reveal the presence of long-range correlations and, at the same time, to
characterize the self-similarity of the series. The rich information derivable
from the characteristic exponents and the multifractal spectrum can be further
analyzed to discover important insights about the underlying dynamical process.
In this paper, we employ multifractal analysis techniques in the study of
protein contact networks. To this end, initially a network is mapped to three
different time series, each of which is generated by a stationary unbiased
random walk. To capture the peculiarities of the networks at different levels,
we accordingly consider three observables at each vertex: the degree, the
clustering coefficient, and the closeness centrality. To compare the results
with suitable references, we consider also instances of three well-known
network models and two typical time series with pure monofractal and
multifractal properties. The first result of notable interest is that time
series associated to proteins contact networks exhibit long-range correlations
(strong persistence), which are consistent with signals in-between the typical
monofractal and multifractal behavior. Successively, a suitable embedding of
the multifractal spectra allows to focus on ensemble properties, which in turn
gives us the possibility to make further observations regarding the considered
networks. In particular, we highlight the different role that small and large
fluctuations of the considered observables play in the characterization of the
network topology.

ground state of self-conjugate nuclei are treated in terms of alpha-like
quartets built by two protons and two neutrons coupled to total isospin T=0 and
total angular momentum J=0. Quartets are constructed dynamically via an
iterative variational procedure and the ground state is represented as a
product of such quartets. It is shown that the quartet formalism describes
accurately the ground state energies of realistic isovector plus isoscalar
pairing Hamiltonians in nuclei with valence particles outside the 16O, 40Ca and
100Sn cores. Within the quartet formalism we analyse the competition between
isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations and find that for nuclei with the
valence nucleons above the cores 40Ca and 100Sn the isovector correlations
account for the largest fraction of the total pairing correlations. This is not
the case for sd-shell nuclei for which isoscalar correlations prevail. Contrary
to many mean-field studies, isovector and isoscalar pairing correlations mix
significantly in the quartet approach.

processes combining non-determinism with quantitative aspects (such as
probabilistic or stochastically timed executions), aiming to provide general
results and tools. This paper provides two contributions in this respect.
First, we present a general GSOS specification format and a corresponding
notion of bisimulation for non-deterministic processes with quantitative
aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to
the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation
associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight
functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called
Weight Function GSOS (WF-GSOS), covers many known systems and their
bisimulations (e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted
GSOS, Segala-GSOS, among others).
  The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras
of a class of functors, parametric on the weight structure. This result allows
us to prove soundness and completeness of the WF-GSOS specification format, and
that bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.

on bunched atomic beams. \item[Results] From measured hyperfine structure
spectra of K isotopes, nuclear spins and magnetic moments of the ground states
were obtained for isotopes from $N = 19$ up to $N = 32$. In order to draw
conclusions about the composition of the wave functions and the occupation of
the levels, the experimental data were compared to shell-model calculations
using SDPF-NR and SDPF-U effective interactions. In addition, a detailed
discussion about the evolution of the gap between proton $1d_{3/2}$ and

\item[Conclusions] The dominant component of the wave function for the odd-$A$
isotopes up to $^{45}$K is a $\pi 1d_{3/2}^{-1}$ hole. For $^{47,49}$K, the
main component originates from a $\pi 2s_{1/2}^{-1}$ hole configuration and it
inverts back to the $\pi 1d_{3/2}^{-1}$ in $^{51}$K. For all even-$A$ isotopes,
the dominant configuration arises from a $\pi 1d_{3/2}^{-1}$ hole coupled to a
neutron in the $\nu 1f_{7/2}$ or $\nu 2p_{3/2}$ orbitals. Only for $^{48}$K, a
significant amount of mixing with $\pi 2s_{1/2}^{-1} \otimes \nu (pf)$ is
observed leading to a $I^{\pi}=1^{-}$ ground state. For $^{50}$K, the
ground-state spin-parity is $0^-$ with leading configuration $\pi 1d_{3/2}^{-1}
\otimes \nu 2p_{3/2}^{-1}$.

the nature of such theorems as statements about virtual continuity. Our results
imply that under conditions of Sobolev theorems there is a well-defined
integration of a function over wide class of singular measures, including the
measures concentrated on submanifolds. The notion of virtual continuity is used
also for the classification of measurable functions of several variables and in
some questions on dynamical systems, theory of polymorphisms and bistochastic

some applications. Revised version (without the proofs) is published in

reside in groups from SDSS-DR7 group catalog. To provide a suitable
quantification of the effects of bars, a reliable control sample of unbarred
active galaxies in high density environments with similar redshift, magnitude,
morphology, and bulge size distributions was constructed. We found that the
fraction of barred AGN galaxies in groups (~ 38 %) is higher than those in the
total barred AGN sample ( ~ 28 %), indicating that AGN spiral galaxies in
groups are more likely to be barred than those in the field. We also found that
barred AGN galaxies are more concentrated towards the group centers than the
other unbarred AGN group members. In addition, barred AGN host galaxies show an
excess of population dominated by red colors suggesting that bars produce an
importanteffect on galaxy colors of AGN hosts. The host groups of the barred
AGN exhibit a larger fraction of red colors than the host groups of the
corresponding unbarred active galaxies. Color-magnitude relations of both host
groups of AGN differ significantly: the host group colors of barred active
galaxies display distributions spreading toward red populations, with respect
to the host groups of the unbarred AGN objects. Barred active galaxies show an
excess of nuclear activity compared to galaxies without bars. We found that
barred active galaxies located farther from the group-center have stronger
Lum[OIII]. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of bars to transport
material towards the more central regions of the AGN galaxies in high density

transformation of multivariate Gaus- sian variables to model the topical
distribution of documents in the presence of correlations among topics. In this
paper, we propose a probit normal alternative approach to modelling correlated
topical structures. Our use of the probit model in the context of topic
discovery is novel, as many authors have so far con- centrated solely of the
logistic model partly due to the formidable inefficiency of the multinomial
probit model even in the case of very small topical spaces. We herein
circumvent the inefficiency of multinomial probit estimation by using an
adaptation of the diagonal orthant multinomial probit in the topic models
context, resulting in the ability of our topic modelling scheme to handle
corpuses with a large number of latent topics. An additional and very important
benefit of our method lies in the fact that unlike with the logistic normal
model whose non-conjugacy leads to the need for sophisticated sampling schemes,
our ap- proach exploits the natural conjugacy inherent in the auxiliary

ergodic multifrequency torus translation. These models are called
quasi-periodic cocycles. We make the following assumptions on the model: the
translation vector satisfies a generic Diophantine condition, and the fiber
action is given by a matrix valued analytic function of several variables which
is not identically singular. The LDT estimates obtained here depend on some
uniform measurements on the cocycle.
  Our general results derived in [9] regarding the continuity properties of the
Lyapunov exponents (LE) and of the Oseledets filtration and decompositions are
then applicable, and we obtain local weak-Holder continuity of these quantities
in the presence of gaps in the Lyapunov spectrum. The main new feature of this
work is allowing a cocycle depending on several variables to have
singularities, i.e. points of non invertibility. This requires a careful
analysis of the set of zeros of certain analytic functions of several variables
and of the singularities (i.e. negative infinity values) of pluri-subharmonic
functions related to the iterates of the cocycle.
  A refinement of this method in the one variable case leads to a stronger LDT
estimate and in turn to a stronger, nearly-Holder modulus of continuity of the
LE, Oseledets filtration and Oseledets decomposition.
  This is a draft of a chapter in our forthcoming research monograph [9].

quantum phase representation which also reveals that entanglement is not
required. We modify Schwinger's harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum
to include the case of photons. Therein the quantum angle measurement is shown
to be equivalent to the measurement of the relative phase between the two
oscillators. Two reasonable ways of dealing with degeneracy are shown to
correspond to: a conditional measurement which takes a snapshot in absolute
time (corresponding to adding probability amplitudes); and a marginal
measurement which takes an average in absolute time (corresponding to adding
probabilities). The sense in which distinguishability is a ""matter of how long
we look"" is discussed and the meaning of the general theory is illustrated by
taking the two oscillators to be circularly polarized photons. It is shown that
an odd number of x-polarized photons will never have an angle in correspondence
with the y-axis; but an even number of x-polarized photons always can! The
behavior of an x-polarized coherent state is examined and the snapshot angular
distributions are seen to evolve into two counter-rotating peaks resulting in
considerable correspondence with the y-axis at the time for which a classical
linear polarization vector would shrink to zero length. We also demonstrate how
the probability distribution of absolute time (herein a measurable quantity,
rather than just a parameter) has an influence on how these snapshot angular
distributions evolve into a quantum version of the polarization ellipse.

designed and analyzed based on a geometric model. Specifically, the UA is
modeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and
free-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser
UA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel
channel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into
Fourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into
peak detection of a derive function of location. The process is shown to
suppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to
interference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance
following the power law, where the exponent is 1/3 and 1 for the circular and
spherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel
estimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data
transmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference
between two users is shown to decay with the increasing user-separation
distance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA,
respectively. Furthermore, a novel multiuser precoding design is proposed by
exciting different phase modes of the UA and controlling the mode weight
factors to null interference. The number of available degrees of freedom for
interference nulling using the UA is proved to be proportional to the minimum
user-separation distance.

transport is perfectly described by this very simple idea: electrons are
emitted by the contacts into the sample which they may cross with a finite
probability. Combined with Fermi statistics, this partition of the electron
flow accounts for the full statistics of electron transport. When it comes to
short time scales, a key question must be clarified: are there correlations
between successive attempts of the electrons to cross the sample? While there
are theoretical predictions and several experimental indications for the
existence of such correlations, no direct experimental evidence has ever been
provided. Here we show a direct experimental proof of how temperature and
voltage bias control the electron flow: while temperature $T$ leads to a jitter
which tends to decorrelate electron transport after a time $\hbar/k_BT$, the
bias voltage $V$ induces strong correlations/anticorrelations which oscillate
with a period $h/eV$. Our experiment reveals how time scales related to voltage

  This result gives a new method to upper bound the quantum query complexity:
we give a method of finding bomb query algorithms from classical algorithms,
which then provide nonconstructive upper bounds on $Q(f)=\Theta(\sqrt{B(f)})$.
We subsequently were able to give explicit quantum algorithms matching our
upper bound method. We apply this method on the single-source shortest paths
problem on unweighted graphs, obtaining an algorithm with $O(n^{1.5})$ quantum
query complexity, improving the best known algorithm of $O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log

synthetic fastwind line profiles to the VLT/X-Shooter spectra using a genetic

evolutionary masses and ages. We also investigate the effective temperature

reassess the wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. The derived parameters of
our target stars indicate stellar masses that reach values of up to 50
$M_{\odot}$. The wind strengths of our stars are, on average, stronger than
predicted from radiation-driven wind theory and reminiscent of stars with an
LMC metallicity. We discuss indications that the iron content of the host
galaxies is higher than originally thought and is instead SMC-like. We find
that the discrepancy with theory is lessened, but remains significant for this

(SPDC) is widely studied for applications in quantum information science due to
its ability to produce two photons that can be entangled in many degrees of
freedom. For applications in quantum communication, two metrics of this process
are particularly important: heralding efficiency and total joint rate. Here, we
derive expressions for both quantities for a variety of different beam
geometries and frequencies. We pay specific attention to the spectrum of both
biphotons and individual photons. We reveal the underlying mechanisms
responsible for the spectral shape and show they differ for different
geometries and frequencies. We then use these spectra to calculate heralding
efficiency and joint count rate and examine how each of these metrics changes
with different geometries, frequencies, and spectral filtering and beam
parameters. Interestingly, we find very high heralding efficiencies are
achievable for collinear geometries, while noncollinear geometries require
spectral filtering for high heralding efficiency, ultimately limiting the joint
count rate. We also find that the the spectrum is narrower in nondegenerate
cases, leading to lower joint count rates and higher heralding efficiency in
the noncollinear case. In addition to the theory, we verify selected
predictions with experimental results.

regarding their interpretation. Classical conditioned averages of noisy signals
only show such anomalies if the quantity being measured is also disturbed prior

question whether anomalous weak values are merely classical disturbance
effects. Here we carefully review the role of the weak value as both a

maximal information about the system within the theory. Here, we show that no
non-trivial (not local realistic) extremal states (boxes) of general
no-signaling theories can be realized within quantum theory. We then explore
three interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are
uncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against
the most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure
key generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the
interesting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local
correlations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new
information-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum
correlations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on
arbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the
possibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling
correlations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also
forms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum
winning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique
non-signaling winning strategy. We illustrate each of these consequences with
the example of generalized Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.

contribute to the building performance. On account of this reason, it is
important to estimate and compare alternative solutions, when it is still

  The authors have been developing a prototype tool to assist architects during
this initial design phase. It is made up of two algorithms. The first algorithm
generates alternative floor plans according to the architect's preferences and
requirements, and the client's design program. It consists in one evolutionary
strategy approach enhanced with local search technique to allocate rooms on
several levels in the two-dimensional space. The second algorithm evaluates,
ranks, and optimizes those floor plans according to thermal performance
criteria. The prototype tool is coupled with dynamic simulation program, which
estimates the thermal behavior of each solution. A sequential variable
optimization is used to change several geometric values of different
architectural elements in the floor plans to explore the improvement potential.
  In the present communication, the two algorithms are used in an iterative
process to generate and optimize the thermal performance of alternative floor
plans. In the building simulation specifications of EnergyPlus program, the

In an evolving background, they can experience strong, spurious perturbations
and then follow unphysical orbits. We study by means of numerical simulations
the dynamical evolution of a pair MBHs in the rapidly and violently evolving
gaseous and stellar background that follows a galaxy major merger. We confirm
that spurious numerical effects alter the MBH orbits in AMR simulations, and
show that numerical issues are ultimately due to a drop in the spatial
resolution during the simulation, drastically reducing the accuracy in the
gravitational force computation. We therefore propose a new refinement
criterion suited for massive particles, able to solve in a fast and precise way
for their orbits in highly dynamical backgrounds. The new refinement criterion
we designed enforces the region around each massive particle to remain at the
maximum resolution allowed, independently upon the local gas density. Such
maximally-resolved regions then follow the MBHs along their orbits, and
effectively avoids all spurious effects caused by resolution changes. Our suite
of high resolution, adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic simulations,
including different prescriptions for the sub-grid gas physics, shows that the
new refinement implementation has the advantage of not altering the physical
evolution of the MBHs, accounting for all the non trivial physical processes
taking place in violent dynamical scenarios, such as the final stages of a

Here we show, analytically, that this result is exact in first order

theory and an angular series of the inelasticity's angular power around the
symmetry axis of the collision $(\theta = 0,\pi)$. To establish these results,
firstly, we show that at null infinity the angular dependence factorises order
by order in perturbation theory, as a result of a hidden symmetry. Secondly, we
show that a consistent truncation of the angular series in powers of $\sin^2
\theta$ at some order $O(n)$ requires knowledge of the metric perturbations up
to $O(n+1)$. In particular, this justifies the isotropy assumption used in
first order perturbation theory. We then compute, analytically, all terms that
contribute to the inelasticity and depend linearly on the initial conditions

lensing by the cluster MACS J0717+3745 results in a spatial resolution of
~200-300 pc, enabling good spatial sampling despite the intrinsically small
galaxy sizes. The galaxies in this system are separated by 50-200 kpc in
projection and are likely in an early stage of interaction, evidenced by
relatively high specific star formation rates. Their gas-phase metallicities
are consistent with larger samples at similar redshift, star formation rate,
and stellar mass. We obtain a precise measurement of the metallicity gradient
for one galaxy and find a shallow slope compared to isolated galaxies at high
redshift, consistent with a flattening of the gradient due to gravitational
interaction. An alternative explanation for the shallow metallicity gradient
and elevated star formation rate is rapid recycling of metal-enriched gas, but
we find no evidence for enhanced gas-phase metallicities which should result
from this effect. Notably, the measured stellar masses log(M/Msun) = 7.2-9.1
probe to an order of magnitude below previous mass-metallicity studies at this

Fornax at this redshift, indicating that GLASS is able to directly study the

In this paper, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we
observe a universal behavior in the hole concentration and magnetic moment
across different families. All the parent materials have the same total number
of electrons in the Fe 3d bands; however, the local Fe magnetic moment varies
due to different orbital occupancy. Although the common understanding has been
that both long-range and local magnetic moments decrease with doping, we find
that, near the onset of superconductivity, the local magnetic moment increases
and shows a dome-like maximum near optimal doping, where no ordered magnetic
moment is present. In addition, we address a longstanding debate concerning how
Co substitutions induces superconductivity in the 122 arsenide family, showing
that the 3d band filling increases a function of doping. These new microscopic
insights into the properties of FBS demonstrate the importance of spin
fluctuations for the superconducting state, reveal changes in orbital occupancy
among different families of FBS, and confirm charge doping as one of the
mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in 122 arsenides.

important also for long-distance transmission of quantum information. We
develop a formalism to constrain the ground-state form of SPT phases protected

states of SPT phases protected by various finite groups for similar gate
protections. We construct a particular Hamiltonian invariant under $A_4$
symmetry transformation which is one of the groups that allows protected
identity operation and examine its ground states. We find that there is an
extended region where the ground state is the AKLT state, which not only
supports the identity gate but also arbitrary single-qubit gates.

and Obukhov in 1950, it is predicted that the rate of separation of pairs of
fluid elements in turbulent flows with initial separation at inertial scales,
grows ballistically first (Batchelor regime), before undergoing a transition
towards a super-diffusive regime where the mean-square separation grows as t^3
(Richardson regime). Richardson empirically interpreted this super-diffusive
regime in terms of a non-Fickian process with a scale dependent diffusion
coefficient (the celebrated Richardson's ""4/3rd"" law). However, the actual
physical mechanism at the origin of such a scale dependent diffusion
coefficient remains unclear. The present article proposes a simple physical
phenomenology for the time evolution of the mean square relative separation in
turbulent flows, based on a scale dependent ballistic scenario rather than a
scale dependent diffusive. This phenomenology accurately retrieves most of the
known features of relative dispersion ; among others : (i) it is quantitatively
consistent with recent numerical simulations and experiments (both for the
short term Batchelor regime and the long term Richardson regime, and for all
initial separations at inertial scales), (ii) it gives a simple physical
explanation of the origin of the super diffusive t^3 Richardson regime which
naturally builts itself as an iterative process of elementary
short-term-scale-dependent ballistic steps, (iii) it shows that the Richardson
constant is directly related to the Kolmogorov constant (and eventually to a
ballistic persistence parameter) and (iv) in a further extension of the
phenomenology, taking into account third order corrections, it robustly
describes the temporal asymmetry between forward and backward dispersion, with
an explicit connection to the cascade of energy flux across scales.

Tomography (DOT) data can be described mathematically as an ill-posed inverse
problem. Recent work has shown that the use of hyperspectral DOT data, as
opposed to data sets comprising of a single or, at most, a dozen wavelengths,
has the potential for improving the quality of the reconstructions. The use of
hyperspectral diffuse optical data in the formulation and solution of the
inverse problem poses a significant computational burden. The forward operator
is, in actuality, nonlinear. However, under certain assumptions, a linear
approximation, called the Born approximation, provides a suitable surrogate for
the forward operator, and we assume this to be true in the present work.
Computation of the Born matrix requires the solution of thousands of large
scale discrete PDEs and the reconstruction problem, requires matrix-vector
products with the (dense) Born matrix. In this paper, we address both of these
difficulties, thus making the Born approach a computational viable approach for
hyDOT reconstruction. In this paper, we assume that the images we wish to
reconstruct are anomalies of unknown shape and constant value, described using
a parametric level set approach, (PaLS) on a constant background. Specifically,
to address the issue of the PDE solves, we develop a novel recycling-based
Krylov subspace approach that leverages certain system similarities across
wavelengths. To address expense of using the Born operator in the inversion, we
present a fast algorithm for compressing the Born operator that locally
compresses across wavelengths for a given source-detector set and then
recursively combines the low-rank factors to provide a global low-rank
approximation. This low-rank approximation can be used implicitly to speed up
the recovery of the shape parameters and the chromophore concentrations.

including the gapped FF, gapless FF, gapless topological FF and gapped

density (tensor) of the system becomes anisotropic. When an in-plane Zeeman
field is applied along the \textit{x}-direction, the tensor component along the
\textit{y}-direction $n_{s,yy}$ is generally larger than $n_{s,xx}$ in most
parameter space. At zero temperature, there is always a discontinuity jump in
$n_{s,xx}$ as the system evolves from a gapped FF into a gapless FF state. With
increasing temperature, such a jump is gradually washed out. The critical BKT
temperature has been calculated as functions of the spin-orbit coupling
strength, interatomic interaction strength, in-plane and out-of-plane Zeeman
fields. We predict that the novel FF superfluid phases have a significant
critical BKT temperature, typically at the order of $0.1T_{F}$, where $T_{F}$
is the Fermi degenerate temperature. Therefore, their observation is within the
reach of current experimental techniques in cold-atom laboratories.

the recent decade. The fact that many signals, though high dimensional, are
intrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility to recover them stably
from a relatively small number of their measurements. For example, in
compressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix
completion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a
logarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.
  Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the
cosparse analysis prior. In the noiseless case, it is possible to recover
signals from this model, using a combinatorial search, from a number of
measurements proportional to the signal's manifold dimension. However, if we
ask for stability to noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all
the existing results demand a number of measurements which is far removed from
the manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask
whether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if there
exists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by relying only on
their manifold dimension. Is there an algorithm which, in the presence of
noise, can accurately recover a cosparse signal from a number of measurements
proportional to the manifold dimension? In this work, we prove that there is no
such algorithm. Further, we show through numerical simulations that even in the
noiseless case convex relaxations fail when the number of measurements is
comparable to the manifold dimension. This gives a practical counter-example to
the growing literature on compressed acquisition of signals based on manifold

external bath coupling and their statistical mechanics is challenging; the
answers are important for preparations and control of those Floquet states.
Here, we propose a scheme to classify the statistical distribution of Floquet
states for time-periodic systems which couple to an external heat bath. If an
effective Hamiltonian and a system-bath coupling operator, which are all
time-independent, can be simultaneously obtained via a time-periodic unitary
transformation, the statistical mechanics of the Floquet states is equivalent
to the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the effective Hamiltonian. In the
large driving frequency cases, we also show that the conditions of this theorem
can be weakened to: the time-period part in the system Hamiltonian commutes
with the system-bath coupling operator. A Floquet-Markov approach is applied to
numerically compute the Floquet state occupation distribution of a bosonic
chain, and the results agree with the theoretical predictions.

establishes the connection between our financial system and existing general
semimartingale based discussions by justifying required conditions. More
precisely, there are three steps involved. First, we firmly prove the
no-arbitrage condition to be true for our financial market, which is used as an
assumption in existing discussions. In doing so, we explicitly construct the
square-integrable density process of the variance-optimal martingale measure
(VOMM). Second, we derive a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)
with jumps for the mean-value process of a given contingent claim. The unique
existence of adapted strong solution to the BSDE is proved under suitable
terminal conditions including both European call and put options as special
cases. Third, by combining the solution of the BSDE and the VOMM, we reach the
justification of the global risk optimality for our hedging strategy.

few-layer phosphorene MOSFET with Al2O3 surface passivation and Ti/Au top gate.
As fabricated, the phosphorene MOSFET was stable in atmosphere for at least 100
h. With annealing at 200{\deg}C in dry nitrogen for 1 h, its drain current
increased by an order of magnitude to approximately 100 mA/mm, which could be
attributed to the reduction of trapped charge in Al2O3 and/or Schottky barrier
at the source and drain contacts. Thereafter, the drain current was stable
between -50{\deg}C and 150{\deg}C up to at least 1000 h. These promising
results suggest that environmental protection of phosphorene should not be a
major concern, and passivation of phosphorene should focus on its effect on
electronic control and transport as in conventional silicon MOSFETs. With
cutoff frequencies approaching the gigahertz range, the present phosphorene
MOSFET, although far from being optimized, can meet the frequency and stability
requirements of most flexible electronics for which phosphorene is
intrinsically advantageous due to its corrugated lattice structure.

label complexity of active learning with general hypothesis classes, under
various noise models. The results reveal a number of surprising facts. In
particular, under the noise model of Tsybakov (2004), the minimax label
complexity of active learning with a VC class is always asymptotically smaller
than that of passive learning, and is typically significantly smaller than the
best previously-published upper bounds in the active learning literature. In
high-noise regimes, it turns out that all active learning problems of a given
VC dimension have roughly the same minimax label complexity, which contrasts
with well-known results for bounded noise. In low-noise regimes, we find that
the label complexity is well-characterized by a simple combinatorial complexity
measure we call the star number. Interestingly, we find that almost all of the
complexity measures previously explored in the active learning literature have
worst-case values exactly equal to the star number. We also propose new active
learning strategies that nearly achieve these minimax label complexities.

slow-light periodically layered ambient medium exhibits phenomena markedly
different from typical scattering problems. In a slow-light periodic medium,
constructed by Figotin and Vitebskiy, the energy velocity of a propagating mode
in one direction slows to zero, creating a ""frozen mode"" at a single frequency
within a pass band, where the dispersion relation possesses a flat inflection
point. The slow-light regime is characterized by a $3\!\times\!3$ Jordan block
of the log of the $4\!\times\!4$ monodromy matrix for EM fields in a periodic
medium at special frequency and parallel wavevector. The scattering problem
breaks down as the 2D rightward and leftward mode spaces intersect in the
frozen mode and therefore span only a 3D subspace $\mathring{V}$ of the 4D
space of EM fields.
  Analysis of pathological scattering near the slow-light frequency and
wavevector is based on the interaction between the flux-unitary transfer matrix
$T$ across the defect layer and the projections to the rightward and leftward

generic, non-resonant case when $T$ does not map $\mathring{V}$ to itself and
the quadratically growing mode is excited; and the resonant case, when
$\mathring{V}$ is invariant under $T$ and a guided frozen mode is resonantly

""coarse"" space in the multigrid algorithm, where the discrete problem in the
auxiliary space can be easily solved by an existing solver. In this
construction, the authors conveniently use the $H^1$ conforming piecewise
linear finite element space as an auxiliary space. The main technical
difficulty is to build the connection between the weak Galerkin discrete space
and the $H^1$ conforming piecewise linear finite element space. The authors
successfully constructed such an auxiliary space multigrid preconditioner for
the weak Galerkin method, as well as a reduced system of the weak Galerkin
method involving only the degrees of freedom on edges/faces. The preconditioned
systems are proved to have condition numbers independent of the mesh size.
Numerical experiments are conducted to support the theoretical results.

connection to the topological properties of the ambient manifold, a class of

([BoDeO11] and [BoDeO13]). In this article we give a description of the local
structure of closed symmetric 2-differentials on complex surfaces, with an
emphasis towards the local decompositions as products of 1-differentials. We
show that a closed symmetric 2-differential $w$ of rank 2 (i.e. defines two
distinct foliations at the general point) has a subvariety $B_w\subset X$
outside of which $w$ is locally the product of closed holomorphic
1-differentials. The main result, theorem 2.6, gives a complete description of
a (locally split) closed symmetric 2-differential in a neighborhood of a
general point of $B_w$. A key feature of theorem 2.6 is that closed symmetric
2-differentials still have a decomposition as a product of 2 closed
1-differentials (in a generalized sense) even at the points of $B_w$. The
(possibly multi-valued) closed 1-differentials can have essential singularities
along $B_w$, but one still has a control on these essential singularities. The
essential singularities come from exponentials of meromorphic functions
acquiring poles along the irreducible components of $B_w$ of order bounded by
the order of contact of the 2 foliations defined by the symmetric
2-differential along that irreducible component.

Informally, given a graph $G$ of treewidth
$k$, a treewidth sparsifier $H$ is a minor of $G$, whose treewidth is close to
$k$, $|V(H)|$ is small, and the maximum vertex degree in $H$ is bounded.
Treewidth sparsifiers of degree $3$ are of particular interest, as routing on
node-disjoint paths, and computing minors seems easier in sub-cubic graphs than
in general graphs.
  In this paper we describe an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ of treewidth
$k$, computes a topological minor $H$ of $G$ such that (i) the treewidth of $H$
is $\Omega(k/\text{polylog}(k))$; (ii) $|V(H)| = O(k^4)$; and (iii) the maximum
vertex degree in $H$ is $3$. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in
$|V(G)|$ and $k$. Our result is in contrast to the known fact that unless $NP
\subseteq coNP/{\sf poly}$, treewidth does not admit polynomial-size kernels.
One of our key technical tools, which is of independent interest, is a
construction of a small minor that preserves node-disjoint routability between
two pairs of vertex subsets. This is closely related to the open question of
computing small good-quality vertex-cut sparsifiers that are also minors of the
original graph.

onto a viscous liquid pool. Then, a fingering instability occurs around the
crater's rim, depending on the experimental conditions such as projectile's
inertia and the viscosity of the target liquid. When the impact inertia is not
sufficient, any fingering structure cannot be observed. Contrastively, if the
impact inertia is too much, the random splashing is induced and the counting of
fingers becomes difficult. The clear fingering instability is observable in
between these two regimes. The number of fingers $N$ is counted by using
high-speed video data. The scaling of $N$ is discussed on the basis of
dimensionless numbers. By assuming Rayleigh-Taylor instability, scaling laws
for $N$ can be derived using Reynolds number $Re$, Weber number $We$, and
Froude number $Fr$. Particularly, the scaling $N=(\rho_r
Fr)^{1/4}We^{1/2}/3^{3/4}$ is obtained for the gravity-dominant cratering
regime, where $\rho_r$ is the density ratio between a projectile and a target.
Although the experimental data considerably scatters, the scaling law is
consistent with the global trend of the data behavior. Using one of the scaling
laws, planetary nano crater's rim structure is also evaluated.

large anisotropy in electrical conductivity and thermopower, which is due to
the difference in the effective masses along the in-plane and out of plane

dispersion of bands lead to three-fold enhancement in thermopower for both p-

length of the shortest polymer that can hold such knot. The only other
parameter depending on the knot kind is an amplitude such that relative
probabilities of knots do not vary with the temperature $T$, in the limit of
long chains. We arrive at this conclusion by simulating interacting
self-avoiding rings at low $T$ on the cubic lattice, both with unrestricted
topology and with setups where the globule is divided by a slip link in two
loops (preserving their topology) which compete for the chain length, either in
contact or separated by a wall as for translocation through a membrane pore.
These findings suggest that in macromolecular environments there may be
entropic forces with a purely topological origin, whence portions of polymers

Data are from the Owens Valley and CARMA millimeter interferometers. Species
detected at ~<4"" resolution include C^18O, HCN, HCO+, HNC, CN, CH_3OH and,
tentatively, HNCO. Along with existing CO, ^13CO and radio continuum data,
these lines constrain the chemical properties of the inner disk. Dense
molecular gas in the nucleus fuels a star formation rate ~>10 M_sun/yr and is
traced by lines of HCN, HCO+, HNC, and CN. A correlation between HCN and star
formation rate is observed on sub-kpc scales, consistent with global relations.
Toward the nucleus, CN abundances are similar to those of HCN, indicating
emission comes from a collection (~40-50) of moderate visual extinction,
photon-dominated region clouds. The CO isotopic line ratios are unusual:
CO(1-0)/^13CO(1-0) and CO(1-0)/C^18O(1-0) line ratios are large toward the
starburst, as is commonly observed in LIRGs, but farther out in the disk these
ratios are remarkably low (~<3). ^13CO/C^18O abundance ratios are lower than in
Galactic clouds, possibly because the C^18O is enriched by massive star ejecta
from the starburst. ^13CO is underabundant relative to CO. Extended emission
from CH_3OH indicates that dynamical shocks pervade both the nucleus and the
inner disk. The unusual CO isotopologue ratios, the CO/HCN intensity ratio
versus L_IR, the HCN/CN abundance ratio and the gas consumption time versus
inflow rate, all indicate that the starburst in IRAS 04296+2923 is in an early

higher learning rates. We also make a second, independent, hypothesis: synapses
communicate their uncertainty by linking it to variability in PSP size, with
more uncertainty leading to more variability. These two hypotheses cast
synaptic plasticity as a problem of Bayesian inference, and thus provide a

zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) property. However, traditional ZCZ sequences (which
assume the availability of the entire spectral band) cannot be used because
their orthogonality will be destroyed by the spectrum hole constraint in a CR

Taking advantage of the Kronecker sequence property, a novel family of
sequences (called ""quasi-ZCZ"" CR sequences) which displays zero

the case of hyper scaling violating we show that the coupling between dilaton

We find that the observed flux-ratio anomaly can be explained by a presence of
either a minifilament or a minivoid in the line-of-sight with a surface mass
density of the order of 10^(8-9) h^(-1) solar mass /arcsec^2 without taking
into account any subhalos in the lensing galaxy. The astrometric perturbation
by a possible minifilament/minivoid is <~ 0.001 arcsec and the amplitudes of
convergence perturbations due to these perturbers are ~ 0.004-0.008 at the
place of an image that shows anomaly. In order to discriminate models with the
line-of-sight ministructures from those with a subhalo(s) in the lensing
galaxy, we need to precisely measure the projected convergence and shear around
the lensing galaxy. The differential magnification effect could break the model
degeneracy if the source size is > ~100 pc. Observation at the submillimeter
band using interferometers will enable us to determine the origin of anomalies

re-identification, is a challenging problem due to the change in visual
appearance caused by varying lighting conditions. The perceived color of the

use color as it is or address these challenges by designing color spaces
focusing on a specific cue. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach
for learning color patterns from pixels sampled from images across two camera
views. The intuition behind this work is that, even though pixel values of same
color would be different across views, they should be encoded with the same
values. We model color feature generation as a learning problem by jointly
learning a linear transformation and a dictionary to encode pixel values. We
also analyze different photometric invariant color spaces. Using color as the
only cue, we compare our approach with all the photometric invariant color
spaces and show superior performance over all of them. Combining with other
learned low-level and high-level features, we obtain promising results in

with the assistance of abundant manually labeled images. Facial feature point
detection favors many applications such as face recognition, animation,
tracking, hallucination, expression analysis and 3D face modeling. Existing
methods can be categorized into the following four groups: constrained local
model (CLM)-based, active appearance model (AAM)-based, regression-based, and
other methods. CLM-based methods consist of a shape model and a number of local
experts, each of which is utilized to detect a facial feature point. AAM-based
methods fit a shape model to an image by minimizing texture synthesis errors.
Regression-based methods directly learn a mapping function from facial image
appearance to facial feature points. Besides the above three major categories
of methods, there are also minor categories of methods which we classify into
other methods: graphical model-based methods, joint face alignment methods,
independent facial feature point detectors, and deep learning-based methods.
Though significant progress has been made, facial feature point detection is
limited in its success by wild and real-world conditions: variations across
poses, expressions, illuminations, and occlusions. A comparative illustration
and analysis of representative methods provide us a holistic understanding and
deep insight into facial feature point detection, which also motivates us to
explore promising future directions.

systems. Furthermore, it follows that separability by PTL is decidable if and
only if one can compute for any language of the class its downward closure wrt.

  The obtained decidability results contrast some undecidability results. In
fact, for all (non-regular) language classes that we present as examples with
decidable separability, it is undecidable whether a given language is a PTL

  Our characterization involves a result of independent interest, which states

density-temperature plane, allowing for four competing phases of nuclear
matter: (i) the unpaired phase, (ii) the translationally and rotationally
symmetric, but isospin-asymmetrical BCS condensate, (iii) the current-carrying
Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell phase, and (iv) the heterogeneous
phase-separated phase. The phase diagram of nuclear matter composed of these
phases features two tri-critical points in general, as well as crossovers from
the asymmetrical BCS phase to a BEC of deuterons plus a neutron gas, both for
the homogeneous superfluid phase (at high temperatures) and for the
heterogeneous phase (at low temperatures). The BCS-BEC type crossover in the
condensate occurs as the density is reduced. We analyze in detail some
intrinsic properties of these phases, including the Cooper-pair wave function,
the coherence length, the occupation numbers of majority and minority nucleonic
components, and the dispersion relations of quasiparticle excitations about the
ground state. We show by explicit examples that the physics of the individual
phases and the transition from weak to strong coupling can be well understood
by tracing the behavior of these quantities.

a quantum machine learning algorithm on a four-qubit NMR test bench to solve an

recognize handwritten characters from a set with two candidates. To our best

its tremendous consuming of computational resources, quantum speedup would be

applications in the fields of quantum optics, photovoltaics, photodetection,

have been developed to tailor the interaction between an emitter and its
environment, active control of the energy flow has remained challenging. Here,
we demonstrate in-situ electrical control of the relaxation pathways of excited
erbium ions, which emit light at the technologically relevant telecommunication
wavelength of 1.5 $\mu$m. By placing the erbium at a few nanometres distance
from graphene, we modify the relaxation rate by more than a factor of three,
and control whether the emitter decays into either electron-hole pairs, emitted
photons or graphene near-infrared plasmons, confined to $<$15 nm to the sheet.
These capabilities to dictate optical energy transfer processes through
electrical control of the local density of optical states constitute a new
paradigm for active (quantum) photonics.

first passage times (MFPT) in the presence of a mobile trap. The question we
address is whether a mobile trap can improve capture times over a stationary
trap. We consider two scenarios: a randomly moving trap and an oscillating
trap. In both cases, we find that a stationary trap actually performs better
(in terms of reducing expected capture time) than a very slowly moving trap;
however, a trap moving sufficiently fast performs better than a stationary
trap. We explicitly compute the thresholds that separate the two regimes. In
addition, we find a surprising relation between the oscillating trap problem
and a moving-sink problem that describes reduced dynamics of a single spike in
a certain regime of the Gray-Scott model. Namely, the above-mentioned threshold
corresponds precisely to a Hopf bifurcation that induces oscillatory motion in
the location of the spike. We use this correspondence to prove the uniqueness
of the Hopf bifurcation.

addition of radially symmetric, linear confining potentials, some specific
bound-state energies surprisingly retain their exact Dirac--Coulomb values (in
the sense of an ""exact symmetry""). This observation raises pertinent questions
as to the generality of the cancellation mechanism. A Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation is used to find the relevant nonrelativistic physical degrees of
freedom, which include additional spin-orbit couplings induced by the linear
confining potentials. The matrix elements of the effective operators obtained
from the scalar, and time-like confining potentials mutually cancel for
specific ratios of the prefactors of the effective operators, which must be
tailored to the cancellation mechanism. The result of the Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformation is used to explicitly show that the cancellation is accidental
and restricted (for a given Hamiltonian) to only one reference state, rather
than traceable to a more general relationship among the obtained effective
low-energy operators. Furthermore, we show that the cancellation mechanism does
not affect anti-particle (negative-energy) states.

  Chemora is a framework for solving systems of Partial Differential Equations

sees prominent usage in the computational relativistic astrophysics community.
In Chemora, PDEs are expressed either in a high-level \LaTeX-like language or
in Mathematica. Discretisation stencils are defined separately from equations,
and can include Finite Differences, Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Elements
(DGFE), Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), and multi-block systems.

structures of probability spaces and that of the discrete spectrum for Hawking

standard formalism of quantum mechanics, while the discrete spectrum of Hawking
radiation contributes to the semiclassical unitary evolution of Hawking
radiation. If more realistic models of Hawking radiation are chosen, the
information-geometric structures of the probability space for Hawking radiation
can be constructed from some physical considerations. The constructed quantum
formalism is consistent with both the unitary evolution of Hawking radiation in
the semiclassical picture and the topology change of fuzzy horizons. These
aspects of Hawking radiation can be connected to some general convictions of
quantum gravity. A comparison with the fuzzball proposal shows the limiation
and effectiveness of this construction. We conclude that these
information-geometric aspects show some possible ways bridging the gap between
semiclassical models and quantum gravity.

engineering of PV systems requires modeling and evaluating shading losses. Some
PV systems are affected by complex shading scenes whose resulting PV energy
losses are very difficult to evaluate with current modeling tools. Several
specialized PV design and simulation software include the possibility to
evaluate shading losses. They generally possess a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) through which the user can draw a 3D shading scene, and then evaluate its
corresponding PV energy losses. The complexity of the objects that these tools
can handle is relatively limited. We have created a software solution, 3DPV,
which allows evaluating the energy losses induced by complex 3D scenes on PV
generators. The 3D objects can be imported from specialized 3D modeling
software or from a 3D object library. The shadows cast by this 3D scene on the
PV generator are then directly evaluated from the Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU). Thanks to the recent development of GPUs for the video game industry,
the shadows can be evaluated with a very high spatial resolution that reaches
well beyond the PV cell level, in very short calculation times. A PV simulation
model then translates the geometrical shading into PV energy output losses.
3DPV has been implemented using WebGL, which allows it to run directly from a
Web browser, without requiring any local installation from the user. This also
allows taken full benefits from the information already available from
Internet, such as the 3D object libraries. This contribution describes, step by
step, the method that allows 3DPV to evaluate the PV energy losses caused by
complex shading. We then illustrate the results of this methodology to several
application cases that are encountered in the world of PV systems design.
