molecular chemistry in the presence and surroundings of an active galactic
nucleus. Exploring the distribution of different molecular species allows us to
understand the physical processes affecting the ISM both in the AGN vicinity as
well as in the outer star forming molecular ring. We carried out 3 mm ALMA
observations of HCN, HCO+, CCH, CS, HNCO, SiO, HC3N, and SO as well as the 13C
isotopologues. All species were imaged over the central 2 kpc (~30"") of the
galaxy at a resolution of ~2.2""x1.5 (150 pc x 100 pc). HCO+ and CS appear to be
slightly enhanced in the star forming ring. CCH, showing the largest variations
across NGC 1097, is suggested to be a good tracer of both obscured and early
stage star formation. HNCO, SiO and HC3N are significantly enhanced in the
inner circumnuclear disk surrounding the AGN. Differences in the molecular
abundances are observed between the star forming ring and the inner
circumnuclear disk. We conclude that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS differences
observed between AGN dominated and starburst galaxies are not due to a HCN
enhancement due to X-rays, but rather this enhancement is produced by shocked
material at distances of 200 pc from the AGN. Additionally we claim the lower
HCN/CS to be a combination of a small under-abundance of CS in AGNs together
with excitation effects, where a high dense gas component (~10^6 cm^-3) may be
more prominent in SB galaxies. However the most promising are the differences
found among the dense gas tracers which, at our modest spatial resolution, seem
to outline the physical structure of the molecular disk around the AGN. In this
picture, HNCO probes the well shielded gas in the disk, surrounding the dense
material moderately exposed to X-ray radiation traced by HC3N. Finally SiO
might be the innermost molecule in the disk structure.

independent of density, and the minimum shear viscosity is achieved at
unitarity. At the next order medium effects modify the scattering amplitude as

shift the minimum of the shear viscosity to the Bose-Einstein condensation

monoclinic insulating state, bond-length disproportionation splits the manifold
of $e_g$ bands, corresponding to a modulation of the effective on-site energy.
We show that, when subject to a local Coulomb repulsion $U$ and Hund's coupling
$J$, the resulting bond-disproportionated state is a paramagnetic insulator for
a wide range of interaction parameters. Furthermore, we find that when $U-3J$
is small or negative, a spontaneous instability to bond disproportionation
takes place for large enough $J$. This minimal theory emphasizes that a small
or negative charge-transfer energy, a large Hund's coupling, and a strong
coupling to bond-disproportionation are the key factors underlying the
transition. Experimental consequences of this theoretical picture are
discussed.

Its ability to deal with high-dimensional data makes this algorithm especially
useful for studies in neuroimaging and bioinformatics. Despite its popularity
and wide use, feature selection in Random Forest still lacks a crucial
ingredient: false positive rate control. To date there is no efficient,
principled and computationally light-weight solution to this shortcoming. As a
result, researchers using Random Forest for feature selection have to resort to
using heuristically set thresholds on feature rankings. This article builds an
approximate probabilistic model for the feature selection process in random
forest training, which allows us to compute an estimated false positive rate
for a given threshold on selection frequency. Hence, it presents a principled
way to determine thresholds for the selection of relevant features without any
additional computational load. Experimental analysis with synthetic data
demonstrates that the proposed approach can limit false positive rates on the
order of the desired values and keep false negative rates low. Results show
that this holds even in the presence of a complex correlation structure between
features. Its good statistical properties and light-weight computational needs
make this approach widely applicable to feature selection for a wide-range of
applications.

distributed numbers of events in a treatment and control group and requires the
proportion of deaths to be extracted from published papers. This data is often
not available in the publications due to loss to follow-up. When the Kaplan
Meier survival plot is available, it is common practice to manually measure the
needed information from the plot and infer the probability of survival and then
to infer a best-guess of the number of deaths. Uncertainty introduced from
theses guesses is not accounted for in current models. This naive approach
leads to over-certain results and potentially inaccurate conclusions. We
propose the Uncertain Reading-Estimated Events model to construct each study's
contribution to the meta-analysis separately using the data available for
extraction in the publications. We use real and simulated data to illustrate
our methods. Meta-analysis based on the observed number of deaths lead to
biased estimates while our proposed model does not. Our results show increases
in the standard deviation of the log-odds as compared to a naive meta-analysis
that assumes ideal extracted data, equivalent to a reduction of the overall
sample size of 43% in our example.

databases. We compare N2 and the metallicity determined using the direct method
for the set of extremely metal-poor galaxies compiled by Morales-Luis et al.

constant with N2, with a very large scatter. Consequently, we find that the

true metallicity in low-metallicity galaxies. An explicit expression for this

photoionization models. It is mostly due to the different evolutionary state of
the HII regions producing the emission lines, but it also arises due to

substrate on whose surface a plasmon mode is activated conjoining a single or
pair of thin sheets of either monolayer graphene, silicene or a two-dimensional
electron gas as would occur at a hetero-interface. When an electric current is
passed through either a layer or within the substrate, the low-frequency
plasmons in the layer may bifurcate into separate streams due to the driving
current. At a critical wave vector, determined by the separation between layers
(if there are two) and their distance from the surface, their phase velocities
may be in opposite directions and a surface plasmon instability leads to the
emission of radiation (spiler). Spiler takes advantage of the flexibility of
choosing its constituents to produce sources of radiation. The role of the
substrate is to screen the Coulomb interaction between two layers or between a
layer and the surface. The range of wave vectors where the instability is
achieved may be adjusted by varying layer separation and type of material.
Applications to detectors and other electromagnetic devices exploiting
nano-plasmonics are discussed.

that the side information of both the channel states and the energy harvesting
states is known for $K$ time slots {\em a priori}, and the battery capacity and
the maximum transmission power in each time slot are bounded. The objective is
to maximize the weighted sum-rate of all transmitters over the $K$ time slots
by assigning the transmission power and bandwidth for each transmitter in each

alternatively solves two subproblems in each iteration. The convergence and the

to maximize the total throughput. We develop efficient algorithms for solving

to obtain information-theoretically secure key agreement, commitment and
oblivious transfer protocols, among others. Oblivious transfer (OT) is a
fundamental primitive since it is complete for secure multi-party computation,
and the OT capacity characterizes how efficiently a channel can be used for
obtaining string oblivious transfer. Ahlswede and Csisz\'{a}r (\emph{ISIT'07})
presented upper and lower bounds on the OT capacity of generalized erasure
channels (GEC) against passive adversaries. In the case of GEC with erasure
probability at least 1/2, the upper and lower bounds match and therefore the OT
capacity was determined. It was later proved by Pinto et al. (\emph{IEEE Trans.
Inf. Theory 57(8)}) that in this case there is also a protocol against
malicious adversaries achieving the same lower bound, and hence the OT capacity
is identical for passive and malicious adversaries. In the case of GEC with
erasure probability smaller than 1/2, the known lower bound against passive
adversaries that was established by Ahlswede and Csisz\'{a}r does not match
their upper bound and it was unknown whether this OT rate could be achieved
against malicious adversaries as well. In this work we show that there is a
protocol against malicious adversaries achieving the same OT rate that was
obtained against passive adversaries.

  Part II: Multiple Broadcast Channels & Proportional Fairness",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the energy-bandwidth allocation for a network with
multiple broadcast channels, where the transmitters access the network
orthogonally on the assigned frequency band and each transmitter communicates
with multiple receivers orthogonally or non-orthogonally. We assume that the
energy harvesting state and channel gain of each transmitter can be predicted
for $K$ slots {\em a priori}. To maximize the weighted throughput, we formulate
an optimization problem with $O(MK)$ constraints, where $M$ is the number of
the receivers, and decompose it into the energy and bandwidth allocation
subproblems. In order to use the iterative algorithm proposed in [1] to solve
the problem, we propose efficient algorithms to solve the two subproblems, so
that the optimal energy-bandwidth allocation can be obtained with an overall
complexity of ${\cal O}(MK^2)$, even though the problem is non-convex when the
broadcast channel is non-orthogonal. For the orthogonal broadcast channel, we
further formulate a proportionally-fair (PF) throughput maximization problem
and derive the equivalence conditions such that the optimal solution can be
obtained by solving a weighted throughput maximization problem. Further, the
algorithm to obtain the proper weights is proposed. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm can make efficient use of the harvested energy and
the available bandwidth, and achieve significantly better performance than some
heuristic policies for energy and bandwidth allocation. Moreover, it is seen
that with energy-harvesting transmitters, non-orthogonal broadcast offers
limited gain over orthogonal broadcast.

""Count Matching"" approach. Using lightcones drawn from a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation, we choose physical galaxy properties given by the model as
proxies for their submillimeter luminosities, assuming a monotonic
relationship. As recent interferometric observations of the Extended Chandra
Deep Field South show that the brightest sources detected by single-dish
telescopes are comprised by emission from multiple fainter sources, we assign
the submillimeter fluxes so that the combined LABOCA plus bright-end ALMA
observed number counts for this field are reproduced. After turning the model
catalogs given by the proxies into submillimeter maps, we perform a source
extraction to include the effects of the observational process on the recovered
counts and galaxy properties. We find that for all proxies, there are lines of
sight giving counts consistent with those derived from LABOCA observations,
even for input sources with randomized positions in the simulated map.
Comparing the recovered redshift, stellar mass and host halo mass distributions
for model SMGs with observational data, we find that the best among the
proposed proxies is that in which the submillimeter luminosity increases
monotonically with the product between dust mass and SFR. This proxy naturally
reproduces a positive trend between SFR and bolometric IR luminosity. The
majority of components of blended sources are spatially unassociated.

optimal tradeoff of secret key rate, list rate, and eavesdropper distortion.
The solution hinges on a problem of independent interest: lossy compression of
a codeword drawn uniformly from a random codebook. We also characterize the
solution to the lossy communication version of the problem in which distortion
is allowed at the legitimate receiver. The analysis in both settings is greatly
aided by a recent technique for proving source coding results with the use of a

striking differences between the two clusters. In the dynamically younger, $1$
Gyr old `Sausage' cluster we find numerous ($59$) H$\alpha$ emitters above a
star-formation rate (SFR) of $0.17$ M$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ surprisingly located
in close proximity to the shock fronts, embedded in very hot intra-cluster
medium plasma. The SFR density for the cluster population is at least at the
level of typical galaxies at $z\sim2$. Down to the same star-formation rate,
the possibly dynamically more evolved `Toothbrush' cluster has only $9$
H$\alpha$ galaxies. The cluster H$\alpha$ galaxies fall on the SFR-stellar mass

Thomson scattering, and derive the radiation energy-momentum tensor in the
diffusion limit, with viscous terms included. Contrary to relativistic
generalizations of the viscous stress tensor that appear in the literature, we
find that the stress tensor should contain a correction to the comoving energy
density proportional to the divergence of the four-velocity, as well as a
finite bulk viscosity. These modifications are consistent with the framework of
radiation hydrodynamics in the limit of large optical depth, and do not depend
on thermodynamic arguments such as the assignment of a temperature to the
zeroth-order photon distribution. We perform a perturbation analysis on our
equations and demonstrate that, as long as the wave numbers do not probe scales
smaller than the mean free path of the radiation, the viscosity contributes
only decaying, i.e., stable, corrections to the dispersion relations. The
astrophysical applications of our equations, including jets launched from
super-Eddington tidal disruption events and those from collapsars, are
discussed and will be considered further in future papers.

cluster merger. Despite being well studied in the X-ray, and radio, little has
been presented on the cluster structure and dynamics inferred from its galaxy
population. We carried out a deep (i<25) broad band imaging survey of the
system with Subaru SuprimeCam (g & i bands) and the Canada France Hawaii
Telescope (r band) as well as a comprehensive spectroscopic survey of the
cluster area (505 redshifts) using Keck DEIMOS. We use this data to perform a
comprehensive galaxy/redshift analysis of the system, which is the first step
to a proper understanding the geometry and dynamics of the merger, as well as
using the merger to constrain self-interacting dark matter. We find that the
system is dominated by two subclusters of comparable richness with a projected
separation of 6.9'^{+0.7}_{-0.5} (1.3^{+0.13}_{-0.10} Mpc). We find that the
north and south subclusters have similar redshifts of z=0.188 with a relative
line-of-sight velocity difference of 69+/-190 km/s. We also find that north and
south subclusters have velocity dispersions of 1160^{+100}_{-90} km/s and
1080^{+100}_{-70} km/s, respectively. These correspond to masses of
16.1^{+4.6}_{-3.3}x10^14 M_sun and 13.0^{+4.0}_{-2.5}x10^14 M_sun,
respectively. While velocity dispersion measurements of merging clusters can be
biased we believe the bias in this system to be minor due to the large
projected separation and nearly plane-of-sky merger configuration. CIZA
J2242.8+5301 is a relatively clean dissociative cluster merger with near 1:1
mass ratio, which makes it an ideal merger for studying merger associated
physical phenomena.

relic, which together with the morphology of the X-ray emission provides strong
evidence for a violent collision along the N-S axis. We present our constraints
on the dark matter distribution of this unusual system using Subaru and CFHT
imaging data. Measuring a high S/N lensing signal from this cluster is
potentially a challenging task because of its proximity to the Milky Way plane
(|b|~5 deg). We overcome this challenge with careful observation planning and
systematics control, which enables us to successfully map the dark matter
distribution of the cluster with high fidelity. The resulting mass map shows
that the mass distribution is highly elongated along the N-S merger axis
inferred from the orientation of the radio relics. Based on our mass
reconstruction, we identify two sub-clusters, which coincide with the cluster
galaxy distributions. We determine their masses using MCMC analysis by
simultaneously fitting two NFW halos without fixing their centroids. The
resulting masses of the northern and southern systems are
$M_{200}=11.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\times10^{14} M_{\sun}$ and
$9.8_{-2.5}^{+3.8}\times10^{14} M_{\sun}$, respectively, indicating that we are
witnessing a post-collision of two giant systems of nearly equal mass. When the
mass and galaxy centroids are compared in detail, we detect ~ 1' (~190 kpc)
offsets in both northern and southern sub-clusters. We find that the galaxy
luminosity-mass offset for the northern clump is statistically significant at
the ~2 sigma level whereas the detection is only marginal for the southern
sub-cluster in part because of a relatively large mass centroid error. We
conclude that it is yet premature to uniquely attribute the galaxy-mass
misalignment to SIDM and discuss caveats.

with a Curie temperature of approximately 130K. By suppressing ferroelectricity
with bromine substitution on the chlorine sites, pure single crystals were
tuned through a ferroelectric quantum phase transition. The resulting quantum
critical regime was investigated in detail - the first time for a uniaxial
ferroelectric and for an organic ferroelectric - and was found to persist up to
temperatures of at least 30K to 40K. The nature of long-range dipole
interactions in uniaxial materials, which lead to non-analytical terms in the
free-energy expansion in the polarization, predict a dielectric susceptibility
varying as $1/T^3$ close to the quantum critical point. Rather than this, we
find that the dielectric susceptibility varies as $1/T^2$ as expected and
observed in better known multi-axial systems. We explain this result by
identifying the ultra-weak nature of the dipoles in the TSCC family of
crystals. Interestingly we observe a shallow minimum in the inverse dielectric
function at low temperatures close to the quantum critical point in
paraelectric samples that may be attributed to the coupling of quantum
polarization and strain fields. Finally we present results of the heat capacity

spectroscopy, displacement measurements at the standard quantum limit, and the
development of advanced optical atomic clocks. Further applications include
LIDAR, coherent communications, frequency synthesis, and precision sensors of

frequency noise, many also require a laser that is robust and compact. Here, we
introduce a dual-microcavity laser that leverages one chip-integrable silica
microresonator to generate tunable 1550 nm laser light via stimulated Brillouin
scattering (SBS) and a second microresonator for frequency stabilization of the
SBS light. This configuration reduces the fractional frequency noise to
$7.8\times10^{-14} 1/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 10 Hz offset, which is a new regime of noise
performance for a microresonator-based laser. Our system also features
terahertz tunability and the potential for chip-level integration. We
demonstrate the utility of our dual-microcavity laser by performing optical
spectroscopy with hertz-level resolution.

Automorphic Lie Algebras are obtained by imposing a discrete group symmetry on
a current algebra of Krichever-Novikov type. Past work shows remarkable
uniformity between algebras associated to different reduction groups. For
example, if the base Lie algebra is $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and the poles
of the Automorphic Lie Algebra are restricted to an exceptional orbit of the
symmetry group, changing the reduction group does not affect the Lie algebra

the local transmit power non-cooperatively. Due to the limit of information
exchange in intra- and inter-tiers, a self-learning based strategy-updating

near-field radiative heat transfer. It is found that the spectral radiative
energy is enhanced by the epsilon-near-zero and hyperbolic modes at different
polarizations. As a result, the power output from a semi-infinite TPV cell is
improved by 1.85 times with the nanowire HMM emitter over that with a plain
tungsten emitter at a vacuum gap of 10 nm. Moreover, by using a thin TPV cell
with 10 um thickness, the conversion efficiency can be greatly improved from
19.5% to 31.5% without affecting the power generation, due to the total
internal reflection occurring at the bottom cell interface that minimizes the
sub-bandgap spectral radiative energy. Furthermore, the effects of a TPV cell
and a nanowire emitter with finite thicknesses are also studied. The result
shows that the maximum efficiency of 32.2% is achieved with an optimal cell

that are expensive and wasteful, and which are expected to grow with the
increasing penetration of renewables. The most promising solution to this
problem is the use of demand response, i.e. load participation in frequency
control. Yet it is still unclear how to efficiently integrate load
participation without introducing instabilities and violating operational
constraints.
  In this paper we present a comprehensive load-side frequency control
mechanism that can maintain the grid within operational constraints. In
particular, our controllers can rebalance supply and demand after disturbances,
restore the frequency to its nominal value and preserve inter-area power flows.
Furthermore, our controllers are distributed (unlike the currently implemented
frequency control), can allocate load updates optimally, and can maintain line
flows within thermal limits. We prove that such a distributed load-side control
is globally asymptotically stable and robust to unknown load parameters. We
illustrate its effectiveness through simulations.

create structures in macro systems. In fact, if all possible degrees of freedom
are actualized on equal footing without constraint, the state of
""equipartition"" may bear no specific structure. Fluid turbulence is a typical
example - while turbulent mixing seems to increase entropy, a variety of
sustained vortical structures can emerge. In Hamiltonian formalism, some
topological constraints are represented by Casimir invariants (for example,
helicities of a fluid or a plasma), and then, the effective phase space is
reduced to the Casimir leaves. However, a general constraint is not necessarily
integrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate Casimir invariant;
the circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this work, we formulate
a systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an extended phase space;
we introduce phantom fields and extend the Poisson algebra. A phantom field
defines a new Casimir invariant, a cross helicity, which represents a
topological constraint that is not integrable in the original phase space.
Changing the perspective, a singularity of the extended system may be viewed as
a subsystem on which the phantom fields (though they are actual fields, when
viewed from the extended system) vanish, i.e., the original system. This
hierarchical relation of degenerate Poisson manifolds enables us to see the
""interior"" of a singularity as a sub Poisson manifold. The theory can be
applied to describe bifurcations and instabilities in a wide class of general
Hamiltonian systems [Yoshida & Morrison, Fluid Dyn. Res. 46 (2014), 031412].

size. In this paper, we develop cyclic delay diversity (CDD) transmission for
V-OFDM when there are multiple transmit antennas (CDD-V-OFDM). Similar to
CDD-OFDM systems, CDD-V-OFDM can also collect both spatial and multipath
diversities. Since V-OFDM first converts a single input single output (SISO)
ISI channel to a multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) ISI channel of
order/length $K$ times less, where $K$ is the vector size, for a given
bandwidth, the CDD-V-OFDM can accommodate $K$ times more transmit antennas than
the CDD-OFDM does to collect all the spatial and multipath diversities. This
property will specially benefit a massive MIMO system. We show that with the
linear MMSE equalizer at each subcarrier, the CDD-V-OFDM achieves diversity
order $d_{\text{CDD-V-OFDM}}^{\text{MMSE}} = \min \{ \lfloor 2^{-R}K \rfloor,
N_t L \} +1$, where $R$ is the transmission rate, $N_t$ is the number of
transmit antennas, and $L$ is the ISI channel length between each transmit and
receive antenna pair. Simulations are presented to illustrate our theory.

order at the atomic scale. While quasicrystals possess long-range orientational
order they lack translation periodicity. Structurally complex, yet crystalline
intermetallics and (bulk) metallic glasses represent competing states of
condensed matter among metallic phases, including peculiarities like the
q-glass. Considerable progress has been made in their structure elucidation and
in identifying factors governing their formation; comparatively less is known
about their interrelation. Moreover, studies bridging the spatial scales from
atoms to the macroscale are scarce. Here we report on the homogeneous
nucleation of a single quasicrystalline seed of decagonal symmetry and its
continuous growth into a tenfold twinned dendritic microstructure.
Electrostatic levitation was applied to undercool melts of glass-forming NiZr,
observing single crystallization events with a high-speed camera; with a
statistical evaluation of 200 consecutive thermal cycles suggesting homogeneous
nucleation. The twinned dendritic microstructure, apparent in electron
backscatter diffraction maps, results from the symmetry breaking of an
essentially 2D decagonal quasicrystalline cluster. Conserving its long-range
orientational order, our distortion-free twin model merges a common structure
type for binary intermetallic compounds, with interatomic distances of alike
atoms scaled by the golden ratio, and spiral growth resembling phyllotaxis.
NiZr represents a missing link connecting quasicrystals and multiple twinned
structures sheding light on intermediate states of order between glasses,
crystals and their twins, and quasicrystals.

theories are established for addressing the model-free optimal control problem
of general nonlinear continuous-time systems. By introducing the Q-function for
continuous-time systems, policy iteration based QL (PIQL) and value iteration
based QL (VIQL) algorithms are proposed for learning the optimal control policy
from real system data rather than using mathematical system model. It is proved
that both PIQL and VIQL methods generate a nonincreasing Q-function sequence,
which converges to the optimal Q-function. For implementation of the QL
algorithms, the method of weighted residuals is applied to derived the
parameters update rule. The developed PIQL and VIQL algorithms are essentially
off-policy reinforcement learning approachs, where the system data can be
collected arbitrary and thus the exploration ability is increased. With the
data collected from the real system, the QL methods learn the optimal control
policy offline, and then the convergent control policy will be employed to real
system. The effectiveness of the developed QL algorithms are verified through
computer simulation.

liquid $^3$He that Fermi-liquid renormalizations change in the superconducting

Landau parameters $F_0^s$ and $F_1^s$; this has never been accomplished before.
A modification of the temperature dependence of the specific heat

carefully determined the magnitude and temperature dependence of $\Lambda$ in
CeCoIn$_5$ by muon spin relaxation rate measurements to obtain $F_0^s = 36 \pm

Sarnak (1994). The former states that, on any Riemannian manifold with negative
curvature or ergodic geodesic flow, the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator equidistribute in phase space with density 1. Under the same
assumptions, the latter states that the eigenfunctions induce a sequence of
Wigner probability measures on fibers of the Hamiltonian in phase space, and
these measures converge in the weak-* topology to the uniform Liouville
measure. If true, the conjecture implies that such eigenfunctions
equidistribute in the high-eigenvalue limit with no exceptional ""scarring""
patterns. This physically means that the finest details of chaotic Hamiltonian
systems can never reflect their quantum-mechanical behaviors, even in the
semiclassical limit.

research on the possibility of directly processing of compressed images. In
this research paper, we summarize the research work carried out to perform
different operations straight from run-length compressed documents without

are feature extraction; text-line, word and character segmentation; document
block segmentation; and font size detection, all carried out in the compressed
version of the document. Feature extraction methods demonstrate how to extract
the conventionally defined features such as projection profile, run-histogram
and entropy, directly from the compressed document data. Document segmentation
involves the extraction of compressed segments of text-lines, words and
characters using the vertical and horizontal projection profile features.
Further an attempt is made to segment randomly a block of interest from the
compressed document and subsequently facilitate absolute and relative
characterization of the segmented block which finds real time applications in
automatic processing of Bank Cheques, Challans, etc, in compressed domain.
Finally an application to detect font size at text line level is also
investigated. All the proposed algorithms are validated experimentally with
sufficient data set of compressed documents.

  Populations",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comprehensive models of stochastic, clonally reproducing populations are
defined in terms of general branching processes, allowing birth during maternal
life, as for higher organisms, or by splitting, as in cell division. The
populations are assumed to start small, by mutation or immigration, reproduce
supercritically while smaller than the habitat carrying capacity but
subcritically above it. Such populations establish themselves with a
probability wellknown from branching process theory. Once established, they
grow up to a band around the carrying capacity in a time that is logarithmic in
the latter, assumed large. There they prevail during a time period whose
duration is exponential in the carrying capacity. Even populations whose life
style is sustainble in the sense that the habitat carrying capacity is not
eroded but remains the same, ultimately enter an extinction phase, which again
lasts for a time logarithmic in the carrying capacity. However, if the habitat
can carry a population which is large, say millions of individuals, and it
manages to avoid early extinction, time in generations to extinction will be
exorbitantly long, and during it, population composition over ages, types,
lineage etc. will have time to stabilise. This paper aims at an exhaustive
description of the life cycle of such populations, from inception to
extinction, extending and overviewing earlier results. We shall also say some
words on persistence times of populations with smaller carrying capacities and
short life cycles, where the population may indeed be in danger in spite of not
eroding its environment.

at the LHC, where quasi-real photons are emitted by both colliding protons.
These reactions can result in the exclusive production of a final state $X$,
$p+p \rightarrow p+p+X$. When computing such cross sections, it has already
been shown that finite size effects of colliding protons are important to
consider for a realistic estimate of the cross sections. These first results
have been essential in understanding the physics case of heavy-ion collisions
in the low invariant mass range, where heavy ions collide to form an exclusive
final state like a $J/\Psi$ vector meson. In this paper, our purpose is to
present some calculations that are valid also for the exclusive production of
high masses final states in proton-proton collisions, like the production of a
pair of $W$ bosons or the Higgs boson. Therefore, we propose a complete
treatment of the finite size effects of incident protons irrespective of the

separation driven by intercomponent density-density interaction. Such a theory
can be viewed arising from the breakdown of $SU(2)$ symmetry by a biquadratic
interaction between the components of the field. Depending on the
symmetry-breaking term, there are two ground-state phases: one where both
components of the doublet are equal (the miscible phase) and one where only one
component assumes a non zero vacuum expectation value (the immiscible state).
In the latter phase, the spectrum of topological excitations contains both
domain walls and vortices. We show the existence of another kind of excitation
that has properties of both topological excitations at the same time. They
combine vorticity together with a circular domain wall, interpolating between
inequivalent broken states, that shows up as a ring of localized magnetic flux.
Asymptotically, this resembles a vortex carrying multiple flux quanta, but
because the magnetic field is localized at a given distance from the center
this looks like a pipe. The isolated multiquanta pipelike vortices can be
either stable or metastable, even if the system is not type-1. We also discuss
the response of such a system to an externally applied magnetic field.

strengths. We show that ES, in fact, is far more general, and can occur in
adaptive and multilayer networks also in the absence of such correlation
properties. Precisely, we first report evidence of ES in the absence of
correlation for networks where a fraction f of the nodes have links adaptively
controlled by a local order parameter, and then we extend the study to a
variety of two-layer networks with a fraction f of their nodes coupled each
other by means of dependency links. In this latter case, we even show that ES
sets in, regardless of the differences in the frequency distribution and/or in
the topology of connections between the two layers. Finally, we provide a
rigorous, analytical, treatment to properly ground all the observed scenario,

AGNs with the goal to use these objects as standard candles and mass tags.
However, the RM size can receive different interpretations depending on the
assumed geometry and the corresponding mass depends on an unknown geometrical
factor as well on the possible confusion between local and global velocity
dispersion. From RM alone, the scatter around the mean mass is as large as a
factor 3. Though BLRs are expected to be much smaller than the current spatial
resolution of large optical interferometers (OI), we show that differential
interferometry with AMBER, GRAVITY and successors can measure the size and
constrain the geometry and kinematics on a large sample of QSOs and Sy1 AGNs.
AMBER and GRAVITY (K around 10.5) could be easily extended up to K equal to 13
by an external coherencer or by advanced incoherent data processing. Future
VLTI instrument could reach K around 15. This opens a large AGN BLR program
intended to obtain a very accurate calibration of mass, luminosity and distance
measurements from RM data which will allow using many QSOs as standard candles
and mass tags to study the general evolution of mass accretion in the Universe.
This program is analyzed with our BLR model allowing predicting and
interpreting RM and OI measures together and illustrated with the results of
our observations of 3C273 with the VLTI.

the turbulent heating and acceleration of ions in the collisionless fast solar
wind streams. The energy source is given by an initial broad-band spectrum of
parallel propagating Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves, which co-exists with the plasma
and is self-consistently coupled to the perpendicular ion bulk velocities. We
include the effect of a gradual solar wind expansion, which cools and
decelerates the minor ions. This paper for the first time considers the
combined effect of self-consistently initialized dispersive turbulent
Alfv\'enic spectra with differentially streaming protons and $\alpha$ particles
in the expanding solar wind outflows within a 2.5D hybrid simulation study. In
the non-expanding wind, we find a threshold value of the differential streaming
$V_{\alpha p} = 0.5 V_\mathrm{A}$, for which the relative drift speed remains
nearly steady. For ions, streaming below the threshold value, the waves act to
increase the magnitude of the relative drift speed. Ions, which stream faster
than the threshold value become subject to nonlinear streaming instability and
as the system evolves their bulk velocities decrease. We find that the solar
wind expansion strongly affects the relative drift speeds and significantly
slows down both ion species for all values of the relative drift speeds

dimension 8 is given by Lauret and Will. In this paper we study 9-dimensional
Anosov Lie algebras by using the properties of very special algebraic numbers
and Lie algebra classification tools. We prove that there exists a unique (up
to a Lie algebra isomorphism) complex 3-step Anosov Lie algebra of dimension 9.
In the 2-step case, we prove that a 2-step real 9-dimensional Anosov Lie
algebra with no abelian factor must have a 3-dimensional derived algebra and we
characterize these Lie algebras in terms of their Pfaffian forms. Among these
Lie algebras, we have found a family of infinitely many complex nonisomorphic
Anosov Lie algebras.

  Pacific Wireless Communications Symposium (IEEE APWCS 2013)",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Routing in VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks) is a challenging task due to
large network sizes, rapidly changing topology and frequent network
disconnections. State-of-the-art routing protocols tried to address these
specific problems especially in city environments (vehicles constrained by road
geometry, signal transmissions blocked by obstacles, degree of congestion in
roads etc). It was noticed that in city scenarios codirectional roads consist
of a collection of disconnected clusters because of traffic control strategies
(e.g., RSU (Road Side Units), stop signs and traffic lights). In this paper, we
propose an intervehicle ad-hoc routing metric called EFD (Expected Forwarding
Delay) based on the vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., densities and
velocities) collected on-the-fly. We derive an analytical expression for the
expected size of a cluster in co-directional traffic. In case of disconnection
between two co-directional clusters the opposite directional clusters are used
as a bridge to propagate a message in the actual forwarding direction to reduce
the delay due to carry and forward. Through theoretical analysis and extensive
simulation, it is shown that our link delay model provides the accurate link
delay estimation in bidirectional city environments.

area navigation by generating different geometric patterns and shapes, and also
in carrying large objects. In this paper, Centroid Based Transformation (CBT)
\cite{c39}, has been applied to decompose the combined dynamics of wheeled
mobile robots (WMRs) into three subsystems: intra and inter group shape
dynamics, and the dynamics of the centroid. Separate controllers have been
designed for each subsystem. The gains of the controllers are such chosen that
the overall system becomes singularly perturbed system. Then sliding mode
controllers are designed on the singularly perturbed system to drive the
subsystems on sliding surfaces in finite time. Negative gradient of a potential
based function has been added to the sliding surface to ensure collision
avoidance among the robots in finite time. The efficacy of the proposed
controller is established through simulation results.
