northern Chile. A large-format KID camera, with up to 48,000 detectors at a
single waveband sampled at about 1 kHz, will have a data rate about 50 times

we formulate and then study a novel, namely strategic perspective on such
dynamics: There are the usual normal agents that update their opinions, for
instance according the well-known bounded confidence mechanism. But,
additionally, there is at least one strategic agent. That agent uses opinions
as freely selectable strategies to get control on the dynamics: The strategic
agent of our benchmark problem tries, during a campaign of a certain length, to
influence the ongoing dynamics among normal agents with strategically placed
opinions (one per period) in such a way, that, by the end of the campaign, as
much as possible normals end up with opinions in a certain interval of the
opinion space. Structurally, such a problem is an optimal control problem. That
type of problem is ubiquitous. Resorting to advanced and partly non-standard
methods for computing optimal controls, we solve some instances of the campaign
problem. But even for a very small number of normal agents, just one strategic
agent, and a ten-period campaign length, the problem turns out to be extremely
difficult. Explicitly we discuss moral and political concerns that immediately
arise, if someone starts to analyze the possibilities of an optimal opinion
control.

these criteria can be extended to continuous variable entangled states. We
apply them to various squeezed states, argue that two-mode squeezed vacuum
states belong to a class of general Schrodinger-cat states and compare the size

means for dynamic performance analysis of mechanical systems. The evolution of
theoretical and computational aspects of the multibody dynamics discipline make
it conducive these days for other types of applications, in addition to pure
simulations. One very important such application is design optimization. A very
important first step towards design optimization is sensitivity analysis of
multibody system dynamics. Dynamic sensitivities are often calculated by means
of finite differences. Depending of the number of parameters involved, this
procedure can be computationally expensive. Moreover, in many cases, the
results suffer from low accuracy when real perturbations are used. The main
contribution to the state-of-the-art brought by this study is the development
of the adjoint sensitivity approach of multibody systems in the context of the
penalty formulation. The theory developed is demonstrated on one academic case
study, a five-bar mechanism, and on one real-life system, a 14-DOF vehicle
model. The five-bar mechanism is used to illustrate the sensitivity approach
derived in this paper. The full vehicle model is used to demonstrate the
capability of the new approach developed to perform sensitivity analysis and
gradient-based optimization for large and complex multibody systems with
respect to multiple design parameters.

graph on $v$ vertices whose adjacency matrix $A$ satisfies the equation $AA^t=k

  We prove that the adjacency matrix of a normally regular digraph is normal. A
connected $k$-regular digraph with normal adjacency matrix is a normally
regular digraph if and only if all eigenvalues other than $k$ are on one circle
in the complex plane. We prove several non-existence results, structural
characterizations, and constructions of normally regular digraphs. In many
cases these graphs are Cayley graphs of abelian groups and the construction is
then based on a generalization of difference sets.

driven by fast time-periodic modulations. In the limit of large driving
frequency, the long-time dynamics of such systems can often be described by a
time-independent effective Hamiltonian, which is generally identified through a
perturbative treatment. Here, we present a general formalism that describes
time-modulated physical systems, in which the driving frequency is large, but
resonant with respect to energy spacings inherent to the system at rest. Such a
situation is currently exploited in optical-lattice setups, where superlattice
(or Wannier-Stark-ladder) potentials are resonantly modulated so as to control
the tunneling matrix elements between lattice sites, offering a powerful method
to generate artificial fluxes for cold-atom systems. The formalism developed in
this work identifies the basic ingredients needed to generate interesting flux
patterns and band structures using resonant modulations. Additionally, our
approach allows for a simple description of the micro-motion underlying the
dynamics; we illustrate its characteristics based on diverse dynamic-lattice
configurations. It is shown that the impact of the micro-motion on physical
observables strongly depends on the implemented scheme, suggesting that a
theoretical description in terms of the effective Hamiltonian alone is
generally not sufficient to capture the full time-evolution of the system.

generation in the transversely driven cavity mode induces a cavity-assisted
spin-orbit coupling in the system and opens a bulk gap at half-filling. This
mechanism can simultaneously drive a topological phase transition in the
system, yielding a topological superradiant phase. We map out the steady-state
phase diagram of the system in the presence of an effective Zeeman field, and
identify a critical quadracritical point beyond which the topological and the

the topological phase transitions based on the unique signatures in the

stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE). The DSGE model describes the
entanglements of the three variables (output gap [$y$], inflation [$\pi$] and
nominal interest rate [$r$]) which can be presented in 3D phase space. We find
that, even though the trajectory of $\pi\!-\!y\!-\!r$ in phase space appears
highly stochastic, it can be visualized and quantified. It exhibits as
clockwise cycles, counterclockwise cycles and weak cycles, respectively, when
projected onto $\pi\!-\!y$, $y\!-\!r$ and $r\!-\!\pi$ phase planes. We find
also that empirical data of United State (1960-2013) significantly exhibit same
cycles. The resemblance between the cycles in general equilibrium and the
cycles in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium suggest that, there generally exists
dynamical fine structures accompanying with equilibrium. The fine structure,
describing the entanglement of the non-equilibrium (the constantly deviating
from the equilibrium), displays as endless cycles.

field methods and nonrelativistic QED matching conditions. In particular, we
show that lack of on-shell conditions in lattice QCD with time-dependent
background fields generally requires that certain operators related by
equations of motion should be retained in an effective field theory to
correctly describe the behavior of Green's functions. The coefficients of such
operators in a nonrelativistic hadronic theory are determined by performing a
robust nonrelativistic expansion of QED for relativistic scalar and spin-half
hadrons including nonminimal electromagnetic couplings. Provided that
nonrelativistic QED is augmented with equation-of-motion operators, we find
that the background field method can be reconciled with the nonrelativistic QED
matching conditions without any inconsistency. We further investigate whether
nonrelativistic QED can be employed in the analysis of lattice QCD correlation
function in background fields, but we are confronted with difficulties.
Instead, we argue that the most desirable approach is a hybrid one which relies
on a relativistic hadronic theory with operators chosen based on their
relevance in the nonrelativistic limit. Using this hybrid framework, we obtain
practically useful forms of correlation functions for scalar and spin-half
hadrons in uniform electric and magnetic fields.

prototypical chemically active protostellar outflow L1157. We made use of
(sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the Chemical HErschel Surveys of
Star forming regions (CHESS) and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI) key
science programs. We detected $^{12}$C$^{32}$S, $^{12}$C$^{34}$S,
$^{13}$C$^{32}$S, and $^{12}$C$^{33}$S emissions, for a total of 18
transitions, with $E_{\rm u}$ up to $\sim$ 180 K. The unprecedented sensitivity
of the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing
high-velocity emission, up to 20 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic. The
profiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are
remarkably similar to what previously found using CO. These components have
been related to the cavity walls produced by the $\sim$ 2000 yr B1 shock and
the older ($\sim$ 4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively. The combination of low- and
high-excitation CS emission was used to properly sample the different physical
components expected in a shocked region. Our CS observations show that this
molecule is highlighting the dense, $n_{\rm H_2}$ = 1--5 $\times$ 10$^{5}$
cm$^{-3}$, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in L1157. In addition,
the highest excitation (E$_u$ $\geq$ 130 K) CS lines provide us with the
signature of denser (1--5 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas, associated with a
molecular reformation zone of a dissociative J-type shock, which is expected to
arise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. The CS
fractional abundance increases up to $\sim$ 10$^{-7}$ in all the kinematical
components. This value is consistent with what previously found for
prototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of the
abundances obtained via the chemical code Astrochem.

conceptual understanding of fast dynamos, including fluctuation or small scale
dynamos. We study the evolution and saturation behaviour of two types of
Baker's map dynamos, which have been used to model Zeldovich's STF dynamo
process. Using such maps allows one to analyze dynamos at much higher magnetic
Reynolds numbers $R_M$ as compared to direct numerical simulations. In the
2-strip map dynamo there is constant constructive folding while the 4-strip map
dynamo also allows the possibility of field reversal. Incorporating a diffusive
step parameterised by $R_M$, we find that the magnetic field $B(x)$ is
amplified only above a critical $R_M=R_{crit} \sim 4$ for both types of
dynamos. We explore the saturation of these dynamos in 3 ways; by a
renormalized decrease of the effective $R_M$ (Case I) or due to a decrease in
the efficiency of field amplification by stretching (Case II), or a combination
of both effects (Case III). For Case I, we show that $B(x)$ in the saturated
state, for both types of maps, goes back to the marginal eigenfunction, which
is obtained for the critical $R_M=R_{crit}$. This is independent of the initial
$R_M=R_{M0}$. On the other hand in Case II, for the 2-strip map, we show that
$B(x)$ now saturates preserving the structure of the kinematic eigenfunction.
Thus the energy is transferred to larger scales in Case I but remains at the
smallest resistive scales in Case II. For the 4-strip map, the $B(x)$
oscillates with time, although with a structure similar to the kinematic
eigenfunction. Interestingly, the saturated state for Case III shows an
intermediate behaviour, with $B(x)$ now similar to the kinematic eigenfunction
for an intermediate $R_M=R_{sat}$, with $R_{M0}>R_{sat}>R_{crit}$. These
saturation properties are akin to the ones discussed in the context of
fluctuation dynamos.

paradigm in many-body physics, and it exhibits a Mott insulator (MI)-superfluid

superconducting circuit is proposed. Specifically, a superconducting
transmission line resonator supporting microwave photons is coupled to a charge
qubit to form one site of the BHM, and adjacent sites are connected by a
tunable coupler. To obtain a mapping from the superconducting circuit to the
BHM, we focus on the dispersive regime where the excitations remain
photon-like. Standard perturbation theory is implemented to locate the
parameter range where the MI-SF transition may be simulated. This simulator
allows single-site manipulations and we illustrate this feature by considering
two scenarios where a single-site manipulation can drive a MI-SF transition.
The transition can be analyzed by mean-field analyses, and the exact
diagonalization was implemented to provide accurate results. The variance of
the photon density and the fidelity metric clearly show signatures of the
transition. Experimental realizations and other possible applications of this
simulator are also discussed.

difference between the lightest squark $\tilde u_1$ (which is assumed to be
mainly stop-like) and the neutralino LSP $\tilde \chi^0_1$ is smaller than the
top mass. In such a scenario $\tilde u_1\to t \tilde\chi^0_1$ is kinematically
not allowed and searches for $\tilde u_1\to W b \tilde\chi^0_1$ and $\tilde
u_1\to c \tilde\chi^0_1$ are performed. A large decay rate for $\tilde u_1\to c
\tilde\chi^0_1$ can weaken the LHC bounds from $\tilde u_1\to W b \chi^0_1$

bilinear terms. If flavour-violation originates from trilinear terms, the
effect can be $\pm 50\%$ or more, depending on the sign of $A^t$. We note that
connecting a theory of SUSY breaking to LHC observables, the shift from the

This variation is
governed by the underlying temperature-density structure of the solar
atmosphere. To explore the spectrally resolved center-to-limb variation (CLV)
we make use of two spectral atlases recorded with the Fourier transform
spectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce facility at Kitt Peak. One spectral
atlas obtained 10 arcsec inside the solar limb was recorded in 1978-79 as part
of the first survey of the Second Solar Spectrum, while the other atlas is the
well used reference NSO/Kitt Peak FTS atlas for the disk center. Both atlases
represent fully resolved spectra without any spectral stray light. We then
construct an atlas of the limb/disk-center ratio between the two spectra over
the wavelength range 4084-9950 \AA. This ratio spectrum, which expresses the
CLV amplitude relative to the continuum, is as richly structured as the
intensity spectrum itself, but the line profiles differ greatly in both shape
and amplitude. It is as if we are dealing with a new, unfamiliar spectrum of
the Sun, distinctly different from both the intensity spectrum (which we here
refer to with the acronym SS1) and the linear polarization of the Second Solar
Spectrum (for which we use acronym SS2). In analogy we refer to the new ratio
spectrum as SS3. While there is hardly any resemblance between SS3 and SS2, we
are able to identify a non-linear mapping that can translate SS1 to SS3 in the
case of weak to medium-strong spectral lines that are mainly formed in LTE
(being directly coupled to the local temperature-density structure). This
non-linear mapping is successfully modeled in terms of two free parameters that
are found to vary approximately linearly over the entire wavelength range
covered. These parameters and the various SS3 line profiles provide a novel,
rich set of observational constraints on model atmospheres.

brane-flux annihilation and is in tension with the idea that anti-branes can be

$\text{iTO}_L^7=2\mathbb{Z}$. Our construction also gives us the topological

begins from the scattering theory in quantum mechanics where the spectrum
reshuffling can be related to permutations of S-matrices. In non-trivial
situations, starting from spin chains and matrix models, the S-matrices are
operator-valued and their algebra is described in terms of R- and mixing
(Racah) U-matrices. Then, the Kontsevich-Soibelman invariants are nothing but
the standard knot invariants made out of these data within the
Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten approach. The R- and Racah matrices acquire a
relatively universal form in the quasiclassical limit, where the basic
reshufflings with the change of moduli are those of the Stokes line. Natural
from this point of view are matrices provided by the modular transformations of
conformal blocks (with the usual identification R=T and U=S), and in the
simplest case of the first degenerate field (2,1), when the conformal blocks
satisfy a second order Shroedinger-like equation, the invariants coincide with
the Jones (N=2) invariants of the associated knots. Another possibility to
construct knot invariants is to realize the cluster coordinates associated with
reshufflings of the Stokes lines immediately in terms of check-operators acting
on the solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. Then, the R-matrices
are realized as products of successive mutations in the cluster algebra and are
manifestly described in terms of quantum dilogarithms ultimately leading to the
Hikami construction of knot invariants.

operator depends on the spacetime dimension. This requires a modification when

play an important role at low energy. The singular $C_4$ symmetry of $d_{zx}$

$\Gamma$ pocket has vortex structure in the orbital space and the X/Y electron
pockets have $yz$/$zx$ components respectively. We propose a low energy theory
for the spin--nematic model derived from a multiorbital Hamiltonian. In the
standard spin--nematic scenario the ellipticity of the electron pockets is a
necessary condition for nematicity. In the present model nematicity is
essentially due to the singular $C_4$ symmetry of $yz$ and $zx$ orbitals. By
analyzing the ($\pi, 0$) spin susceptibility in the nematic phase we find
spontaneous generation of orbital splitting extending previous calculations in
the magnetic phase. We also find that the ($\pi, 0$) spin susceptibility has an
intrinsic anisotropic momentum dependence due to the non trivial topology of

relativistic jets inducing star formation has been found in the surroundings of
the microquasar GRS 1915+105. Here we summarize the multiwavelength
observations of two compact star formation IRAS sources axisymmetrically
located and aligned with the position angle of the sub-arcsec relativistic jets
from the stellar black hole binary GRS 1915+105 (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1994). The
observations of these two star forming regions at centimeter (Rodriguez &
Mirabel 1998), millimeter and infrared (Chaty et al. 2001) wavelengths had
suggested -despite the large uncertainties in the distances a decade ago- that
the jets from GRS 1915+105 are triggering along the radio jet axis the
formation of massive stars in a radio lobe of bow shock structure. Recently,
Reid et al.(2014) found that the jet source and the IRAS sources are at the
same distance, enhancing the evidence for the physical association between the
jets from GRS 1915+105 and star formation in the IRAS sources. We conclude that
as jets from AGN, jets from microquasars can trigger the formation of massive
stars, but at distances of a few tens of parsecs. Although star formation
induced by microquasar jets may not be statistically significant in the Milky
Way, jets from stellar black holes may have been important to trigger star
formation during the re-ionization epoch of the universe (Mirabel et al. 2011).
Because of the relative proximity of GRS 1915+105 and the associated star
forming regions, they may serve as a nearby laboratory to gain insight into the
physics of jet-trigger star formation elsewhere in the universe.

As such it provides a description of the Higgs sector of the standard model, in
which the Higgs field is replaced by the Goldstone `pions' of this QCD-like
theory, and the Higgs itself is the $\sigma$. Such a theory will need to be
extended if it is to also give masses to the quarks and leptons. What we are
attempting to determine is whether it is indeed QCD-like and hence walking, or
if it has an infrared fixed point making it a conformal field theory. We do
this by simulating its lattice version at finite temperature and observing the
running of the bare (lattice) coupling at the chiral transition, as the lattice
spacing is varied, and comparing this running with that predicted by 2-loop
perturbation theory. Our results on lattices with temporal extents ($N_t$) up
to 12 indicate that the coupling runs, but not as fast as asymptotic freedom
predicts. We discuss our program for studying the zero-temperature
phenomenology of this theory.

Hz frequency range based on RXTE data, and on simultaneous observations with
RXTE and optical telescopes. We find that the cross-correlation functions and
power spectra depend drastically on the precession phase of the supercritical
accretion disc. When the wind funnel of the disc is maximally open to the
observer, a flat part emerges in the power spectrum; a break is observed at the
frequency $1.7\times10^{-3}$ Hz, with a power-law index $\beta \approx 1.67$ at
higher frequencies. The soft emission forming mostly in the jets, lags behind
the hard and optical emission. When the observer does not see the funnel and
jets (the `edge-on' disc), the power spectrum is described by a single
power-law with $\beta \approx 1.34$ and no correlations between X-ray ranges
are detected. We investigated two mechanisms to explain the observed
variability at the open disc phase, 1) reflection of radiation at the funnel
wall (X-rays and optical) and 2) the gas cooling in the jets (X-rays only). The
X-ray variability is determined by the contribution of both mechanisms, however
the contribution of the jets is much higher. We found that the funnel size is
$(2-2.5)\times10^{12}$ cm, and the opening angle is $\vartheta_f\sim 50^\circ$.
X-ray jets may consist of three fractions with different densities:
$8\times10^{13}$, $3\times10^{13}$ and $5\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, with most of
the jet's mass falling within the latter fraction. We suppose that revealed
flat part in the power spectrum may be related to an abrupt change in the disc
structure and viscous time-scale at the spherization radius, because the
accretion disc becomes thick at this radius, $h/r \sim 1$. The extent of the
flat spectrum depends on the variation of viscosity at the spherization radius.

from the MOJAVE VLBA program. Nearly half the features and three-quarters of
the jets show significant changes in speed and/or direction. In general,
apparent speed changes are distinctly larger than changes in direction,
indicating that changes in the Lorentz factors of jet features dominate the
observed speed changes rather than bends along the line of sight. Observed
accelerations tend to increase the speed of features near the jet base,
$\lesssim 10-20$ parsecs projected, and decrease their speed at longer
distances. The range of apparent speeds at fixed distance in an individual jet
can span a factor of a few, indicating that shock properties and geometry may
influence the apparent motions; however, we suggest that the broad trend of jet
features increasing their speed near the origin is due to an overall
acceleration of the jet flow out to de-projected distances of order $10^2$
parsecs, beyond which the flow begins to decelerate or remains nearly constant
in speed. We estimate intrinsic rates of change of the Lorentz factors in the
galaxy frame of order $\dot{\Gamma}/\Gamma \simeq 10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ per
year which can lead to total Lorentz factor changes of a factor of a few on the
length scales observed here. Finally, we also find evidence for jet collimation
at projected distances of $\lesssim 10$ parsecs in the form of the non-radial
motion and bending accelerations that tend to better align features with the
inner jet.

2015, with Virgo following shortly after. The use of squeezing has been
proposed as a way to reduce the quantum noise without increasing the laser
power, and has been successfully tested at one of the LIGO sites and at GEO in
Germany. When used in Advanced LIGO without a filter cavity, the squeezer
improves the performances of detectors above about 100 Hz, at the cost of a
higher noise floor in the low frequency regime. Frequency-dependent squeezing,
on the other hand, will lower the noise floor throughout the entire band.
Squeezing technology will have a twofold impact: it will change the number of
expected detections and it will impact the quality of parameter estimation for
the detected signals. In this work we consider three different GW detector
networks, each utilizing a different type of squeezer, all corresponding to
plausible implementations. Using LALInference, a powerful Monte Carlo parameter
estimation algorithm, we study how each of these networks estimates the
parameters of GW signals emitted by compact binary systems, and compare the
results with a baseline advanced LIGO-Virgo network. We find that, even in its
simplest implementation, squeezing has a large positive impact: the sky error
area of detected signals will shrink by about 30% on average, increasing the
chances of finding an electromagnetic counterpart to the GW detection.
Similarly, we find that the measurability of tidal deformability parameters for
neutron stars in binaries increases by about 30%, which could aid in
determining the equation of state of neutron stars. The degradation in the
measurement of the chirp mass, as a result of the higher low-frequency noise,
is shown to be negligible when compared to systematic errors.

classically scale-invariant. We show that gravitational radiative corrections
are crucial in the determination of the nature of the vacuum state in such
theories, which are renormalisable, technically natural, and can be
asymptotically free in all dimensionless couplings. In the pure gravity case,
we discuss the role of the Gauss-Bonnet term, and we find that Dimensional
Transmutation (DT) \`a la Coleman-Weinberg leads to extrema of the effective
action corresponding to nonzero values of the curvature, but such that these
extrema are local maxima. In even the simplest extension of the theory to
include scalar fields, we show that the same phenomenon can lead to extrema
that are local minima of the effective action, with both non-zero curvature and
non-zero scalar vacuum expectation values, leading to spontaneous generation of
the Planck mass. Although we find an asymptotically free (AF) fixed point
exists, unfortunately, no running of the couplings connect the region of DT to
the basin of attraction of the AF fixed point. We also find there remains a
flat direction for one of the conformal modes. We suggest that in more
realistic models AF and DT could be compatible, and that the same scalar vacuum
expectation values could be responsible both for DT and for spontaneous
breaking of a Grand Unified gauge group.

galaxies correlate tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion (the $\MBH -
\sigma$ relation) and the stellar mass (the $\MBH - \Mhost$ relation) of their
host spheroids. However, the origin of these correlations remains ambiguous. In
a previous paper by Zhu et al., we proposed a model which links the M-$\sigma$
relation to the the dynamical state of the system and the $\MBH - \Mhost$
relation to the self-regulation of galaxy growth. To test this model, we
compile a sample of observed galaxies with different properties and examine the
dependence of the above correlations on these parameters. We find that galaxies
that satisfy the the $\MBH - \sigma$ correlation appear to have reached virial
equilibrium, as indicated by the ratio between kinetic energy and gravitational
potential, 2K/U $\sim$ 1. Furthermore, the ratio of black hole accretion rate
to star formation rate remains nearly constant, BHAR /SFR $\sim$ $10^{-3}$, in
active galaxies over a wide range of mass in the redshift range z=0 - 3. These
results confirm our theoretical model that the observed correlations have
different origins: the $\MBH - \sigma$ relation may result from galaxy
relaxation, while the $\MBH$ - $\Mhost$ relation may be due to self-regulated
black hole accretion and star formation in galaxies.

$\sim 10^7$ ergs-cm$^{-2}$-sec$^{-1}$. The heating rates due to electron
current dissipation in the photosphere and corona are also computed. The wave
amplitudes are computed self-consistently as functions of an inhomogeneous

numerically using a resolution of 3.33 m. The oscillations drive a

in the photosphere. Thermalization of Poynting flux in the photosphere due to
electron current dissipation regulates the Poynting flux into the chromosphere,
limiting $F_{Ch}$. $F_{Ch}$ initially increases with $\nu$, reaches a maximum,
and then decreases with increasing $\nu$ due to increasing electron current
dissipation in the photosphere. The resolution needed to resolve the
oscillations increases from $\sim 10$ m in the photosphere to $\sim 10$ km in

cosmological hydrodynamical cluster simulations performed with an SPH numerical
scheme employing an artificial conductivity (AC) term. We explore the effects
of this term on the ICM temperature and entropy profiles, thermal distribution,
velocity field and expected X-ray emission. We find that in adiabatic runs the
artificial conductivity favours (i) the formation of an entropy core, raising
and flattening the central entropy profiles, in better agreement with findings
from Eulerian codes; and (ii) a systematic reduction of the cold gas component.
In fact, the cluster large-scale structure and dynamical state are preserved
across different runs, but the improved gas mixing enabled by the AC term
strongly increases the stripping rate of gas from the cold clumps moving
through the ICM. This in turn reduces the production of turbulence generated by
the instabilities which develop because of the interaction between clumps and
ambient ICM. We then find that turbulent motions, enhanced by the
time-dependent artificial viscosity scheme we use, are rather damped by the AC
term. The ICM synthetic X-ray emission substantially mirrors the changes in its
thermo-dynamical structure, stressing the robustness of the AC impact. All
these effects are softened by the introduction of radiative cooling but still
present, especially a partial suppression of cold gas. Therefore, not only the
physics accounted for, but also the numerical approach itself can have an
impact in shaping the ICM thermo-dynamical structure and ultimately in the use

the carriers of the semimetal. We find that when the temperature is much

long-range scalar disorder and Kondo effect. In the presence of
disorder-induced long-range carrier density inhomogeneities the Kondo effect is
not characterized by a Kondo temperature but by a distribution of Kondo

properties concerning the three-point functions at weak coupling in the SU(2)
sector of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. One is a double spin-chain
formulation of the spin-chain and the associated new interpretation of the
operation of Wick contraction. It will be regarded as a skew symmetric pairing
which acts as a projection onto a singlet in the entire SO(4) sector, instead
of an inner product in the spin-chain Hilbert space. This formalism allows us
to study a class of three-point functions of operators built upon more general
spin-chain vacua than the special configuration discussed so far in the
literature. Furthermore, this new viewpoint has the signicant advantage over
the conventional method: In the usual ""tailoring"" operation, the Wick
contraction produces inner products between off-shell Bethe states, which
cannot be in general converted into simple expressions. In contrast, our
procedure directly produces the so-called partial domain wall partition
functions, which can be expressed as determinants. Using this property, we
derive simple determinantal representation for a broader class of three-point
functions. The second new property uncovered in this work is the non-trivial
identity satisfied by the three-point functions with monodromy operators
inserted. Generically this relation connects three-point functions of different
operators and can be regarded as a kind of Schwinger-Dyson equation. In
particular, this identity reduces in the semiclassical limit to the triviality
of the product of local monodromies around the vertex operators, which played a
crucial role in providing all important global information on the three-point
function in the strong coupling regime. This structure may provide a key to the
understanding of the notion of ""integrability"" beyond the spectral level.

superradiance can be exploited to extract energy from black holes. The original
idea (involving the breakup of a single particle) yields only modest energy
gains. A variant of the Penrose process consists of particle collisions in the
ergoregion. The collisional Penrose process has been explored recently in the
context of dark matter searches, with the conclusion that the ratio $\eta$
between the energy of post-collision particles detected at infinity and the
energy of the colliding particles should be modest ($\eta \lesssim 1.5$).
Schnittman has shown that these studies underestimated the maximum efficiency
by about one order of magnitude (i.e., $\eta \lesssim 15$). In this work we
show that particle collisions in the vicinity of rapidly rotating black holes
can produce high-energy ejecta and result in high efficiencies under much more
generic conditions. The astrophysical likelihood of these events deserves
further scrutiny, but our study hints at the tantalizing possibility that the
collisional Penrose process may power gamma rays and ultra-high-energy cosmic
rays.

demonstrate that the fermion sign problem originates in topological properties

two natural classes of actions which arise from set intersection and union. In
the first class, the $\uparrow\mathrel{\mspace{-2mu}}\downarrow$-actions, each
element of $S$ is identified with a pair of sets $(s^\downarrow,s^\uparrow)$,
which act on a set $c$ by intersection with $s^\downarrow$ and union with
$s^\uparrow$. In the second class, the
$\uparrow\mathrel{\mspace{-2mu}}\downarrow$-biactions, each element of $S$ is
labeled as an intersection or a union, and acts accordingly on $C$. We give
intuitive examples of these actions, one involving conversations and another a
university's changing student body. The examples give some motivation for
considering these actions, and also help give intuitive readings of the axioms.
The class of $\uparrow\mathrel{\mspace{-2mu}}\downarrow$-actions is closely
related to a class of single-sorted algebras, which was previously treated by
Margolis et al., albeit in another guise (hyperplane arrangements), and we note

univocally explained by a single emission model. Leptonic models with one and
multi-zone emission regions, occurring in the jet of these objects, are usually
used to describe the broadband spectral energy distribution. A correlation
between the X-ray and TeV emission is naturally expected within leptonic models
whereas a lack of correlation between these two observables represents a
challenge and favors the hadronic scenarios. This is the case of M87 as we show
here by analyzing its TeV and X-ray emission recorded in the last decade.
Furthermore, we point out that the spectra obtained by MAGIC, H.E.S.S. and
VERITAS telescopes cannot be described with the same leptonic model introduced
by the Fermi-LAT collaboration. We introduce hadronic scenarios to explain the
TeV gamma-ray fluxes of this radiogalaxy as products of Fermi-accelarated
protons interacting with seed photons in the jet or thermal particles in the
giant lobes. By fitting this part of spectral energy distribution as pion decay
products, we obtain the expected neutrino counterpart and the luminosity of
accelerating protons in the jet and/or lobes. With the expected neutrino fluxes
we investigate, through Monte Carlo simulations, the possibility to see the
signal from M87 with a Km$^{3}$ neutrino telescope, and compare the results
with what has been seen by IceCube experiment up to now. Finally we constrain
the features of giant lobes through the observations performed at ultra high

temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition. These {\it overluminous
stars} have two curious properties. First, their kinematics as a function of
age from stellar evolution modeling (isochrone fitting) is very different from
that of normal stars. Second, while X-ray luminosity of normal stars declines
with age, the X-ray luminosity of overluminous F stars changes in the opposite
direction, being on average higher for older stars. These properties imply
that, in defiance of standard models of stellar evolution, F stars of a given
mass and chemical composition can evolve very differently. Assuming that the
models correctly describe normal stars, for overluminous F stars they predict
too young age and the X-ray emission evolving in the direction opposite to the
actually observed trend. This discrepancy between modeling results and
observational data suggests that standard stellar evolution models and models
of stellar activity are missing some important factors, which makes stellar age
and predictions for stellar activity from these models problematic. The data
and literature analysis presented in this paper point to a nonuniform rotation
of the stellar interior as a plausible key factor able to reconcile the

significantly the upper bound on top partner masses in minimal composite Higgs

a comprehensive survey of the impact of different realizations of the fermion
sectors on the Higgs potential, with a special emphasis on the role of the
leptons. The non-negligible compositeness of the $\tau_R$ in a general class of
models that address the flavor structure of the lepton sector and the smallness
of the corresponding FCNCs, can have a significant effect on the potential. We
find that, with the $\tau_R$ in the symmetric representation of $SO(5)$, an
increase in the maximally allowed mass of the lightest top partner of $\gtrsim
1$ TeV is possible for minimal quark setups like the MCHM$_{5,10}$, without
increasing the tuning. A light Higgs boson $m_H \sim(100-200)$ GeV is a natural
prediction of such models, which thus provide a new setup that can evade
ultra-light top partners without ad-hoc tuning in the Higgs mass. Moreover, we
advocate a more minimal realization of the lepton sector than generally used in
the literature, which still can avoid light partners due to its contributions
to the Higgs mass in a different and very natural way, triggered by the seesaw
mechanism. This allows to construct the most economical $SO(5)/SO(4)$ composite
Higgs models possible. Using both a transparent 4D approach, as well as
presenting numerical results in the 5D holographic description, we demonstrate
that, including leptons, minimality and naturalness do not imply light
partners. Leptonic effects, not considered before, could hence be crucial for
the viability of composite models.

many of the features of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), such as the generation
of a hot torus orbiting a rapidly rotating black hole, which can then build a

Yet, this scenario has problems explaining the recently discovered long-term

SGRBs. We propose a new model that explains how an X-ray afterglow can be
sustained by the product of the merger and how the X-ray emission is produced
before the corresponding emission in the gamma-band, although it is observed to
follow it. Overall, our paradigm combines in a novel manner a number of
well-established features of the emission in SGRBs and results from
simulations. Because it involves the propagation of an ultra-relativistic
outflow and its interaction with a confining medium, the paradigm also
highlights a unifying phenomenology between short and long GRBs.

faults that excite qubits to states outside the computational space. Aliferis

using gadgets called leakage reduction units (LRUs). However, these gadgets
reduce the accuracy threshold and can increase overhead and experimental
complexity, and these costs have not been thoroughly understood. Our work
explores a variety of techniques for leakage-resilient, fault-tolerant error
correction in the context of topological codes. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we develop a leakage model that differs in critical details
from earlier models. Second, we use Monte-Carlo simulations to survey several
syndrome extraction circuits. Third, given the capability to perform
three-outcome measurements, we present a dramatically improved syndrome
processing algorithm. Our simulation results show that simple circuits with one
extra CNOT per qubit and no additional ancillas reduce the accuracy threshold
by less than a factor of 4 when leakage and depolarizing noise rates are
comparable. This becomes a factor of 2 when the decoder uses 3-outcome
measurements. Finally, when the physical error rate is less than 2 x 10^-4,
placing LRUs after every gate may achieve the lowest logical error rates of all
of the circuits we considered. We expect the closely related planar and rotated
codes to exhibit the same accuracy thresholds and that the ideas may generalize
naturally to other topological codes.

about the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to
containment. In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public
health interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal
understanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate
dynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case
incidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To
investigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a
multi-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and
time-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate
interventions. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters
that were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the
observed trajectory. Results suggest that epidemic outcome depends on both
hospital capacity and individual behavior. The model predicts that if hospital
capacity is not increased soon, then transmission may outpace the rate of
isolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying.
Similarly, containment will probably require individuals to adopt behaviors
that increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial
of the deceased. Given current knowledge, it is uncertain that this epidemic
will be contained even with 99% hospitalization rate at the currently projected
hospital capacity.

sub-populations does not grow too fast. A plug-in estimator for the
heterogeneity parameter is further constructed, and shown to possess the
asymptotic distribution as if the commonality information were available. We
also test the heterogeneity among a large number of sub-populations. All the
above results require to regularize each sub-estimation as though it had the
entire sample size. Our general theory applies to the divide-and-conquer
approach that is often used to deal with massive homogeneous data. A technical
by-product of this paper is the statistical inferences for the general kernel
ridge regression. Thorough numerical results are also provided to back up our

primary fluence shaded by the moving BSA (during scatter measurement) could be
recovered with high accuracy. However, the moving BSA may increase the
mechanical burden in real applications. For better practicability, in this
paper we proposed a PC-VI based single-scan scheme with a ring-shaped
stationary BSA, which serves as a virtual moving BSA during CB scan, so the
shaded primary fluence by this stationary BSA can be also well recovered by
PC-VI. The principle in designing the whole system is deduced and evaluated.
The proposed scheme greatly enhances the practicability of the single-scan

confinement-like region and a Higgs-like region appear even in two dimensions.
The behavior of the plaquette expectation value is consistent with a smooth
cross-over in accordance with the Fradkin-Shenker-Osterwalder-Seiler theorem.
In the confinement-like region, the static potential seems to rise linearly
with string breaking at large distances, while in the Higgs-like region there
seems to be a massive behavior which means that the BEH mechanism occurs. The
correlation length obtained from the W propagator has a finite maximum between
these phases, which supports no second-order phase transition. Based on these

characterized by a single, reddish nucleus of absolute magnitude $H \ge$
18.98$\pm$0.10, corresponding to an equal-area sphere of radius $\le$200$\pm$20
m (for assumed geometric albedo 0.29$\pm$0.09). We set an upper limit to the
radii of possible companion nuclei at $\sim$10 m. The nucleus ejected debris in
nine discrete episodes, spread irregularly over a nine month interval, each
time forming a distinct tail. Particles in the tails range from about 10 $\mu$m
to at least 80 mm in radius, and were ejected at speeds $<$1 m s$^{-1}$. The
ratio of the total ejected dust mass to the nucleus mass is
$\sim$3$\times$10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a global surface layer $\sim$2 mm
thick, or to a deeper layer covering a smaller fraction of the surface. The
observations are incompatible with an origin of the activity by impact or by
the sublimation of entrapped ice. This object appears to be shedding its
regolith by rotational (presumably YORP-driven) instability. Long-term fading
of the photometry (months) is attributed to gradual dissipation of near-nucleus
dust. Photometric variations on short timescales ($<$0.7 hr) are probably
caused by fast rotation of the nucleus. However, because of limited time
coverage and dilution of the nucleus signal by near-nucleus dust, we have not
been able to determine the rotation period.

performed in a similarity transformation domain using the quasi-steady-state

smaller. Variations of the most unstable wave number and the cut-off wave

that the wave numbers of the unstable modes increase with Pe. Influence of the
anisotropic dispersion on the onset in both the linear and nonlinear regimes

the combined effect of the Korteweg stress and Pe in the linear regime has been

Legendre transformation mathematical frame, the celebrated Boltzmann-Gibbs~(BG)
statistical mechanics is suff{}icient but not necessary. Indeed, the
$N\to\infty$ limit of statistical mechanics is expected to be consistent with
thermodynamics. For systems whose elements are generically independent or
quasi-independent in the sense of the theory of probabilities, it is well known
that the BG theory (based on the additive BG entropy) does satisfy this
expectation. However, in complete analogy, other thermostatistical theories
(\emph{e.g.}, $q$-statistics), based on nonadditive entropic functionals, also
satisfy the very same expectation. We illustrate this standpoint with systems
whose elements are strongly correlated in a specific manner, such that they
escape the BG realm.

with focusing on finite large scales. It is previously shown that (Yildirim,
2015, Int. J. Mod. Phys A, 30(7), 1550034), topologically massive Yang-Mills
theory exhibits a Chern-Simons splitting behavior at large scales, similar to
the topologically massive AdS gravity model in its near Chern-Simons limit.
This splitting occurs as two Chern-Simons parts with levels $+k/2$ each, where
$k$ is the original Chern-Simons level in the Lagrangian. In the pure
Chern-Simons limit, split parts combine to give the original Chern-Simons
level. The opposite limit of the gravitational analogue gives an
Einstein-Hilbert term with a negative cosmological constant, which can be
written as a two half Chern-Simons terms with opposite signs. With this
motivation, the gauge theory analogue of this limit is investigated, showing
that at finite large distances pure Yang-Mills theory acts like a topological
theory that consists of split Chern-Simons parts with levels $+k/2$ and $-k/2$.
At very large distances these split terms cancel, making the Yang-Mills theory
trivial, as expected, due to the existence of a mass gap. Gauge invariance of
the split parts is discussed. It is also shown that this splitting behavior can
be exploited to incorporate link invariants of knot theory, just like in the
topologically massive case.

operation of a laser oscillating from gain supplied by stimulated Brillouin
scattering (SBS) in a microresonator. The interaction of the forward, backward,
and density waves within the microresonator results in a set of coupled-mode
equations describing both the laser's phase and amplitude evolution over time.
Using this coupled-mode formalism, we investigate the performance of the SBS
laser under noise perturbation and identify the fundamental parameters and
their optimization to enable low-noise SBS operation. The intrinsic laser
linewidth, which is primarily limited by incoherent thermal occupation of the
density wave, can be of order hertz or below. Our analysis also determines the
SBS laser's relaxation oscillation, which results from the coupling between the
optical and density waves, and appears as a resonance in both the phase and
amplitude quadratures. We further explore contributions of the pump noise to
the SBS laser's performance, which we find under most circumstances to increase
the SBS laser noise beyond its fundamental limits. By tightly stabilizing the
pump laser onto the microcavity resonance, the transfer of pump noise is
significantly reduced. Our analysis is both supported and extended through
numerical simulations of the SBS laser.

Unlike traditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line
measurements or training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive
the transitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in
situ measurements. It utilizes a deterministic mechanics framework, but the
stochastic nature of the solution arises naturally from the underlying
assumptions regarding the order of the conservation potential as well as the
number of dimensions involved. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting
onset of instabilities. Since the need for off-line testing (or training) is
obviated, it can be easily implemented for systems where such a priori testing
is difficult or even impossible to conduct. The prognosis capability is
demonstrated here via a balloon burst experiment where the instability is
predicted utilizing only on-line visual observations. The DDP scheme never
failed to predict the incipient failure, and no false positives were issued.
The DDP algorithm is applicable to others types of datasets. Time horizons of
DDP predictions can be adjusted by using memory over different time windows.
Thus, a big dataset can be parsed in time to make a range of predictions over
varying time horizons.

different channels of forming CO WD + He WD pairs. We selected the systems
fulfilling the constraints of the old population and the birth rate from all
the CO WD + He WD pairs by constraining the component mass of the WD pairs.
  For the four channels, the stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) could have a
significant influence on the formation of the WD + WD pairs. Based on their
position on the $M_{\rm CO}$-$M_{\rm He}$ plane, the mass-transfer between the
components for most of the CO WD + He WD pairs is neither always unstable nor
always stable. We found that it is necessary that the CO WDs are less massive
than 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ and the He WDs are less massive than 0.25 $M_{\odot}$ if
CO WD + He WD pairs fulfill the constraints from both the old population and
the birth rate of CRTs. However, the He WD mass is lower than, while the total
mass of the low-mass WD pairs is larger than{\bf ,} the ejecta mass of the CRTs

helium detonation on a low-mass CO WD may lead to the second detonation in the

  S^L (P(b),h)=\sum_{y}\int_{P(b)\cap (y+L)} h(x) \mathrm dx, $$ where we
integrate over the intersections of $P(b)$ with the subspaces parallel to a
fixed rational subspace $L$ through all lattice points, and sum the integrals.
The purely discrete sum is of course a particular case ($L=0$), so $S^0(P(b),
1)$ counts the integer points in the parametric polytopes.
  The chambers are the open conical subsets of $R^N$ such that the shape of
$P(b)$ does not change when $b$ runs over a chamber. We first prove that on
every chamber of $R^N$, $S^L (P(b),h)$ is given by a quasi-polynomial function
of $b\in R^N$. A key point of our paper is an analysis of the interplay between
two notions of degree on quasi-polynomials: the usual polynomial degree and a
filtration, called the local degree.
  Then, for a fixed $k\leq d$, we consider a particular linear combination of
such intermediate weighted sums, which was introduced by Barvinok in order to
compute efficiently the $k+1$ highest coefficients of the Ehrhart
quasi-polynomial which gives the number of points of a dilated rational
polytope. Thus, for each chamber, we obtain a quasi-polynomial function of $b$,
which we call Barvinok's patched quasi-polynomial (at codimension level $k$).
  Finally, for each chamber, we introduce a new quasi-polynomial function of
$b$, the cone-by-cone patched quasi-polynomial (at codimension level $k$),
defined in a refined way by linear combinations of intermediate generating
functions for the cones at vertices of $P(b)$.
  We prove that both patched quasi-polynomials agree with the discrete weighted
sum $b\mapsto S^0(P(b),h)$ in the terms corresponding to the $k+1$ highest
polynomial degrees.

the objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate through inter-cell
interference coordination (ICIC). The blanking method is used to mitigate the
inter-cell interference, where a resource is either used with a predetermined
transmit power or not used at all, i.e., blanked. This problem is known to be
strongly NP-hard, which means that it is not only hard to solve in polynomial
time, but it is also hard to find an approximation algorithm with guaranteed
optimality gap. In this work, we identify special scenarios where a
polynomial-time algorithm can be constructed to solve this problem with
theoretical guarantees. In particular, we define a dominant interference
environment, in which for each user the received power from each interferer is
significantly greater than the aggregate received power from all other weaker
interferers.
  We show that the strongly NP-hard problem can be tightly relaxed to a linear
programming problem in a dominant interference environment. Consequently, we
propose a polynomial-time distributed algorithm that is based on the
primal-decomposition, the projected-subgradient, and the network flow
optimization methods. In comparison with baseline schemes, simulation results
show that the proposed scheme achieves higher gains in aggregate throughput,
cell-edge throughput, and outage probability.

such that on the first interation a vertex $v \in V(G)$ explodes to arc
(directed edges) to all vertices $u \in V(G)$ for which the edge $vu \notin
E(G)$, to obtain the mixed graph $G'_1.$ Now $G'_1$ is considered on the second

motion pair HD 134439 and HD 134440 has been variously attributed to chemical
evolution in an extragalactic environment with an irregular star formation
history, planetessimal accretion, and formation in an environment with an
unusually high dust-to-gas ratio. We explore these various putative origins
using CNO, Be, Ag, and Eu abundances derived from high-resolution near-UV
Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. While we confirm a previously suggested correlation
between elemental abundance ratios and condensation temperature at the 95%
confidence level, these ratios lie within the continuum of values manifested by
extant dSph data. We argue that the most plausible origin of our stars'
distinctive abundance distribution relative to the Galactic halo field is
formation in an environment chemically dominated by products of Type II SN of
low progenitor mass; such a progenitor mass bias has been previously suggested
as an explanation of low alpha-element ratios of dSph stars. The proper motion
pair's heavy-to-light $n$-capture element ratio, which is > 0.3-0.5 dex lower
than in the Galactic halo field and dSph stars, is discussed in the context of
the truncated r-process, phenomenlogical n-capture production models, and
alpha-rich freezeout in a high neutron excess environment; the latter
simultaneously provides an attractive explanation of the difference in
[Ca,Ti/O,Mg,Si] ratio in HD 134439/134440 compared to in situ dSph stars.

axes ($a \sim$ 30--1000AU) have been detected by direct imaging. We have
investigated orbital evolution in a formation scenario for such planets, based
on core accretion model: i) Icy cores accrete from planetesimals at $\lesssim$
30AU, ii) they are scattered outward by an emerging nearby gas giant to acquire
highly eccentric orbits, and iii) their orbits are circularized through
accretion of disk gas in outer regions, where they spend most of time. We
analytically derived equations to describe the orbital circularization through
the gas accretion. Numerical integrations of these equations show that the
eccentricity decreases by a factor of more than 5 during the planetary mass
increases by a factor of 10. Because runaway gas accretion increases planetary
mass by $\sim$ 10--300, the orbits are sufficiently circularized. On the other
hand, $a$ is reduced at most only by a factor of 2, leaving the planets in
outer regions. If the relative velocity damping by shock is considered, the
circularization is slowed down, but still efficient enough. Therefore, this
scenario potentially accounts for the formation of observed distant jupiters in
nearly circular orbits. If the apocenter distances of the scattered cores are
larger than the disk sizes, their $a$ shrink to a quarter of the disk sizes;
the $a$-distribution of distant giants could reflect outer edges of the disks
in a similar way that those of hot jupiters may reflect inner edges.

dynamically acquires user channels to avoid choking the system with CSI
overhead. The genie-aided optimization problem (GAP) is first formulated to
maximize the Lyapunov-drift every scheduling step, incorporating user queue
information and taking channel fluctuations into consideration. The scheduling
scheme based on GAP, namely the GAP-rule, is proved to be throughput-optimal
but practically infeasible, and thus serves as a performance bound. In view of
the implementation overhead and delay unfairness of the GAP-rule, the T-frame
dynamic channel acquisition scheme and the power-law DCA scheme are further
proposed to mitigate the implementation overhead and delay unfairness,
respectively. Both schemes are based on the GAP-rule and proved
throughput-optimal. To make the schemes practically feasible, we then propose
the heuristic schemes, queue-based quantized-block-length user scheduling
scheme (QQS), T-frame QQS, and power-law QQS, which are the practical versions
of the aforementioned GAP-based schemes, respectively. The QQS-based schemes
substantially decrease the complexity, and also perform fairly close to the

single-particle excitations but show normal metallic behaviors in thermodynamic

Hubbard model with pair-hopping term. However, it is difficult to solve this
model in higher dimension, here we focus on its one-dimension version, in which
a powerful U(1) abelian bosonization technique is available to capture
\textit{analytically} its universal low-energy physics. It is found that the
one-dimensional system is unable to provide an appropriate precursor for the
desirable orthogonal metals in higher dimension and the occurrence of the
featureless orthogonal metallic phase needs \textit{at least} a
quasi-one-dimensional multi-leg ladder model. Nevertheless, two interesting
quantum liquid phases are identified for the present one-dimensional model,
namely, pair-density wave (PDW) state and pair-superconducting (PSC) state. The
former describes the charge-density-wave order of cooper pairs while the latter
shows the superfluidity of two cooper pairs. Needing not any explicit
calculation, these two phases could have further implications in the
two-dimensional case, namely, the PDW state may give rise to quantum electron
liquid crystal states, which is believed to be responsible for the complex
pseudogap phase in cuprate, and the PSC state with charge 4e can be related to
certain nematic superconducting state. These predications call for further
investigation on this model in higher dimension by available analytical methods

the better strategy. An additional aspect of this paper is the amount of
uninsured losses which have to be convered by society. In the situation of
networks of agents, in our setting diversification is never detrimental
concerning the amount of uninsured losses. If the Pareto-tailed claims have
finite mean, diversification turns out to be never detrimental, both for

because of their non-linear but highly interpretable model representations. One
of the key challenges in their use is non-convexity in simultaneous
optimization of regions and region-specific models. This paper proposes novel
convex region-specific linear models, which we refer to as partition-wise
linear models. Our key ideas are 1) assigning linear models not to regions but
to partitions (region-specifiers) and representing region-specific linear
models by linear combinations of partition-specific models, and 2) optimizing
regions via partition selection from a large number of given partition
candidates by means of convex structured regularizations. In addition to
providing initialization-free globally-optimal solutions, our convex
formulation makes it possible to derive a generalization bound and to use such
advanced optimization techniques as proximal methods and decomposition of the
proximal maps for sparsity-inducing regularizations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our partition-wise linear models perform better than or are at
least competitive with state-of-the-art region-specific or locally linear
models.

open system, with a spatio-temporally localized coupling to a finite bosonic
environment. The single atom, initially prepared in a coherent state of low
energy, oscillates in a one-dimensional harmonic trap and thereby periodically
penetrates an interacting ensemble of $N_A$ bosons, held in a displaced trap.
We show that the inter-species energy transfer accelerates with increasing
$N_A$ and becomes less complete at the same time. System-environment
correlations prove to be significant except for times when the excess energy
distribution among the subsystems is highly imbalanced. These correlations
result in incoherent energy transfer processes, which accelerate the early
energy donation of the single atom and stochastically favour certain energy
transfer channels depending on the instantaneous direction of transfer.
Concerning the subsystem states, the energy transfer is mediated by
non-coherent states of the single atom and manifests itself in singlet and
doublet excitations in the finite bosonic environment. These comprehensive
insights into the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of an open system are gained
by ab-initio simulations of the total system with the recently developed
Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree Method for Bosons.

black holes and neutron stars. The LOFT scientific payload is composed of a
Large Area Detector (LAD) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM). The LAD is a 10
m^2-class pointed instrument with about 15 times the collecting area of the
largest past timing missions (as the Rossi XTE) over the 2-30 keV range (30-80
keV expanded), combined with CCD-class spectral resolution, which holds the
capability to revolutionise studies of X-ray variability down to the
millisecond time scales. Its ground-breaking characteristic is a mass per unit
surface in the range of 10 kg/m^2, enabling an effective area of about 10 m^2

experiment, with low mass and power per unit area, is now made possible by the
recent advancements in the field of large-area silicon drift detectors and

gauging away a number of superfluous fields. On the other hand, a different
gauge fixing reduces our formulation to the SU(2) superspace of

how to reproduce practically all off-shell constructions derived so far,

fluids are well-observed and well-studied from the experimental, the
theoretical, and the numerical perspective. From the mathematical point of
view, these waves are exact solutions of the 2D Euler equations for
incompressible, inviscid fluids. Contrasting with a rich theory for their
existence and the development of methods for computing these waves, their
stability analysis has hardly received attention at a rigorous mathematical
level.
  This paper proposes a new approach to the investigation of stability of
internal solitary waves in a continuously stratified fluidic medium and carries
out the following four steps of this approach: (I) to formulate the eigenvalue
problem as an infinite-dimensional spatial-dynamical system, (II) to introduce
finite-dimensional truncations of the spatial-dynamics description, (III) to
demonstrate that each truncation, of any order, permits a well-defined Evans
function, (IV) to prove absence of small zeros of the Evans function in the
small-amplitude limit. The latter notably implies the low-frequency spectral
stability of small-amplitude internal solitary waves to arbitrarily high
truncation order.

investigated using both an event-by-event (3+1)-D ideal hydrodynamical model

gradual rotation in flow angles between the forward and backward direction and
additional fluctuations on top of the twist. Within the AMPT model,

two-dimensional nulls, are important sites for magnetic reconnection. Magnetic
reconnection occurs in strong current layers which have very short length
scales. The aim of this work is to explore the nature of current layers around
separators. A separator is a special field line which lies along the
intersection of two separatrix surfaces and forms the boundary between four
topologically distinct flux domains. In particular, here the current layer
about a separator that joins two 3D nulls and lies along the intersection of
their separatrix surfaces is investigated. A magnetic configuration containing
a single separator embedded in a uniform plasma with a uniform electric current
parallel to the separator is considered. This initial magnetic setup, which is
not in equilibrium, relaxes in a non-resistive manner to form an equilibrium.
The relaxation is achieved using the 3D MHD code, Lare3d, with resistivity set
to zero. A series of experiments with varying initial current are run to
investigate the characteristics of the resulting current layers present in the
final (quasi-) equilibrium states. In each experiment, the separator collapses
and a current layer forms along it. The dimensions and strength of the current
layer increase with initial current. It is found that separator current layers
formed from current parallel to the separator are twisted. Also the collapse of
the separator is a process that evolves like an infinite-time singularity where
the length, width and peak current in the layer grow slowly whilst the depth of
the current layer decreases.

colloids for both low and high contact energy values. As a precursor for
crystal formation, we observe increased local order at the position where the
crystal will form, but no correlations with the local density. Thus, the
nucleation is driven by order fluctuations rather than density fluctuations.
Our results also show that the transition involves two stages in both cases,
first a transition liquid-bcc, followed by a bcc-hcp/fcc transition. Both
transitions have to overcome free energy barriers, so that a spherical bcc-like
cluster is formed first, in which the final fcc-like structure is nucleated
mainly at the surface of the crystallite. This means that the bcc-fcc phase
transition is a heterogeneous nucleation, even though we start from a
homogeneous bulk liquid. The height of the bcc-hcp/fcc free energy barrier
strongly depends on the contact energies of the colloids. For low contact
energy this barrier is low, so that the bcc-hcp/fcc transition happens
spontaneously. For the higher contact energy, the second barrier is too high to

May 2011 suggest the following updated scenario for eruptive flare, CME and
shock wave evolution. An initial destabilization of a filament results in
stretching out of magnetic threads belonging to its body and rooted in the
photosphere along the inversion line. Their reconnection leads to i) heating of
parts of the filament or its environment, ii) initial development of the flare
arcade cusp and ribbons, and iii) increasing similarity of the filament to a
curved flux rope and its acceleration. Then the pre-eruption arcade enveloping
the filament gets involved in reconnection according to the standard model and
continues to form the flare arcade and ribbons. The poloidal magnetic flux in
the curved rope developing from the filament progressively increases and forces
its toroidal expansion. This flux rope impulsively expands and produces an MHD
disturbance, which rapidly steepens into a shock. The shock passes through the
arcade expanding above the filament and then freely propagates ahead of the CME
like a decelerating blast wave for some time. If the CME is slow, then the
shock eventually decays. Otherwise, the frontal part of the shock changes into
the bow-shock regime. This was observed for the first time in the 24 February
2011 event. When reconnection ceases, the flux rope relaxes and constitutes the
CME core-cavity system. The expanding arcade develops into the CME frontal
structure. We also found that reconnection in the current sheet of a remote
streamer forced by the shock's passage results in a running flare-like process
within the streamer responsible for a type II burst. The development of dimming
and various associated phenomena are discussed.

the contribution from clusters to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino

using a phenomenological luminosity-mass relation applied to all clusters, as
well as a detailed semi-analytical model. Additionally, we consider
observationally-motivated values for the cluster magnetic field. This is a
crucial parameter since the observed radio counts due to synchrotron emission
by secondary electrons need to be respected. For a choice of parameters
respecting all current constraints, and assuming a spectral index of -2, we
find that hadronic interactions in clusters contribute by less than 10% to the
extragalactic gamma-ray background observed by Fermi and to the IceCube flux.
They account for less than 1% for spectral indices <=-2. The neutrino flux
observed by IceCube can be reproduced without violating constraints only if a
very hard (and speculative) spectral index >-2 is adopted. However, this
scenario is in tension with the IceCube data, which seem to suggest a spectral
energy distribution of the neutrino flux that decreases with energy. In the
case of proton-photon interactions, we find that very likely protons do not
reach sufficiently high energies to produce neutrinos in clusters. We argue
that our results are optimistic due to our assumptions, and that clusters of
galaxies cannot give any relevant contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray
and neutrino backgrounds. Finally, we find that the cluster contribution to the
angular fluctuations in the gamma-ray background is subdominant, less than 10%.

both methods provide the equivalent orbital period, eccentricity and argument

compatible with a third body in the system, a low mass M dwarf in an 861-d

indicating that the FM signal is a consequence of the intrinsic change in
pulsation frequency, thus providing a cautionary tale. Our analysis shows the

determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation
where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known,
but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many

performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher
successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first
estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the
training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal.
By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the

indicative of an underlying interaction, but can also result from indirect
effects. Inverse Ising inference is a method to distinguish one from the other.
Essentially, the parameters of the least constrained statistical model are
learned from the observed correlations such that direct interactions can be
separated from indirect correlations. Among many other applications, this
approach has been helpful for protein structure prediction, because residues
which interact in the 3D structure often show correlated substitutions in a
multiple sequence alignment. In this context, samples used for inference are
not independent but share an evolutionary history on a phylogenetic tree. Here,
we discuss the effects of correlations between samples on global inference.
Such correlations could arise due to phylogeny but also via other slow
dynamical processes. We present a simple analytical model to address the
resulting inference biases, and develop an exact method accounting for
background correlations in alignment data by combining phylogenetic modeling
with an adaptive cluster expansion algorithm. We find that popular reweighting
schemes are only marginally effective at removing phylogenetic bias, suggest a
rescaling strategy that yields better results, and provide evidence that our
conclusions carry over to the frequently used mean-field approach to the
inverse Ising problem.

in order to access the non-perturbative regime. I devise an approximation that
respects Galilei invariance and is designed to resolve the frequency and
momentum dependence of low order correlation functions. I establish a set of RG
fixed point equations for inverse propagators with an arbitrary frequency and
momentum dependence. In all spatial dimensions they yield a continuum of fixed
points as well as an isolated one. These results are fully compatible with the
existing literature for $d=1$. For $d\neq1$ however results of the literature
focus almost exclusively on irrotational solutions while the solutions that my

Navier-Stokes turbulence.
  Non-equilibrium steady states of ultra-cold Bose gases coupled to external
baths of energy and particles such as exciton-polariton condensates are related

obtain in this context applies as well to far-from-equilibrium quasi-stationary
states (non-thermal fixed points) of the closed system described by the GPE. I
translate results found in the KPZ literature to their corresponding dual in
the ultra-cold Bose gas set-up. I find that this provides a new scaling
relation which can be used to analytically identify the classical Kolmogorov
-5/3 exponent and its anomalous correction. Moreover I estimate the anomalous
correction to the scaling exponent of the compressible part of the kinetic
energy spectrum of the Bose gas which is confirmed by numerical simulations of

quasiparticles gives rise to a divergent golden rule rate. We calculate qubit

quasiparticles leads to a dephasing $\sim \exp(-x(t))$ where $x(t)$ is not
linear in time on short time scales while it tends towards a selfconsistent

parameters of the stellar models. Key parameters are the mixing processes, the
metallicity, the mass-loss rate and the effect of a close companion. We study
how the red supergiant lifetimes, the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram
(HRD), the positions in this diagram of the pre-supernova progenitor as well as
the structure of the stars at that time change for various mass-loss rates
during the red supergiant phase (RSG), and for two different initial rotation
velocities. The surface abundances of RSGs are much more sensitive to rotation
than to the mass-loss rates during that phase. A change of the RSG mass-loss
rate has a strong impact on the RSG lifetimes and therefore on the luminosity
function of RSGs. At solar metallicity, the enhanced mass-loss rate models do
produce significant changes on the populations of blue, yellow and red
supergiants. When extended blue loops or blue ward excursions are produced by
enhanced mass-loss, the models predict that a majority of blue (yellow)
supergiants are post RSG objects. These post RSG stars are predicted to show
much smaller surface rotational velocities than similar blue supergiants on
their first crossing of the HR gap. The position in the HRD of the end point of
the evolution depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope. More precisely,
whenever, at the pre-supernova stage, the H-rich envelope contains more than
about 5\% of the initial mass, the star is a red supergiant, and whenever the
H-rich envelope contains less than 1\% of the total mass the star is a blue
supergiant. For intermediate situations, intermediate colors/effective
temperatures are obtained. Yellow progenitors for core collapse supernovae can
be explained by the enhanced mass-loss rate models, while the red progenitors

  To gain insights into the nature of the optimal solution and to construct
low-complexity schemes to characterize the optimal rate for general wireless

amenable for analysis, yet general enough to capture essential characteristics
of general wireless relay networks, and (2) schemes to approximate the

non-isomorphism results in the other cases. We show the perhaps surprising

of the Marfan Syndrome (MS), a genetic defect leading to the degeneration of
the elastic fibres. Dilation affects the structure of the flow and, in turn,
altered flow may play a role in vessel dilation, generation of aneurysms, and
dissection. The aim of the present work is the investigation in-vitro of the
fluid dynamic modifications occurring as a consequence of the morphological
changes typically induced in the aortic root by MS. A mock-loop reproducing the
left ventricle outflow tract and the aortic root was used to measure time
resolved velocity maps on a longitudinal symmetry plane of the aortic root. Two
dilated model aortas, designed to resemble morphological characteristics
typically observed in MS patients, have been compared to a reference, healthy
geometry. The aortic model was designed to quantitatively reproduce the change
of aortic distensibility caused by MS. Results demonstrate that vorticity
released from the valve leaflets, and possibly accumulating in the root, plays
a fundamental role in redirecting the systolic jet issued from the aortic
valve. The altered systolic flow also determines a different residual flow
during the diastole.

has surface magnetic field $ B_{NS} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{13 } \, {\rm G}$ and
experiences accretion rate of $9 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot {\rm \, yr}^{-1} $. The
magnetospheric radius, close to the corotation radius, is $\sim 2 \times 10^8$
cm. The accretion torque on the neutron star is reduce well below what is
expected in a simple magnetospheric accretion due to effective penetration of
the stellar magnetic field into the disk beyond the corotation radius. As a
result, the radiative force of the surface emission does not lead to strong
coronal wind, but pushes plasma along magnetic field lines towards the
equatorial disk. The neutron star is nearly an orthogonal rotator, with the
angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment $\geq 80$ degrees.
Accretion occurs through optically thick -- geometrically thin and flat
accretion ""curtain"", which cuts across the polar cap. High radiation pressure
from the neutron star surface is nevertheless smaller than that the ram
pressure of the accreting material flowing through the curtain, and thus fails
to stop the accretion. At distances below few stellar radii the magnetic
suppression of the scattering cross-section becomes important. The $X$-ray
luminosity (pulsed and persistent components) comes both from the neutron star
surface as a hard $X$-ray component and as a soft component from reprocessing
by the accretion disk.

simulations made with a 2.5D, cylindrical and axisymmetric set-up and computed
with the PLUTO code were used to find torque formulations for each topology. We
further succeed to give a unique law that fits the data for every topology by
formulating the torque in terms of the amount of open magnetic flux in the
wind. We also show that our formulation can be applied to even more realistic
magnetic topologies, with examples of the Sun in its minimum and maximum phase
as observed at the Wilcox Solar Observatory, and of a young K-star (TYC-0486-

composition), intermediate mass donor star together with a neutron star. We
consider models including irradiation feedback and evaporation. These
non-standard ingredients deeply modify the mass transfer stages of these
binaries. While models that neglect irradiation feedback undergo continuous,
long standing mass transfer episodes, models including these effect suffer a
number cycles of mass transfer and detachment. During mass transfer the systems
should reveal themselves as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), whereas when
detached they behave as a binary radio pulsars. We show that at these stages
irradiated models are in a Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) state or in a quasi-RLOF
state. Quasi-RLOF stars have a radius slightly smaller than its Roche lobe.
Remarkably, these conditions are attained for orbital period and donor mass
values in the range corresponding to a family of binary radio pulsars known as
""redbacks"". Thus, redback companions should be quasi-RLOF stars. We show that
the characteristics of the redback system PSR J1723-2837 are accounted for by
these models.
  In each mass transfer cycle these systems should switch from LMXB to binary
radio pulsar states with a timescale of \sim million years. However, there is
recent and fast growing evidence of systems switching on far shorter, human
timescales. This should be related to instabilities in the accretion disc
surrounding the neutron star and/or radio ejection, still to be included in the
model having the quasi-RLOF state as a general condition.

differential equations. Changes in expression of a gene propagate to other
genes along paths in the network. At a stable state, the system's Jacobian
matrix confers information about network connectivity. To disclose the
functional properties of genes, knowledge of network connections is essential.
We present a new method to reconstruct the Jacobian matrix of models for gene
regulatory systems from equilibrium protein concentrations. In a recent paper
we defined propagation and feedback functions describing how genetic variation
at one gene propagates to the other genes in the network and possibly also back
to itself. Here we show how propagation and feedback functions provide
relations between equilibrium protein levels which are in principle observable,
and Jacobi elements which are not directly observable. We establish exact
formulae expressing the Jacobian in terms of derivatives of propagation and
feedback functions. Approximating these derivatives from perturbed and
unperturbed protein levels, we derive formulae for estimating the Jacobian. We
apply the method to models of the Drosophila segment polarity network and
randomly generated gene networks. Genes could be perturbed in two ways: by
modifying mRNA degradation rates, or by allele knockout in diploid models.
Comparison with the true Jacobians shows that for noiseless data we obtain hit
rates close to 100% in the former case and in the range 80-90% in the latter.
Our method adds to the network interference toolbox and provides a sign
estimate of the Jacobian from steady state data, and a value estimate of the
Jacobian if protein degradation rates are known. Also the approach identifies
some predicted connections as much more reliable than others, and could point
to further experiments for resolving uncertainties in the less dependable
Jacobian elements.

Lx-Tx, M-Lx and M-Tx scaling relations and include corrections for
observational biases. By providing fully bias corrected relations, we give the
current limitations for Lx and Tx as cluster mass proxies. We demonstrate that
Tx benefits from a significantly lower intrinsic scatter at fixed mass than Lx.
By studying the residuals of the bias corrected relations, we show for the
first time using weak lensing masses that galaxy groups seem more luminous and
warmer for their mass than clusters. This implies a steepening of the M-Lx and
M-Tx relations at low masses. We verify the inferred steepening using a
different high mass sample from the literature and show that variance between
samples is the dominant effect leading to discrepant scaling relations. We
divide our sample into subsamples of merging and relaxed systems, and find that
mergers may have enhanced scatter in lensing measurements, most likely due to
stronger triaxiality and more substructure. For the Lx-Tx relation, which is
unaffected by lensing measurements, we find the opposite trend in scatter. We
also explore the effects of X-ray cross-calibration and find that Chandra
calibration leads to flatter Lx-Tx and M-Tx relations than XMM-Newton.

the impact of reduced dimensionality in the crossover from bulk-like to

ultrathin NiFe2O4 films on Nb-SrTiO3 (001) substrates that co-occurs with a
reduced out-of-plane lattice constant under compressive in-plane epitaxial
strain. We found a bulk-like cationic coordination of the inverse spinel
lattice independent of the NiFe2O4 film thickness -- thus ruling out a cationic
inversion that nominally could account for an enhanced $M_S$. Our study instead
uncovers a reduction of the unit cell volume, i.e. an auxetic behavior in
ultrathin NiFe2O4 films, which may result in an enhanced magnetic exchange
caused by an increased interatomic electronic localization.

risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) and almost 50% display symptoms 10
to 20 years post injury. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often
does not protect against knee OA development. Accordingly, a multiscale
formulation for Data Driven Prognosis (DDP) of post ACLR is developed. Unlike
traditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line measurements
or training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive the
transitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in situ
measurements. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting onset of
instabilities. Since the need for off line testing (or training) is obviated,
it can be easily implemented for ACLR, where such controlled a priori testing
is almost impossible to conduct. The DDP algorithm facilitates hierarchical
handling of the large data set, and can assess the state of recovery in post
ACLR conditions based on data collected from stair ascent and descent exercises
of subjects. The DDP algorithm identifies inefficient knee varus motion and
knee rotation as primary difficulties experienced by some of the post ACLR
population. In such cases, levels of energy dissipation rate at the knee, and
its fluctuation may be used as measures for assessing progress after ACL
reconstruction.

energy. The very weak neutrino-matter interactions is explained by zero tending
contraction parameter, which depend on neutrino energy. The second consistent
rescaling corresponds to the higher energy limit of the Electroweak Model. At

adequacy risk assessment, due to the need to include variable generation
renewables within such calculations. This paper will describe new statistical
approaches to estimating the joint distribution of demand and available VG
capacity; this is required for the LOLE calculations used in many statutory
adequacy studies, for example those of GB and PJM. The most popular estimation
technique in the VG-integration literature is `hindcast', in which the historic
joint distribution of demand and available VG is used as a predictive
distribution. Through the use of bootstrap statistical analysis, this paper
will show that due to extreme sparsity of data on times of high demand and low
VG, hindcast results can suffer from sampling uncertainty to the extent that
they have little practical meaning. An alternative estimation approach, in
which a marginal distribution of available VG is rescaled according to demand
level, is thus proposed. This reduces sampling uncertainty at the expense of
the additional model structure assumption, and further provides a means of
assessing the sensitivity of model outputs to the VG-demand relationship by
varying the function of demand by which the marginal VG distribution is
rescaled.
