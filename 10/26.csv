successfully integrate complex systems. Project-based learning is used to help
students build professional skills. However, it is typically applied to small
teams and small efforts. This paper describes an experience in engaging a large
number of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary
research effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in
Computer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical
Engineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping),
and Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a
student project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires
interaction with at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long
projects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school,
undergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical
Engineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate
student learning are real-world system development constraints, regular
cross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student
mentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches, a survey was
conducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approaches. For example, 70% of the students surveyed
indicated that working on their research project improved their ability to
function on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships, or any
other activity.

trace distance criterion. The widespread misinterpretation of the criterion as
failure probability and also its actual scope have been discussed previously.
Recently its distinguishability advantage interpretation is re-emphasized as an
operational guarantee, and the failure probability misinterpretation is
maintained with a further failure probability per bit interpretation. In this
paper we explain the basic perpetuating error as a confusion on the
correspondence between mathematics and reality. We note that the assignment of
equal a priori probability of 1/2 to the real and ideal situations for
distinguishability advantage would not lead to operational guarantee. We
explain why operational guarantee in terms of Eve's probabilities of getting
various key bits is necessary for security, and why the failure probability
interpretation misrepresents the security situation. The scope and limits of
the trace distance guarantee are summarized. It is shown that there would have
been no security problem to begin with if the failure probability per bit
interpretation validity.

whose characteristics are very diverse. This makes difficult a cost-effective
procedure for monitoring, fault detection, performance analyses, operation and
maintenance. As a result, many problems affecting BIPV systems go undetected.
In order to carry out effective automatic fault detection procedures, we need a
performance indicator that is reliable and that can be applied on many PV
systems at a very low cost. The existing approaches for analyzing the
performance of PV systems are often based on the Performance Ratio (PR), whose
accuracy depends on good solar irradiation data, which in turn can be very
difficult to obtain or cost-prohibitive for the BIPV owner. We present an
alternative fault detection procedure based on a performance indicator that can
be constructed on the sole basis of the energy production data measured at the
BIPV systems. This procedure does not require the input of operating conditions
data, such as solar irradiation, air temperature, or wind speed. The
performance indicator, called Performance to Peers (P2P), is constructed from
spatial and temporal correlations between the energy output of neighboring and
similar PV systems. This method was developed from the analysis of the energy
production data of approximately 10,000 BIPV systems located in Europe. The
results of our procedure are illustrated on the hourly, daily and monthly data
monitored during one year at one BIPV system located in the South of Belgium.
Our results confirm that it is possible to carry out automatic fault detection
procedures without solar irradiation data. P2P proves to be more stable than PR
most of the time, and thus constitutes a more reliable performance indicator
for fault detection procedures.

and MODIS instruments on polar-orbiting satellites produce detection squares in

cloud cover, false negatives are common, and the detection squares are much
coarser than the resolution of a fire behavior model. Consequently, current
active fire satellite detection products should be used to improve fire
modeling in a statistical sense only, rather than as a direct input. We
describe a new data assimilation method for active fire detection, based on a
modification of the fire arrival time to simultaneously minimize the difference
from the forecast fire arrival time and maximize the likelihood of the fire
detection data. This method is inspired by contour detection methods used in
computer vision, and it can be cast as a Bayesian inverse problem technique, or
a generalized Tikhonov regularization. After the new fire arrival time on the
whole simulation domain is found, the model can be re-run from a time in the
past using the new fire arrival time to generate the heat fluxes and to spin up
the atmospheric model until the satellite overpass time, when the coupled
simulation continues from the modified state.

It provides non-Gaussian information of large scale structures, complementary
to second order statistics. We propose a new flexible method to predict weak
lensing peak counts, which can be adapted to realistic scenarios, such as a
real source distribution, intrinsic galaxy alignment, mask effects, photo-$z$
errors from surveys, etc. The new model is also suitable for applying the
tomography technique and non-linear filters. A probabilistic approach to model
peak counts is presented. First, we sample halos from a mass function. Second,
we assign them NFW profiles. Third, we place those halos randomly on the field
of view. The creation of these ""fast simulations"" requires much less computing
time compared to $N$-body runs. Then, we perform ray-tracing through these fast
simulation boxes and select peaks from weak-lensing maps to predict peak number
counts. The computation is achieved by our \textsc{Camelus} algorithm, which we
make available at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/camelus/ . We compare our
results to $N$-body simulations to validate our model. We find that our
approach is in good agreement with full $N$-body runs. We show that the lensing
signal dominates shape noise and Poisson noise for peaks with SNR between 4 and
6. Also, counts from the same SNR range are sensitive to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$
and $\sigma_8$. We show how our model can discriminate between various
combinations of those two parameters. In summary, we offer a powerful tool to
study weak lensing peaks. The potential of our forward model is its high
flexibility, making the use of peak counts under realistic survey conditions
feasible.

in multi-agent systems. The algorithm under study consists of two steps: a
local stochastic approximation step and a diffusion step which drives the
network to a consensus. The diffusion step uses row-stochastic matrices to
weight the network exchanges. As opposed to previous works, exchange matrices
are not supposed to be doubly stochastic, and may also depend on the past
estimate.
  We prove that non-doubly stochastic matrices generally influence the limit
points of the algorithm. Nevertheless, the limit points are not affected by the
choice of the matrices provided that the latter are doubly-stochastic in
expectation. This conclusion legitimates the use of broadcast-like diffusion
protocols, which are easier to implement. Next, by means of a central limit
theorem, we prove that doubly stochastic protocols perform asymptotically as
well as centralized algorithms and we quantify the degradation caused by the
use of non doubly stochastic matrices. Throughout the paper, a special emphasis
is put on the special case of distributed non-convex optimization as an
illustration of our results.

statistics of both blue-shifted absorption (i.e. mass outflows) and red-shifted
absorption features (i.e. mass infall or accretion). Our results suggest that,
in general, Herbig Be (HBe) stars do not accrete material from their inner
disks in the same manner as CTTSs, which are believed to accrete material via
magnetospheric accretion, while Herbig Ae (HAe) stars generally show evidence
for magnetospheric accretion. We find no evidence in our sample of narrow
blue--shifted absorption features which are typical indicators of inner disk
winds and are common in He I 10830 profiles of CTTSs. The lack of inner disk
wind signatures in HAEBES, combined with the paucity of detected magnetic
fields on these objects, suggests that accretion through large magnetospheres
which truncate the disk several stellar radii above the surface is not as
common for HAe and late-type HBe stars as it is for CTTSs. Instead, evidence is
found for smaller magnetospheres in the maximum red-shifted absorption
velocities in our HAEBE sample. These velocities are, on average, a smaller
fraction of the system escape velocity than is found for CTTSs, suggesting
accretion is taking place closer to the star. Smaller magnetospheres, and
evidence for boundary layer accretion in HBe stars, may explain the less common
occurrence of red--shifted absorption in HAEBES. Evidence is found that smaller
magnetospheres may be less efficient at driving outflows compared to CTTS
magnetospheres.

{\em Distance-based} utility, which is a decreasing function of the distance

present the first highly scalable algorithms for both problems, providing
statistical guarantees on approximation quality and near-linear worst-case
bounds on the computation. We perform an experimental evaluation which

stationary state where certain intensive thermodynamic variable, like
equilibrium chemical potential, equalizes following zeroth law of

the zeroth law would hold, provided both systems have short-ranged spatial

are drawn from admixtures of distributions over words, known as topics. The
inference problem of recovering topics from admixtures, is NP-hard. Assuming
separability, a strong assumption, [4] gave the first provable algorithm for
inference. For LDA model, [6] gave a provable algorithm using tensor-methods.
But [4,6] do not learn topic vectors with bounded $l_1$ error (a natural
measure for probability vectors). Our aim is to develop a model which makes
intuitive and empirically supported assumptions and to design an algorithm with
natural, simple components such as SVD, which provably solves the inference
problem for the model with bounded $l_1$ error. A topic in LDA and other models
is essentially characterized by a group of co-occurring words. Motivated by
this, we introduce topic specific Catchwords, group of words which occur with
strictly greater frequency in a topic than any other topic individually and are
required to have high frequency together rather than individually. A major
contribution of the paper is to show that under this more realistic assumption,
which is empirically verified on real corpora, a singular value decomposition
(SVD) based algorithm with a crucial pre-processing step of thresholding, can
provably recover the topics from a collection of documents drawn from Dominant
admixtures. Dominant admixtures are convex combination of distributions in
which one distribution has a significantly higher contribution than others.
Apart from the simplicity of the algorithm, the sample complexity has near
optimal dependence on $w_0$, the lowest probability that a topic is dominant,
and is better than [4]. Empirical evidence shows that on several real world
corpora, both Catchwords and Dominant admixture assumptions hold and the
proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the state of the art [5].

effect of realistic extrinsic noises acting on gene deactivation in a common

distribution of proteins and properties of the external perturbations. At
variance with standard models where the perturbations are Gaussian unbounded,
we focus here on bounded extrinsic noises to better mimic biological reality.
Our results suggest that the gene switching velocity is a key parameter to
modulate the response of the network. Simulations suggest that, if the gene
switching is fast and many proteins are present, an irreversible noise-induced
first order transition is observed as a function of the noise intensity. If
noise intensity is further increased a second order transition is also
observed. When gene switching is fast, a similar scenario is observed even when
few proteins are present, provided that larger cells are considered, which is
mainly influenced by noise autocorrelation. On the contrary, if the gene
switching is slow, no fist order transitions are observed. In the concluding
remarks possible implications of the irreversible transitions for cellular

approximation to finite chemical potential $\mu$ and discuss Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) in the case of a charged scalar field with $O(2)$ symmetry.
We show that the approximation is renormalizable by means of counterterms which
are independent of both the temperature and the chemical potential. We point
out the presence of an additional skew contribution to the propagator as
compared to the $\mu=0$ case, which comes with its own gap equation (except at
Hartree level). We solve this equation together with the field equation, and
the usual longitudinal and transversal gap equations to find that the
transition is second order, in agreement with recent lattice results to which
we compare. We also discuss a general criterion an approximation should obey
for the so-called Silver Blaze property to hold, and we show that any
$\Phi$-derivable approximation at finite temperature and density obeys this
criterion if one chooses a UV regularization that does not cut off the
Matsubara sums.

non-perturbative renormalization group (RG) studies on theory spaces involving
a large number of independent field components that are prohibitively
complicated using standard methods. Its main motivation are quantum gravity
theories in which the gravitational degrees of freedom are carried by a complex
system of tensor fields, a prime example being Einstein-Cartan theory, possibly
coupled to matter. We describe a sequence of approximation steps leading from
the functional RG equation of the Effective Average Action to the new flow
equation which, as a consequence, is no longer fully exact on the untruncated
theory space. However, it is by far more ""user friendly"" when it comes to
projecting the abstract equation on a concrete (truncated) theory space and
computing explicit beta-functions. The necessary amount of (tensor) algebra
reduces drastically, and the usually very hard problem of diagonalizing the
pertinent Hessian operator is sidestepped completely. In this paper we
demonstrate the reliability of the simplified equation by applying it to a
truncation of the Einstein-Cartan theory space. It is parametrized by a scale
dependent Holst action, depending on a O(4) spin-connection and the tetrad as
the independent field variables. We compute the resulting RG flow, focusing in
particular on the running of the Immirzi parameter, and compare it to the
results of an earlier computation where the exact equation had been applied to
the same truncation. We find consistency between the two approaches and provide
further evidence for the conjectured non-perturbative renormalizability
(asymptotic safety) of quantum Einstein-Cartan gravity. We also investigate a
duality symmetry relating small and large values of the Immirzi parameter which
is displayed by the beta-functions in absence of a cosmological constant.

Programming (ILP) approach for the NP-hard problem of computing a most
parsimonious time-consistent reconciliation of a gene tree with a species tree
when dating information on speciations is not available. The ILP formulation,
which builds upon the DTL model, returns a most parsimonious reconciliation
ranging over all possible datings of the nodes of the species tree. By studying
its performance on plausible simulated data we conclude that the ILP approach
is significantly faster than a brute force search through the space of all
possible species tree datings. Although the ILP formulation is currently
limited to small trees, we believe that it is an important proof-of-concept
which opens the door to the possibility of developing an exact, parsimony based

classical erasure/list decoder developed in earlier studies, which is based on
the competitive minimax methodology, and guarantees universal achievability of
a certain fraction of the optimum random coding error exponents. In this paper,
we derive an exact single-letter expression for the maximum achievable
fraction. Examples are given in which the maximal achievable fraction is
strictly less than unity, which imply that, in general, there is no universal
erasure/list decoder which achieves the same random coding error exponents as
the optimal decoder for a known channel. This is in contrast to the situation
in ordinary decoding (without the erasure/list option), where optimum exponents
are universally achievable, as is well known. It is also demonstrated that
previous lower bounds derived for the maximal achievable fraction are not tight
in general. We then analyze a generalized random coding ensemble which
incorporate a training sequence, in conjunction with a suboptimal practical
decoder (""plug-in"" decoder), which first estimates the channel using the known
training sequence, and then decodes the remaining symbols of the codeword using
the estimated channel. One of the implications of our results, is setting the
stage for a reasonable criterion of optimal training. Finally, we compare the
performance of the ""plug-in"" decoder and the universal decoder, in terms of the
achievable error exponents, and show that the latter is noticeably better than

solutions of the model have also been obtained with different Lifshitz scaling.
Our results imply that holographic $d$-wave superconductor is indeed a type II
one even for different Lifshitz scaling. This is the same as the conventional
$d$-wave superconductors in the Ginzburg-Landau theory.
  Our results also indicate that the dynamical exponent $z$ has no effect to
the shape of the vortex lattice even after higher order corrections (away from
the phase transition point $B_c$) are included. However, it has effects on the
upper critical magnetic field $B_{c_2}$ through the fact that a larger $z$
results in a smaller $B_{c_2}$ and therefore influences the size (characterized
by $r_0\equiv 1/\sqrt{B_{c_2}}$) of the vortex lattices. Furthermore, close
comparisons between our results and those of the Ginzburg-Landau theory reveal
the fact that the upper critical magnetic field $B_{c_2}$ is inversely
proportional to the square of the superconducting coherence length $\xi$,
regardless of the anisotropy between space and time.

Under such assumption, it is known that, for a multi-agent system with two
leaders, if the followers' interaction subgraph is undirected and connected,
then followers will converge to a convex combination of two leaders' states
with linear consensus protocol. In this paper, we introduce the conflict
between leaders: by choosing k followers to connect with, every leader attempts
all followers converge to himself closer than that of the other. By using graph
theory and matrix theory, we formulate this conflict as a standard two-player
zero-sum game and give some properties about it. It is noteworthy that the
interaction graph here is generated from the conflict between leaders.
Interestingly, we find that to find the optimal topology of the system is
equivalent to solve a Nash equilibrium. Especially for the case of choosing one
connected follower, the necessary and sufficient condition for an interaction
graph to be the optimal one is given. Moreover, if followers' interaction graph
is a circulant graph or a graph with a center node, then the system's optimal

functional data. There are growing interests in classification of dynamic or
functional data. The basic feature of functional data is that the functional
data have infinite dimensions and are highly correlated. An essential issue for
classifying dynamic and functional data is how to effectively reduce their
dimension and explore dynamic feature. However, few statistical methods for
dynamic data classification have directly used rich dynamic features of the
data. We propose to use second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to
model dynamic process and principal differential analysis to estimate constant
or time-varying parameters in the ODE. We examine differential dynamic
properties of the dynamic system across different conditions including
stability and transient-response, which determine how the dynamic systems
maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal
and external perturbations. We use the parameters in the ODE as features for
classifiers. As a proof of principle, the proposed methods are applied to
classifying normal and abnormal QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG)
data analysis, which is of great clinical values in diagnosis of cardiovascular
diseases. We show that the ODE-based classification methods in QRS complex
classification outperform the currently widely used neural networks with
Fourier expansion coefficients of the functional data as their features. We
expect that the dynamic model-based classification methods may open a new
avenue for functional data classification.

random walk on the same geometry. Since walks on homogeneous lattices satisfy
this relation trivially, our results for heterogeneous networks suggests that
such a relation holds irrespective of whether translational invariance is
maintained or not. To develop our results, we extend the renormalization group
analysis (RG) of the stochastic master equation to one with a unitary
propagator. As in the classical case, the solution $\rho(x,t)$ in space and
time of this quantum walk equation exhibits a scaling collapse for a variable
$x^{d_{w}}/t$ in the weak limit, which defines $d_{w}$ and illuminates
fundamental aspects of the walk dynamics, e.g., its mean-square displacement.
We confirm the collapse for $\rho(x,t)$ in each case with extensive numerical
simulation. The exact values for $d_{w}$ in themselves demonstrate that RG is a
powerful complementary approach to study the asymptotics of quantum walks that
weak-limit theorems have not been able to access, such as for systems lacking
translational symmetries beyond simple trees.

valence centers, nominally Cu$^{1+,2+,3+}$, we present an unified approach to
the description of the local intra-unit-cell (IUC) order parameters in

on-site quantum superpositions of the three valent states characterized by
different hole occupation, $n_h$=0,1,2, conventional spin s=1/2 for Cu$^{2+}$
and s=0 for Cu$^{1+,3+}$ centers, and different orbital symmetry:$B_{1g}$ for
the ground states of the Cu$^{2+}$ center and $A_{1g}$ for the Cu$^{1+,3+}$
centers, respectively. The latter does result in a spontaneous orbital symmetry
breaking with emergence of the IUC orbital nematic order parameter of the
$B_{1g}\propto d_{x2-y2}$ symmetry. To describe the quantum local charge order
we develop an S=1 pseudospin model. Conventional spin density $\rho_s$ for
mixed valence superpositions can vary inbetween 0 and 1 in accordance with the
weight of the Cu$^{2+}$ center in the superposition. We show that the
superconductivity and spin magnetism are nonsymbiotic phenomena with competing
order parameters. Furthermore we argue that instead of a well-isolated
Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet $^1A_{1g}$ the ground state of the hole Cu$^{3+}$
center in cuprates should be described by a complex
$^1A_{1g}$-$^{1,3}B_{2g}$-$^{1,3}E_u$ multiplet, formed by a competition of
conventional hybrid Cu 3d-O 2p $b_{1g}(\sigma)\propto d_{x^2 -y^2}$ state and

coupling between geometry and physical properties is readily seen in folded
structures from intestinal villi and pollen grains, to wrinkled membranes and
programmable metamaterials. While the well-known rules and mechanisms behind
folding a flat surface have been used to create deployable structures and shape
transformable materials, folding of curved shells is still not fundamentally
understood. Curved shells naturally deform by simultaneously bending and
stretching, and while this coupling gives them great stability for engineering
applications, it makes folding a surface of arbitrary curvature a non-trivial
task. Here we discuss the geometry of folding a creased shell, and demonstrate
theoretically the conditions under which it may fold continuously. When these
conditions are violated we show, using experiments and simulations, that shells
undergo rapid snapping motion to fold from one stable configuration to another.
Although material asymmetry is a proven mechanism for creating this bifurcation
of stability, for the case of a creased shell, the inherent geometry itself
serves as a barrier to folding. We discuss here how two fundamental geometric
concepts, creases and curvature, combine to allow rapid transitions from one
stable state to another. Independent of material system and length scale, the
design rule that we introduce here explains how to generate snapping
transitions in arbitrary surfaces, thus facilitating the creation of
programmable multi-stable materials with fast actuation capabilities.

network coding (HPNC) is proposed for two-way relay networks with correlated
sources (TWRN-CS). In the HPNC scheme, both sources first transmit the
correlated raw source messages to the relay simultaneously. The relay performs
physical-layer network coding (PNC) on the received symbols, compresses the
PNC-coded symbols using Huffman coding, and broadcasts the compressed symbols
to both source nodes. Then, each source decodes the other source's messages by
using its own messages as side information. Compression rate and block error
rate (BLER) of the proposed scheme are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate
that the HPNC scheme can effectively improve the network throughput, and
meanwhile, achieve the superior BLER performance compared with the conventional
non-compressed relaying scheme in TWRN-CS.

coefficient of the tournament $H$, for every prime tournament $H$ for which the
celebrated Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal Conjecture has been proven so far. This is the
first polynomial bound on the EH coefficient obtained for all known prime
Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal tournaments, in particular for infinitely many prime
tournaments. As a byproduct of our analysis, we answer affirmatively the
question whether there exists an infinite family of prime tournaments $H$ with
$\epsilon(H)$ lower-bounded by $\frac{1}{\textit{poly}(|H|)}$, where
$\textit{poly}$ is a polynomial function. Furthermore, we give much tighter
bounds than those known so far for the EH coefficients of tournaments without
large homogeneous sets. This enables us to significantly reduce the gap between
best known lower and upper bounds for the EH coefficients of tournaments. As a
corollary we prove that every known prime Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal tournament $H$
satisfies: $-5 + o(1) \leq \frac{\log(\epsilon(H))}{\log(|H|)} \leq -1 + o(1)$.
No lower bound on that expression was known before. We also show the
applications of those results to the tournament coloring problem. In
particular, we prove that for every known prime Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal tournament $H$
every $H$-free tournament has \textit{chromatic number} at most
$O(n^{1-\frac{C}{|H|^{5}\log(|H|)}}\log(n))$, where $C>0$ is some universal
constant. The related coloring can be constructed algorithmically in the
quasipolynomial time by following straightforwadly the proof of our main
result. In comparison, the standard Ramsey theory gives only
$O(\frac{n}{\log(n)})$ bounds for the tournament chromatic number.

In this model, two phases appear, which interact via a Coulombic energy. As in
our previous work, we focus on the regime where one of the phases has a very
small volume fraction, thus creating ""droplets"" of the minority phase in a
""sea"" of the majority phase. In this paper, we address the asymptotic behavior
of non-minimizing stationary points in dimensions $n \geq 2$ left open by the
study of the $\Gamma$-convergence of the energy established in [23]-[24], which
provides information only for almost minimizing sequences when $n=2$. In
particular, we prove that (asymptotically) stationary points satisfy a force
balance condition which implies that the minority phase distributes itself
uniformly in the background majority phase. Our proof uses and generalizes the
framework of Sandier-Serfaty [36,37], used in the context of stationary points
of the Ginzburg-Landau model, to higher dimensions. When $n=2$, using the
regularity results obtained in [25], we also are able to conclude that the
droplets in the sharp interface energy become asymptotically round when the
number of droplets is constrained to be finite and have bounded isoperimetric
deficit.

spontaneous formation of spatial structures inside electrons bunches. This
fundamental effect is actively studied as it represents one of the most
fundamental limitations in electron accelerators, and at the same time a source
of intense terahertz radiation (Coherent Synchrotron Radiation, or CSR). Here
we demonstrate the possibility to directly observe the electron bunch
microstructures with subpicosecond resolution, in a storage ring accelerator.
The principle is to monitor the terahertz pulses emitted by the structures,
using a strategy from photonics, time-stretch, consisting in slowing-down the
phenomena before recording. This opens the way to unpreceeded possibilities for
analyzing and mastering new generation high power coherent synchrotron sources.

constant $\epsilon(H)>0$ such that every graph $G$ that does not contain $H$ as
an induced subgraph contains a clique or a stable set of size at least
$|V(G)|^{\epsilon(H)}$. The Conjecture is still open. Some time ago its
directed version was formulated (see:\cite{alon}). In the directed version
graphs are replaced by tournaments, and cliques and stable sets by transitive
subtournaments. If the Conjecture is not true then the smallest counterexample
is a prime tournament. For a long time the Conjecture was known only for
finitely many prime tournaments. Recently in \cite{bcc} and \cite{choromanski2}
the Conjecture was proven for the families of galaxies and constellations that
contain infinitely many prime tournaments. In \cite{bcc} the Conjecture was
also proven for all $5$-vertex tournaments. We say that a tournament $H$ has
the $EH$-property if it satisfies the Conjecture. In this paper we introduce
the so-called \textit{strong EH-property} which enables us to prove the
Conjecture for new prime tournaments, but what is even more interesting,
provides a mechanism to combine tournaments satisfying the Conjecture to get
bigger tournaments that do so and are not necessarily nonprime. We give several
examples of families of tournaments constructed according to this procedure.
The only procedure known before used to construct bigger tournaments satisfying
the Conjecture from smaller tournaments satisfying the Conjecture was the
so-called \textit{substitution procedure} (see: \cite{alon}). However an
outcome of this procedure is always a nonprime tournament and, from what we
have said before, prime tournaments are those that play crucial role in the
research on the Conjecture. Our method may be potentially used to prove the
Conjecture for several new classes of tournaments.

the relativistic conservation law for the center of energy to give an
unambiguous definition of the ""internal momentum of a system,"" and then we
exhibit this internal momentum for the system of a magnet (modeled as a
