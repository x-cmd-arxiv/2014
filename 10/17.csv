decoding algorithms for topological quantum error correction. Due to their
versatility, they have been used to decode systems with fractal logical
operators, color codes, qudit topological codes, and non-Abelian systems. In
this work, we develop a method of performing HDRG decoding which combines
strenghts of existing decoders and further improves upon them. In particular,
we increase the minimal number of errors necessary for a logical error in a
system of linear size $L$ from $\Theta(L^{2/3})$ to $\Omega(L^{1-\epsilon})$

decoders. Furthermore, we provide the first study of continuous error
correction with imperfect syndrome measurements for the $D(\mathbb{Z}_d)$

$\text{poly}(\log L)$ for the perfect measurement case. In the continuous case
with imperfect syndrome measurements, the averaged runtime is $O(1)$ for
Abelian systems, while continuous error correction for non-Abelian anyons stays

near-wall turbulent flow is revisited in the context of a two-dimensional
channel flow. An approach based on the use of dispersion relations for the flow
velocity is developed. It is shown that for an incompressible flow conserving
vorticity, there exists a decomposition of the velocity field into rotational
and potential components, such that the restriction of the former to an
arbitrary cross-section of the channel is a functional of the vorticity and
velocity distributions over that cross-section, while the latter is
divergence-free and bounded downstream thereof. By eliminating the unknown
potential component with the help of a dispersion relation, a nonlinear
integro-differential equation for the flow velocity is obtained. It is then
analyzed within an asymptotic expansion in the small ratio v*/U of the friction
velocity to the mean flow velocity. Upon statistical averaging in the lowest
nontrivial order, this equation relates the mean velocity to the
cross-correlation function of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis of the
equation reveals existence of two continuous families of solutions, one having
the near-wall asymptotic of the form U \sim ln^p (y/y0), where y is the
distance to the wall, p>0 is arbitrary, and the other, U \sim y^n, with n>0
also arbitrary except in the limit n \to 0 where it turns out to be a universal
function of the Reynolds number, n \sim 1/ln(Re). It is proved, furthermore,
that given a mean velocity distribution having either asymptotic, one can
always construct a cross-correlation function so as to satisfy the obtained
equation. These results are discussed in the light of the existing controversy
regarding experimental verification of the law of the wall.

limb had a 51.6% chance of being observed on the west solar limb. Predicted

unchanged, leading to absence of jamming even at very high densities [ John et.

mechanism of self-propulsion force generated by each ant using information
about the distance from the ant in front, our model captures all the main
features observed in the experiment. The distance headway distribution shows a
maximum corresponding to separations within clusters. The position of this
maximum remains independent of average number density. We find a
non-equilibrium first order transition, with the formation of an infinite
cluster at a threshold density where all the ants in the system suddenly become

coronal mass ejections (CMEs), including any deflections close to the Sun or
through interplanetary space. Kay et al. 2013 introduced ForeCAT, a model of
CME deflection resulting from the background solar magnetic field. For a
magnetic field solution corresponding to Carrington Rotation (CR) 2029
(declining phase, April-May 2005), the majority of the CMEs deflected to the
Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS), the minimum in magnetic pressure on global
scales. Most of the deflection occurred below 4 Rs. Here we extend ForeCAT to
include a three dimensional description of the deflecting CME. We attempt to
answer the following questions: a) Do all CMEs deflect to the magnetic minimum?
and b) Does most deflection occur within the first few solar radii (~4 Rs)?
Results for solar minimum and declining phase CMEs show that not every CME
deflects to the magnetic minimum and that the deflection is typically
determined below 2 Rs. Slow, wide, low mass CMEs in declining phase solar
backgrounds with strong magnetic field and magnetic gradients exhibit the
largest deflections. Local gradients related to active regions tend to cause
the largest deviations from the deflection predicted by global magnetic
gradients, but variations can also be seen for CMEs in the quiet sun regions of
the declining phase CR. We show the torques due to differential forces along
the CME can cause rotation about the CME's toroidal axis.

about 1.4\% of the sky. We reject the hypothesis that there is no correlation
between CMB lensing and galaxy detection at a $20\,\sigma$ significance,
checking the result by performing a number of null tests. The significance of
the detection of the theoretically expected cross-correlation signal is found
to be $10\,\sigma$. The galaxy bias parameter, $b$, derived from a joint
analysis of the cross-power spectrum and of the auto-power spectrum of the
galaxy density contrast is found to be $b=2.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, consistent
with earlier estimates for H-ATLAS galaxies at similar redshifts. On the other
hand, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is found to be a factor $1.62 \pm
0.16$ higher than expected from the standard model and also found by
cross-correlation analyses with other tracers of the large-scale structure. The
enhancement due to lensing magnification can account for only a fraction of the
excess cross-correlation signal. We suggest that part of it may be due to an
incomplete removal of the contamination of the CIB, that includes the H-ATLAS
sources we are cross-correlating with. In any case, the highly significant
detection reported here using a catalog covering only 1.4\% of the sky

impacting nearly all extragalactic science with LSST. As existing deep redshift
samples have failed to yield highly-secure redshifts for a systematic 20%-60%
of their targets, it is a strong possibility that future deep spectroscopic
samples will not solve the calibration problem on their own. The best options
in this scenario are provided by cross-correlation methods that utilize
clustering with objects from spectroscopic surveys (which need not be fully
representative) to trace the redshift distribution of the full sample. For
spectroscopy, the eBOSS survey would enable a basic calibration of LSST
photometric redshifts, while the expected LSST-DESI overlap would be more than
sufficient for an accurate calibration at z>0.2. A DESI survey of nearby
galaxies conducted in bright time would enable accurate calibration down to
z~0. The expanded areal coverage provided by the transfer of the DESI

low density limit, and specifically the transition from the isotropic phase to
collective polar motion. We show that the fundamental quantity of interest for
the stability of the isotropic phase is the forward component of the momentum
change induced by binary scattering events. Building on the Boltzmann
formalism, we introduce an ansatz for the one-particle distribution and derive
a closed-form evolution equation for the order parameter. This approach yields
a very intuitive and physically meaningful criterion for the destabilization of
the isotropic phase, where the ansatz is exact. The criterion also predicts
whether the transition is continuous or discontinuous, as illustrated in three
different classes of models. The theoretical predictions are in excellent
agreement with numerical results.

  Labeling","to appear in Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2014",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We frame the task of predicting a semantic labeling as a sparse
reconstruction procedure that applies a target-specific learned transfer
function to a generic deep sparse code representation of an image. This
strategy partitions training into two distinct stages. First, in an
unsupervised manner, we learn a set of generic dictionaries optimized for
sparse coding of image patches. We train a multilayer representation via
recursive sparse dictionary learning on pooled codes output by earlier layers.
Second, we encode all training images with the generic dictionaries and learn a
transfer function that optimizes reconstruction of patches extracted from
annotated ground-truth given the sparse codes of their corresponding image
patches. At test time, we encode a novel image using the generic dictionaries
and then reconstruct using the transfer function. The output reconstruction is
a semantic labeling of the test image.
  Applying this strategy to the task of contour detection, we demonstrate
performance competitive with state-of-the-art systems. Unlike almost all prior
work, our approach obviates the need for any form of hand-designed features or
filters. To illustrate general applicability, we also show initial results on
semantic part labeling of human faces.
  The effectiveness of our approach opens new avenues for research on deep
sparse representations. Our classifiers utilize this representation in a novel
manner. Rather than acting on nodes in the deepest layer, they attach to nodes
along a slice through multiple layers of the network in order to make
predictions about local patches. Our flexible combination of a generatively
learned sparse representation with discriminatively trained transfer
classifiers extends the notion of sparse reconstruction to encompass arbitrary
semantic labeling tasks.

discovered in disordered mean-field models in the '80s. We find that the upper
critical dimension $d_u$ above which mean-field results hold is strictly larger

do not find any perturbative attractive fixed point (except for a tiny region
of the 1RSB breaking parameter), thus showing that the transition in three

nonlinear systems subject to time-invariant probabilistic uncertainties in
model parameters and initial conditions. The stochastic optimal control problem
entails a cost function in terms of expected values and higher moments of the
states, and chance constraints that ensure probabilistic constraint
satisfaction. The generalized polynomial chaos framework is used to propagate
the time-invariant stochastic uncertainties through the nonlinear system
dynamics, and to efficiently sample from the probability densities of the
states to approximate the satisfaction probability of the chance constraints.
To increase computational efficiency by avoiding excessive sampling, a
statistical analysis is proposed to systematically determine a-priori the least
conservative constraint tightening required at a given sample size to guarantee
a desired feasibility probability of the sample-approximated chance constraint
optimization problem. In addition, a method is presented for sample-based
approximation of the analytic gradients of the chance constraints, which
increases the optimization efficiency significantly. The proposed stochastic
nonlinear model predictive control approach is applicable to a broad class of
nonlinear systems with the sufficient condition that each term is analytic with
respect to the states, and separable with respect to the inputs, states and
parameters. The closed-loop performance of the proposed approach is evaluated
using the Williams-Otto reactor with seven states, and ten uncertain parameters
and initial conditions. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach
for real-time stochastic model predictive control and its capability to
systematically account for probabilistic uncertainties in contrast to a
nonlinear model predictive control approaches.

comparatively low payoffs. To take this into consideration, we introduce
coevolutionary success-driven multigames in structured populations. While the
core game is always the weak prisoner's dilemma, players whose payoffs from the
previous round exceed a threshold adopt only a minimally low temptation to
defect in the next round. Along with the strategies, the perceived strength of
the social dilemma thus coevolves with the success of each individual player.
We show that the lower the threshold for using the small temptation to defect,
the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted. Importantly, the promotion
of cooperation is not simply due to a lower average temptation to defect, but
rather due to a dynamically reversed direction of invasion along the interfaces
that separate cooperators and defectors on regular networks. Conversely, on
irregular networks, in the absence of clear invasion fronts, the promotion of
cooperation is due to intermediate-degree players. At sufficiently low
threshold values, these players accelerate the erosion of defectors and
significantly shorten the fixation time towards more cooperative stationary
states. Coevolutionary multigames could thus be the new frontier for the swift
resolution of social dilemmas.

  Analogous to the worst case redundancy of a collection of distributions over

addition, the recent proposal of a direct equivalence between the $p$-type
doping typically found for these systems and the spontaneous polarization (SP)
associated to the particular SiC polytype, opens the possibility of tuning the
number of carriers in the Dirac cones without the need of external gate
voltages. However, first principles calculations which could confirm at the
atomic scale the effect of the SP are lacking mainly due to the difficulty of
combining a bulk property such as the SP with the surface confined graphene
doping. Here we develop an approach based on standard density functional theory
(DFT) slab calculations in order to quantify the effect of the SP on the QFG
doping level. First, we present an accurate scheme to estimate the SPs by
exploiting the dependence of the slab's dipole moment with its thickness. Next,
and in order to circumvent the DFT shortcomings associated to polar slab
geometries, a double gold layer is attached at the C-terminated bottom of the
slab which introduces a metal induced gap state that pins the chemical
potential inside the gap thus allowing a meaningful comparison of the QFG
dopings among different polytypes. Furthermore, the slab dipole can be removed
after adjusting the Au-Au interlayer distances. Our results confirm that the SP
does indeed induce a substantial p-doping of the Dirac cones which can be as
large as a few hundreds of meV depending on the hexagonality of the polytype.
The evolution of the doping with the slab thickness reveals that several tens
of SiC bilayers are required to effectively remove the depolarization field and
recover the macroscopic regime whereby the graphene doping should equal the SP.

molecular gas powered by the mechanical energy of an active galactic nucleus
(AGN). It has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (SF) in
their host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxy
formation. Previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremely
rare, high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on
their hosts. Here we present detailed observations of the gas and dust
continuum of NGC1266 at millimeter wavelengths. Our observations show that
molecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at $\dot{M}_{\rm out}
\approx 110 M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, of which the vast majority cannot escape the
nucleus. Only 2 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is actually capable of escaping the galaxy.
Most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars.
The far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact ($\lesssim50$pc)
source that could either be powered by an AGN or by an ultra-compact starburst.
The ratio of the SF surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) to the gas surface
density ($\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$) indicates that SF is suppressed by a factor of
$\approx 50$ compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is forming
stars, and $\approx$150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if the
central region is is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. The AGN-driven bulk
outflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering the
fragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through a
process of turbulent injection. This result suggests that even relatively
common, low-power AGNs are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxies
as their black holes grow onto the M-$\sigma$ relation.

metal-free stars evolve into red supergiants shortly before they explode. We
argue that the envelopes of these stars, which will form pair-instability
supernovae, become pulsationally unstable and that this will lead to extreme
mass-loss rates despite the tiny metal content of the envelopes. We investigate
the pulsational properties of such models and derive pulsationally induced
mass-loss rates, which take the damping effects of the mass loss on the
pulsations selfconsistently into account. We find that the pulsations may
induce mass-loss rates of ~ 1e-4 - 1e-2 Msun/yr shortly before the explosions,
which may create a dense circumstellar medium. Our results show that very
massive stars with dense circumstellar media may stem from a wider initial mass
range than pulsational-pair instability supernovae. The extreme mass loss will
cease when so much of the hydrogen-rich envelope is lost that the star becomes
more compact and stops pulsating. The helium core of these stars therefore
remains unaffected, and their fate as pair-instability supernovae remains
unaltered. The existence of dense circumstellar media around metal-free
pair-instability supernovae can make them brighter and bluer, and they may be
easier to detect at high redshifts than previously expected. We argue that the
mass-loss enhancement in pair-instability supernova progenitors can naturally
explain some observational properties of superluminous supernovae: the
energetic explosions of stars within hydrogen-rich dense circumstellar media
with little 56Ni production and the lack of a hydrogen-rich envelope in
pair-instability supernova candidates with large 56Ni production.

breaks the $\mathbb{SU}(2)$-spin symmetry and causes the superconducting order

components. We find that in the presence of SOC the spectrum of
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states is qualitatively different in s-wave and p-wave
superconductor, a fact that can be used to identify the superconducting pairing
symmetry of the host system. We also predict that in the presence of SOC the
spectrum of the impurity-induced bound states depends on the orientation of the
magnetic moment $\bf{S}$ of the impurity and, in particular, that by changing
the orientation of $\bf{S}$ the fermion-parity of the lowest energy bound state
can be tuned. We then study the case of a dimer of magnetic impurities and show
that in this case the YSR spectrum for a p-wave superconductor is qualitatively
very different from the one for an s-wave superconductor even in the limit of

competing world models. Their identification is generally based on density or
geometry criteria that, because of their very nature, are prone to shot noise.
We propose two void finders that are based on dynamical criterion to select
voids in Lagrangian coordinates and minimise the impact of sparse sampling. The
first approach exploits the Zel'dovich approximation to trace back in time the
orbits of galaxies located in voids and their surroundings, the second uses the
observed galaxy-galaxy correlation function to relax the objects' spatial
distribution to homogeneity and isotropy. In both cases voids are defined as
regions of the negative velocity divergence, that can be regarded as sinks of
the back-in-time streamlines of the mass tracers. To assess the performance of
our methods we used a dark matter halo mock catalogue CoDECS, and compared the
results with those obtained with the ZOBOV void finder. We find that the void
divergence profiles are less scattered than the density ones and, therefore,
their stacking constitutes a more accurate cosmological probe. The significance
of the divergence signal in the central part of voids obtained from both our
finders is 60% higher than for overdensity profiles in the ZOBOV case. The
ellipticity of the stacked void measured in the divergence field is closer to
unity, as expected, than what is found when using halo positions. Therefore our
void finders are complementary to the existing methods, that should contribute

that result from stellar fly-bys. Although a small fraction of stars are
expected to undergo close approaches, the outcomes of the most violent
encounters might leave an imprint on the discs and host stars that will
influence both their orbits and their ability to form planets. We first
construct well-behaved 3-D models of self-gravitating discs, and then create a
suite of numerical experiments of parabolic encounters, exploring the effects
of pericenter separation r_p, disc orientation and disc-star mass ratio
(M_d/M_*) on the orbital evolution of the host stars. Close encounters (2r_p<~
disc radius) can truncate discs on very short time scales. If discs are
massive, close encounters facilitate enough orbital angular momentum extraction
to induce stellar capture. We find that for realistic primordial disc masses
M_d<~0.1M_*, non-colliding encounters induce minor orbital changes, which is
consistent with analytic calculations of encounters in the linear regime. The
same disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/colliding
encounters. In the latter case, rapidly cooling discs lose orbital energy by
radiating away the energy excess of the shock-heated gas, thus causing capture
of the host stars into a bound orbit. In rare cases, a tight binary with a
circumbinary disc forms as a result of this encounter.

can be described phenomenologically by only two distinct components: a soft
component, presumably dominated by hadronic processes, tracing the dense, cold
interstellar medium and a hard component, presumably dominated by leptonic
interactions, following the hot and dilute medium and outflows such as the
Fermi bubbles. A comparison of the soft component with the Galactic dust
emission indicates that the dust-to-soft-gamma ratio in the interstellar medium
decreases with latitude. The spectrally hard component exists in a thick
Galactic disk and tends to flow out of the Galaxy at some locations.
Furthermore, we find the angular power spectrum of the diffuse flux to roughly
follow a power law with an index of 2.47 on large scales, independent of

hard X-rays are due to the intra-binary shock from the interaction between the
pulsar wind and the injected material from the low-mass companion star. During
the rotation-powered MSP state, the X-ray orbital modulation is due to Doppler
boosting of the shocked pulsar wind. At the LMXB state, the evaporating matter
of the accretion disk due to the gamma-ray irradiation from the pulsar stops
almost all the pulsar wind, resulting the disappearance of the X-ray orbital

are not sufficient for searching into new surveys (e.g. DES, PS1, LSST),
because spectroscopic information is not readily available and the large data

systematic exploration of machine learning techniques and demonstrate that a
two step strategy can be highly effective. In the first step we use
catalog-level information ($griz$+WISE magnitudes, second moments) to preselect
targets, using artificial neural networks. The accepted targets are then
inspected with pixel-by-pixel pattern recognition algorithms (Gradient-Boosted
Trees), to form a final set of candidates. The results from this procedure can
be used to further refine the simpler SQLS algorithms, with a twofold (or
threefold) gain in purity and the same (or $80\%$) completeness at
target-selection stage, or a purity of $70\%$ and a completeness of $60\%$
after the candidate-selection step. Simpler photometric searches in $griz$+WISE
based on colour cuts would provide samples with $7\%$ purity or less. Our
technique is extremely fast, as a list of candidates can be obtained from a
stage III experiment (e.g. DES catalog/database) in {a few} CPU hours.

ceiling of 2.1 million K. Assuming cylindrical geometry and transonic turbulent
pressure support, we estimate the gas mass at ~1 million solar masses. The
coronal gas is cooling isochorically. We propose that the coronal gas has not
condensed out of the intracluster medium, but instead is the conductive or
mixing interface between the X-ray plume and the optical filaments. We present
a number of emission lines that may be pursued to test this hypothesis and

populations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances and
panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope photometry. The spectroscopic abundances
are used to compute stellar atmosphere and evolution models. The synthetic
spectra for the two populations show significant differences in the ultraviolet
and, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. The stellar evolution
models exhibit insignificant differences in the H-R diagram except on the lower
main sequence. The appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) of NGC 6752 is almost exclusively due to spectral effects
caused by the abundance variations. The models reproduce the observed splitting
and/or broadening of sequences in a range of CMDs. The ultraviolet CMDs are
sensitive to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are not
reliable enough to directly estimate abundance variations from photometry. On
the other hand, the widening of the lower main sequence in the near-infrared

other), which are reminiscent of the block copolymer nanophases for spherically
confined geometries. Phase diagrams for various chains in the $(T^*,

microarchitecture and $\omega$, is calculated. Since $S(k)$ can be measured in
scattering experiments, it can be used to relate simulation results to an

competition between minimization of the interfacial area separating different

Rare and Weak (RW). Researchers measure a large number of features, hoping to
find perhaps only a small fraction of them to be relevant to the research in
question; the effect sizes of the relevant features are individually small so
the true effects are not strong enough to stand out for themselves.
  Higher Criticism (HC) and Graphlet Screening (GS) are two classes of methods
that are specifically designed for the Rare/Weak settings. HC was introduced to
determine whether there are any relevant effects in all the measured features.
More recently, HC was applied to classification, where it provides a method for
selecting useful predictive features for trained classification rules. GS was
introduced as a graph-guided multivariate screening procedure, and was used for
variable selection.
  We develop a theoretic framework where we use an Asymptotic Rare and Weak
(ARW) model simultaneously controlling the size and prevalence of
useful/significant features among the useless/null bulk. At the heart of the
ARW model is the so-called phase diagram, which is a way to visualize clearly
the class of ARW settings where the relevant effects are so rare or weak that
desired goals (signal detection, variable selection, etc.) are simply
impossible to achieve. We show that HC and GS have important advantages over
better known procedures and achieve the optimal phase diagrams in a variety of
ARW settings.
  HC and GS are flexible ideas that adapt easily to many interesting
situations. We review the basics of these ideas and some of the recent
extensions, discuss their connections to existing literature, and suggest some

al - have been observed in the H II regions surrounding young stellar clusters.
With masses typically in the planetary (or low mass brown dwarf) regime, these
objects are so numerous in some regions (e.g. the Rosette) that, if only a
small fraction of them could ultimately collapse, then they would be a very
significant source of free floating planets. Here we review the properties of
globulettes and present a theoretical framework for their structure and
evolution. We demonstrate that their interior structure is well described by a
pressure confined isothermal Bonnor-Ebert sphere and that the observed
mass-radius relation (mass approximately proportional to the radius squared) is
a systematic consequence of a column density threshold below which components
of the globulette are not identified. We also find that globulettes with this
interior structure are very stable against collapse within H II regions. We
follow Gahm et al in assuming that globulettes are detached from the tips of
pillars protruding in from the swept up shell that borders the expanding H II
region and produce a model for their dynamics, finding that globulettes will
eventually impact the shell. We derive an expression for the time it takes to
do so and show that dissipation of energy via dust cooling allows all
globulettes to survive this encounter and escape into the wider ISM. Once there
the ambient pressure drops and they disperse on timescales around 30-300 kyr
and should be observable using ALMA out to distances of order a parsec. Since
we find that globulettes are stable, the only route via which they might still
form brown dwarfs or planets is during their collision with the shell or some
other violent perturbative event.

Access (CDMA) is a widely used method to both mitigate such interference and
support multiple in-band users. The ability to time-control multiple receptions
at a receiver permits use of deterministically orthogonal codes. Achieving full
capacity of the available frequency band depends, in part, on ensuring that all
signals in the band are from the agreed set of orthogonal signals. Each
unwanted signal consumes a fraction of the available capacity. In the extreme,
as more interferers are added the available bandwidth can support only one
user.
  We adapt CDMA techniques to a single user by assigning a constellation of M
symbols built around Walsh codes. This M-ary constellation encodes K bits of
data into one of the length N codewords, and gives preference to a
non-power-of-two Hadamard length, e.g., 12, 20, and higher multiples. The
tradeoff between the modified and conventional Walsh code designs is that one
user sends K bits per Walsh symbol interval as opposed to many users sending
one bit each per symbol. The throughput sacrifice is a consequence of the
severe external interference environment.

fields propagating on the background of rotating black holes in higher (odd)
dimensions with all angular momenta set equal. For this special case, the
solution enjoys an enhanced symmetry, which translates into the advantageous
feature of being cohomogeneity-1, i.e., these backgrounds depend on a single
radial coordinate. Our analysis contemplates three distinct situations, with
the cosmological constant being zero, positive or negative. Using the technique
of matched asymptotic expansions we compute analytically the greybody factors
in the low-frequency regime, restricting to s-wave scattering. Our formulas
generalize those obtained previously in the literature for the static and
spherically symmetric case, with corrections arising from the change in the
horizon area due to rotation. It is also proven that, for this family of black
holes, the horizon area is a decreasing function of the spin parameter, without
regard of dimensionality and of cosmological constant. Through an improvement
on a calculation specific to the class of small black holes in anti-de Sitter
and not restricted to the usual low-frequency regime, we uncover a rich
structure of the greybody spectrum, more complex than previously reported but
also enjoying a certain degree of universality. We complement our low-frequency
analytic results with numerical computations valid over a wide range of
frequencies and extend them to higher angular momentum quantum numbers,
$\ell>0$. This allows us to probe the superradiant regime that is observed for
corotating wavefunctions. We point out that the maximum amplification factor

Instead of performing broad phase collision detection, we need to check for
accuracy of detection by running narrow phase collision detection. One of the
important elements for narrow phase collision detection is to determine the
precise distance between two or more nearly intersecting objects or polygons in
order to prepare the area for potential colliding. Distance computation plays
important roles in determine the exact point of contact between two or more
nearly intersecting polygons where the preparation for collision detection is
determined at the earlier stage. In this paper, we describes our current works
of determining the distance between objects using dynamic pivot point that will
be used as reference point to reduce the complexity searching for potential
point of contacts. By using Axis-Aligned Bounding Box for each polygon, we
calculate a dynamic pivot point that will become our reference point to
determine the potential candidates for distance computation. The test our
finding distance will be simplified by using our method instead of performing
unneeded operations. Our method provides faster solution than the previous
method where it helps to determine the point of contact efficiently and faster
than the other method.

non-compact symplectic group $Sp(12,R)$, is introduced by considering the
symplectic geometry of the two-component many-particle nuclear system. The
possible classical collective motions are determined by different dynamical
groups that can be constructed from the symplectic generators. The relation of
the $Sp(12,R)$ irreps with the shell-model classification of the basis states
is considered by extending of the state space to the direct product space of
$SU_{p}(3) \otimes SU_{n}(3)$ irreps, generalizing in this way the Elliott's
$SU(3)$ model for the case of two-component system. The $Sp(12,R)$ model
appears then as a natural multi-major-shell extension of the generalized
proton-neutron $SU(3)$ scheme which takes into account the core collective
excitations of monopole and quadrupole, as well as dipole type associated with
the giant resonance vibrational degrees of freedom. Each $Sp(12,R)$ irreducible
representation is determined by a symplectic bandhead or an intrinsic $U(6)$
space which can be fixed by the underlying proton-neutron shell-model
structure, so the theory becomes completely compatible with the Pauli
principle. It is shown that this intrinsic $U(6)$ structure is of vital
importance for the appearance of the low-lying collective bands with both the
positive and negative parity. The full range of low-lying collective states can
then be described by the microscopically based intrinsic $U(6)$ structure,
renormalized by coupling to the giant resonance vibrations.

  Neighbor to neighbor interactions among the nodes are exploited to build
point clouds representing spatial features of the manifold characterizing the
environment based on the sampled data.
  To extract dominant features from sampled data, topological data analysis is
used to produce persistence intervals for features, to be used for topological
mapping. In order to improve robustness characteristics of the sampled data
with respect to outliers, density based subsampling algorithms are employed.
Moreover, a robust scale-invariant classification algorithm for persistence
diagrams is proposed to provide a quantitative representation of desired
features in the data. Furthermore, various strategies for defining encounter
metrics with different degrees of information regarding agents' motion are
suggested to enhance the precision of the estimation and classification

UV filtered topological charge densities are determined from a fixed number of

allows to find all three distinguished (anti)dyon constituents in the gauge
field of Kraan-van Baal-Lee-Lu (anti)caloron solutions. The clustering of the
three topological charge densities in Monte Carlo generated configurations is

also for time-like Abelian monopole currents (defined in the maximally Abelian

neglected is that it turns out to be very challenging to realize D-terms at
energies parametrically smaller than the Planck scale in supergravity. As we
demonstrate in this paper, all conventional difficulties may, however, be
overcome if the generation of the D-term is based on strong dynamics. To
illustrate our idea, we focus on a certain class of vector-like SUSY breaking
models that enjoy a minimal particle content and which may be easily embedded
into more complete scenarios. We are then able to show that, upon gauging a
global flavor symmetry, an appropriate choice of Yukawa couplings readily
allows to dynamically generate a D-term at an almost arbitrary energy scale.
This includes in particular the natural and consistent realization of D-terms
around, above and below the scale of grand unification in supergravity, without
the need for fine-tuning of any model parameters. Our construction might
therefore bear the potential to open up a new direction for model building in
supersymmetry and early universe cosmology.

end-to-end distance of the high molecular weight polymer chains. In this paper,
the proven enhanced mobility of sub-Rouse modes at the surface of polymers is
used to explain recent experimental investigations of viscous flow at the
surface of low molecular weight PS by Chai et al. [Science, 343, 994 (2014)],
and by Yang et al. [Science, 328, 1676 (2010).]. Viscous flow of polymers is by
global chain motion, therefore the observed large reduction of viscosity at the
surface of low molecular weight PS originates from the sub-Rouse modes, and not
the segmental a-relaxation. This distinction is not commonly recognized in the
current literature. The accerleration of the sub-Rouse modes at the surface
explains the experimental findings.

massive atmosphere after their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the
critical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being smaller and rock/ice-dominated,
never crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough to attract
substantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in
pressure-equilibrium with the disc. Our goal is to characterise the
hydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and their
implication for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper -- the first in
series -- we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid
flow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical
simulations. Using the PLUTO code we confirm that the flow is steady and bound.
This steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid
spacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets,
Cartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow
the circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of
rotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive
atmospheres rotate faster -- a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation
theorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire
from the nebula. Dependent on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc,
the planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian rotation before self-gravity
starts to become important.

around small protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disc by conducting
hydrodynamical simulations. These are now extended to three dimensions,
employing a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown
to reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary
demarcates bound atmospheric gas from disc material; instead, we find an open
system where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through
the midplane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian.
The simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the
atmosphere is characterized by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular
interest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas,
$t_\mathrm{replenish}$. It is shown that the replenishment rate,
$M_\mathrm{atm}/t_\mathrm{replenish}$, can be understood in terms of a modified
Bondi accretion rate,
$\sim$$R_\mathrm{Bondi}^2\rho_\mathrm{gas}v_\mathrm{Bondi}$, where
$v_\mathrm{Bondi}$ is set by the Keplerian shear or the magnitude of the
sub-Keplerian motion of the gas, whichever is larger. In the inner disk, the
atmosphere of embedded protoplanets replenishes on a timescale that is shorter
than the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (or cooling) timescale. As a result,
atmospheric gas can no longer contract and the growth of these atmospheres
terminates. Future work must confirm whether these findings continue to apply
when the (thermodynamical) idealizations employed in this study are relaxed.
But if shown to be broadly applicable, replenishment of atmospheric gas
provides a natural explanation for the preponderance of gas-rich but
rock-dominant planets like super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

excluded ion-size effect for the correlation energy. This results in a

We show that the ionic size is of significant importance in predicting a finite
self energy for an ion in an inhomogeneous medium. Asymptotic approximation is
proposed for the solution of a generalized Debye-Huckel equation, which has
been shown to capture the ionic correlation and dielectric self energy. Through
simulating ionic distribution surrounding a macroion, the modified

present high resolution [CII] spectra obtained with the Herschel/HIFI
instrument towards bright dust continuum sources regions in the Galactic plane,
probing simultaneously the diffuse gas along the line of sight and the
background high-mass star forming regions. These data are complemented by
observations of the 492 and 809 GHz fine structure lines of atomic carbon and
by medium spectral resolution spectral maps of the fine structure lines of
atomic oxygen at 63 and 145 microns with Herschel/PACS. We show that the
presence of foreground absorption may completely cancel the emission from the
background source in medium spectral resolution data and that high spectral
resolution spectra are needed to interpret the [CII] and [OI] emission and the
[CII]/FIR ratio. This phenomenon may explain part of the [CII]/FIR deficit seen
in external luminous infrared galaxies. The C+ and C excitation in the diffuse

The knowledge of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor of

F_{r}$, where $F_r$ is a finitely generated free group, of a group $G$ of
finite Kurosh rank, we can associate some (relative) outer space $\mathcal{O}$.
In this paper, we develop the theory of (stable) laminations for (relative)
irreducible with irreducible powers (IWIP) automorphisms. In particular, we
examine the action of $Out(G, \mathcal{O}) \leq Out(G)$ (i.e. the automorphisms
which preserve the set of conjugacy classes of $G_i$'s) on the set of
laminations. We generalise the theory of the attractive laminations associated
to automorphisms of finitely generated free groups. The strategy is the same as
in the classical case (see \cite{BFM}), but some statements are slightly
different because of the existence of the $G_i$'s. More precisely, we prove
that the stabiliser of the lamination of a relative IWIP is a
$\mathbb{Z}$-extension of a subgroup that is consisted of virtually elliptic
automorphisms. Note that in the free case, virtually elliptic automorphisms are
exactly the finite order automorphisms of $Out(F_n)$. As a corollary of the
previous theorem, we generalise the fact that the centraliser of an IWIP
automorphism of a free group, is virtually cyclic. As a direct corollary, if
$Out(G)$ is virtually torsion free and every $Aut(G_i)$ is finite, we prove
that the centraliser of an IWIP is virtually cyclic. Finally, we give an
example which shows that we cannot expect that in general the centraliser of a
relative IWIP (and as a consequence the stabiliser of its stable lamination) is
virtually cyclic.

theoretical predictions for the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) signature

simulations of the \LambdaCDM Planck cosmology to study any possible systematic
shifts and damping in BAO due to the impact of nonlinear gravitational growth
of structure, scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-space
distortions. The effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing the
tracer power spectrum by that from a BAO-free simulation starting with the same
phases. This permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%
for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine BAO
wavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the
power spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.
For dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of
\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor D(z). For halo samples, with
bias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a typical BAO shift of ~0.25%,
observed in real-space, which does not show an appreciable evolution with
redshift within the uncertainties. Moreover, we report a constant shift as a
function of halo bias. We find a different evolution of the damping of the
acoustic feature in all halo samples as compared to dark matter with haloes
suffering less damping, and also find some weak dependence on bias. A larger
BAO shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can be well explained
by linear theory due to redshift-space distortions. A clear modulation in phase
with the acoustic scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to the
presence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.

is the need for sparse instrumentation in areas of 100 km2 and above, often in
remote and harsh environments. All these arrays have similar requirements for
read-out and communication, power generation and distribution, and
synchronization. Within the TAXI project we are developing a transportable,
modular four-station test-array that allows us to study different approaches to
solve the aforementioned problems in the laboratory and in the field.
Well-defined interfaces will provide easy interchange of the components to be
tested and easy transport and setup will allow in-situ testing at different
sites. Every station consists of three well-understood 1 m2 scintillation
detectors with nanosecond time resolution, which provide an air shower trigger.
An additional sensor, currently a radio antenna for air shower detection in the
100 MHz band, is connected for testing and calibration purposes. We introduce
the TAXI project and report the status and performance of the first TAXI
station deployed at the Zeuthen site of DESY.

The analysis of
Arabic script is further complicated due to obligatory dots/strokes that are
placed above or below most letters and usually written delayed in order. Due to
ambiguities and diversities of writing styles, recognition systems are
generally based on a set of possible words called lexicon. When the lexicon is
small, recognition accuracy is more important as the recognition time is
minimal. On the other hand, recognition speed as well as the accuracy are both
critical when handling large lexicons. Arabic is rich in morphology and syntax
which makes its lexicon large. Therefore, a practical online handwriting
recognition system should be able to handle a large lexicon with reasonable
performance in terms of both accuracy and time. In this paper, we introduce a
fully-fledged Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based system for Arabic online
handwriting recognition that provides solutions for most of the difficulties
inherent in recognizing the Arabic script. A new preprocessing technique for
handling the delayed strokes is introduced. We use advanced modeling techniques
for building our recognition system from the training data to provide more
detailed representation for the differences between the writing units, minimize
the variances between writers in the training data and have a better
representation for the features space. System results are enhanced using an
additional post-processing step with a higher order language model and
cross-word HMM models. The system performance is evaluated using two different
databases covering small and large lexicons. Our system outperforms the
state-of-art systems for the small lexicon database. Furthermore, it shows
promising results (accuracy and time) when supporting large lexicon with the
possibility for adapting the models for specific writers to get even better
results.

of geodesic motion in the presence of a magnetic field proportional to the
ricci form. It has been conjectured to model low-energy dynamics of vortex
solitons in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, the k\""ahler manifold in
question being the $n$-vortex moduli space. This paper presents a detailed
study of RMG motion in soliton moduli spaces, focusing on the cases of
hyperbolic vortices and spherical $\mathbb{C}P^1$ lumps. It is shown that RMG
flow localizes on fixed point sets of groups of holomorphic isometries, but
that the flow on such submanifolds does not, in general, coincide with their
intrinsic RMG flow. For planar vortices, it is shown that RMG flow differs from
an earlier reduced dynamics proposed by Kim and Lee, and that the latter flow
is ill-defined on the vortex coincidence set. An explicit formula for the
metric on the whole moduli space of hyperbolic two-vortices is computed
(extending an old result of Strachan's), and RMG motion of centred two-vortices
is studied in detail. Turning to lumps, the moduli space of static $n$-lumps is
$Rat_n$, the space of degree $n$ rational maps, which is known to be k\""ahler
and geodesically incomplete. It is proved that $Rat_1$ is, somewhat
surprisingly, RMG complete (meaning that that the initial value problem for RMG
motion has a global solution for all initial data). It is also proved that the
submanifold of rotationally equivariant $n$-lumps, $Rat_n^{eq}$, a
topologically cylindrical surface of revolution, is intrinsically RMG
incomplete for $n=2$ and all $n\geq 5$, but that the extrinsic RMG flow on

bijection between signed permutations and an equivalence class of particular
fatgraphs, called $\pi$-maps, and analyze the action of reversals on the

show that each of the new tilings is mutually locally derivable to the original

some key matrix power series in Markov kernels weighted with solutions to a

treated and control groups are similar in terms of observable covariates.
Traditionally such matched samples consist of matched pairs. If a pair match
fails to make treated and control units sufficiently comparable, alternative
forms of matching may be necessary. One general strategy to improve balance is
to match a variable number of control units to each treated unit. A more
tailored strategy is to adopt a fine balance constraint. Under a fine balance
constraint, a nominal covariate is exactly balanced, but it does not require
individually matched treated and control subjects for this variable. In the
example, we seek to construct a matched sample for an ongoing evaluation of
Peer Health Exchange, an intervention in schools designed to decrease risky
health behaviors among youth. We find that an optimal pair match that minimizes
distances between pairs creates a matched sample where balance is poor. Here we
propose a method to allow for fine balance constraints when each treated unit
is matched to a variable number of control units, which is not currently
possible using existing matching algorithms. Our approach uses the entire
number to first determine the optimal number of controls for each treated unit.
For each strata of matched treated units, we can then apply a fine balance
constraint. We then demonstrate that a matched sample for the evaluation of the
Peer Health Exchange based on a variable number of controls and fine balance
constraint is superior to simply using a variable-ratio match.

approaches for estimating a high-dimensional covariance matrix are often

family of nonparametric Stein-type shrinkage covariance estimators is proposed
whose members are written as a convex linear combination of the sample
covariance matrix and of a predefined invertible target matrix. Under the
Frobenius norm criterion, the optimal shrinkage intensity that defines the best
convex linear combination depends on the unobserved covariance matrix and it
must be estimated from the data. A simple but effective estimation process that
produces nonparametric and consistent estimators of the optimal shrinkage
intensity for three popular target matrices is introduced. In simulations, the
proposed Stein-type shrinkage covariance matrix estimator based on a scaled
identity matrix appeared to be up to 80% more efficient than existing ones in

demonstrate the utility of the proposed estimators. A rule of thumb for adhoc

human movements. With growing usage, compressing mocap data has received
increasing attention, since compact data size enables efficient storage and
transmission. Our analysis shows that mocap data have some unique
characteristics that distinguish themselves from images and videos. Therefore,
directly borrowing image or video compression techniques, such as discrete
cosine transform, does not work well. In this paper, we propose a novel
mocap-tailored transform coding algorithm that takes advantage of these
features. Our algorithm segments the input mocap sequences into clips, which
are represented in 2D matrices. Then it computes a set of data-dependent
orthogonal bases to transform the matrices to frequency domain, in which the
transform coefficients have significantly less dependency. Finally, the
compression is obtained by entropy coding of the quantized coefficients and the
bases. Our method has low computational cost and can be easily extended to
compress mocap databases. It also requires neither training nor complicated

significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of compression

simplest case of unlimited harvester size, the maximum obtainable power is
simply proportional to the maximum value of the power spectral density of

by a subsurface ocean. The crust thus responds to tidal forcing as a deformed
membrane, cold at the top and near melting point at the bottom. In this paper I
develop the membrane theory of viscoelastic shells with depth-dependent
rheology with the dual goal of predicting tidal tectonics and computing tidal
dissipation. Two parameters characterize the tidal response of the membrane:
the effective Poisson's ratio $\bar\nu$ and the membrane spring constant
$\Lambda$, the latter being proportional to the crust thickness and effective
shear modulus. I solve membrane theory in terms of tidal Love numbers, for
which I derive analytical formulas depending on $\Lambda$, $\bar\nu$, the
ocean-to-bulk density ratio and the number $k_2^o$ representing the influence
of the deep interior. Membrane formulas predict $h_2$ and $k_2$ with an
accuracy of a few tenths of percent if the crust thickness is less than one
hundred kilometers, whereas the error on $l_2$ is a few percents. Benchmarking
with the thick-shell software SatStress leads to the discovery of an error in
the original, uncorrected version of the code that changes stress components by
up to 40%. Regarding tectonics, I show that different stress-free states
account for the conflicting predictions of thin and thick shell models about
the magnitude of tensile stresses due to nonsynchronous rotation. Regarding
dissipation, I prove that tidal heating in the crust is proportional to $Im
\Lambda$ and that it is equal to the global heat flow (proportional to $Im
k_2$) minus the core-mantle heat flow (proportional to $Im k_2^o$). As an
illustration, I compute the equilibrium thickness of a convecting crust. More
generally, membrane formulas are useful in any application involving tidal Love
numbers such as crust thickness estimates, despinning tectonics or true polar
wander.

for this self-organization in the adiabatic limit and show that the
self-organization of the beam leads to the formation of travelling molecular
packets, which in turn function as a dynamic Bragg grating, thus modulating
periodically the intracavity field by superradiant scattering of the pump
photons. The modulation encodes the position information of the molecular
packets into the output of the intracavity field instantaneously. We then
applied time-varying laser pumps that are automatically switched by the output
of the intracavity field to slow down the molecular packets via a feedback
mechanism and found that most of the molecules in the molecular packets are
decelerated to zero central velocity after tens of stages. Our cavity-based
deceleration proposal works well in the bad cavity regime, which is very
different from the conventional cavity- based cooling strategies where a good
cavity is preferred. Practical issues in realizing the proposal are also

proposed as candidate materials for use in high-speed, low-power digital
switches driven by stress induced changes of resistivity. At room temperature
these materials exhibit a pressure driven insulator-to-metal transition with
resistivity decreasing by up to 7 orders of magnitude over a small pressure
range. Thus, the application of only a few GPa's to the piezoresistor (SmX)
allows the switching device to perform complex logic. Here we study from first
principles the electronic properties of these compounds under uniaxial strain
and discuss the consequences on carrier transport. The changes in the band
structure show that the piezoresistive response is mostly governed by the
reduction of band gap with strain. Furthermore, it becomes optimal when the
Fermi level is pinned near the localized valence band. The piezoresistive
effect under uniaxial strain which must be taken into account in thin films and
other systems with reduced dimensionality is also quantified. Under uniaxial
strain we find that the piezoresistive response can be substantially larger
than in the isotropic case. Analysis of complex band structure of SmSe yields a
tunneling length of the order of 1 nm. The results suggest that the conduction
mechanism governing the piezoresistive effect in bulk, i.e.~thermal promotion
of electrons, should still be dominant in few-nanometer-thick films.

simultaneously controlling the size and prevalence of useful/significant items
among the useless/null bulk. The RW model shows that HC has important
advantages over better known procedures such as False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control and Family-wise Error control (FwER), in particular, certain optimality

notably electron traps (e-traps) are close to CB and h-traps are supposedly
close to the valance band, especially in anion rich CdSe QDs. Although such
emission (so called deep-trap) is a well known phenomenon, the energetic
locations of these traps and the associated discrepancy require further

thus they percolate, filling the simulation volume; we show that the set of
multi-stream particles also percolates. This percolation persists to high
resolution, where the mass fraction of single-stream voids is low, because the
volume fraction remains high; we speculate on the fraction of collapsed mass in

first when the system is free, the second when gradually a trapping potential
is added. In both cases we first focus on the existence and stability/
instability properties of standing waves. Our approach leads to the search of
critical points of a constrained functional which is unbounded from below on
the constraint. In the free case, by showing that the constrained functional
has a so-called {\it mountain pass geometry}, we prove the existence of
standing states with least energy, the ground states, and show that any ground
state is orbitally unstable. Moreover, when the system is free, we show that
small data in the energy space scatter in all regimes, stable and unstable. In
the second case, if the trapping potential is small, we prove that two
different kind of standing waves appears: one corresponds to a {\it topological
local minimizer} of the constrained energy functional and it consists in ground
states, the other is again of {\it mountain pass type} but now corresponds to
excited states. We also prove that any ground state is a {\it topological local
minimizer}. Despite the problem is mass supercritical and the functional
unbounded from below, the standing waves associated to the set of ground states
turn to be orbitally stable. Actually, from the physical point of view, the
introduction of the trapping potential stabilizes the system initially
unstable. Related to this we observe that it also creates a gap in the ground
state energy level of the system. In addition when the trapping potential is
active the presence of standing waves with arbitrary small norm does not permit
small data scattering. Eventually some asymptotic results are also given.

cycle events with cell growth. This coordination has for long been supposed to
rely on the existence of size thresholds determining cell cycle progression
[1]. In budding yeast, size is controlled at the G1/S transition [11]. In
agreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in
G1: smaller cells have a longer G1 period [3]. Nevertheless, even though cells
born smaller have a longer G1, the compensation is imperfect and they still bud
at smaller cell sizes. In bacteria, several recent studies have shown that the
incremental model of size control, in which size is controlled by addition of a
constant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively
explain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7].
Here, we report on experimental results for the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, finding, surprisingly, that cell size control in this organism is
very well described by the incremental model, suggesting a common strategy for
cell size control with bacteria. Additionally, we argue that for S. cerevisiae
the volume increment is not added from birth to division, but rather between
two budding events.

achieve rendezvous in presence of a very powerful adversary, a malicious agent
that moves through the network and tries to block the honest agents and
prevents them from gathering. The malicious agent is assumed to be arbitrarily
fast, has full knowledge of the network and it cannot be exterminated by the
honest agents. On the other hand, the honest agents are assumed to be quite
weak: They are asynchronous and anonymous, they have only finite memory, they
have no prior knowledge of the network and they can communicate with the other
agents only when they meet at a node. Can the honest agents achieve rendezvous
starting from an arbitrary configuration in spite of the malicious agent? We
present some necessary conditions for solving rendezvous in spite of the
malicious agent in arbitrary networks. We then focus on the ring and mesh
topologies and provide algorithms to solve rendezvous. For ring networks, our
algorithms solve rendezvous in all feasible instances of the problem, while we
show that rendezvous is impossible for an even number of agents in unoriented
rings. For the oriented mesh networks, we prove that the problem can be solved
when the honest agents initially form a connected configuration without holes
if and only if they can see which are the occupied nodes within a two-hops
distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study such
a powerful and mobile fault model, in the context of mobile agents. Our model
lies between the more powerful but static fault model of black holes (which can
even destroy the agents), and the less powerful but mobile fault model of
Byzantine agents (which can only imitate the honest agents but can neither harm
nor stop them).

antennas are connected to a Fusion Center (FC) via limited-capacity backhaul
links. Similar to cloud radio access networks in communications, the receive
antennas quantize the received baseband signal before transmitting it to the
FC. The problem of maximizing the detection performance at the FC jointly over
the code vector used by the transmitting antenna and over the statistics of the
noise introduced by backhaul quantization is investigated. Specifically,
adopting the information-theoretic criterion of the Bhattacharyya distance to
evaluate the detection performance at the FC and information-theoretic measures
of the quantization rate, the problem at hand is addressed via a Block
Coordinate Descent (BCD) method coupled with Majorization-Minimization (MM).
Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed joint optimization
approach over more conventional solutions that perform separate optimization.

classification problems that allows for multiple outputs that are dependent on

for any given input pattern there can be multiple correct output patterns. This
changes the learning task from function approximation to relation
approximation. Previous algorithms do not consider this problem, and thus
cannot be readily applied to MOD problems. To perform MOD learning, we
introduce the Hierarchical Multi-Output Nearest Neighbor model (HMONN) that
employs a basic learning model for each output and a modified nearest neighbor
approach to refine the initial results.

this method is analogous to the method of characteristics for two hyperbolic
equations. The method is effectively applicable in all cases when the explicit
expression for the Riemann-Green function of some linear second order PDE,
resulting from the use of the hodograph method for the original equations, is
known. One of the method advantages is the possibility of constructing a
multi-valued solutions. Compared with the previous authors paper, in which, in
particular, the shallow water equations are studied, here we investigate the
case when the Riemann-Green function can be represent as the sum of the terms

computing the different initial data (periodic, wave packet, the Gaussian
