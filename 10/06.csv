(spin-1/2s) to admit a local hidden variable (LHV) description i.e. to be
classical is the separability of the density matrix characterizing its state,
but not all classical states are separable. This leads one to infer that
separability and classicality are two different concepts. These concepts are
examined here in the framework of a criterion for identifying classicality of a
system of spin-1/2s based on the concept of joint quasiprobability (JQP) for
the eigevalues of spin components. The said criterion identifies a state as
classical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in
suitably chosen three or two orthogonal directions is non-negative. In
agreement with other approaches, the JQP based criterion leads to the result
that all non-factorizable pure states of two spin-1/2s are non-classical.
Furthermore, the validity of the criterion is confirmed by comparing its
predictions with those arrived at by other methods when applied to several
mixed states of two spin-1/2s and the Werner like state of three spin-1/2s
(G.Toth and A.Acin,Phys.Rev. A74, 030306(R) (2006)). The JQP based approach,
formulated as it is along the lines of the P-function approach for identifying
classical states of the electromagnetic field, offers a unified approach for
systems of arbitrary number of spin-1/2s and the possibility of linking
classicality with the nature of the measurement process.

an arbitrary trajectory on Minkowski background. While a purely outgoing
boundary condition on the gluonic field allows one to express the corresponding
string worldsheet in a closed form, the setup has curious consequences. In
particular, we argue that any quark whose trajectory on flat spacetime
approaches that of a light ray in the remote past (as happens e.g. in the case
of uniform acceleration) must necessarily be accompanied by an anti-quark. This
is puzzling from the field theory standpoint, since one would expect that a
sole quark following any timelike trajectory should be allowed. We explain the
resolution in terms of boundary and initial conditions. We analyze the
configuration in global AdS, which naturally suggests a modification to the
boundary conditions allowing for a single accelerated quark without
accompanying anti-quark. We contrast this resolution with earlier proposals.

lots of attention from statisticians, engineers and computer scientists. In
this work we study the type of outliers that are not necessarily apparent in
the original observation space but can seriously affect the principal subspace
estimation. Based on a mathematical formulation of such transformed outliers, a
novel robust orthogonal complement principal component analysis (ROC-PCA) is
proposed. The framework combines the popular sparsity-enforcing and low rank
regularization techniques to deal with row-wise outliers as well as
element-wise outliers. A non-asymptotic oracle inequality guarantees the
accuracy and high breakdown performance of ROC-PCA in finite samples. To tackle
the computational challenges, an efficient algorithm is developed on the basis
of Stiefel manifold optimization and iterative thresholding. Furthermore, a
batch variant is proposed to significantly reduce the cost in ultra high

reduction in robust PCA. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of
ROC-PCA in both synthetic and real data.

proposed for efficient computation and allows for direct cardinality control of

equations are distribution valued and a Wick renormalisation has to be
performed in order to define the non-linear term. Formally, this
renormalisation corresponds to adding an infinite mass term to the equation. We
show that this need for renormalisation for the limiting equation is reflected

order to maximize the observing time with this robotic system we need to move
in parallel the fiber-ends of all positioners from the previous to the next
target coordinates. Direct trajectories are not feasible due to collision risks
that could undeniably damage the robots and impact the survey operation and
performance. We have previously developed a motion planning method based on a
novel decentralized navigation function for collision-free coordination of
fiber positioners. The navigation function takes into account the configuration
of positioners as well as their envelope constraints. The motion planning
scheme has linear complexity and short motion duration (~2.5 seconds with the
maximum speed of 30 rpm for the positioner), which is independent of the number
of positioners. These two key advantages of the decentralization designate the
method as a promising solution for the collision-free motion-planning problem
in the next-generation of fiber-fed spectrographs. In a framework where a
centralized computer communicates with the positioner robots, communication
overhead can be reduced significantly by using velocity profiles consisting of
a few bits only. We present here the discretization of velocity profiles to
ensure the feasibility of a real-time coordination for a large number of

Recently demonstrated, the giants (K$_{s}$ $\leq$ -22.5 mag) in the Local
Volume beyond the Local Sheet have spin vectors directed close to the plane of
the Local Supercluster, supporting the predictions of Tidal Torque Theory.
However, the giants in the Local Sheet encircling the Local Group display a
distinctly different arrangement, suggesting that the mass asymmetry of the
Local Group or its progenitor torqued them from their primordial spin
directions. To investigate the origin of the spin alignment of giants locally,
analogues of the Local Sheet were identified in the SDSS DR9. Similar to the
Local Sheet, analogues have an interacting pair of disk galaxies isolated from
the remaining sheet members. Modified sheets in which there is no interacting
pair of disk galaxies were identified as a control sample.
  Galaxies in face-on control sheets do not display axis ratios predominantly
weighted toward low values, contrary to the expectation of tidal torque theory.
For face-on and edge-on sheets, the distribution of axis ratios for galaxies in
analogues is distinct from that in controls with a confidence of 97.6 $\%$ $\&$
96.9$\%$, respectively. This corroborates the hypothesis that an interacting
pair can affect spin directions of neighbouring galaxies.

rates to validate the redMaPPer membership probability estimates for clusters

three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue
cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third
systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial
dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer
probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we
find exquisite agreement ($\approx 1\%$) between the photometric probability
estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can
robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a
byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection
effects from correlated structure contribute $\approx 6\%$ of the richness of a

give some interesting results: first, by giving non-trivial charges to the
Standard Model fermions, it is possible to use the $Z_3$ symmetry of the scalar
potential to generate potentially useful Yukawa textures. This is not possible
with $Z_2$. A series of possibilities is presented where their viability is

obtained that differs from the $Z_2$ case. Some general comments are presented

magnetostatics, and the electric fields of Faraday induction can all be
regarded as arising from charged particles. Some aspects of electromagnetic
induction are explored for a hypothetical circuit consisting of point charges
which move frictionlessly in a circular orbit. For a small number of particles
in the circuit (or for non-interacting particles), the induced electromagnetic
fields depend upon the mass and charge of the current carriers while energy is
transferred to the kinetic energy of the particles. However, for an interacting
multiparticle circuit, the mutual electromagnetic interactions between the

T_e = 0.033 \,m_i\,c_{Ar}^2$, where $\Delta T_{e}$ is the increase in electron
temperature. For the range of simulations performed, the heating shows almost
no correlation with inflow total temperature $T_{tot} = T_i + T_e$ or plasma
$\beta$. An out-of-plane (guide) magnetic field of similar magnitude to the
reconnecting field does not affect the total heating, but it does quench
perpendicular heating, with almost all heating being in the parallel direction.
These results are qualitatively consistent with a recent statistical survey of
electron heating in the dayside magnetopause, which also found that $\Delta

varies very little with distance downstream of the x-line. The simulations show
at most a very weak dependence of electron heating on the ion to electron mass
ratio. In the antiparallel reconnection case, the largely parallel heating is
eventually isotropized downstream due a scattering mechanism such as stochastic
particle motion or instabilities. The study highlights key properties that must

weak dependence on electron mass; and (4) An exhaust electron temperature that

coronal loops form at the same places as they are found in coronal

time with temperature, in agreement with the experimental work of Wallace et
al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 5584-5589]. The hairpin closing
process involves the formation of an initial nucleus of one or two bonds
between the stems followed by a rapid zippering of the stem. At high
temperatures, typically above the hairpin melting temperature, an effective
negative activation enthalpy is observed because the nucleus has a lower
enthalpy than the open state. By contrast, at low temperatures, the activation
enthalpy becomes positive mainly due to the increasing energetic cost of
bending a loop that becomes increasingly highly stacked as the temperature
decreases. We show that stacking must be very strong to induce this
experimentally observed behavior, and that the existence of just a few weak
stacking points along the loop can substantially suppress it. Non-native base
pairs are observed to have only a small effect, slightly accelerating hairpin
formation.

(large-scale) model containing uncertain parameters, (possibly) noisy
observational data, and a prediction quantity of interest, how do we construct
efficient and scalable algorithms to (1) infer the model parameters from the
data (the deterministic inverse problem), (2) quantify the uncertainty in the
inferred parameters (the Bayesian inference problem), and (3) propagate the
resulting uncertain parameters through the model to issue predictions with
quantified uncertainties (the forward uncertainty propagation problem)? We
present efficient and scalable algorithms for this end-to-end,
data-to-prediction process under the Gaussian approximation and in the context
of modeling the flow of the Antarctic ice sheet and its effect on sea level.
The ice is modeled as a viscous, incompressible, creeping, shear-thinning
fluid. The observational data come from InSAR satellite measurements of surface
ice flow velocity, and the uncertain parameter field to be inferred is the
basal sliding parameter. The prediction quantity of interest is the present-day
ice mass flux from the Antarctic continent to the ocean. We show that the work
required for executing this data-to-prediction process is independent of the
state dimension, parameter dimension, data dimension, and number of processor
cores. The key to achieving this dimension independence is to exploit the fact
that the observational data typically provide only sparse information on model
parameters. This property can be exploited to construct a low rank
approximation of the linearized parameter-to-observable map.

oscillating due to the temporal coherence of electrons tunneling through the

quantum-impurity systems, the temperature T plays an inhibitory action to the
oscillations of dynamic current through its suppression to the Kondo effects.
The amplitude of the current oscillations is attenuated by the e-e interaction
$U$ in the Kondo regime. The frequency of the current oscillation is found
almost independent of T and U. For parallel-coupling double quantum-impurity
systems, the oscillation of the current shows similar behaviors to the single

graph-theoretic applications. It is used to reveal natural divisions that exist
within real world networks without imposing prior size or cardinality
constraints on the set of communities. Despite its potential for application,
there is only limited support for community detection on large-scale parallel
computers, largely owing to the irregular and inherently sequential nature of
the underlying heuristics. In this paper, we present parallelization heuristics
for fast community detection using the Louvain method as the serial template.
The Louvain method is an iterative heuristic for modularity optimization.
Originally developed by Blondel et al. in 2008, the method has become
increasingly popular owing to its ability to detect high modularity community
partitions in a fast and memory-efficient manner. However, the method is also
inherently sequential, thereby limiting its scalability. Here, we observe
certain key properties of this method that present challenges for its
parallelization, and consequently propose heuristics that are designed to break
the sequential barrier. For evaluation purposes, we implemented our heuristics
using OpenMP multithreading, and tested them over real world graphs derived
from multiple application domains (e.g., internet, citation, biological).
Compared to the serial Louvain implementation, our parallel implementation is
able to produce community outputs with a higher modularity for most of the
inputs tested, in comparable number or fewer iterations, while providing
absolute speedups of up to 16x using 32 threads.

reasonable agreement with the recent transport experiment in the spin-injection
configuration [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 111}, 257204 (2013)]. We reveal that the
spin relaxation is significantly enhanced at low temperature in the presence of
weak electric field $E\lesssim 50$~V/cm, which originates from the obvious
center-of-mass drift effect due to the weak electron-phonon interaction,
whereas the hot-electron effect is demonstrated to be less important. This can
explain the discrepancy between the experimental observation and the previous
theoretical calculation [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 86}, 085202 (2012)], which deviates
from the experimental results by about two orders of magnitude at low
temperature. It is further shown that in the strong-electric-field regime with
$0.5\lesssim E \lesssim 2$~kV/cm, the spin relaxation is enhanced due to the
hot-electron effect, whereas the drift effect is demonstrated to be marginal.
Finally, we find that when $1.4 \lesssim E\lesssim 2$~kV/cm which lies in the
strong-electric-field regime, a small fraction of electrons ($\lesssim 5\%$)
can be driven from the L to $\Gamma$ valley, and the spin relaxation rates are
the same for the $\Gamma$ and L valleys in the intrinsic sample without
impurity. With the negligible influence of the spin dynamics in the $\Gamma$
valley to the whole system, the spin dynamics in the L valley can be measured
from the $\Gamma$ valley by the standard direct optical transition method.

galaxy formation and evolution. Recent studies have pointed out that extracting
merger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;
different tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These
differences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as
input for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different
halo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z=0 galaxy
properties in our model show differences between trees when using a common
parameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of
satellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different
construction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for
each tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxy
properties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary
histories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,
resulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing
by factors of 2. Such a change alters the regimes where star formation is
primarily suppressed by supernovae. Therefore, halo merger trees extracted from
a common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result in
a difference in the semi-analytic model. Given the uncertainties in galaxy
formation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed as
significant.

elucidate the close relationship between the pair amplitude of the

sufficiently large scales, where $b_v$ is the volume weighted halo(galaxy)

fundamental assumption has not been robustly verified in numerical simulations.
Furthermore, it is challenged by structure formation theory (BBKS, 1986, ApJ;
Desjacques and Sheth, 2010, PRD), which predicts the existence of velocity bias
(at least for proto-halos) due to the fact that halos reside in special regions
(local density peaks). The major obstacle to measure the volume weighted
velocity from N-body simulations is an unphysical sampling artifact. It is
entangled in the measured velocity statistics and becomes significant for
sparse populations. With recently improved understanding of the sampling
artifact (Zhang, Zheng and Jing, 2015, PRD; Zheng, Zhang and Jing, 2015, PRD),
for the first time we are able to {\it appropriately correct this sampling
artifact and then robustly measure the volume weighted halo velocity bias}. (1)
We verify $b_v=1$ within $2\%$ model uncertainty at $k\lesssim 0.1h/$Mpc and
$z=0$-$2$ for halos of mass $\sim 10^{12}$-$10^{13} h^{-1} M_\odot$, and,
therefore, consolidates a foundation of the peculiar velocity cosmology. (2) We
also find statistically significant signs of $b_v\neq 1$ at $k\gtrsim
0.1h/$Mpc. Unfortunately, whether this is real or caused by residual sampling
artifact requires further investigation. Nevertheless, cosmology based on
$k\gtrsim 0.1h/$Mpc velocity data shall be careful this potential velocity

because different segments of the sequence alignment support different

can also lead to phylogenetic tree incongruence across the sequence alignment.
Current methods for detection of phylogenetic incongruence are not equipped to
distinguish between these two different mechanisms and assume that the

make this distinction, based on synonymous codon substitution distances.
Although some power is lost by discarding the information contained in the
nonsynonymous substitutions, our new method has lower false positive
probabilities than the comparable recombination detection method when the
phylogenetic incongruence signal is due to convergent evolution. We apply our

quantum system changes diabatically its microscopic configuration. Pairing
correlations tend to make the large-amplitude nuclear collective motion more
adiabatic by reducing the effect of those configuration changes. Competition
between pairing and level crossing is thus expected to have a profound impact
on spontaneous fission lifetimes. To elucidate the role of nucleonic pairing on
spontaneous fission, we study the dynamic fission trajectories of $^{264}$Fm
and $^{240}$Pu using the state-of-the-art self-consistent framework. We employ
the superfluid nuclear density functional theory with the Skyrme energy density
functional SkM$^*$ and a density-dependent pairing interaction. Along with
shape variables, proton and neutron pairing correlations are taken as
collective coordinates. The collective inertia tensor is calculated within the
nonperturbative cranking approximation. The fission paths are obtained by using
the least action principle in a four-dimensional collective space of shape and
pairing coordinates. Pairing correlations are enhanced along the minimum-action
fission path. For the symmetric fission of $^{264}$Fm, where the effect of
triaxiality on the fission barrier is large, the geometry of fission pathway in
the space of shape degrees of freedom is weakly impacted by pairing. This is
not the case for $^{240}$Pu where pairing fluctuations restore the axial
symmetry of the dynamic fission trajectory. The minimum-action fission path is
strongly impacted by nucleonic pairing. In some cases, the dynamical coupling
between shape and pairing degrees of freedom can lead to a dramatic departure
from the static picture. Consequently, in the dynamical description of nuclear
fission, particle-particle correlations should be considered on the same
footing as those associated with shape degrees of freedom.

and Doppler stretch estimation of an extended target is considered in this
paper. The integral representations of the CRLBs for both the time delay and
the Doppler stretch are derived. To facilitate computation and analysis, series
representations and approximations of the CRLBs are introduced. According to
these series representations, the impact of several waveform parameters on the
estimation accuracy is investigated, which reveals that the CRLB of the Doppler
stretch is inversely proportional to the effective time-bandwidth product of
the waveform. This conclusion generalizes a previous result in the narrowband
case. The popular wideband ambiguity function (WBAF) based delay-Doppler
estimator is evaluated and compared with the CRLBs through numerical
experiments. Our results indicate that the WBAF estimator, originally derived
from a single scatterer model, is not suitable for the parameter estimation of
an extended target.

beamforming in a point-to-point MISO-OFDM channel. For the first method, a
receiver with perfect channel information, quantizes and feeds back the optimal
transmit beamforming vectors of a few selected subcarriers, which are equally
spaced. Based on those quantized vectors, the transmitter applies either
constant, linear, or higher-order interpolation with the remaining beamforming
vectors. With constant interpolation, we derive the approximate sum achievable
rate and the optimal cluster size that maximizes the approximate rate. For
linear interpolation, we derive a closed-form expression for the phase rotation
by utilizing the correlation between OFDM subcarriers. We also propose a
higher-order interpolation that requires more than two quantized vectors to
interpolate transmit beamformers, and is based on existing channel estimation
methods. Numerical results show that interpolation with the optimized cluster
size can perform significantly better than that with an arbitrary cluster size.
For the second proposed method, a channel impulse response is quantized with a
uniform scalar quantizer. With channel quantization, we also derive the
approximate sum achievable rate. We show that switching between the two methods
for different feedback-rate requirements can perform better than the existing
schemes.

statistical tool in searches for supersymmetric particles performed by ATLAS.
  HistFitter is a programmable and flexible framework to build, book-keep, fit,
interpret and present results of data models of nearly arbitrary complexity.
Starting from an object-oriented configuration, defined by users, the framework
builds probability density functions that are automatically fitted to data and
interpreted with statistical tests. A key innovation of HistFitter is its
design, which is rooted in core analysis strategies of particle physics. The
concepts of control, signal and validation regions are woven into its very
fabric. These are progressively treated with statistically rigorous built-in
methods. Being capable of working with multiple data models at once, HistFitter
introduces an additional level of abstraction that allows for easy bookkeeping,
manipulation and testing of large collections of signal hypotheses. Finally,
HistFitter provides a collection of tools to present results with
publication-quality style through a simple command-line interface.

Within this model we prove a natural $d$-dimensional analog of these graph

nonvanishing of the real $d$-th homology of complexes from $X_d(n,p)$. We also
compute the real Betti numbers of $X_d(n,p)$ for $p=c/n$. Finally, we establish
the emergence of giant shadow at this threshold. (For $d=1$ a giant shadow and
a giant component are equivalent). Unlike the case for graphs, for $d\ge 2$ the
emergence of the giant shadow is a first order phase transition.

incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the
renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the
stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the
power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may
be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation
of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However,
V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently.
Thus it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a
preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network,
whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and
regulation-down, separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can
be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the
grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we
extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism which
can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the
actual system follow the analytical model.

SWIPT system is considered where two multi-antenna stations perform separate PT
and IT to a multi-antenna mobile to accommodate their difference in ranges. The
mobile dynamically assigns each antenna for either PT or IT. The antenna
partitioning results in a tradeoff between the MIMO IT channel capacity and the
PT efficiency. The optimal partitioning for maximizing the IT rate under a PT
constraint is a NP-hard integer program, and the paper proposes solving it via
efficient greedy algorithms with guaranteed performance. To this end, the
antenna-partitioning problem is proved to be one that optimizes a sub-modular
function over a matroid constraint. This structure allows the application of
two well-known greedy algorithms that yield solutions no smaller than the
optimal one scaled by factors $(1-1/e)$ and 1/2, respectively.

study reveals that negative charges on the side-facets pushes the electron
cloud inward resulting in the formation of 2DEG in the central plane parallel
to the wall height. This confinement is evidenced from several orders of
magnitude enhancement of electron mobility as compared to bulk, observation of
weak localization effect in low temperature magneto-transport studies as well
as the reduction of both the elastic and inelastic scattering rates with the
average width of the walls. Importantly, the phase coherence length has been
found to be as high as 20 {\mu}m, which makes the system potentially
interesting for spin-tronics. Schrodinger and the Poisson equations are solved
self-consistently taking into account the surface charge accumulation effect.

Subsequently, we analyze the orbital characteristics of the parts of the stream
that approach the Earth's orbit. Modelled orbits of the stream particles are
compared with the orbits of actual photographic, video, and radar meteors from
several catalogues. The whole procedure is repeated for several past perihelion
passages of the parent comet. To keep our description compact but detailed, we
usually present only either a single or a few parent comets with their
associated showers in one paper. Here, an overview of the results from the

associate meteor showers which exhibit a symmetry of their radiant areas with
respect to the ecliptic (ecliptical, toroidal, or showers of an
ecliptic-toroidal structure), and there are showers which have no counterpart
with a similar ecliptical longitude on the opposite hemisphere. However,
symmetry of the radiant areas of the pair filaments with respect to the Earth's

the precise characterization of orbiting exoplanets and the correct

extremely important because all the other stellar parameters depend on them.
Using our standard equivalent-width method on high-resolution spectroscopy,
good precision can be obtained for the derived effective temperature and
metallicity. The surface gravity, however, is usually not well constrained with
spectroscopy. We use two different samples of FGK dwarfs to study the effect of
the stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of the
other atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, we present a straightforward formula
for correcting the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method and
with our linelists. Our spectroscopic analysis is based on Kurucz models in
LTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters. The
surface gravity was either left free or fixed to a predetermined value. The
latter is either obtained through a photometric transit light curve or derived
using asteroseismology. We find first that, despite some minor trends, the
effective temperatures and metallicities for FGK dwarfs derived with the
described method and linelists are, in most cases, only affected within the
errorbars by using different values for the surface gravity, even for very
large differences in surface gravity, so they can be trusted. The temperatures
derived with a fixed surface gravity continue to be compatible within 1 sigma
with the accurate results of the InfraRed Flux Method (IRFM), as is the case
for the unconstrained temperatures. Secondly, we find that the spectroscopic
surface gravity can easily be corrected to a more accurate value using a linear
function with the effective temperature.

assume that the missing baryons reside in a form of Warm Hot Intergalactic
Medium, i.e. the WHIM. Our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent large
scale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the Cosmic
Web and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated to the WHIM, (b) map
its luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numerical
simulations to relate the luminosity density to the density of the WHIM, (d)
apply this relation to real data to trace the WHIM using the observed galaxy
luminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF redshift surveys. In our
application we find evidence for the WHIM along the line of sight to the
Sculptor Wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported X-ray
absorption line detections. Our indirect WHIM detection technique complements
the standard method based on the detection of characteristic X-ray absorption
lines, showing that the galaxy luminosity density is a reliable signpost for
the WHIM. For this reason, our method could be applied to current galaxy
surveys to optimise the observational strategies for detecting and studying the
WHIM and its properties. Our estimates of the WHIM hydrogen column density in
Sculptor agree with those obtained via the X-ray analysis. Due to the
additional column density estimate, our method has potential for improving the
constrains of the physical parameters of the WHIM as derived with X-ray
absorption, and thus for improving the understanding of the missing baryons
problem.

velocity in ultrathin magnetic wires has opened new opportunities for
spintronic devices. However, there is still no consensus on the underlying
mechanisms of DW motion. Key to this debate is the DW structure, which can be
of Bloch or N\'eel type, and dramatically affects the efficiency of the
different proposed mechanisms. To date, most experiments aiming to address this
question have relied on deducing the DW structure and chirality from its motion
under additional in-plane applied fields, which is indirect and involves strong
assumptions on its dynamics. Here we introduce a general method enabling
direct, in situ, determination of the DW structure in ultrathin ferromagnets.
It relies on local measurements of the stray field distribution above the DW
using a scanning nanomagnetometer based on the Nitrogen-Vacancy defect in
diamond. We first apply the method to a Ta/Co40Fe40B20(1 nm)/MgO magnetic wire
and find clear signature of pure Bloch DWs. In contrast, we observe left-handed
N\'eel DWs in a Pt/Co(0.6 nm)/AlOx wire, providing direct evidence for the
presence of a sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at the Pt/Co
interface. This method offers a new path for exploring interfacial DMI in
ultrathin ferromagnets and elucidating the physics of DW motion under current.

person are at the core of many individual and global conflicts. Yet little is
known about how people behave when facing these situations in the lab. Here we
report a large experiment in which participants could either take $x$ dollars
from another anonymous participant or give $y$ dollars to the same participant.
Depending on the treatments, participants could also exit the game without
making any decision, but paying a cost. Across different protocols and
parameter specifications, we provide evidence of three regularities: (i) when
exiting is allowed and costless, subjects tend to exit the game; (ii) females
are more likely than males to exit the game, but only when the cost is small;
(iii) when exiting is not allowed, altruistic actions are more common than
predicted by the dominant economic models. In particular, against the
predictions of every dominant economic model, about one sixth of the subjects
show hyper-altruistic tendencies, that is, they prefer giving $y$ rather than
taking $x>y$. In doing so, our findings shed light on human decision-making in
conflictual situations and suggest that economic models should be revised in
order to take into account hyper-altruistic behaviour.

trade-off between space-based engineering complexity and the rate of

generalize the mapping to systems with an intrinsically gapless bulk. In
particular, we construct mechanical counterparts of topological semimetals. The
resulting gapless bulk modes are physically distinct from the usual acoustic
Goldstone phonons, and appear even in the absence of continuous translation
invariance. Moreover, the zero-frequency phonon modes feature adjustable
momenta and are topologically protected as long as the lattice coordination is
unchanged. Such protected soft modes with tunable wavevector may be useful in
designing mechanical structures with fault-tolerant properties.

towards the central star, the trapping of dust inside persistent vortices in

lead to planetesimal formation. Although a few special cases have been
discussed, exhaustive studies of possible quasi-steady configurations available
for dust-laden vortices and their stability have yet to be undertaken, thus
their viability or otherwise as locations for the gravitational instability to
take hold and seed planet formation is unclear. In this paper we generalise and
extend the well known Kida solution to obtain a series of steady state
solutions with varying vorticity and dust density distributions in their cores,
in the limit of perfectly coupled dust and gas. We then present a local
stability analysis of these configurations, considering perturbations localised
on streamlines. Typical parametric instabilities found have growthrates of
$~0.05\Omega_P$, where $\Omega_P$ is the angular velocity at the centre of the
vortex. Models with density excess can exhibit many narrow parametric
instability bands while those with a concentrated vorticity source display
internal shear which significantly affects their stability. However, the
existence of these parametric instabilities may not necessarily prevent the
possibility of dust accumulation in vortices.

estimated to be 3.80 - 4.25 Gyr from the mass-radius diagram and 3.9 - 4.6 Gyr

significantly higher than those reported so far. The derived apparent distance
modulus of 11.65 mag agrees well with the range of 10.9 - 12.2 mag derived by
other authors; however our estimated reddening (0.113 mag) is lower than the
lowest published value (0.15 mag). We confirm earlier observations that model
atmospheres are not accurate enough to account for the whole CMD of the
cluster, with the largest discrepancies appearing on the subgiant and giant
branches. Although age estimation from the mass-radius diagram is a relatively
safe, distance- and reddening-independent procedure, our results should be
verified by photometric and spectroscopic observations of additional detached

the use of the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) technique. It has been shown that the
strain-inducing size misfit between the substrate and the overlayer produces
long range dipole-monopole (d-m) interaction between the mobile adatoms and the
islands. To simplify the account of the long range interactions in the KMC
simulations, use has been made of a modified square island model. Analytic
formula for the interaction between the point surface monopole and the dipole
forces has been derived and used to obtain a simple expression for the
interaction between the mobile adatom and the rectangular island. The d-m
interaction was found to be longer ranged than the conventional dipole-dipole
potential. The narrowing of the island size distributions (ISDs) observed in
the simulations was shown to be a consequence of a weaker repulsion of adatoms
from small islands than from large ones which led to the preferential growth of
the former. Furthermore, similarly to the unstrained case, the power-law
behavior of the average island size and of the island density on the coverage
has been found. In contrast to the unstrained case, the value of the scaling
exponent was not universal but strongly dependent on the strength of the long
range interactions. Qualitative agreement of the simulation results with some
previously unexplained behaviors of experimental ISDs in the growth of
semiconductor quantum dots was observed.

nickel-etched-graphene electrodes were fabricated on MoS2 that yield contact
resistance as low as 200 ohm-um. The substantial contact enhancement (~2 orders
of magnitude) as compared to pure nickel electrodes, is attributed to the much
smaller work function of nickel-graphene electrodes, together with the fact
that presence of zigzag edges in the treated graphene surface enhances
tunneling between nickel and graphene. To this end, the successful fabrication
of a clean graphene-MoS2 interface and a low resistance nickel-graphene

corresponding to the limit of small screening, where effective pair potentials
converge faster than the Ewald sum. Secondly, an Ewald regime, where the plain
real space Ewald sum converges faster. Tuning the screening parameter for
optimal convergence occurs essentially at the crossover. The implication is
that effective pair potentials are an alternative to the Ewald sum only in
those cases where optimization of the convergence error is not possible.

Spicules at
the limb appear as relatively small and dynamic jets that are observed to
everywhere stick out. Many papers emphasize the important role spicules might
play in the energy and mass balance of the chromosphere and corona. However,
many aspects of spicules remain a mystery. In this Letter we shed more light on
the multi-threaded nature of spicules and their torsional component. We use
high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution observations from the Swedish
1-m Solar Telescope in the H{\alpha} spectral line. The data targets the limb
and we extract spectra from spicules far out from the limb to reduce the
line-of-sight superposition effect. We discover that many spicules display very
asymmetric spectra with some even showing multiple peaks. To quantify this
asymmetry we use a double Gaussian fitting procedure and find an average
velocity difference between the single Gaussian components to be between 20-30
km s$^{-1}$ for a sample of 57 spicules. We observe that spicules show
significant sub-structure where one spicule consists of many 'threads'. We
interpret the asymmetric spectra as line-of-sight superposition of threads in
one spicule and therefore have a measure for a perpendicular flow inside
spicules which will be important for future numerical model to reproduce. In
addition we show examples of {\lambda}-x-slices perpendicular across spicules
and find spectral tilts in individual threads providing further evidence for
the complex dynamical nature of spicules.

restricting the analysis to isotropic fluid configurations, we made use of a
constant electrical conductivity coefficient for the fluid (plasma), and the
nonlinear stability for the case of an infinitely conducting plasma is also
considered. As a result of this analysis we provide a complete classification
and characterization of various stable and unstable configurations. We found in

accurate analysis of data-path delay. This process is fast because delay is
picked from Look Up Tables (LUT) rather than conventional SPICE simulations.
But accuracy of this method depends upon the underlying delay model with which
LUT was characterized. Non Linear Delay Model (NLDM) based LUTs are quite
common in industries. These LUT requires huge amount to time during
characterization because of huge number of SPICE simulations done at arbitrary
points. To improve this people proposed various other delay models like
alpha-power and piecewise linear delay models. Bulusu et al proposed Linear
Delay Model(LDM) which reduces LUT generation time to 50 percent. LDM divides
delay curve w.r.t input rise time(trin) into two different region one is linear
and other is non-linear. This boundary point between linear and non- linear
region was called break point (trb). Linear region will be done if we simulate
at only two points. This advantage will be possible by having knowledge of this
break point at various PVT corners. In this paper, We will analyze this break
point and will give a formula to find out this at various PVT corners.
Knowledge about (trb) will restrict LUT simulations only in non-linear region
and will help us in saving huge amount of time during LUT characterization.

In spacial dimension 2, this system demonstrates a balance between the

a result, there exists a critical ""mass"" (i.e. total cell's population) above

efforts of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)
and the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). Our method takes into
account the spectroscopic constraints derived from the APOGEE Stellar
Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, together with the asteroseismic
parameters from KASC. These parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsic
stellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the Bayesian tool
PARAM. We then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observed
photometry in SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE passbands. The first 1989 giants targeted
by APOKASC are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, with
individual uncertainties of just ~1.8 per cent. Our extinction estimates are
systematically smaller than provided in the Kepler Input Catalogue and by the
Schlegel, Finkbeiner and Davis maps. Distances to individual stars in the NGC
6791 and NGC 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals.
Comparison with the APOGEE red clump and SAGA catalogues provide another useful
check, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few percent.
Overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinction
determinations for the bulk of the APOKASC sample. Approximately one third of
the stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions and
hence increased uncertainties. Uncertainties are expected to be reduced in
future releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will have

formation rate and evolution of the cloud. Our results indicate that, although

capturing the entire history is difficult as we ignore any star formation that

optical initialization and readout of electronic spin in a single

Coherent population trapping (CPT) is used to demonstrate coherent preparation

defining a background state and studying the linear stability of the small
fluctuations around such a state. Weakly non-linear theories can be constructed
using higher order expansions terms. While these methods have undoubtedly great
value for elucidating the relevant physical processes, they are unable to
follow the dynamics of a turbulent atmosphere. We provide a first example of
extension of the classical stability analysis to a non-linearly evolving
quasi-geostrophic flow. The so-called covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) provide
a covariant basis describing the directions of exponential expansion and decay
of perturbations to the non-linear trajectory of the flow. We use such a
formalism to re-examine the basic barotropic and baroclinic processes of the
atmosphere with a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane two-layer model in a periodic
channel driven by a forced meridional temperature gradient $\Delta T$. We
explore three settings of $\Delta T$, representative of relatively weak
turbulence, well-developed turbulence, and intermediate conditions. We
construct the Lorenz energy cycle for each CLV describing the energy exchanges
with the background state. A positive baroclinic conversion rate is a necessary
but not sufficient condition of instability. Barotropic instability is present
only for few very unstable CLVs for large values of $\Delta T$. Slowly growing
and decaying hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes closely mirror the properties of the
background flow. Following classical necessary conditions for
barotropic/baroclinic instability, we find a clear relationship between the
properties of the eddy fluxes of a CLV and its instability. CLVs with positive
baroclinic conversion seem to form a set of modes for constructing a reduced
model of the atmosphere dynamics.

$minrank_q(G)\leq k$ iff there exists a homomorphism from the complement of the
graph $G$ to the complement of a particular undirected graph family called
""graph family $\{G_k\}$"". As observed in [2], by combining these two results
one can relate the linear index coding problem of undirected graphs to the
graph homomorphism problem. In [4], a direct connection between linear index
coding problem and graph homomorphism problem is introduced. In contrast to the
former approach, the direct connection holds for digraphs as well and applies
to any field size. More precisely, in [4], a graph family $\{H_k^q\}$ is
introduced and shown that whether or not the scalar linear index of a digraph
$G$ is less than or equal to $k$ is equivalent to the existence of a graph
homomorphism from the complement of $G$ to the complement of $H_k^q$.
  Here, we first study the structure of the digraphs $H_k^q$. Analogous to the
result of [2] about undirected graphs, we prove that $H_k^q$'s are vertex
transitive digraphs. Using this, and by applying a lemma of Hell and Nesetril
[5], we derive a class of necessary conditions for digraphs $G$ to satisfy
$lind_q(G)\leq k$. Particularly, we obtain new lower bounds on $lind_q(G)$.
  Our next result is about the computational complexity of scalar linear index
of a digraph. It is known that deciding whether the scalar linear index of an
undirected graph is equal to $k$ or not is NP-complete for $k\ge 3$ and is
polynomially decidable for $k=1,2$ [3]. For digraphs, it is shown in [6] that
for the binary alphabet, the decision problem for $k=2$ is NP-complete. We use
graph homomorphism framework to extend this result to arbitrary alphabet.

exciton condensate using dipolaritonic setup with an optical pumping.
Dipolaritons are bosonic quasiparticles which arise from the coupling between
cavity photon (C), direct exciton (DX), and indirect exciton (IX) modes, and
appear in a double quantum well embedded in a semiconductor microcavity.
Controlling the detuning between modes of the system, the limiting cases of
exciton-polaritons and indirect excitons can be realized. Our protocol relies
on the initial preparation of an exciton polariton condensate for the far
blue-detuned IX mode, with its subsequent adiabatic transformation to an
indirect exciton condensate by lowering IX energy via applied electric field.
The following allows for generation of a spatially localized cold exciton gas,
on the contrary to currently used methods, where IX cloud appears due to
diffusion of carriers from spatially separated electron- and hole-rich areas.

escape-route to reconcile eV sterile neutrino hints from short-baseline
anomalies with cosmological observations. In particular models with coupling
g_X \gtrsim 10^{-2} and gauge boson mediators $X$ with $M_X \lesssim 10$ MeV
lead to large matter potential suppressing the sterile neutrino production
before the neutrino decoupling. With this choice of parameter ranges, big bang
nucleosynthesis is left unchanged and gives no bound on the model. However, we
show that at lower temperatures when active-sterile oscillations are no longer
matter suppressed, sterile neutrinos are still in a collisional regime, due to
their secret self-interactions. The interplay between vacuum oscillations and
collisions leads to a scattering-induced decoherent production of sterile
neutrinos with a fast rate. This process is responsible for a flavor
equilibration among the different neutrino species. We explore the effect of
this large sterile neutrino population on cosmological observables. We find
that a signature of strong secret interactions would be a reduction of the
effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$ at matter radiation equality down
to 2.7. Moreover, for $M_X \gtrsim g_X$ MeV sterile neutrinos would be
free-streaming before becoming non-relativistic and they would affect the
large-scale structure power spectrum. As a consequence, for this range of
parameters we find a tension of a eV mass sterile state with cosmological

and engineering and are (approximately) solved by a variety of algorithms.
Existing algorithms usually only have local convergence or subsequence
convergence of their iterates. We propose an algorithm for a generic nonconvex
optimization formulation, establish the convergence of its whole iterate
sequence to a critical point along with a rate of convergence, and numerically
demonstrate its efficiency.
  Specially, we consider the problem of minimizing a nonconvex objective
function. Its variables can be treated as one block or be partitioned into
multiple disjoint blocks. It is assumed that each non-differentiable component
of the objective function or each constraint applies to one block of variables.
The differentiable components of the objective function, however, can apply to
one or multiple blocks of variables together.
  Our algorithm updates one block of variables at time by minimizing a certain
prox-linear surrogate. The order of update can be either deterministic or
randomly shuffled in each round. We obtain the convergence of the whole iterate
sequence under fairly loose conditions including, in particular, the
Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition, which is satisfied by a broad class of
nonconvex/nonsmooth applications.
  We apply our convergence result to the coordinate descent method for
non-convex regularized linear regression and also a modified rank-one residue
iteration method for nonnegative matrix factorization. We show that both the
methods have global convergence. Numerically, we test our algorithm on
nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization problems, with random shuffling
enable to avoid local solutions.

Furthermore, cloud computing for mobile systems (i.e., systems in which the

construct an encrypted program known as garbled circuit. Next, using garbled
inputs from a mobile client, another server executes this garbled circuit and
returns the resulting garbled outputs. Our system assures privacy of the mobile
client's data, even if the executing server chooses to collude with all but one
of the other servers. We adapt the garbled circuit design of Beaver et al. and
the secure multiparty computation protocol of Goldreich et al. for the purpose
of building a secure cloud computing for mobile systems. Our method
incorporates the novel use of the cryptographically secure pseudo random number
generator of Blum et al. that enables the mobile client to efficiently retrieve
the result of the computation, as well as to verify that the evaluator actually
performed the computation. We analyze the server-side and client-side

the single interval Renyi entropies and entanglement entropy, and conjecture
that this dominates the answer in theories with a large central charge and a
sparse spectrum of low-dimension operators. The resulting entanglement
entropies agree precisely with holographic calculations in three-dimensional
gravity. High-energy eigenstates are dual to microstates of the BTZ black hole,
so the corresponding holographic calculation is a geodesic length in the black
hole geometry; agreement between these two answers demonstrates that
entanglement entropy thermalizes in individual microstates of holographic CFTs.
For local quenches, the dual geometry is a highly boosted black hole or conical
defect. On the CFT side, the rise in entanglement entropy after a quench is
directly related to the monodromy of a Virasoro conformal block.

these modes display strong anomalies and for some of them, a transfer of

that these modes are electromagnons. Remarkably, at least two of these modes

due to the difference in the number of protons of the colliding nuclei an
electric field emerges which is directed from the heavy to the light nucleus.
This strong electric field is only present for about 0.25 fm/c at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and leads to a splitting of the directed flow $v_1$
for particles with the same mass but opposite electric charges in case of an
early presence of charged quarks and antiquarks. The microscopic calculations
of the directed flow for $\pi^\pm, K^\pm, p$ and $\bar{p}$ are carried out in

trajectories. It is shown that the splitting of the directed flow as a function

The initial step of sporulation is asymmetric cell division, leading to a large
mother-cell and a small forespore compartment. After division is completed and
the dividing septum is thinned, the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a slow
process based on cell-wall degradation and synthesis. However, recently a new
cell-wall independent mechanism was shown to significantly contribute, which
can even lead to fast engulfment in $\sim$ 60 $%$ of the cases when the cell
wall is completely removed. In this backup mechanism, strong ligand-receptor
binding between mother-cell protein SpoIIIAH and forespore-protein SpoIIQ leads
to zipper-like engulfment, but quantitative understanding is missing. In our
work, we combined fluorescence image analysis and stochastic Langevin
simulations of the fluctuating membrane to investigate the origin of fast
bistable engulfment in absence of the cell wall. Our cell morphologies compare
favorably with experimental time-lapse microscopy, with engulfment sensitive to
the number of SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH bonds in a threshold-like manner. By systematic
exploration of model parameters, we predict regions of osmotic pressure and
membrane-surface tension that produce successful engulfment. Indeed, decreasing
the medium osmolarity in experiments prevents engulfment in line with our
predictions. Forespore engulfment may thus not only be an ideal model system to
study decision-making in single cells, but its biophysical principles are
likely applicable to engulfment in other cell types, e.g. during phagocytosis
in eukaryotes.

secondary resonances within the tadpole domain of motion. We consider the limit
of a massless trojan companion of a giant planet. Without other planets, this
is a case of the elliptic restricted three body problem (ERTBP). The presence
of more planets (the restricted multi-planet problem, RMPP) induces new direct
and indirect secular effects on the trojan's dynamics. In the theoretical part
of this paper, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism in action-angle variables,
which allows to treat in a unified way resonant dynamics and secular effects on
the trojan body in both the ERTBP or the RMPP. Our formalism leads to a
decomposition of the Hamiltonian in two parts, $H=H_b+H_{sec}$. $H_b$, called
the basic model, describes resonant dynamics in the short-period (epicyclic)
and synodic (libration) degrees of freedom. $H_{sec}$ contains only terms
depending on slow (secular) angles. $H_b$ is formally identical in the ERTBP
and the RMPP, apart from a re-definition of angular variables. An important
physical consequence is that the slow chaotic diffusion proceeds in both the
ERTBP and the RMPP by a qualitatively similar dynamical mechanism better
approximated by the paradigm of `modulational diffusion'. In the numerical
part, we focus on the ERTBP for making a numerical demonstration of the chaotic
diffusion process along resonances. Using color stability maps, we provide a
survey of the resonant web for characteristic mass parameters of the primary,
in which the secondary resonances from 1:5 to 1:12 (ratio of the short over the
synodic period) and their resonant multiplets appear. We give numerical
examples of diffusion of weakly chaotic orbits in the resonant web. We make a
statistics of the escaping times in the resonant domain, and find power-law
tails of the distribution of escaping times for slowly diffusing chaotic
orbits.

matrices of order five are equivalent with the Fourier matrix $F_5$ by
constructing circulant matrices that lead to new Hadamard matrices. An
important item is the construction of new mutually unbiased bases that are a
basic concept of quantum theory and play an essential role in quantum
tomography, quantum cryptografy, teleportation, construction of dense coding
schemes, classical signal proccesing, etc.

  Relationship to the Non-Thermal Effects of Microwaves","45 pages, 18 figures, 10 tables. There is an update in the

radiation have increased globally. Computer simulation models were developed to
assess exposure of square, rectangular, pyramidal, and cylindrical water
containers to microwave radiation at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz. The development
of the models included determination of EM field distribution and the resulting
specific absorption rate (SAR) in the stored water. These models employed CST
STUDIO SUITE 2014 package to solve EM field equations by applying the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The effect of frequency, packaging
shape, and polarization on SAR induced in water was determined. High electric
field and point SAR were obtained over the whole azimuth and elevation angles
range in the pyramidal container model. The highest values of SAR were induced
in water at the sharp edges of the four water container models. The order of
the effect on total SAR and maximum point SAR is cylindrical < square <
rectangular < pyramidal model at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz for both vertical and
horizontal polarizations. It can be concluded that the variation in the
packaging shape of the containers, polarization, irradiation geometry, and
frequency. In addition, the sharp edges of the container models significantly
affect the calculation and distribution of electric and magnetic fields and SAR
values induced in the stored water, which in turn could cause variations in the
non-thermal effects of the electromagnetic fields in the stored water.

operators are available in the literature. Here we consider actual Durrmeyer
variant of the operators due to [10]. It is observed here that the Durrmeyer
variant has the nice properties and one need not to take any restriction on
$\beta$ in order to get convergence. We establish moments using the Tricomi's
confluent hypergeometric function and Stirling numbers of first kind, also
estimate some direct results

illustrate the famous Heisenberg's uncertainty principle based on Otto-Wiener's
experiment (1890) associated with standing light waves. This illustration is
quite easy as well as far more realizing than all other thought experiments
generally found in textbooks. In this work seeding of quantum nature of light
has been done with the Otto-Wiener's experiment. May be this new thought
experiment will help the students to understand the Heisenberg's principle in a
better way and also enhance their interest of learning quantum mechanics from
the beginning of their course.

computing. Both technologies complement each other. Quantum clouds, therefore,
is deploying the resources of quantum computation in a cloud environment to
provide solution to the challenges and problems faced by present model of
classical cloud computation. State of the art challenges faced by the cloud
such as VM migration, data security, traffic management can be addressed by the
quantum principles. But the merging of these two technologies have challenges
of their own which need to be addressed before moving forward. What are those
challenges and how does a quantum computer solve the cloud problems? The
relation among quantum parallelism, superposition and flash crowd effect;
Laundauer's principle and energy management; photon polarization principle and
data security; these fascinating queries are addressed in the paper.
