from inflation has focused interest on the potential for early-Universe
cosmology using observations of gravitational waves. In addition to cosmic
microwave background detectors, efforts are underway to carry out
gravitational-wave astronomy over a wide range of frequencies including pulsar
timing arrays (nHz), space-based detectors (mHz), and terrestrial detectors
($\sim$10-2000 Hz). This multiband effort will probe a wide range of times in
the early Universe (each corresponding to a different energy scale), during
which gravitational-wave backgrounds may have been produced through processes
such as phase transitions or preheating. In this letter, we derive a rule of
thumb (not quite so strong as an upper limit) governing the maximum energy
density of cosmological backgrounds. For most cosmological scenarios, we expect
the energy density spectrum to peak at values of
$\Omega_\text{gw}(f)\lesssim10^{-12\pm2}$. We discuss the applicability of this
rule of thumb and the implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.

interferometric and spectroscopic measurements and combining them with
photometry from the literature. The interferometric measurements were obtained
using the visible interferometer VEGA on the CHARA array and we determined a 1D
limb-darkened angular diameter of 0.353 +/- 0.013 milliarcseconds. Using
photometry from the literature we derived the bolometric flux with two
solutions: a zero-reddening one of Fbol = 3.890 +/- 0.066 1E-8 erg/s/cm2 and a
solution with a maximum of Av = 0.1 mag, Fbol= 4.220 +/- 0.067 1E-8 erg/s/cm2.
The interferometric Teff is thus 5534 +/- 103 K or 5647 +/- 105 K and its
radius is R = 2.21 +/- 0.08 Rsol. Spectroscopic measurements of HD140283 were
obtained using HARPS, NARVAL, and UVES and a 1D LTE analysis of H-alpha line
wings yields Teff(Halpha) = 5626 +/- 75 K. Using fine-tuned stellar models
including diffusion of elements we then determined the mass M and age t of
HD140283. Once the metallicity has been fixed, the age of the star depends on
M, initial helium abundance Yi and mixing-length parameter alpha, only two of
which are independent. We need to adjust alpha to much lower values than the
solar one (~2) in order to fit the observations, and if Av = 0.0 mag then 0.5 <
alpha < 1. We give an equation to estimate t from M, Yi (alpha) and Av.
Establishing a reference alpha = 1.00 and adopting Yi = 0.245 we derive a mass
and age of HD140283: M = 0.780 +/- 0.010 Msol and t = 13.7 +/- 0.7 Gyr (Av =
0.0) or M = 0.805 +/- 0.010 Msol and t = 12.2 +/- 0.6 Gyr (Av=0.1 mag). Our
stellar models yield an initial metallicity of [Z/X]i = -1.70 and logg = 3.65
+/- 0.03. Asteroseismic observations are critical for overcoming limitations in
our results.

probe the coherent and incoherent coupling of impulsive electronic excitation
at 1.55 eV (800 nm) to optical and acoustic phonon modes directly from the
perspective of the lattice degrees of freedom. A bi-exponential suppression of
diffracted intensity due to relaxation of the electronic system into incoherent
phonons is observed, with the 250 fs fast contribution dominated by coupling to
the $E_{2g2}$ optical phonon mode at the $\Gamma$-point ($\Gamma-E_{2g2}$) and
$A_1^{'}$ optical phonon mode at the $K$-point ($K-A_1^{'}$). Both modes have
Kohn anomalies at these points in the Brillouin zone. The result is a unique
non-equilibrium state with the electron subsystem in thermal equilibrium with
only a very small subset of the lattice degrees of freedom within 500 fs
following photoexcitation. This state relaxes through further electron-phonon
and phonon-phonon pathways on the 6 ps timescale. In addition, electronic
excitation leads to both in-plane and out-of-plane coherent lattice responses
in graphite whose character we are able to fully determine based on spot
positions and intensity modulations in the femtosecond electron diffraction
data. The in-plane motion is specifically a $\Gamma$-point shearing mode of the
graphene planes with an amplitude of approximately 0.06 pm and the out-of-plane
motion an acoustic breathing mode response of the film.

to a state in which the nanoparticles become dynamically decoupled. In this

the peak position can be predicted from Kittel's ferromagnetic resonance theory

bulk SO(3). We compare this boundary stress tensor to its hydrodynamic
counterpart with viscous corrections of up to second order, and compare the
conformally related stress tensor to ideal hydrodynamic simulations in
Minkowski space, initialized at various time slices of the boundary data. Our
findings reveal far-from-hydrodynamic behavior at early times, with a
transition to ideal hydrodynamics at late times.

dormancy, angiogenic dormancy and immunosurveillance have been proposed, a
comprehensive understanding of cancer dormancy and the ""switch"" from a dormant
to a proliferative state still needs to be strengthened from both a basic and
clinical point of view. Computational modeling enables one to explore a variety
of scenarios for possible but realistic microscopic dormancy mechanisms and
their predicted outcomes. The aim of this paper is to devise such a predictive
computational model of dormancy with an emergent ""switch"" behavior.
Specifically, we generalize a previous cellular automaton (CA) model for
proliferative growth of solid tumor that now incorporates a variety of
cell-level tumor-host interactions and different mechanisms for tumor dormancy,
for example the effects of the immune system. Our new CA rules induce a natural
""competition"" between the tumor and tumor suppression factors in the
microenvironment. This competition either results in a ""stalemate"" for a period
of time in which the tumor either eventually wins (spontaneously emerges) or is
eradicated; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before
such a ""stalemate"" could ever develop. We also predict that if the number of
actively dividing cells within the proliferative rim of the tumor reaches a
critical, yet low level, the dormant tumor has a high probability to resume
rapid growth. Our findings may shed light on the fundamental understanding of
cancer dormancy.

contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants,
none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.
  To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for
PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces
extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic
improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4
orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit
in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data
format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and
multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the
new types of information.
  The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in

tracking, and hence the sensitivity of optical interferometry, must decrease as
the number of apertures increases, at least in the near infrared where we are
still limited by detector readout noise. Here we present a Hierarchical Fringe
Tracking (HFT) concept with sensitivity at least equal to this of a two
apertures fringe trackers. HFT is based of the combination of the apertures in
pairs, then in pairs of pairs then in pairs of groups. The key HFT module is a
device that behaves like a spatial filter for two telescopes (2TSF) and
transmits all or most of the flux of a cophased pair in a single mode beam. We
give an example of such an achromatic 2TSF, based on very broadband dispersed
fringes analyzed by grids, and show that it allows piston measures from very
broadband fringes with only 3 to 5 pixels per fringe tracker. We show the
results of numerical simulation indicating that our device is a good achromatic
spatial filter and allowing a first evaluation of its coupling efficiency,
which is similar to this of a single mode fiber on a single aperture. Our very
preliminary results indicate that HFT has a good chance to be a serious
candidate for the most sensitive fringe tracking with the VLTI and also
interferometers with much larger number of apertures. On the VLTI the first
rough estimate of the magnitude gain with regard to the GRAVITY internal FT is
between 2.5 and 3.5 magnitudes in K, with a decisive impact on the VLTI science

between 30 and 300 GHz have made these bands an attractive candidate for
next-generation cellular systems. However, reliable communication at these
frequencies depends extensively on beamforming with very high-dimensional
antenna arrays. Estimating the channel sufficiently accurately to perform
beamforming can thus be challenging both due to low coherence time and large
number of antennas. Also, the measurements used for channel estimation may need
to be made with analog beamforming where the receiver can ""look"" in only
direction at a time. This work presents a novel method for estimation of the
receive-side spatial covariance matrix of a channel from a sequence of power
measurements made at different angular directions. The method reduces the
spatial covariance estimation to a matrix completion optimization problem. To
reduce the number of measurements, the optimization can incorporate the
low-rank constraints in the channels that are typical in the mmW setting. The
optimization is convex and fast, iterative methods are presented to solving the
problem. Simulations are presented for both single and multi-path channels
using channel models derived from real measurements in New York City at 28 GHz.

perform detailed calculations and a parameter scan. We find that the observed

host star) for the types of planetary systems the Korean Microlensing Telescope
Network is predicted to find. I examine the potential to obtain lens flux
measurements by 1) imaging a lens once it is spatially resolved from the
source, 2) measuring the elongation of the point spread function of the
microlensing target (lens+source) when the lens and source are still
unresolved, and 3) taking prompt follow-up photometry. In each case I simulate
observing programs for a representative example of current ground-based
adaptive optics (AO) facilities (specifically NACO on VLT), future ground-based
AO facilities (GMTIFS on GMT), and future space telescopes (NIRCAM on $JWST$).
Given the predicted distribution of relative lens-source proper motions, I find
that the lens flux could be measured to a precision of $\sigma_{H_{\ell}} \leq
0.1$ for $\gtrsim$60$\%$ of planet detections $\geq$5 years after each
microlensing event, for a simulated observing program using GMT that images
resolved lenses. NIRCAM on $JWST$ would be able to carry out equivalently
high-precision measurements for $\sim$28$\%$ of events $\Delta t$ = 10 years
after each event by imaging resolved lenses. I also explore the effects various
blend components would have on the mass derived from prompt follow-up
photometry, including companions to the lens, companions to the source, and
unassociated interloping stars. I find that undetected blend stars would cause
catastrophic failures (i.e., $>$50$\%$ fractional uncertainty in the inferred
lens mass) for $\lesssim$(16$\cdot f_{\rm bin})\%$ of planet detections, where
$f_{\rm bin}$ is the binary fraction, with the majority of these failures
occurring for host stars with mass $\lesssim$0.3$M_{\odot}$.

and WISE/2MASS NIR photometry, we apply a series of color and apparent
magnitude cuts to isolate candidate O and B stars that are plausibly associated
with the Smith Cloud. We find an excess of stars along the line of sight to the
cloud, but not at a statistically significant level relative to a control
region. The number of stars found in projection on the cloud after removing an
estimate of the contamination by the Milky Way implies an average star
formation rate surface density of 10^(-4.8 +/- 0.3) Msun yr^(-1) kpc^(-2),
assuming the cloud has been forming stars at a constant rate since its first
passage through the Milky Way ~70 Myr ago. This value is consistent with the
star formation rate expected based on the average gas density of the cloud. We
also discuss how the newly discovered star forming galaxy Leo P has very
similar properties to the Smith Cloud, but its young stellar population would
not have been detected at a statistically significant level using our method.
Thus, we cannot yet rule out the idea that the Smith Cloud is really a dwarf
galaxy.

late-type (M4-L6) candidate members of nearby young moving groups (YMGs) with
an expected false-positive rate of ~ 13%. This sample includes 79 new candidate
young brown dwarfs and 22 planetary-mass objects. These candidates were
identified through the first systematic all-sky survey for late-type low-mass
stars and brown dwarfs in YMGs. We cross-matched the 2MASS and ALLWISE catalogs
outside of the galactic plane to build a sample of 98 970 potential $\geq$ M5
dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and calculated their proper motions with
typical precisions of 5-15 mas yr$^{-1}$. We selected highly probable candidate
members of several YMGs from this sample using the Bayesian Analysis for Nearby
Young AssociatioNs II tool (BANYAN II). We used the most probable statistical
distances inferred from BANYAN II to estimate the spectral type and mass of
these candidate YMG members. We used this unique sample to show tentative signs
of mass segregation in the AB Doradus moving group and the Tucana-Horologium
and Columba associations. The BASS sample has already been successful in
identifying several new young brown dwarfs in earlier publications, and will be
of great interest in studying the initial mass function of YMGs and for the
search of exoplanets by direct imaging; the input sample of potential close-by
$\geq$ M5 dwarfs will be useful to study the kinematics of low-mass stars and
brown dwarfs and search for new proper motion pairs.

extent and high inequality affects it negatively. Moreover, in the case of

papers tried to analyse income and wealth distribution by employing
distributions such as Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann, lognormal
(Gibrat), and exponential. Generally, distributions describe mostly income and
less wealth distribution for low and middle income segment of population, which
accounts about 90% of the population. Our approach is based on a totally new
distribution, not used so far in the literature regarding income and wealth
distribution. Using cumulative distribution method, we find that polynomial
functions, regardless of their degree (first, second, or higher), can describe
with very high accuracy both income and wealth distribution. Moreover, we find
that polynomial functions describe income and wealth distribution for entire
population including upper income segment for which traditionally Pareto
distribution is used.

particularly the noble gases Ar, Kr, and Xe. While He, Ne and O are depleted,
seven other elements show similar enrichments ($\sim$3 times solar, relative to
H). Being volatile, Ar is difficult to fractionate from ${\rm H}_{2}$. We argue
that external photoevaporation by far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from nearby
massive stars removed ${\rm H}_{2}$, He, and Ne from the solar nebula, but Ar
and other species were retained because photoevaporation occurred at large
heliocentric distances where temperatures were cold enough ($\lt 30$ K) to trap
them in amorphous water ice. As the solar nebula lost H it became relatively
and uniformly enriched in other species. Our model improves on the similar
model of Guillot \& Hueso (2006). We recognize that cold temperatures alone do
not trap volatiles; continuous water vapor production also is necessary. We
demonstrate that FUV fluxes that photoevaporated the disk generated sufficient
water vapor, in regions $\lt 30$ K, to trap gas-phase species in amorphous
water ice, in solar proportions. We find more efficient chemical fractionation
in the outer disk: whereas the model of Guillot \& Hueso (2006) predicts a
factor of 3 enrichment when only $< 2\%$ of the disk mass remains, we find the
same enrichments when 30\% of the disk mass remains. Finally, we predict the
presence of $\sim 0.1 \, M_{\oplus}$ of water vapor in the outer solar nebula
and in protoplanetary disks in H II regions.

applications. Multifractal analysis is a useful signal and image processing
tool, yet, the accurate estimation of multifractal parameters for image texture
remains a challenge. This is due in the main to the fact that current
estimation procedures consist of performing linear regressions across frequency
scales of the two-dimensional (2D) dyadic wavelet transform, for which only a
few such scales are computable for images. The strongly non-Gaussian nature of
multifractal processes, combined with their complicated dependence structure,
makes it difficult to develop suitable models for parameter estimation. Here,
we propose a Bayesian procedure that addresses the difficulties in the
estimation of the multifractality parameter. The originality of the procedure
is threefold: The construction of a generic semi-parametric statistical model
for the logarithm of wavelet leaders; the formulation of Bayesian estimators
that are associated with this model and the set of parameter values admitted by
multifractal theory; the exploitation of a suitable Whittle approximation
within the Bayesian model which enables the otherwise infeasible evaluation of
the posterior distribution associated with the model. Performance is assessed
numerically for several 2D multifractal processes, for several image sizes and
a large range of process parameters. The procedure yields significant benefits
over current benchmark estimators in terms of estimation performance and
ability to discriminate between the two most commonly used classes of
multifractal process models. The gains in performance are particularly
pronounced for small image sizes, notably enabling for the first time the
analysis of image patches as small as 64x64 pixels.

on demixing for a series of symmetric non-additive hard spheres mixtures
confined in slit pores. We consider both a wide range of positive
non-additivities and a series of pore widths, ranging from the pure two
dimensional limit to a large pore width where results are close to the bulk
three dimensional case. Critical parameters are extracted by means of finite
size analysis. We find that for this particular case in which demixing is
induced by volume effects, phase separation is in most cases somewhat impeded
by spatial confinement. However, a non-monotonous dependence of the critical
pressure and density with pore size is found for small non-additivities. In
this latter case, it turns out that an otherwise stable bulk mixture can be
forced to demix by simple geometric confinement when the pore width decreases
down to approximately one and a half molecular diameters.

so high that the microgel particles are compressed. We find that the width of

decreases for softer microgels. For sufficiently soft microgels, the
suspensions are fluid-like, irrespective of volume fraction. By calculating the

the behavior of the phase-coexistence width correlates with whether or not the

  Dissecting the mass-SFR plane in COSMOS and GOODS","24 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables, published version in A&A",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The relation between the stellar mass and the star formation rate
characterizes how the instantaneous star formation is determined by the galaxy
past star formation history and by the growth of the dark matter structures. We
deconstruct the M-SFR plane by measuring the specific SFR functions in several
stellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. Our analysis is primary based on a
MIPS 24$\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the COSMOS and GOODS surveys. We
estimate the SFR by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.
The sSFR functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range
9.5<log(M/Msun)<11.5. First, we demonstrate the importance of taking into
account selection effects when studying the M-SFR relation. Secondly, we find a
mass-dependent evolution of the median sSFR with redshift varying as $sSFR
\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between
$M=10^{9.75}Msun$ and $M=10^{11.1}Msun$, respectively. At low masses, this
evolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictions
from semi-analytical models (SAM). This agreement breaks down for more massive
galaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of the
star-formation history in massive galaxies. Third, we obtain that the shape of
the sSFR function is invariant with time at z<1.4 but depends on the mass. We
observe a broadening of the sSFR function ranging from 0.28 dex at
$M=10^{9.75}Msun$ to 0.46 dex at $M=10^{11.1}Msun$. Such increase in the
scatter of the M-SFR relation suggests an increasing diversity of SFHs as the
stellar mass increases. Finally, we find a gradual decline of the sSFR with
mass as $log(sSFR) \propto -0.17M$. We discuss the numerous physical processes,
as gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can gradually
reduce the sSFR and increase the SFH diversity.

is shown to be a critical SL state adjacent to the CSL, characterized by the
gapless spin singlet excitations and also vanishing small spin triplet
excitations. The quantum phase transition from the CSL to the gapless critical
SL is driven by the collapsing of the neutral (spin singlet) excitation gap. By
following the evolution of entanglement spectrum, we find that the transition
takes place through the coupling of the edge states with opposite chiralities,
which merge into the bulk and become gapless neutral excitations. The effect of
the NN spin-$z$ coupling $J_z$ is also studied, which leads to a quantum phase
diagram with an extended regime for the gapless SL.

of vertices whose removal breaks the graph into two disconnected subsets that

the Vertex Separator Problem was formulated as a continuous
(non-concave/non-convex) bilinear quadratic program. In this paper, we develop
a more general continuous bilinear program which incorporates vertex weights,
and which applies to the coarse graphs that are generated in a multilevel
compression of the original Vertex Separator Problem. A Mountain Climbing
Algorithm is used to find a stationary point of the continuous bilinear
quadratic program, while second-order optimality conditions and perturbation
techniques are used to escape from either a stationary point or a local
maximizer. The algorithms for solving the continuous bilinear program are
employed during the solution and refinement phases in a multilevel scheme.
Computational results and comparisons demonstrate the advantage of the proposed
algorithm.

important for transport related science and engineering. The approaches of fast
laser process and electrical conductivity matching were used in previous
literature, which do not give accurate information on scattering relaxation
time as a function of carrier energy for intrinsic photon-free transport.
Graphene is considered as a model system in materials science studying for its
simple atomic and electronic structures. Here we have developed a new
methodology to detect the scattering relaxation time as a function of carrier
energy, which can be used to infer the carrier scattering mechanisms at
different temperatures. Our method utilizes the measured values of optimal
Seebeck coefficient, for both P-type and N-type materials. This new approach
can eliminate the influence from photon-carrier scattering in the fast-laser
method, and avoid the over-fitting issue in the electrical conductivity
matching method. We have then applied the new approach in the SiO2 substrated
graphene system, and discovered that the Dirac carriers are mainly scattered by
short-range interactions at 40 K. The scatter strength of long-range Coulomb
interaction increases with temperature. At 300 K, the long-range and
short-range interactions scatter the Dirac carriers with almost comparable

regularity than that for the global-in-time existence is usually imposed to

The aim of this paper is to seek the lowest regularity index for the optimal
decay rate of $L^{1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$-$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Consequently, a notion
of minimal decay regularity for dissipative systems of regularity-loss is
firstly proposed. To do this, we develop a new time-decay estimate of

the low frequency and high-frequency analysis in Fourier spaces. As an
application, for compressible Euler-Maxwell equations with the weaker
dissipative mechanism, it is shown that the minimal decay regularity coincides
with the critical regularity for global classical solutions. Moreover, the
recent decay property for symmetric hyperbolic systems with non-symmetric
dissipation is also extended to be the $L^p$-version.

analysis remains valid only for nonlinear systems in higher dimensions

provides the main motivation of this work. Firstly, we develop new time-decay
properties on the frequency-localization Duhamel principle. Furthermore, it is
shown that the classical solution and its derivatives of fractional order decay
at the optimal algebraic rate in dimension 1, by time-weighted energy
approaches in terms of low-frequency and high-frequency decompositions.

faults in hardware, which lead to corruption of stored values. Mission-critical
devices require such faults to be mitigated by fault-tolerance --- a
combination of techniques that aim at preserving the functional behaviour of a
system despite the disruptive effects of transient faults. Fault-tolerance
typically has a high deployment cost -- special hardware might be required to
implement it -- and provides weak statistical guarantees. It is also based on
the assumption that faults are rare. In this paper, we consider scenarios where
security, rather than functional correctness, is the main asset to be
protected. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we develop a theory for
expressing confidentiality of data in the presence of transient faults. We show
that the natural probabilistic definition of security in the presence of faults
can be captured by a possibilistic definition. Furthermore, the possibilistic
definition is implied by a known bisimulation-based property, called Strong
Security. Secondly, we illustrate the utility of these results for a simple
RISC architecture for which only the code memory and program counter are
assumed fault-tolerant. We present a type-directed compilation scheme that
produces RISC code from a higher-level language for which Strong Security holds
--- i.e. well-typed programs compile to RISC code which is secure despite
transient faults. In contrast with fault-tolerance solutions, our technique
assumes relatively little special hardware, gives formal guarantees, and works
in the presence of an active attacker who aggressively targets parts of a
system and induces faults precisely.

enhancement. In the present paper we explore the phase space in energy
intervals where we have orbits that act as building blocks for boxy-peanut
(b/p) and ""{\sf X}-shaped"" structures in rotating potentials of galactic type.
We underline the significance of the rotational tori around the 3D families
x1v1 and x1v1$^{\prime}$ that have been bifurcated from the planar x1 family.
These tori play a multiple role: (i) They belong to quasi-periodic orbits that
reinforce the local density. (ii) They act as obstacles for the diffusion of
chaotic orbits and (iii) they attract a large number of chaotic orbits that
become sticky to them. There are also bifurcations of unstable families (x1v2,
x1v2$^{\prime}$). Their unstable asymptotic curves wind around the x1v1 and
x1v1$^{\prime}$ tori generating orbits with hybrid morphologies between that of
x1v1 and x1v2. In addition, a new family of multiplicity 2, called x1mul2, is
found to be important for the peanut construction. Our work shows also that
there are peanut-supporting orbits before the vertical ILR. Non-periodic orbits
associated with the x1 family secure this contribution as well as the support
of b/p structures at several other energy intervals. Non-linear phenomena
associated with complex instability of single and double multiplicity families
of periodic orbits show that these structures are not interrupted in regions
where such orbits prevail. Depending on the main mechanism behind their
formation, boxy bulges exhibit different morphological features. Finally our
analysis indicates that ""X"" features shaped by orbits in the neighbourhood of
x1v1 and x1v1$^{\prime}$ periodic orbits are pronounced only in side-on or

in terms of dynamo theory may indicate that small and large bipoles trace
different components of the solar magnetic field. The other possible viewpoint
is that the difference in tilt data for small and large bipoles is connected

dimen\-sion reduction approaches that represent a compromise between the
parametric and fully nonparametric models for regressions or conditional laws.
In a mean regression setup, the SIM assumption means that the conditional
expectation of the response given the vector of covariates is the same as the
conditional expectation of the response given a scalar projection of the
covariate vector. In a conditional distribution modeling, under the SIM
assumption the conditional law of a response given the covariate vector
coincides with the conditional law given a linear combination of the
covariates. Several estimation techniques for single-index models are available
and commonly used in applications. However, the problem of testing the
goodness-of-fit seems less explored and the existing proposals still have some
major drawbacks. In this paper, a novel kernel-based approach for testing SIM
assumptions is introduced. The covariate vector needs not have a density and
only the index estimated under the SIM assumption is used in kernel smoothing.
Hence the effect of high-dimensional covariates is mitigated while asymptotic
normality of the test statistic is obtained. Irrespective of the fixed
dimension of the covariate vector, the new test detects local alternatives
approaching the null hypothesis slower than $n^{-1/2}h^{-1/4},$ where $h$ is
the bandwidth used to build the test statistic and $n$ is the sample size. A
wild bootstrap procedure is proposed for finite sample corrections of the
asymptotic critical values. The small sample performances of our test compared
to existing procedures are illustrated through simulations.

formation of galaxies within the cosmic dark-matter structures. While they
fairly well reproduce the local stellar mass functions, correlation functions
and luminosity functions, they fail to match observations at high redshift (z >
3) in most cases, particularly in the low-mass range. The inconsistency between
models and observations indicates that the history of gas accretion in
galaxies, within their host dark-matter halo, and the transformation of gas
into stars, are not well followed. Hereafter, we briefly present a new version
of the GalICS semi-analytical model. We explore the impacts of classical
mechanisms, such as supernova feedback or photoionization, on the evolution of
the stellar mass assembly. Even with a strong efficiency, these two processes
cannot explain the observed stellar mass function and star formation rate
distribution and some other relations. We thus introduce an ad-hoc modification
of the standard paradigm, based on the presence of a \textit{no-star-forming}
gas component, and a concentration of the star-forming gas in galaxy discs. The
main idea behind the existence of the no-star-forming gas reservoir is that
only a fraction of the total gas mass in a galaxy is available to form stars.
The reservoir generates a delay between the accretion of the gas and the star
formation process. This new model is in much better agreement with the
observations of the stellar mass function in the low-mass range than the
previous models, and agrees quite well with a large set of observations,
including the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate. However,
it predicts a large fraction of no-star-forming baryonic gas, potentially
larger than observed, even if its nature has still to be examined in the
context of the missing baryon problem.

review all the mechanisms that affect, at any given time, the formation and
evolution of a galaxy in its host dark-matter halo. We mainly focus on the gas
cycle from the smooth cosmological accretion to feedback processes. To follow
this cycle with high accuracy we introduce some novel prescriptions: i) a
smooth baryonic accretion with two phases: a cold mode and a hot mode built on
the continuous dark-matter accretion. In parallel to this smooth accretion, we
implement the standard photoionisation modelling to reduce the input gas flow
on the smallest structures. ii) a complete monitoring of the hot gas phase. We
compute the evolution of the core density, the mean temperature and the
instantaneous escape fraction of the hot atmosphere by considering that the hot
gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dark-matter potential well, and by
applying a principle of conservation of energy on the treatment of gas
accretion, supernovae and super massive black hole feedback iii) a new
treatment for disc instabilities based on the formation, the migration and the
disruption of giant clumps. The migration of such clumps in gas-rich galaxies
allows to form pseudo-bulges. The different processes in the gas cycle act on
different time scales, and we thus build an adaptive time-step scheme to solve
the evolution equations. The model presented here is compared in detail to the
observations of stellar-mass functions, star formation rates, and luminosity
functions, in a companion paper.

strength from $\sim 10^8$ to $\sim 10^{12}$ Gauss on surface. How such strong
magnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,
which is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,
i.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this
paper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster
stars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of
electrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from
quark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between
electrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could
apply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with
that for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the
electrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become
ferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the
whole star. We conclude that, for most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the
amount of net magnetic momentum, which is proportional to the amount of
unbalanced spins $\xi=(n_+-n_-)/n_e$ and depends on the number density of
electrons $n_e=n_++n_-$, could be significant with non-zero $\xi$. The net
magnetic moments of electron system in solid quark-cluster stars could be large

employed in variable-length permuters and their associated fast pruning
algorithms and architectures are proposed. Permuters are used in many signal
processing systems for shuffling data and in communication systems as an
adjunct to coding for error correction. Typically only a small set of discrete
permuter lengths are supported. Serial pruning is a simple technique to alter
the length of a permutation to support a wider range of lengths, but results in
a serial processing bottleneck. In this paper, parallelizing SPPs is formulated
in terms of recursively computing sums involving integer floor and related
functions using integer operations, in a fashion analogous to evaluating
Dedekind sums. A mathematical treatment for bit-reversal permutations (BRPs) is
presented, and closed-form expressions for BRP statistics are derived. It is
shown that BRP sequences have weak correlation properties. A new statistic
called permutation inliers that characterizes the pruning gap of pruned
interleavers is proposed. Using this statistic, a recursive algorithm that
computes the minimum inliers count of a pruned BR interleaver (PBRI) in
logarithmic time complexity is presented. This algorithm enables parallelizing
a serial PBRI algorithm by any desired parallelism factor by computing the
pruning gap in lookahead rather than a serial fashion, resulting in significant
reduction in interleaving latency and memory overhead. Extensions to 2-D block
and stream interleavers, as well as applications to pruned fast Fourier
transforms and LTE turbo interleavers, are also presented. Moreover,
hardware-efficient architectures for the proposed algorithms are developed.
Simulation results demonstrate 3 to 4 orders of magnitude improvement in
interleaving time compared to existing approaches.

the well-known range-minimum query (RMQ) problem on an array $A$ of $n$ ordered

here that while data are necessary to build of a new science of cities, they

observations can provide evidence for an early phase of acceleration in the
universe. Previous theorems demonstrated that the observed power spectrum for
scalar perturbations forces all possible alternative theories of inflation to
theories other than General Relativity. It was shown that generically, without
a phase of accelerated expansion, these alternatives have to break at least one
of the following tenets of classical general relativity: the Null Energy
Condition (NEC), subluminal signal propagation, or sub-Planckian energy
densities. In this paper we prove how detection of primordial gravitational
waves at large scales can provide independent evidence to support a phase of
accelerated expansion. This proof does not rely on the spectral index for
tensor modes but relies on validity of quantum field theory in curved space
time and tensor modes being sourced from adiabatic vacuum fluctuations. Our
approach, like in the case of scalars, is proof by contradiction: we
investigate the possibility of a detectable tensor signal sourced by vacuum
fluctuations in a non-accelerating, sub-Planckian universe using cosmological
perturbation theory and derive contradictory limits on cosmological dynamics.
The contradiction implies that one or more of our axioms for early universe
must have been broken. The bound from tensor perturbations is not only
independent of, but also stronger than the one obtained from scalar power
spectrum.

relevant constraints on possible weak-scale extensions of the Standard Model

constraints seem to suggest that all the additional, non-SM-like Higgs bosons
should be heavy, with masses larger than about 400 GeV. This article shows that
such results do not hold when the theory approaches the conditions for
""alignment independent of decoupling"", where the lightest CP-even Higgs boson
has SM-like tree-level couplings to fermions and gauge bosons, independently of
the non-standard Higgs boson masses. The combination of current bounds from
direct Higgs boson searches at the LHC, along with the alignment conditions,
have a significant impact on the allowed MSSM parameter space yielding light
additional Higgs bosons. In particular, after ensuring the correct mass for the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson, we find that precision measurements and direct
searches are complementary, and may soon be able to probe the region of
non-SM-like Higgs boson with masses below the top quark pair mass threshold of
350 GeV and low to moderate values of $\tan\beta$.

pre--main-sequence evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram. The effect of the

3-100%. While the slope of the resulting IMF at substellar masses is not

Moreover, for objects with masses <~0.2 Msun, the ratio of brown dwarfs to

  on halfmetallic ferromagnetic CrO2","6 pages, 5 figures; supplementary information separate",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ferromagnets can sustain supercurrents through the formation of equal spin
triplet Cooper pairs and the mechanism of odd-frequency pairing. Since such
pairs are not broken by the exchange energy of the ferromagnet, superconducting
triplet correlations are long-ranged and spin-polarized, with promises for
superconducting spintronics devices. The main challenge is to understand how
triplets are generated at the superconductor (S)/ ferromagnet (F) interface.
Here we use the concept of a so-called triplet spin valve (TSV) to investigate
the conversion of singlets in a conventional superconductor to triplets in the
halfmetallic ferromagnet CrO_2. TSV's are composed of two ferromagnetic layers
(separated by a thin normal metal (N) layer) and a superconductor
(F_1/N/F_2/S). The package F_1/N/F_2 generates triplets in F_1 when the
magnetization directions of the F_{1,2}-layers are not collinear. This drains
singlet pairs from the S-layer, and triplet generation is therefore signalled
by a decrease of the critical temperature $T_c$. Recently, experiments with
TSV's were reported with Co draining layers, using in-plane fields, and finding
T_c-shifts up to 100~mK. Using CrO_2 instead of Co and rotating a magnetic
field from in-plane to out-of-plane, we find strong T_c variations of almost a
Kelvin up to fields of the order of a Tesla. Such strong drainage is consistent
with the large lengths over which supercurrents can flow in CrO_2, which are
significantly larger than in conventional ferromagnets. Our results point to
the special interest of halfmetals for superconducting spintronics.

entropy of statistical samples. For this purpose, we use both histogram and
kernel function to estimate the probability density function of statistical
samples. We find that, due to coarse-graining, the entropy is a monotonic
increasing function of the bin width for histogram or bandwidth for kernel
estimation, which seems to be difficult to select an optimal bin
width/bandwidth for computing the entropy. Fortunately, we notice that there
exists a minimum of the first derivative of entropy for both histogram and
kernel estimation, and this minimum point of the first derivative
asymptotically points to the optimal bin width or bandwidth. We have verified
these findings by large amounts of numerical experiments. Hence, we suggest
that the minimum of the first derivative of entropy be used as a selector for
the optimal bin width or bandwidth of density estimation. Moreover, the optimal
bandwidth selected by the minimum of the first derivative of entropy is purely
data-based, independent of the unknown underlying probability density
distribution, which is obviously superior to the existing estimators. Our
results are not restricted to one-dimensional, but can also be extended to
multivariate cases. It should be emphasized, however, that we do not provide a
robust mathematical proof of these findings, and we leave these issues with
those who are interested in them.

leverages unique technologies offered by modern web browsers, such as the

entirely using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and powered by the extremely well

self-contained, and does not require any server-side process running on either
the local or a remote system. Finally, the W3C XML Schema language is used to
define a list of rules, namely a data standard, that an SLN file must conform
to in order to be valid. In this way, developers are able to implement their
own validation functions in their projects, or use one of the freely available

friction and exacerbate differences. However, as with biological diversity,
cultural diversity is valuable in times of upheaval; if a previously effective
solution no longer works, it is good to have alternatives available. What
factors give rise to cultural diversity? This paper describes a preliminary
investigation of this question using a computational model of cultural
evolution. The model is composed of neural network based agents that evolve
fitter ideas for actions by (1) inventing new ideas through modification of
existing ones, and (2) imitating neighbors' ideas. Numerical simulations
indicate that the diversity of ideas in a population is positively correlated
with both the proportion of creators to imitators in the population, and the
rate at which creators create. This is the case for both minimum and peak
diversity of actions over the duration of a run.

$f(x)=x^x$. First section establishes a recursive relationship among successive
derivatives of the function by using the coefficients defined therein. From
recursion between the derivatives you get one general description of them
(section 2). Finally, section 3 has the main result, the expansion series.
Section 4 deals with the coefficients: characterization, their relationship
with rencontre numbers and their emergence as coefficients in certain
polynomial families. The specific use of some of these polynomials allows
eventually go deeper in the description of the series.

Updated to match version accepted by MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.IM astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The all-sky 408 MHz map of Haslam et al. is one the most important
total-power radio surveys. It has been widely used to study diffuse synchrotron
radiation from our Galaxy and as a template to remove foregrounds in cosmic
microwave background data. However, there are a number of issues associated
with it that must be dealt with, including large-scale striations and
contamination from extragalactic radio sources. We have re-evaluated and
re-processed the rawest data available to produce a new and improved 408 MHz
all-sky map. We first quantify the positional accuracy ($\approx 7$ arcmin) and
effective beam ($56.0\pm1.0$ arcmin) of the four individual surveys from which
it was assembled. Large-scale striations associated with $1/f$ noise in the
scan direction are reduced to a level $\ll 1$ K using a Fourier-based filtering
technique. The most important improvement results from the removal of
extragalactic sources. We have used an iterative combination of two techniques
-- two-dimensional Gaussian fitting and minimum curvature spline surface
inpainting -- to remove the brightest sources ($\gtrsim 2$ Jy), which provides
a significant improvement over previous versions of the map. We quantify the
impact with power spectra and a template fitting analysis of foregrounds to the
WMAP data. The new map is publicly available and is recommended as the template
of choice for large-scale diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. We also
provide a higher resolution map with small-scale fluctuations added, assuming a
power-law angular power spectrum down to the pixel scale (1.7 arcmin). This
should prove useful in simulations used for studying the feasibility of
detecting HI fluctuations from the Epoch of Reionization.

  2010, Piraeus, Greece",,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  The security evaluation for Mail Distribution Systems focuses on
certification and reliability of sensitive data between mail servers. The need
to certify the information conveyed is a result of known weaknesses in the
simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). The most important consequence of these
weaknesses is the possibility to mislead the recipient, which is achieved via
spam (especially email spoofing). Email spoofing refers to alterations in the
headers and/or the content of the message. Therefore, the authenticity of the
message is compromised. Unfortunately, the broken link between certification
and reliability of the information is unsolicited email (spam).
  Unlike the current practice of estimating the cost of spam, which prompts
organizations to purchase and maintain appropriate anti-spam software, our
approach offers an alternative perspective of the economic and moral
consequences of unsolicited mail. The financial data provided in this paper
show that spam is a major contributor to the financial and production cost of
an organization, necessitating further attention. Additionally, this paper
highlights the importance and severity of the weaknesses of the SMTP protocol,
which can be exploited even with the use of simple applications incorporated
within most commonly used Operating Systems (e.g. Telnet).
  As a consequence of these drawbacks Mail Distribution Systems need to be
appropriate configured so as to provide the necessary security services to the
users.
