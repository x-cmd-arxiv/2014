microcalorimeters in the L2 orbit, and thus the particle background levels were
calculated by means of Monte Carlo simulations: we considered the original
design configuration and an improved configuration aimed to reduce the
unrejected background, and tested them in the L2 orbit and in the low Earth
orbit, comparing the results with experimental data reported by other X-ray
instruments.To show the results obtainable with the improved configuration we
simulated the observation of a faint, high-redshift, point source (F[0.5-10

(Sb[0.5-2 keV]=8.61E-16 erg cm-2 s-1 arcmin-2,T=6.6 keV). Results.First we
confirm that implementing an active cryogenic anticoincidence reduces the
particle background by an order of magnitude and brings it close to the
required level.The implementation and test of several design solutions can
reduce the particle background level by a further factor of 6 with respect to
the original configuration.The best background level achievable in the L2 orbit
with the implementation of ad-hoc passive shielding for secondary particles is
similar to that measured in the more favorable LEO environment without the
passive shielding, allowing us to exploit the advantages of the L2 orbit.We
define a reference model for the diffuse background and collect all the
available information on its variation with epoch and pointing direction.With
this background level the ATHENA mission with the X-IFU instrument is able to

  A first crucial step is the lifting of the functor F on Set to a functor in

through the condensation of dust, coagulation of planetesimals, and emergence

growth is quenched by dynamical isolation due to the depletion of planetesimals
in their feeding zone. However, embryos with masses ($M_p$) in the range of a
few Earth masses ($M_\oplus$) migrate toward a transition radius between the
inner viscously heated and outer irradiated regions of their natal disk. Their
limiting isolation mass increases with the planetesimals surface density. When
$M_p > 10 M_\oplus$, embryos efficiently accrete gas and evolve into cores of
gas giants. We use numerical simulation to show that, despite streamline
interference, convergent embryos essentially retain the strength of
non-interacting embryos' Lindblad and corotation torque by their natal disks.
In disks with modest surface density (or equivalently accretion rates), embryos
capture each other in their mutual mean motion resonances and form a convoy of
super Earths. In more massive disks, they could overcome these resonant
barriers to undergo repeated close encounters including cohesive collisions

question of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that
log-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst

the fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call
our model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We
demonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time

of realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not
long memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at
detecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory
in data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility
has been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative

process that starts with $n$ vertices and no edges, and at each step adds one
new edge chosen uniformly at random from the set of missing edges. Let
$\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ be a graph with $m$ edges obtained after $m$ steps of this
process. Each edge $e_i$ ($i=1,2,..., m$) of $\mathcal{G}(n,m)$ independently
chooses precisely $k \in \mathbb{N}$ colours, uniformly at random, from a given
set of $n-1$ colours (one may view $e_i$ as a multi-edge). We stop the process
prematurely at time $M$ when the following two events hold: $\mathcal{G}(n,M)$
is connected and every colour occurs at least once ($M={n \choose 2}$ if some
colour does not occur before all edges are present; however, this does not
happen asymptotically almost surely). The question addressed in this paper is
whether $\mathcal{G}(n,M)$ has a rainbow spanning tree (that is, multicoloured
tree on $n$ vertices). Clearly, both properties are necessary for the desired
tree to exist.
  In 1994, Frieze and McKay investigated the case $k=1$ and the answer to this
question is ""yes"" (asymptotically almost surely). However, since the sharp
threshold for connectivity is $\frac {n}{2} \log n$ and the sharp threshold for
seeing all the colours is $\frac{n}{k} \log n$, the case $k=2$ is of special
importance as in this case the two processes keep up with one another. In this
paper, we show that asymptotically almost surely the answer is ""yes"" also for
$k \ge 2$.

possible drivers of turbulent angular momentum transport in astrophysical

may be difficult to excite in the astrophysically relevant regime of magnetic
Prandtl number (Pm) significantly smaller than unity, for reasons currently not
well understood. The aim of this article is to present the first results of an
ongoing numerical investigation of the role of both linear and nonlinear
dissipative effects in this problem. Combining a parametric exploration and an
energy analysis of incompressible nonlinear MRI dynamo cycles representative of
the transitional dynamics in large aspect ratio shearing boxes, we find that
turbulent magnetic diffusion makes the excitation and sustainment of this
dynamo at moderate magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) increasingly difficult for
decreasing Pm. This results in an increase in the critical Rm of the dynamo for
increasing kinematic Reynolds number (Re), in agreement with earlier numerical
results. Given its very generic nature, we argue that turbulent magnetic
diffusion could be an important determinant of MRI dynamo excitation in disks,
and may also limit the efficiency of angular momentum transport by MRI
turbulence in low Pm regimes.

consistent variability around 7 x10^37 erg/s, with a spectral hardening event
in 2009. We phase-connected the entire light-curve by folding the photon
arrival times on a series of trial periods spanning the known orbital period
and its uncertainty, refining the X-ray period to P = 1.45175(1)d. The duration
of minimum-flux in the X-ray eclipse is 5 hr which together with the optical
radial velocity curve for the companion yields a radius for the eclipsing body
of 8-10 Rsun for the allowed range of masses. The orbital separation of 18.5-22
Rsun then provides a limiting inclination i>63 degrees for total eclipses to
occur. The eclipses are asymmetric (egress duration 0.9 hr) and show energy
dependence, suggestive of an accretion-disk hotspot and corona. The eclipse is
much (5X) wider than the 1.5-2 Rsun WR star, pointing to absorption/scattering
in the dense wind of the WR star. The same is true of the close analog NGC 300
X-1. RV measurements of the He II [4686] line from the literature show a
phase-shift with respect to the X-ray ephemeris such that the velocity does not
pass through zero at mid-eclipse. The X-ray eclipse leads inferior conjunction
of the RV curve by 90 degrees, so either the BH is being eclipsed by a trailing
shock/plume, or the He II line does not directly trace the motion of the WR
star and instead originates in a shadowed partially-ionized region of the
stellar wind.

many properties of the directed currents, the most important one being that it
imposes a significant reduction in their maximum values, thus affecting the
attainable efficiency at the quantum level. In this work we prove this
conjecture by means of comprehensive numerical explorations and statistical
analysis of the quantum states. We are able to describe the quantum parameter
space of a paradigmatic system for different values of $\hbar_{\rm eff}$ in
great detail. Moreover, thanks to this we provide evidence on a mechanism that

The space of bounded multipliers is a semifinite von Neumann algebra isomorphic
to the left von Neumann algebra of the Hilbert algebra, as expected. However,
in the unbounded setting, the space of multipliers has the structure of a
*-algebra with nice properties concerning commutant and affiliation: it is a
pre-GW*-algebra. And this correspondence between Hilbert algebras and its
multipliers is functorial. Then, we can endow the Hilbert algebra with a nice
topology constructed from unbounded multipliers. As we can see from the theory
developed here, multipliers should be an important tool for the study of
unbounded operator algebras.
  We also formalize the remark that examples of non-formal deformation
quantizations give rise to Hilbert algebras, by defining the concept of Hilbert
deformation quantization (HDQ) and studying these deformations as well as their
bounded and unbounded multipliers in a general way. Then, we reformulate the
notion of covariance of a star-product in this framework of HDQ and
multipliers, and we call it a symmetry of the HDQ. By using the multiplier
topology of a symmetry, we are able to produce various functional spaces
attached to the deformation quantization, like the generalization of Schwartz
space, Sobolev spaces, Gracia-Bondia-Varilly spaces. Moreover, the non-formal
star-exponential of the symmetry can be defined in full generality and has nice
relations with these functional spaces. We apply this formalism to the
Moyal-Weyl deformation quantization and to the deformation quantization of
Kahlerian Lie groups with negative curvature.

long been suspected in high-mobility 2D electron systems at very low Landau

present a new technique and experimental results that directly probe the

has a very low density and is in the WC regime ($\nu<<1$), while the other

in the other layer and exhibit magneto-resistance maxima whenever their
cyclotron orbit encircles certain integer number of the WC lattice points. The
positions of the maxima reveal that the WC has a triangular lattice and yield a
direct measure of its lattice constant. Our results provide a striking example
of how one can probe an exotic many-body state of 2D electrons using equally

$\epsilon$ of the minimum. Finally, a second approximation takes, for any
constant $c > 1$, $O(n^{1 / c} \log n)$ bits to store a prefix code with
average codeword length at most $c$ times the minimum. In all cases, our data
structures allow encoding and decoding of any symbol in $O(1)$ time. We
experimentally compare our new techniques with the state of the art, showing
that we achieve 6--8-fold space reductions, at the price of a slower encoding
(2.5--8 times slower) and decoding (12--24 times slower). The approximations
further reduce this space and improve the time significantly, up to recovering
the speed of classical implementations, for a moderate penalty in the average
code length. As a byproduct, we compare various heuristic, approximate, and
optimal algorithms to generate length-restricted codes, showing that the
optimal ones are clearly superior and practical enough to be implemented.

20 edge-sharing triangles and belongs to the icosahedral $I_h$ symmetry group,
presents unconventional properties at the classical and quantum level. These
originate in the frustrated nature of the interactions between the spins. For
classical spins the magnetization is discontinuous in a magnetic field. Here we
examine the importance of the connectivity of the icosahedron for the
appearance of the magnetization discontinuity, and also investigate the
transition from the classical to the quantum limit. The influence of
connectivity on the magnetic properties is revealed by considering the cluster
as being made up of a closed strip of a triangular lattice with two additional
spins attached. The classical magnetization discontinuity is shown to evolve
continuously from the discontinuity effected by these two spins when they are
uncoupled to the cluster. In the second part the transition from the classical
to the quantum limit is examined by focusing on the low energy spectrum taking
fully into account the spatial and the spin symmetry of the model in the
characterization of the states. A symmetry analysis of the highly degenerate
due to the connectivity lowest energy classical manifold identifies as its
direct fingerprint the low energy quantum states for spin magnitude as low as
$s=1$, with the latter following a tower of states behavior which relates to
the icosahedron having a structure reminiscent of a depleted triangular
lattice. The classical character of the AHM for small $s$ is also detected on
the ground state energy and correlation functions. On the other hand the
classical magnetization discontinuity in a field eventually disappears for
small $s$, after a weak reentrant behavior.

a stationary distribution over an infinite horizon. We present sufficient
conditions for optimality in terms of a system of dynamically coupled Riccati
equations in the finite horizon case and algebraic in the stationary case. We
then address the question of feasibility for both problems. For the
finite-horizon case, provided the system is controllable, we prove that without
any restriction on the directionality of the stochastic disturbance it is
always possible to steer the state to any arbitrary Gaussian distribution over
any specified finite time-interval. For the stationary infinite horizon case,
it is not always possible to maintain the state at an arbitrary Gaussian
distribution through constant state-feedback. It is shown that covariances of
admissible stationary Gaussian distributions are characterized by a certain
Lyapunov-like equation. We finally present an alternative to solving the system
of coupled Riccati equations, by expressing the optimal controls in the form of
solutions to (convex) semi-definite programs for both cases. We conclude with
an example to steer the state covariance of the distribution of inertial
particles to an admissible stationary Gaussian distribution over a finite

in orbits of 1.68--3.78 d around stars with masses 0.81--1.50 $M_{\rm \odot}$.
  WASP-111b is in a prograde, near-aligned ($\lambda = -5 \pm 16^\circ$),
near-circular ($e < 0.10$ at 2 $\sigma$) orbit around a mid-F star. As tidal
alignment around such a hot star is thought to be inefficient, this suggests
that either the planet migrated inwards through the protoplanetary disc or that
scattering processes happened to leave it in a near-aligned orbit. WASP-111
appears to have transitioned from an active to a quiescent state between the
2012 and 2013 seasons, which makes the system a candidate for studying the
effects of variable activity on a hot-Jupiter atmosphere. We find evidence that
the mid-F star WASP-87 is a visual binary with a mid-G star. Two host stars are
metal poor: WASP-112 has [Fe/H] = $-0.64 \pm 0.15$ and WASP-87 has [Fe/H] =

topological superconductivity can be realized experimentally by placing
transition metal atoms that form a ferromagnetic chain on a superconducting
substrate. We address some properties of this type of systems by using a
Slater-Koster tight-binding model. We predict that topological
superconductivity is nearly universal when ferromagnetic transition metal
chains form straight lines on superconducting substrates and that it is
possible for more complex chain structures. The proximity induced
superconducting gap is $\sim \Delta E_{so} / J$ where $\Delta$ is the $s$-wave
pair-potential on the chain, $E_{so}$ is the spin-orbit splitting energy
induced in the normal chain state bands by hybridization with the
superconducting substrate, and $J$ is the exchange-splitting of the
ferromagnetic chain $d$-bands. Because of the topological character of the 1D
superconducting state, Majorana end modes appear within the gaps of finite
length chains. We find, in agreement with experiment, that when the chain and
substrate orbitals are strongly hybridized, Majorana end modes are
substantially reduced in amplitude when separated from the chain end by less
than the coherence length defined by the $p$-wave superconducting gap. We
conclude that Pb is a particularly favorable substrate material for
ferromagnetic chain topological superconductivity because it provides both
strong $s-$wave pairing and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, but that there
is an opportunity to optimize properties by varying the atomic composition and
structure of the chain. Finally, we note that in the absence of disorder a new
chain magnetic symmetry, one that is also present in the crystalline
topological insulators, can stabilize multiple Majorana modes at the end of a
single chain.

in the core region of microquasars and AGNs. In earlier work, it has been
suggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the
magnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines
anchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles
and produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity
AGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation
between the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$
orders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present
work, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection
mechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and
by turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the
scenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and
gamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the
trend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but
also their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast
reconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the
core region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model
is able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the
other hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend
as that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray
emission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another
population of relativistic particles, as expected.

average-and-random mating process (mean-field behavior); (3) Mendelian

with time-evolutionary dynamics, we have obtained an exact analytic
time-dependent solution and an exactly solvable model. From the
phenomenological viewpoint, any initial parameter of genotype frequencies of a
closed system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under time
evolution, we show (1) the monotonic behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) any
genotype or allele that appears in the population will never become extinct,
(3) the Hardy-Weinberg law, and (4) the global stability without chaos in the

velocity $v$ can be chosen such that the influence of any local perturbation is
approximately confined to within a distance $r$ until a time $t \sim r/v$,
thereby defining a linear light cone and giving rise to an emergent notion of
locality. In systems with power-law ($1/r^{\alpha}$) interactions, when
$\alpha$ exceeds the dimension $D$, an analogous bound confines influences to
within a distance $r$ only until a time $t\sim(\alpha/v)\log r$, suggesting
that the velocity, as calculated from the slope of the light cone, may grow
exponentially in time. We rule out this possibility; light cones of power-law
interacting systems are algebraic for $\alpha>2D$, becoming linear as
$\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. Our results impose strong new constraints on the
growth of correlations and the production of entangled states in a variety of
rapidly emerging, long-range interacting atomic, molecular, and optical
systems.

potential to simultaneously constrain both the cosmological and galaxy
formation models. In this paper we perform a comprehensive exploration of these
signals and their covariances through a combination of analytic and numerical
approaches. First, we derive analytic expressions for the projected galaxy
correlation function and stacked tangential shear profile and their respective
covariances, which include Gaussian and discreteness noise terms. Secondly, we
measure these quantities from mock galaxy catalogues obtained from the
Millennium-XXL simulation and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We find
that on large scales (R>10 Mpc/h), the galaxy bias is roughly linear and
deterministic. On smaller scales (R<5 Mpc/h) the bias is a complicated function
of scale and luminosity, determined by the different spatial distribution and
abundance of satellite galaxies present when different magnitude cuts are
applied, as well as by the mass dependence of the host haloes on magnitude. Our
theoretical model for the covariances provides a reasonably good description of
the measured ones on small and large scales. However, on intermediate scales
(1<R<10 Mpc/h), the predicted errors are ~2-3 times smaller, suggesting that
the inclusion of higher-order, non-Gaussian terms in the covariance will be
required for further improvements. Importantly, both our theoretical and
numerical methods show that the galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering signals
have a non-zero cross-covariance matrix with significant bin-to-bin
correlations. Future surveys aiming to combine these probes must take this into

occurring on the surfaces of white dwarf stars accreting gas from companions in
binary star systems. Novae typically expel ~10^(-4) solar masses of material at
velocities exceeding 1,000 kilometres per second. However, the mechanism of
mass ejection in novae is poorly understood, and could be dominated by the
impulsive flash of thermonuclear energy, prolonged optically thick winds, or
binary interaction with the nova envelope. Classical novae are now routinely
detected in gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray wavelengths, suggesting that
relativistic particles are accelerated by strong shocks in the ejecta. Here we
report high-resolution radio imaging of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon.
We find that its ejecta were shaped by the motion of the binary system: some
gas was expelled rapidly along the poles as a wind from the white dwarf, while
denser material drifted out along the equatorial plane, propelled by orbital
motion. At the interface between the equatorial and polar regions, we observe
synchrotron emission indicative of shocks and relativistic particle
acceleration, thereby pinpointing the location of gamma-ray production. Binary
shaping of the nova ejecta and associated internal shocks are expected to be
widespread among novae, explaining why many novae are gamma-ray emitters.

main result from the improved statistics of our sample is that the distribution
of stars is not continuous along the anticorrelation as they are neatly
clustered into three distinct clumps each with different chemical composition.
One group (P) shows the primordial composition of field stars of similar
metallicity, and the other two (I and E) have increasing abundances of Al and
decreasing abundances of Mg. The fraction of stars we found in the three

ratios computed for the three distinct main sequences in NGC 2808: for the
first time there is a clear correspondence between discrete photometric
sequences of dwarfs and distinct groups of giants with homogeneous chemistry.
The composition of the I group cannot be reproduced by mixing of matter with
extreme processing in hot H-burning and gas with pristine, unprocessed
composition, as also found in the recent analysis of three discrete groups in

degrees on the sky with a typical width of 0.7 degrees. We generate models of
this stream by fixing Pal 5's present-day position, distance and radial
velocity via observations, while allowing its proper motion to vary. In a
spherical dark matter halo we easily find models that fit the observed
morphology. However, no plausible Pal 5 model could be found in the triaxial
potential of Law & Majewski (2010), which has been proposed to explain the
properties of the Sagittarius stream. In this case, the long, thin and curved
morphology of the Pal5 stream alone can be used to rule out such a potential
configuration. Pal 5 like streams in this potential are either too straight,
missing the curvature of the observations, or show an unusual morphology which
we dub stream-fanning: a signature sensitive to the triaxiality of a potential.
We conclude that the mere existence of other thin tidal streams must provide
broad constraints on the orientation and shape of the dark matter halo they

We find that selecting mergers using the $H_{160}$-band flux ratio leads to an
increasing merger fraction with redshift, while selecting mergers using the
stellar mass ratio causes a diminishing redshift dependence. Defining major and
minor mergers as having stellar mass ratios of 1:1 - 4:1 and 4:1 - 10:1
respectively, the results imply $\sim$1 major and $\lesssim$1 minor merger for
an average massive (log$(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \geqslant 10.8$) galaxy during
$z=0.1-2.5$. There may be an additional $\sim 0.5(0.3)$ major (minor) merger if
we use the $H$-band flux ratio selection. The observed amount of major merging
alone is sufficient to explain the observed number density evolution for the
very massive (log$(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \geqslant 11.1$) galaxies. We argue
that these very massive galaxies can put on a maximum of $6\%$ of stellar mass
in addition to major and minor merging, so that their number density evolution
remains consistent with observations. The observed number of major and minor
mergers can increase the size of a massive quiescent galaxy by a factor of two
at most. This amount of merging is enough to bring the compact quiescent
galaxies formed at $z>2$ to lie at $1\sigma$ below the mean of the stellar
mass-size relation as measured in some works (e.g. Newman et al. 2012), but
additional mechanisms are needed to fully explain the evolution, and to be

distribution of galaxies in populous voids follows the same distribution

the big bang in so-called dark matter minihalos with masses ~10^6 M_sun. Their
radiation lit up the Universe for the first time, and the supernova explosions
that ended their brief lives enriched the intergalactic medium with the first
heavy elements. Influenced by their feedback, the first galaxies assembled in
halos with masses ~10^8 M_sun, and hosted the first metal-enriched stellar
populations. In this review, I summarize the theoretical progress made in the
field of high-redshift star and galaxy formation since the turn of the
millennium, with an emphasis on numerical simulations. These have become the
method of choice to understand the multi-scale, multi-physics problem posed by
structure formation in the early Universe. In the first part of the review, I
focus on the formation of the first stars in minihalos - in particular the
post-collapse phase, where disk fragmentation, protostellar evolution, and
radiative feedback become important. I also discuss the influence of additional
physical processes, such as magnetic fields and streaming velocities. In the
second part of the review, I summarize the various feedback mechanisms exerted
by the first stars, followed by a discussion of the first galaxies and the
various physical processes that operate in them.

extend a study by Bulut et al. (arXiv:1305.3301) to include a direct
antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the Cu sites. As in previous work,
we invariably find that the primary instability has a diagonal wavevector $(\pm
Q_0, \pm Q_0)$ and a $d$-form factor. The experimentally observed wavevectors
along the principal axes $(\pm Q_0,0)$, $(0, \pm Q_0)$ have higher energy, but
they also have a predominantly $d$-form factor. Next, we gap out the Fermi
surface in the anti-nodal regions of the Brillouin zone by including static,
long-range antiferromagnetic order at the wavevector $(\pi, \pi)$: this is a
simple model of the pseudogap in which we assume the antiferromagnetic order
averages to zero by `renormalized classical' thermal fluctuations in its
orientation, valid when the antiferromagnetic correlation length is large. The
charge density wave instabilities of this pseudogap state are found to have the
optimal wavevector $(\pm Q_0,0)$, $(0, \pm Q_0)$, with the magnitude of the
$d$-form factor decreasing with increasing magnetic order.

mass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. The subgrid
feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar
mass function and galaxy sizes. Here we demonstrate that the simulations
reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per

mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the
plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with
observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are
bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star
formation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lower
than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely.
The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes EAGLE a
powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy

the M13 protocluster.

highest star formation rates (SFRs), less biased by dust obscuration afflicting

LIRGs and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, L_TIR > 10^12 Lsun) at z >
0.6. We observe weak clustering of r_0 = 3-6 Mpc/h for almost all of our star
forming samples. We find that the clustering and halo mass depend on L_TIR at
all redshifts, where galaxies with higher L_TIR (hence higher SFRs) have
stronger clustering. Galaxies with the highest SFRs at each redshift typically
reside within dark matter halos of M_halo ~ 10^12.9 Msun/h. This is consistent
with a transitional halo mass, above which star formation is largely truncated,
although we cannot exclude that ULIRGs reside within higher mass halos. By
modeling the clustering evolution of halos, we connect our star forming galaxy
samples to their local descendants. Most star forming galaxies at z < 1.0 are
the progenitors of L < 2.5L* blue galaxies in the local universe, but star

expanded and improved our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion

electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a significant
challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first
principles. Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used,
with widely different configurations (e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated
emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral properties of
accreting black-holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such
models, however, requires significant computational power that exceeds
conventional computational facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast
GPU-based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster El Gato, to compute images
and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins.
We also employ two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in
each of the simulations. We show that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr
A* are used, all twelve models tested here can fit the spectra equally well.
However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission
using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models
with strong funnel emission, because the funnels are typically very extended.
Our study shows that images of accretion flows with horizon-scale resolution
offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around black-holes and
their thermodynamic properties.

evolutionary history and directly assesses their properties. Placing stars in
this diagram however requires the knowledge of their distances and interstellar
extinctions, which are often poorly known for Galactic stars. The spectroscopic
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (sHRD) tells similar evolutionary tales, but is
independent of distance and extinction measurements. Based on spectroscopically
derived effective temperatures and gravities of almost 600 stars, we derive for
the first time the observational distribution of Galactic massive stars in the
sHRD. While biases and statistical limitations in the data prevent detailed
quantitative conclusions at this time, we see several clear qualitative trends.
By comparing the observational sHRD with different state-of-the-art stellar
evolutionary predictions, we conclude that convective core overshooting may be
mass-dependent and, at high mass ($\geq 15\,M_\odot$), stronger than previously
thought. Furthermore, we find evidence for an empirical upper limit in the sHRD
for stars with $T_{\rm{eff}}$ between 10000 and 32000 K and, a strikingly large
number of objects below this line. This over-density may be due to inflation
expanding envelopes in massive main-sequence stars near the Eddington limit.

that, while the global state is not conserved in this process, the inner

positive correlation between node states and local averages of their
self/neighbor strength ratios always results in upward (or at least neutral)
global drift. We also show that the strength assortativity negatively affects
the speed of homogenization. Based on these findings, we propose an adaptive

improves the throughput on a specific link, it also increases the interference
imposed on neighboring receivers. We also show that the gain of applying SIC is
more profound in cases of a large degree of asymmetry among interfering links.

rigorous chemical mass balance with metal-silicate element partitioning data.
The primary constraint on the combined model is the composition of the Earth's
primitive mantle, the composition of the Martian mantle, and the mass fractions
of the metallic cores of Earth and Mars. The model is refined by least squares
minimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist of the
metal-silicate equilibrium pressure and 1-4 parameters that define the starting
compositions of primitive bodies. This integrated model has been applied to 6
Grand Tack simulations. Investigations of a broad parameter space indicate
that: accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, metal-silicate equilibration
pressures increase as accretion progresses and are 60-70% of core-mantle
boundary pressures at the time of each impact, and a large fraction (70-100%)
of the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a small fraction of the
silicate mantles of protoplanets during each core formation event. Acceptable
fits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies that
originated close to the Sun, at <0.9-1.2 AU, are highly reduced and those
beyond this distance are increasingly oxidized. The FeO content of the Martian
mantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which the
Mars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is predicted to
contain 8-9 wt% silicon, 2-4 wt% oxygen and 10-60 ppm hydrogen, whereas the
Martian core is predicted to contain low concentrations (<1 wt%) of Si and O.

attention in lieu of different network models for a diverse range of
applications. While many analytic results have been reported for the case of
large networks, very few of them are readily applicable to finite-size
networks. This paper studies cascading failures in finite-size geometric
networks where the number of nodes is on the order of tens or hundreds as in
many real-life networks. First, the impact of the tolerance parameter on
network resiliency is investigated. We quantify the network reaction to initial
disturbances of different sizes by measuring the damage imposed on the network.
Lower and upper bounds on the number of failures are derived to characterize
such damages. Such finite-size analysis reveals the decisiveness and
criticality of taking action within the first few stages of failure propagation
in preventing a cascade. By studying the trend of the bounds as the number of
nodes increases, we observe a phase transition phenomenon in terms of the
tolerance parameter. The critical value of the tolerance parameter, known as
the threshold, is further derived. The findings of this paper, in particular,
shed light on how to choose the tolerance parameter appropriately such that a
cascade of failures could be avoided.

resolution of 7 arcsecs. The gas emission is concentrated in two subclusters
(the NW and SE subclusters). The SE subcluster has more prominent filamentary
structures and more complicated kinematics compared to the NW subcluster. The
majority of gas in the two subclusters has subsonic to sonic velocity
dispersions. We applied a dendrogram technique with N2H+(1-0) to study the gas
structures; the SE subcluster has a higher degree of hierarchy than the NW
subcluster. Combining the dendrogram and line fitting analyses reveals two
distinct relations: a flat relation between nonthermal velocity dispersion and
size, and a positive correlation between variation in velocity centroids and
size. The two relations imply a characteristic depth of 0.15 pc for the cloud.
Furthermore, we have identified six filaments in the SE subcluster. These
filaments have lengths of 0.2 pc and widths of 0.03 pc, which is smaller than a
characteristic width of 0.1 pc suggested by Herschel observations. The
filaments can be classified into two types based on their properties. The first

gradients, smaller masses, and nearly critical mass-per-unit-length ratios. The
other type, located in the southwest of the SE subcluster, has the opposite

  cluster-randomized trials","27 pages, 2 figures, 1 table. Submitted to PLoS ONE",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Background
  A key requirement for a useful power calculation is that the calculation
mimic the data analysis that will be performed on the actual data, once it is
observed. Close approximations may be difficult to achieve using analytic
solutions, however, and thus Monte Carlo approaches, including both simulation
and bootstrap resampling, are often attractive. One setting in which this is
particularly true is cluster-randomized trial designs. However, Monte Carlo
approaches are useful in many additional settings as well. Calculating power
for cluster-randomized trials using analytic or simulation-based methods is
frequently unsatisfactory due to the complexity of the data analysis methods to
be employed and to the sparseness of data to inform the choice of important
parameters in these methods.
  Methods
  We propose that among Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap approaches are most
likely to generate data similar to the observed data. Means of implementation
are described.
  Results
  We demonstrate bootstrap power calculation for a cluster-randomized trial
with a survival outcome and a baseline observation period.
  Conclusions
  Bootstrap power calculation, a natural application of resampling methods,
provides a relatively simple solution to power calculation that is likely to be
the most accurate option. It has several important strengths. Notably, it is
simple to achieve fidelity to the proposed data analysis method and there is no
requirement for estimates from outside settings. We are not aware of bootstrap
power calculation being previously proposed or explored for cluster-randomized
trials. We demonstrate power calculations for a time-to-event outcome in a
cluster randomized trial setting, for which we are unaware of an analytic
alternative.

to obtain local laws for matrix ensembles that are \emph{anisotropic} in the
sense that their resolvents are well approximated by deterministic matrices
that are not multiples of the identity. For definiteness, we present the method
for sample covariance matrices of the form $Q := T X X^* T^*$, where $T$ is
deterministic and $X$ is random with independent entries. We prove that with
high probability the resolvent of $Q$ is close to a deterministic matrix, with
an optimal error bound and down to optimal spectral scales.
  As an application, we prove the edge universality of $Q$ by establishing the
Tracy-Widom-Airy statistics of the eigenvalues of $Q$ near the soft edges. This
result applies in the single-cut and multi-cut cases. Further applications

preferred regions of mid-infrared color space occupied by our bow shock

valid for $\Re (s) > 1/2$ in a specific sense. Namely, the logarithm of the
Euler product, although formally divergent, is meaningful because it is
Ces\`aro summable, and its Ces\`aro average converges to $\log L (s,\chi)$. Our
argument relies on the prime number theorem, an Abel transform, and a central
limit theorem for the Random Walk of the Primes, the series $\sum_{n=1}^N
\cos\left(t\log p_n\right)$, and its generalization to other Dirichlet
$L$-functions. The significance of ${\Re(s) > 1/2}$ arises from the $\sqrt{N}$
growth of this series, since it satisfies a central limit theorem.
$L$-functions based on principal Dirichlet characters, such as the Riemann
$\zeta$-function, are exceptional due to the pole at $s=1$, and require $\Im
(s) \neq 0$ and a truncation of the Euler product. Compelling numerical
evidence of this surprising result is presented, and some of its consequences
are discussed.

$\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.296\pm 0.010$ using fixed-order perturbation theory, and
$\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.310\pm 0.014$ using contour-improved perturbation theory.
Averaging these values with our previously obtained values from the OPAL data,
we find $\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.303\pm 0.009$, respectively,
$\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.319\pm 0.012$. We present a critique of the analysis

non-perturbative effects limit the accuracy with which the strong coupling, an
inherently perturbative quantity, can be extracted at energies as low as the

determination of the strong coupling from analyses of hadronic $\tau$-decay

different locations in non-uniformly magnetized plasmas. For simultaneous
observation of multiple ECE frequencies from the outside edge of a toroidal
plasma confinement device (e.g. a tokamak), the focal length of the collecting
optics should increase with the frequency to maximize the resolution on a line
of sight along the magnetic field gradient. Here we present the design and
numerical study of a zoned metamaterial lens with such characteristics, for
possible deployment with the 83-130 GHz ECE radiometer in the DIII-D tokamak.
The lens consists of a concentric array of miniaturized element phase-shifters.
These were reverse-engineered starting from the desired Gaussian beam waist
locations and further optimized to account for diffraction and finite-aperture
effects that tend to displace the waist. At the same time we imposed high and
uniform transmittance, averaged over all phase-shifters. The focal length is
shown to increase from 1.37 m to 1.97 m over the frequency range of interest,
as desired for low-field DIII-D discharges (B = -1.57 T). Retracting the lens
to receded positions rigidly moves the waists accordingly, resulting in a good
match -within a fraction of the Rayleigh length- of the EC-emitting layer
positions at higher fields (up to B = -2.00 T). Further, it is shown how
varying the lens aperture might move the waists ""non-rigidly"" to better match
the non-rigid movement of the EC-emitting layers with the magnetic field. The
numerical method presented is very general and can be used to engineer any
dependence of the focal length on the frequency, including zero or minimal
chromatic aberration.

approximate the sheet as having vanishing strain, so that it takes a conical
form in which straight generators converge to a disclination singularity. Then
its shape is that which minimizes elastic bending energy alone. Real sheets are
expected to approach this limiting shape as their thickness approaches zero.
The planar constraint forces a sector of the sheet to buckle into the third
dimension. We find that the unbuckled sector is precisely semicircular,
independent of the angle $\delta$ of the inserted wedge. We generalize the
analysis to include conical as well as planar constraints and thereby establish
a law of corresponding states for shallow cones of slope $\epsilon$ and thin

approaches the jamming threshold where flow ceases, both for aerial granular

potentially complete scaling description of stationary flows. Our analysis,
which focuses on frictionless particles, applies {\it both} to suspensions and
inertial flows of hard particles. We compare our predictions with the empirical

whose scaling properties clearly differ from frictionless systems. For

the exponential storage requirement of previously known schemes, that resulted
from the use of large Boolean functions. We propose an improved scheme, that
achieves the capacity of asymmetric channels with polynomial computational
complexity and storage requirement.
  The proposed non-linear scheme is then generalized to the setting of channel
coding with an informed encoder, using a multicoding technique. We consider
specific instances of the scheme for flash memories, that incorporate
error-correction capabilities together with rewriting. Since the considered
codes are non-linear, they eliminate the requirement of previously known
schemes (called polar write-once-memory codes) for shared randomness between
the encoder and the decoder. Finally, we mention that the multicoding scheme is
also useful for broadcast communication in Marton's region, improving upon
previous schemes for this setting.

is ensured by its statistical consistency. Bayesian inference methods produce a
sample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution given sequence
data. Hence the question of statistical consistency of such methods is
equivalent to the consistency of the summary of the sample. More generally,
statistical consistency is ensured by the tree space used to analyse the
sample.
  In this paper, we consider two standard parameterisations of phylogenetic
time-trees used in evolutionary models: inter-coalescent interval lengths and
absolute times of divergence events. For each of these parameterisations we
introduce a natural metric space on ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We compare
the introduced spaces with existing models of tree space and formulate several
formal requirements that a metric space on phylogenetic trees must possess in
order to be a satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We
show that only a few known constructions of the space of phylogenetic trees
satisfy these requirements. However, our results suggest that these basic
requirements are not enough to distinguish between the two metric spaces we
introduce and that the choice between metric spaces requires additional
properties to be considered. Particularly, that the summary tree minimising the
square distance to the trees from the sample might be different for different
parameterisations. This suggests that further fundamental insight is needed
into the problem of statistical consistency of phylogenetic inference methods.

necessary to understand the electron transport properties of a single-molecule
magnet junction. Here we study the negative differential conductance and
super-Poissonian shot noise properties of electron transport through a
single-molecule magnet weakly coupled to two electrodes with either one or both
of them being ferromagnetic. We predict that the negative differential
conductance and super-Poissonian shot noise, which can be tuned by a gate
voltage, depend sensitively on the spin polarization of the source and drain
electrodes. In particular, the shot noise in the negative differential
conductance region can be enhanced or decreased originating from the different
formation mechanisms of negative differential conductance. The effective
competition between fast and slow transport channels is responsible for the
observed negative differential conductance and super-Poissonian shot noise. In
addition, we further discuss the skewness and kurtosis properties of transport
current in the super-Poissonian shot noise regions. Our findings suggest a
tunable negative differential conductance molecular device, and the predicted
properties of high-order current cumulants are very interesting for a better
understanding of electron transport through single-molecule magnet junctions.

entangles with the ($I=2$) internal angular momenta of the d-orbitals to form a
low spin $J=L+I=0$ singlet. We discuss how the recent observation of a nodal

gravitational waves (GW) once they reach <<1 pc separations, for both pulsar
timing arrays (PTAs) and space based (SB) detectors. While BH binaries
coalescences constitute a natural outcome of the cosmological standard model
and galaxy mergers, their dynamical evolution is still poorly understood and
therefore their abundances at different stages. We use a dynamical model for
the decay of BH binaries coupled with a cosmological simulation and
semi-empirical approaches to the occupation of haloes by galaxies and BHs, in
order to follow the evolution of the properties distribution of galaxies
hosting BH binaries candidates to decay due to GWs emission. Our models allow
us to relax simplifying hypothesis about the binaries occupation in galaxies
and their mass, as well as redshift evolution. Following previously proposed
electromagnetic (EM) signatures of binaries in the subpc regime, that include
spectral features and variability, we model possible distributions of such
signatures and also set upper limits to their lifespan. We found a bimodal
distribution of hosts properties, corresponding to BH binaries suitable to be
detected by PTA and the ones detectable only from space missions, as eLISA.
Although it has been discussed that the peak of eLISA sources may happen at
high z, we show that there must be a population of such sources in the nearby
Universe that might show detectable EM signatures, representing an important
laboratory for multimessenger astrophysics. We found a weak dependence of
galaxy host properties on the binaries occupation, that can be traced back to
the BH origin. The combination of the host correlations reported here with the
expected EM signal, may be helpful to verify the presence of nearby GW
candidates, and to distinguish them from 'regular' intrinsic AGN variability.

Here we propose two random variations of the triangle algorithm that allow
relaxed steps so as to take more effective steps possible in subsequent

connected perpendicularly to zigzag-shaped edges, the AGNR allows for
long-range extension of the otherwise localized edge state. The huge
magnetoresistance is a direct consequence of the coupling of two such extended

By tuning the coupling between these two spin-polarized states with a magnetic

small difference between the systemic velocities indicates that the binary

distributions of line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation conditions and
the blockage model includes an outage state that provides a better
representation of the outage possibilities of millimeter wave communications.
By modeling the locations of the base stations as points of a Poisson point
process and by relying on a noise-limited approximation for typical millimeter
wave network deployments, simple and exact integral as well as approximated and
closed-form formulas for computing the coverage probability and the average
rate are obtained. With the aid of Monte Carlo simulations, the noise-limited
approximation is shown to be sufficiently accurate for typical network
densities. The proposed mathematical framework is applicable to cell
association criteria based on the smallest path-loss and on the highest
received power. It accounts for beamforming alignment errors and for multi-tier
cellular network deployments. Numerical results confirm that sufficiently dense

results for phononic thermal conduction in the suspended membrane geometry for
radial heat flow from a central source, which is a common geometry for some
low-temperature detectors, for example. We studied the case where only
diffusive surface scattering is present, the so called Casimir limit, which can
be experimentally relevant at temperatures below $\sim$ 10 K in typical
materials, and even higher for ultrathin samples. Here, we extend our studies
to much thinner membranes, obtaining numerical results for geometries which are
more typical in experiments. In addition, we interpret the results in terms of
a small signal and differential thermal conductance, so that guidelines for
designing devices, such as low-temperature bolometric detectors, are more
easily obtained. Scaling with membrane dimensions is shown to differ
significantly from the bulk scattering, and, in particular, thinning the
membrane is shown to lead to a much stronger reduction in thermal conductance
than what one would envision from the simplest bulk formulas.

review of the fast and accurate NUFFT based method in \cite{JGB} for nonlocal
interactions where the singularity of the Fourier symbol of the interaction
kernel at the origin can be canceled by switching to spherical or polar
coordinates. We then extend the method to compute other nonlocal interactions
whose Fourier symbols have stronger singularity at the origin that cannot be
canceled by the coordinate transform. Many of these interactions do not decay
at infinity in the physical space, which adds another layer of complexity since
it is more difficult to impose the correct artificial boundary conditions for
the truncated bounded computational domain. The performance of our method
against other existing methods is illustrated numerically, with particular
attention on the effect of the size of the computational domain in the physical
space. Finally, to study the ground state and dynamics of the NLSE, we propose
efficient and accurate numerical methods by combining the NUFFT method for
potential evaluation with the normalized gradient flow using backward Euler
Fourier pseudospectral discretization and time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral
method, respectively. Extensive numerical comparisons are carried out between
these methods and other existing methods for computing the ground state and

at bias voltage around magnon emission energy, forming a peak in the bias
dependence of noise power spectra density, independent of magnetic

AlO$_{x}$-based MTJ, and besides Lorentzian shape noise spectra in the
frequency domain, random telegraph noise (RTN) is visible in the time traces.
During repeated measurements the noise peak reduces and the RTN becomes
difficult to resolve, suggesting defects being annealed. The Lorentzian shape
noise spectra can be fitted with bias-dependent activation of RTN, with the
attempt frequency in the MHz range, consistent with magnon dynamics. These
findings suggest magnon-assisted activation of defects as the origin of the

galaxies whose X-ray luminosity exceeds the theoretical maximum for spherical
infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. Their luminosity
ranges from $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1} < L_X$(0.5 - 10 keV) $<10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
Since higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the
isotropic Eddington limit theoretical models have focused on black hole rather
than neutron star systems. The most challenging sources to explain are those at
the luminous end ($L_X$ > $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which require black hole
masses MBH >50 solar masses and/or significant departures from the standard
thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries. Here we report
broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M82, which
contains two bright ULXs. The observations reveal pulsations of average period
1.37 s with a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the
rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its
binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to $L_X$(3 - 30 keV) = $4.9
\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with
a variable ULX which can reach $L_X$ (0.3 - 10 keV) = $1.8 \times 10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. This association implies a luminosity ~100 times the Eddington limit
for a 1.4 solar mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known
accreting pulsar. This finding implies that neutron stars may not be rare in
the ULX population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion of
matter onto magnetized compact objects.

by Simmons et al. (2002) to compute the polarization as due to the photon
scattering on dust grains in the stellar wind. Motivated by the possibility to
perform a polarization measurement during an ongoing microlensing event, we
consider the recently reported event catalog by the OGLE collaboration covering
the 2001-2009 campaigns (OGLE-III events), that makes available the largest and
more comprehensive set of single lens microlensing events towards the Galactic
bulge. The study of these events, integrated by a Monte Carlo analysis, allows
us to estimate the expected polarization profiles and to predict for which
source stars and at which time is most convenient to perform a polarization
measurement in an ongoing event. We find that about two dozens of OGLE-III
events (about 1 percent of the total) have maximum polarization degree in the
range 0.1 < P_{\rm max} <1 percent, corresponding to source stars with apparent
magnitude I < 14.5, being very cool red giants.This signal is measurable by
using the FORS2 polarimeter at VLT telescope with about 1 hour integration

stellar populations has changed dramatically, as it is now thought that
basically all GCs host multiple stellar populations, each with its own chemical
abundance pattern and colour-magnitude diagram sequence. Recent spectroscopic
observations of asymptotic giant branch stars in the GC NGC6752 have disclosed
a low [Na/Fe] abundance for the whole sample, suggesting that they are all
first-generation stars, and that all second-generation stars fail to reach the
AGB in this cluster. A scenario proposed to explain these observations invokes
strong mass loss in second-generation horizontal branch stars possibly induced
by the metal enhancement associated to radiative levitation. This enhanced mass
loss would prevent second generation stars from reaching the AGB phase, thus
explaining at the same time the low value of the ratio between HB and AGB stars
(the R_2 parameter) observed in NGC6752. We have critically discussed this
scenario, finding that the required mass-loss rates are of the order of 10^{-9}
Mo/yr, significantly higher than current theoretical and empirical constraints.
By making use of synthetic HB simulations, we demonstrate that our modelling
predicts correctly the R_2 parameter for NGC6752, without the need to invoke
very efficient mass loss during the core He-burning stage. Our simulations for
NGC6752 HB predict however the presence of a significant fraction - at the
level of about 50% - second generation stars along the cluster AGB. We conclude
that there is no simple explanation for the lack of second generation stars in
the spectroscopically surveyed sample, although the interplay between mass loss
(with low rates) and radiative levitation may play a role in explaining this
puzzle.

demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of
the personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:
they continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first
systematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.
Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided
personalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes
already taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific
context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching
materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be
adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,
likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,
is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching
methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a
student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the
time spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor

Bose-Hubbard (BH) models: (1) a two-species generalization of the spinless BH
model, (2) a single-species, spin-1 BH model, and (3) the extended Bose-Hubbard
model (EBH) for spinless interacting bosons of one species. In all the phases
of these models we provide a unified treatment of random-phase-approximation
(RPA) excitation spectra. These spectra have gaps in all the MI phases and gaps
in the DW phases in the EBH model; they are gapless in all the SF phases in
these models and in the SS phases in the EBH model. We obtain the dependence of
(a) gaps $\Delta$ and (b) the sound velocity $u_s$ on the parameters of these
models and examine $\Delta$ and $u_s$ as these systems go through phase
transitions. At the SF-MI transitions in the spin-1 BH model, $u_s$ goes to
zero continuously (discontinuously) for MI phases with an odd (even) number of
bosons per site; this is consistent with the natures of these transition in
mean-field theory. In the SF phases of these models, our excitation spectra
agree qualitatively, at weak couplings, with those that can be obtained from
Gross-Pitaevskii-type models. We compare the results of our work with earlier
studies of related models and discuss implications for experiments.

processing (QIP) experiments, there is a tradeoff between the coincide count
rates (i.e. the pumping power of the SPDC), which limits the rate of the

quality of the protocol. This tradeoff is mainly caused by the multi-photon
pair emissions from the SPDCs. In theory, the problem is how to model the
experiments without truncating these multi-photon emissions while including
practical imperfections.
  In this paper, we establish a method to theoretically simulate SPDC based
QIPs which fully incorporates the effect of multi-photon emissions and various
practical imperfections. The key ingredient in our method is the application of
the characteristic function formalism which has been used in continuous
variable QIPs. We apply our method to three examples, the Hong-Ou-Mandel

concatenated entanglement swapping protocol. For the first two examples, we
show that our theoretical results quantitatively agree with the recent
experimental results. Also we provide the closed expressions for these the
interference visibilities with the full multi-photon components and various
imperfections. For the last example, we provide the general theoretical form of
the concatenated entanglement swapping protocol in our method and show the
numerical results up to 5 concatenations. Our method requires only a small
computation resource (few minutes by a commercially available computer) which
was not possible by the previous theoretical approach. Our method will have
applications in a wide range of SPDC based QIP protocols with high accuracy and

first use of the technique in a laboratory setting. We apply it in a spherical
cavity with a spinning central core (spherical-Couette flow) to determine the
mean azimuthal velocity of the air filling the cavity. We excite a number of
acoustic resonances (analogous to p-modes in the Sun) using a speaker and
record the response with an array of small microphones on the outer sphere.
Many observed acoustic modes show rotationally-induced splittings, which allow
us to perform an inversion to determine the air's azimuthal velocity as a
function of both radius and latitude. We validate the method by comparing the
velocity field obtained through inversion against the velocity profile measured
with a calibrated hot film anemometer. This 'modal acoustic velocimetry'
technique has great potential for laboratory setups involving rotating fluids
in axisymmetric cavities. It will be useful especially in liquid metals where
direct optical methods are unsuitable and ultrasonic techniques very

  soft-glassy materials",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the Couette flow of a quasi-2d soft-glassy material in a Hele-Shaw
geometry. The material is chosen to be above the jamming point, where a yield
stress $\sigma_Y$ emerges, below which the material deforms elastically and
above which it flows like a complex fluid according to a Herschel-Bulkley (HB)
rheology. Simultaneously, the effect of the confining plates is modelled as an
effective linear friction law, while the walls aside the Hele-Shaw cell are
sufficiently close to each other to allow visible cooperativity effects in the
velocity profiles (Goyon et al., Nature 454, 84-87 (2008)). The effects of
cooperativity are parametrized with a steady-state diffusion-relaxation
equation for the fluidity field $f = \dot{\gamma}/\sigma$, defined as the ratio
between shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$ and shear stress $\sigma$. For particular
rheological flow-curves (Bingham fluids), the problem is tackled analytically:
we explore the two regimes $\sigma \gg \sigma_Y$ and $\sigma \approx \sigma_Y$
and quantify the effect of the extra localisation induced by the wall friction.
Other rheo-thinning fluids are explored with the help of numerical simulations
based on lattice Boltzmann models, revealing a robustness of the analytical
findings. Synergies and comparisons with other existing works in the literature
(Barry et al., Phil. Mag. Lett. 91, 432-440 (2011)) are also discussed.

We investigate the long-term evolution of the Cyclotron Resonance

Methods. Our results are based on repeated observations of Her X-1 by those
X-ray observatories capable of measuring clearly beyond the cyclotron line
energy of about 40 keV. Results. The historical evolution of the pulse phase
averaged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized
by an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about 40
keV between 1990 and 1994, and an apparent decay thereafter. Much of this
decay, however, was found to be due to an artifact, namely a correlation
between Ecyc and the X-ray luminosity Lx discovered in 2007. In observations
after 2006, however, we now find a statistically significant true decrease in
the cyclotron line energy. At the same time, the dependence of Ecyc on X-ray
luminosity is still valid with an increase of about 5% in energy for a factor
of two increase in luminosity. A decrease in Ecyc by 4.2 keV over the 16 years
from 1996 to 2012 can either be modeled by a linear decay, or by a slow decay
until 2006 followed by a more abrupt decrease thereafter. Conclusions. We
speculate that the physical reason could be connected to a geometric
displacement of the cyclotron resonant scattering region in the polar field or
to a true physical change in the magnetic field configuration at the polar cap
by the continued accretion.

offshore wind farm, which is located in the Oresund Strait between Sweden and
Denmark. The simulation combines a dynamic representation of wind turbines
embedded within a Large-Eddy Simulation CFD solver, and uses hr-adaptive
meshing to increase or decrease mesh resolution where required. This allows the
resolution of both large scale flow structures around the wind farm, and local
flow conditions at individual turbines; consequently, the response of each
turbine to local conditions can be modelled, as well as the resulting evolution
of the turbine wakes. This paper provides a detailed description of the turbine
model which simulates interactions between the wind, turbine rotors, and
turbine generators by calculating the forces on the rotor, the body forces on
the air, and instantaneous power output. This model was used to investigate a
selection of key wind speeds and directions, investigating cases where a row of
turbines would be aligned with the wind or at specific angles to the wind.
Results shown include presentations of the spin-up of turbines, the observation
of eddies moving through the turbine array, meandering turbine wakes, and an
extensive wind farm wake several kilometres in length. The key measurement
available for cross-validation with operational wind farm data is the power
output from the individual turbines, where the effect of unsteady turbine wakes
on the performance of downstream turbines was a point of interest. The results
from simulations were compared to performance measurements from the real wind
farm to provide a firm quantitative validation of this methodology. Having
achieved good agreement between the model and actual wind farm measurements,
the potential of the methodology to provide a tool for further investigations
of engineering and atmospheric science problems is outlined.

differential rotation due to baroclinic effects. We solve the eigenvalue
problem with high-resolution spectral simulations and determine the propagation
domain of the waves through the theory of characteristics. We explore the
propagation properties of two kinds of modes: those that can propagate in the
entire shell and those that are restricted to a subdomain. Some of the modes
that we find concentrate kinetic energy around short-period shear layers known
as attractors. We characterise these attractors by the dependence of their
Lyapunov exponent with the \BV frequency of the background and the oscillation
frequency of the mode. Finally, we note that, as modes associated with
short-period attractors form dissipative structures, they could play an
important role for tidal interactions but should be dismissed in the

superconductivity in the p-type (hole doped) cuprates is proposed. The theory
includes mechanisms to account for e-pair coupling in the superconducting and
pseudogap phases and their inter relations observed in these materials.
  Electron pair coupling in the superconducting phase is facilitated by local
quantum potentials created by static dopants in a mechanism which explains
experimentally observed optimal doping levels and the associated peak in
critical temperature. By contrast, evidence suggests that electrons
contributing to the pseudogap are predominantly coupled by fractal spin waves
(fractons) induced by the fractal arrangement of dopants.
  On another level, the theory offers new insights into the emergence of a
macroscopic quantum potential generated by a fractal distribution of dopants.
This, in turn, leads to the emergence of coherent, macroscopic spin waves and a
second associated macroscopic quantum potential, possibly supported by charge
order. These quantum potentials play two key roles. The first involves the
transition of an expected diffusive process (normally associated with Anderson
localization) in fractal networks, into e-pair coherence. The second involves
the facilitation of tunnelling between localized e-pairs. These combined
effects lead to the merger of the super conducting and pseudo gap phases into a
single coherent condensate at optimal doping. The underlying theory relating to
the diffusion to quantum transition is supported by Coherent Random Lasing,
which can be explained using an analogous approach. As a final step, an
experimental program is outlined to validate the theory and suggests a new
approach to increase the stability of electron pair condensates at higher
temperatures.

from NVSS source counts around Planck-selected cluster candidates, and include
appropriate correlations in our mock maps. The study allows us to quantify the

surveys, and will detect $33^{+17}_{-11}$ new radio sources brighter than 0.87
mJy at 30~GHz in a 1 deg$^2$ field at $>5\sigma$ CL during a one-year,

conditions. It is unlikely that any galaxy cluster will be detected at
$3\sigma$ CL in such a survey. A $60$-deg$^2$ survey, with field coverage of
$2^2$ beams per pixel, at 15 GHz with the RTH, would find <1.5 galaxy clusters
per year brighter than 60 $\mu$Jy (at $3\sigma$ CL), and would detect about
$3.4 \times 10^4$ point sources brighter than 1 mJy at $5\sigma$ CL, with
confusion causing flux density errors $\lesssim 2\%$ (20%) in 68% (95%) of the

widely different requirements for the running conditions, the LHC machine has
been faced with a long list of challenges in the first three years of
luminosity production (2010-2012, Run 1), many of which were potentially
capable of limiting the performance due to instabilities resulting from the
extremely high bunch brightness. Nonetheless, LHC met the challenges and
performed extremely well at high efficiency and routinely with beam brightness
at twice the design, well over one-third of the time in collision for physics,
average luminosity lifetimes in excess of 10 h and extremely good background
conditions in the experiments. While the experimental running configurations
remain largely the same for the future high luminosity proton-proton
operational mode, the energy and the luminosity should increase significantly,
making a prior assessment of related beam-beam effects extremely important to
guarantee high performance. Of particular interest is the need for levelling
the luminosity individually in the different experiments. Luminosity control as
the more general version of 'levelling' has been at the heart of the success
for LHCb, and to a large extent also for ALICE, throughout Run 1. With the
increasing energy and potential luminosity, luminosity control may be required
by all the experiments at some point in the future as a means of controlling
the pileup conditions and trigger rates, but possibly also as a way of
optimizing the integrated luminosity. This paper reviews the various
motivations and possibilities for controlling the luminosity from the
experiments' point of view, and outlines the future running conditions and
desiderata for the experiments as they are viewed currently, with the aim of
giving guidelines for different options.

mechanism of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with one compactified

sufficiently small compactification radius, equivalent to a high temperature in
the thermal theory where antiperiodic fermion boundary conditions are applied.
Periodic fermion boundary conditions, on the other hand, are related to the
Witten index and confinement is expected to persist independently of the length
of the compactified dimension. We study this aspect with lattice Monte Carlo
simulations for different values of the fermion mass parameter that breaks
supersymmetry softly. We find a deconfined region that shrinks when the fermion
mass is lowered. Deconfinement takes place between two confined regions at
large and small compactification radii, that would correspond to low and high
temperatures in the thermal theory. At the smallest fermion masses we find no
indication of a deconfinement transition. These results are a first signal for
the predicted continuity in the compactification of supersymmetric Yang-Mills

introducing an infinite network of interacting potential fields (living in

achieving empirical adequacy (like that enjoyed by GRW type theories) with a
more modest ontological complexity, and provide some preliminary evidence for

use a closed-loop scheme in which the environment is measured, the outcome

of excitation in nuclei far away from stability represents an area of intense
research activity. In addition, these modes of excitation appear to be
sensitive to the uncertain density dependence of the symmetry energy. We study
the emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar
monopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel
isotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength
is computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several
accurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral
Green's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the
continuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the
continuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of
low-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy
of the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of
symmetric nuclear matter. In contrast, the large neutron excess in both 68Ni
and 78Ni generates a significant, yet relatively featureless, amount of
low-energy strength that is driven by transitions into the continuum. Moreover,
the evolution of monopole strength with neutron excess displays sensitivity to
the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Our results suggest that future
measurements of the distribution of isoscalar monopole strength at radioactive
beam facilities using a very long chain of both stable and unstable isotopes
could place important constraints on the equation of state of neutron-rich
matter and ultimately on the properties of neutron stars. However, given the
nature of the low-energy monopole excitations, a proper treatment of the
continuum is essential.

been used in centralized systems due to their low computational requirements
and at the same time their relatively good performance in estimating sparse
parameter vectors/signals. The paper reports two new algorithms in the context
of sparsity--aware learning. In both cases, the goal is first to identify the
support set of the unknown signal and then to estimate the non--zero values
restricted to the active support set. First, an iterative greedy multi--step
procedure is developed, based on a neighborhood cooperation strategy, using
batch processing on the observed data. Next, an extension of the algorithm to
the online setting, based on the diffusion LMS rationale for adaptivity, is
derived. Theoretical analysis of the algorithms is provided, where it is shown
that the batch algorithm converges to the unknown vector if a Restricted
Isometry Property (RIP) holds. Moreover, the online version converges in the
mean to the solution vector under some general assumptions. Finally, the

has been demonstrated as a viable solution to detector side-channel attacks.
One of the main advantages of MDI-QKD is that the security can be proved
without making any assumptions about how the measurement device works. The
price to pay is the relatively low secure key rate comparing with conventional
quantum key distribution (QKD), such as the decoy-state BB84 protocol. Recently
a new QKD protocol, aiming at bridging the strong security of MDI-QKD with the
high efficiency of conventional QKD, has been proposed. In this protocol, the
legitimate receiver employs a trusted linear optics network to encode
information on photons received from an insecure quantum channel, and then
performs a Bell state measurement (BSM) using untrusted detectors. One crucial
assumption made in most of these studies is that the untrusted BSM located
inside the receiver's laboratory cannot send any unwanted information to the
outside. Here, we show that if the BSM is completely untrusted, a simple scheme
would allow the BSM to send information to the outside. Combined with Trojan
horse attacks, this scheme could allow Eve to gain information of the quantum
key without being detected. To prevent the above attack, either countermeasures
to Trojan horse attacks or some trustworthiness to the ""untrusted"" BSM device
is required.

attracted much attention in recent years and a general solution to the problem
is still lacking. A promising ratio estimator based on the singular values of
the lagged autocovariance matrix has been recently proposed in the literature
and is shown to have a good performance under some specific assumption on the
strength of the factors. Inspired by this ratio estimator and as a first main
contribution, this paper proposes a complete theory of such sample singular
values for both the factor part and the noise part under the large-dimensional
scheme where the dimension and the sample size proportionally grow to infinity.
In particular, we provide the exact description of the phase transition
phenomenon that determines whether a factor is strong enough to be detected
with the observed sample singular values. Based on these findings and as a
second main contribution of the paper, we propose a new estimator of the number
of factors which is strongly consistent for the detection of all significant
factors (which are the only theoretically detectable ones). In particular,
factors are assumed to have the minimum strength above the phase transition
boundary which is of the order of a constant; they are thus not required to
grow to infinity together with the dimension (as assumed in most of the
existing papers on high-dimensional factor models). Empirical Monte-Carlo study
as well as the analysis of stock returns data attest a very good performance of
the proposed estimator. In all the tested cases, the new estimator largely
outperforms the existing estimator using the same ratios of singular values.

owners of device, e.g., either smartphones, machines or tablets, are willing to

order to avoid the payment for a new antivirus. We model the interaction
between nodes as a non-cooperative games where the node has two strategies:
either to update the antivirus or not. To this aim, we provide a full

the price of protection on the equilibrium as well as the efficiency of the

generally, at the interface between a metallic film and a different metallic or
insulating material) greatly amplifies the influence of the spin-orbit
interaction on the surface properties. The best known manifestation of this
effect is the momentum-dependent splitting of the surface state energies
(Rashba effect). Here we show that the same interaction also generates a
spin-polarization of the bulk states when an electric current is driven through
the bulk of the film. For a semi-infinite jellium model, which is
representative of metals with a closed Fermi surface, we prove as a theorem
that, regardless of the shape of the confinement potential, the induced surface
spin density at each surface is given by ${\bf S} =-\gamma \hbar {\bf \hat
z}\times {\bf j}$, where ${\bf j}$ is the particle current density in the bulk,
${\bf \hat z}$ the unit vector normal to the surface, and
$\gamma=\frac{\hbar}{4mc^2}$ contains only fundamental constants. For a general
metallic solid $\gamma$ becomes a material-specific parameter that controls the
strength of the interfacial spin-orbit coupling. Our theorem, combined with an
{\it ab initio} calculation of the spin polarization of the current-carrying
film, enables a determination of $\gamma$, which should be useful in modeling
the spin-dependent scattering of quasiparticles at the interface.

fundamentally associated with the existence of Lagrange multipliers for the
regularized variational inequality. A regularization is said to be exact if a
solution to the regularized problem is a solution to the unregularized problem

corresponding to a particular regularization of a variational inequality, on
the other hand, are defined via the dual gap function. Our analysis suggests
various conceptual, iteratively regularized numerical schemes, for which we
provide error bounds, and hence stopping criteria, under the additional

transmission spectroscopy, and its application to the study of exoplanet

defocussed transmission spectroscopy has an added advantage over normal
spectroscopy in that it reduces systematic errors due to flat-fielding, PSF
variations, slit-jaw imperfections and other effects associated with
ground-based observations. For one of the planetary systems studied, WASP-12b,
we report a tentative detection of additional Na absorption of
0.12+/-0.03[+0.03]% during transit using a 2A wavelength mask. After
consideration of a systematic that occurs mid-transit, it is likely that the
true depth is actually closer to 0.15%. This is a similar level of absorption
reported in the atmosphere of HD209458b (0.135+/-0.017%, Snellen et al. 2008).
Finally, we outline methods that will improve the technique during future
observations, based on our findings from this pilot study.

Oph A SM1 and SM1N. The data reveal small-scale condensations within both
cores, with mass upper limits of M <~ 0.02M_Sun (~ 20 M_Jup). The SM1
condensation is consistent with a nearly-symmetric Gaussian source with a width
of only 37 AU. The SM1N condensation is elongated, and extends 500 AU along its
major axis. No evidence for substructure is seen in either source. A Jeans
analysis indicates these sources are unlikely to fragment, suggesting that both
will form single stars. H2D+ is only detected toward SM1N, offset from the
continuum peak by ~150-200 AU. This offset may be due to either heating from an
undetected, young, low luminosity protostellar source or first hydrostatic
core, or HD (and consequently H2D+) depletion in the cold centre of the
condensation. We propose that SM1 is protostellar, and that the condensation
detected by ALMA is a warm (T ~ 30-50 K) accretion disk. The less concentrated
emission of the SM1N condensation suggests that it is still starless, but we
cannot rule out the presence of a low-luminosity source, perhaps surrounded by
a pseudodisk. These data reveal observationally the earliest stages of the
formation of circumstellar accretion regions, and agree with theoretical
predictions that disk formation can occur very early in the star formation
process, coeval with or just after the formation of a first hydrostatic core or
protostar.

star periastron passages where the density is enhanced due to the presence of

explanation to the counterintuitive smaller spin-up rate observed at higher

scalable. However, existing schemes typically require extensive adaptive
switching, which is experimentally challenging and noisy, thousands of photon
sources per renormalized qubit, and/or large quantum memories for
repeat-until-success strategies. Our work overcomes all these problems. We
present a scheme to construct a cluster state universal for quantum
computation, which uses no adaptive switching, no large memories, and which is
at least an order of magnitude more resource-efficient than previous passive
schemes. Unlike previous proposals, it is constructed entirely from
loss-detecting gates and offers a robustness to photon loss. Even without the
use of an active loss-tolerant encoding, our scheme naturally tolerates a total
loss rate of $\sim 1.6\%$ in the photons detected in the gates. This scheme
uses only 3-GHZ states as a resource, together with a passive linear-optical
network. We fully describe and model the iterative process of cluster
generation, including photon loss and gate failure. This demonstrates that
building a linear optical quantum computer need be less challenging than
previously thought.

modelling that merges coarse-grained simulations, describing the typical

for a system of DNA coated colloids for which we compute the hybridisation free
energy cost associated to the binding of tethered single stranded DNAs
terminated by short sequences of complementary nucleotides. In order to
demonstrate the versatility of our method, we also consider polymers
functionalized by receptors that bind a surface decorated by ligands. In
particular we compute the density of states of adsorbed polymers as a function
of the number of ligand-receptor complexes formed. Such a quantity can be used
to study the conformational properties of adsorbed polymers useful when
engineering adsorption with tailored properties. We successfully compare the
results with the predictions of a mean field theory. We believe that the

diagonalization, we find clear signatures of fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
states at filling factors 1/3 and 1/5 for fermions (1/2 and 1/4 for bosons) in
the lowest Chern band with a robust spectrum gap at moderate dipolar
interaction strength. The robustness of these FQH states against long-range
interaction tail and band flatness is investigated. When the dipolar
interaction decreases, the fermionic FQH states turn into normal states, and
the bosonic 1/4-FQH state turns into a superfluid state. The bosonic 1/2-FQH
state survives even in the absence of the dipolar interaction, but vanishes
when the hard core becomes a soft core with a critical onsite repulsion. In the
thin torus limit, the static density structure factors indicates that the FQH
state turns into a commensurate charge density wave (CDW) state.

mutually exclusive; and therefore, focus on developing different approaches to
perform the binary classification tasks. In this paper, we show that scene

networks deploying multicarrier transmission. Nodes in the network have
different notions of timing, so from the viewpoint of a typical receiver, the
received signals from different transmitters are asynchronous, leading to a
loss of orthogonality between subcarriers. We first develop a detailed
link-level analysis based on OFDM, based on which we propose a tractable
system-level signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model for
asynchronous OFDM networks. The proposed model is used to analytically
characterize several important statistics in asynchronous networks with
spatially distributed transmitters, including (i) the number of decodable
transmitters, (ii) the decoding probability of the nearest transmitter, and
(iii) the system throughput. The system-level loss from lack of synchronization
is quantified, and to mitigate the loss, we compare and discuss four possible
solutions including extended cyclic prefix, advanced receiver timing, dynamic
receiver timing positioning, and semi-static receiver timing positioning with
multiple timing hypotheses. The model and results are general, and apply to ad
hoc networks, cellular systems, and neighbor discovery in device-to-device

four of these SMGs have redshifts of z=2.2. We also present evidence that
another SMG in this field, detected earlier at 850 micron, has a counterpart
that exhibits Halpha and CO(1-0) emission at z=2.15. Including the radio galaxy

least eight submm sources are part of the protocluster at z=2.16 associated
with the radio galaxy MRC1138-262. We measure a star formation rate density
SFRD ~1500 Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3, four magnitudes higher than the global SFRD of
blank fields at this redshift. Strikingly, these eight sources are concentrated
within a region of 2 Mpc (the typical size of clusters in the local universe)

z=2.2. This concentration of massive, dusty starbursts is not centered on the
submillimeter-bright radio galaxy which could support the infalling of these
sources into the cluster center. Approximately half (6/11) of the SMGs that are
covered by the Halpha imaging data are associated with Halpha emitters,

complexity of structure and large amount of data involved. Methods. A new
Wavelet-based Image Segmentation and Evaluation (WISE) method is developed for

reproduces exceptionally well the previous results of model fitting evaluation
of the structure and kinematics in these jets. Extending the WISE structure
analysis to the finer scales provides the first robust measurements of
two-dimensional velocity fields in these jets and indicates that the velocity
fields are likely to reflect the evolution of Kelvin-Hemlholtz instability

conclusion is that the spin orientation and magnitude is initially well

merging and accretion history of each halo. We provide evidence that the
topology of the merging region, i.e. the number of colliding filaments, gives
an accurate prediction for the spin of dark matter and gas: halos at the center

high spin. The spin of a halo is given by $\lambda \approx 0.05 \times

electroencephalography (EEG) signal related to the movement imagination. The
analysis of sensorimotor rhythms in time-frequency maps reveals the
event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the post-movement event-related
synchronization (ERS), observed mainly in the contralateral hemisphere to the
hand moved for the motor imagery. The signal has been parameterized in
accordance with FNS method. The significant changes of the FNS parameters, at
the time when the subject imagines the movement, have been observed. The
analysis of these parameters allows to distinguish between imagination of right
and left hands movement. Our study shows that the flicker-noise spectroscopy
can be an alternative method of analyzing EEG signal related to the imagination
of movement in terms of a potential application in the brain-computer interface
(BCI).

subspaces of the wavelet analysis induced by the MRA, together with the set
inclusion relation, form a very special lattice of subspaces which herein is
called a ""primorial lattice"". This paper introduces an operator R that extracts
a set of 2^{N-1} element Boolean lattices from a 2^N element Boolean lattice.
Used recursively, a sequence of Boolean lattices with decreasing order is
generated---a structure that is similar to an MRA. A second operator, which is
a special case of a ""difference operator"", is introduced that operates on
consecutive Boolean lattices L_2^n and L_2^{n-1} to produce a sequence of
orthocomplemented lattices. These two sequences, together with the subset
ordering relation, form a primorial lattice P. A logic or probability
constructed on a Boolean lattice L_2^N likewise induces a primorial lattice P.
Such a logic or probability can then be rendered at N different ""resolutions""
by selecting any one of the N Boolean lattices in P and at N different
""frequencies"" by selecting any of the N different orthocomplemented lattices in
P. Furthermore, P can be used for symbolic sequence analysis by projecting
sequences of symbols onto the sublattices in P using one of three lattice
projectors introduced. P can be used for symbolic sequence processing by
judicious rejection and selection of projected sequences. Examples of symbolic
sequences include sequences of logic values, sequences of probabilistic events,
and genomic sequences (as used in ""genomic signal processing"").

networks to provide the reliability of the data delivery. The improvement of
TCP performance was also achieved with different types of networks with
introduction of new TCP variants. However, there are still many factors that
affect performance of TCP. Mobility is one of the major affects on TCP
performance in wireless networks and MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network). To
determine the best TCP variant from mobility point of view, we simulate some
TCP variants in real life scenario. This paper addresses the performance of TCP
variants such as TCP-Tahoe, TCP-Reno, TCP-New Reno, TCPVegas,TCP-SACK and
TCP-Westwood from mobility point of view.The scenarios presented in this paper
are supported by Zone routing Protocol (ZRP) with integration of random
waypoint mobility model in MANET area. The scenario shows the speed of walking
person to a vehicle and suited particularly for mountainous and deserted areas.
On the basis of simulation, we analyze Round trip time (RTT) fairness,
End-to-End delay, control overhead, number of broken links during the delivery
of data. Finally analyzed parameters help to find out the best TCP variant.

  March 2014",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  WSNs are becoming an appealing research area due to their several application
domains. The performance of WSNs depends on the topology of sensors and their
ability to adapt to changes in the network. Sensor nodes are often resource
constrained by their limited power, less communication distance capacity, and
restricted sensing capability. Therefore, they need to cooperate with each
other to accomplish a specific task. Thus, clustering enables sensor nodes to
communicate through the cluster head node for continuous communication process.
In this paper, we introduce a dynamic cluster head election mechanism. Each
node in the cluster calculates its residual energy value to determine its
candidacy to become the Cluster Head Node (CHN). With this mechanism, each
sensor node compares its residual energy level to other nodes in the same
cluster. Depending on the residual energy level the sensor node acts as the
next cluster head. Evaluation of the dynamic CHN election mechanism is
conducted using network simulator-2 (ns2). The simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime and balancing the
energy
