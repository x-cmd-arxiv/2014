Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) survey telescope between 2012 May 20 and 2013 November 9, a
period during which PS1 discovered two main-belt comets, P/2012 T1 (PANSTARRS)
and P/2013 R3 (Catalina-PANSTARRS). PS1 comet detection procedures currently
consist of the comparison of the point spread functions (PSFs) of moving
objects to those of reference stars, and the flagging of objects that show
anomalously large radial PSF widths. Based on the number of missed discovery
opportunities among comets discovered by other observers, we estimate an upper
limit comet discovery efficiency rate of ~70% for PS1. Additional analyses that
could improve comet discovery yields in future surveys include linear PSF
analysis, modeling of trailed stellar PSFs for comparison to trailed moving
object PSFs, searches for azimuthally localized activity, comparison of
point-source-optimized photometry to extended-source-optimized photometry,
searches for photometric excesses in objects with known absolute magnitudes,
and crowd-sourcing. Analysis of PS1 survey statistics indicates an expected
fraction of 59 MBCs per 10^6 outer main-belt asteroids, and a 95% confidence
upper limit of 96 MBCs per 10^6 outer main-belt asteroids. We note that more
sensitive future surveys could detect many more MBCs than estimated here. We
find an excess of high eccentricities (0.1 < e < 0.3) among all known MBCs
relative to the background asteroid population. Theoretical calculations show
that, given these eccentricities, the sublimation rate for a typical MBC is
orders of magnitude larger at perihelion than at aphelion, providing a
plausible physical explanation for the observed behavior of MBCs peaking in
observed activity strength near perihelion.

show that for a linear deterministic model the capacity of the diamond channel
in each direction can be simultaneously achieved for all values of channel
parameters, where the forward and backward channel parameters are not
necessarily the same. We divide the achievability scheme into three cases,
depending on the forward and backward channel parameters. For the first case,
we use a reverse amplify-and-forward strategy in the relays. For the second
case, we use four relay strategies based on the reverse amplify-and-forward
with some modifications in terms of replacement and repetition of some stream
levels. For the third case, we use two relay strategies based on performing two
rounds of repetitions in a relay. The proposed schemes for deterministic
channels are used to find the capacity regions within constant gaps for two
special cases of the Gaussian two-way diamond channel. First, for the general
Gaussian two-way relay channel with a simple coding scheme the smallest gap is
achieved compared to the prior works. Then, a special symmetric Gaussian
two-way diamond model is considered and the capacity region is achieved within

all projections preserve dimension of measures on $[0,1]^2$ that are the
product of a $\times m$-invariant and a $\times n$-invariant measure (for $m$,
$n$ multiplicatively independent). Using these tools, Ferguson, Fraser and
Sahlsten extended that conservation result to $(\times m,\times n)$-invariant

measures which could not be extended beyond the Bernoulli case. In this work,
we extend their result from Bernoulli measures to Gibbs measures on any

achieved by reducing the problem to that of the pointwise convergence of a

spectral image compression. This enormous amount of data needs more space to
store and more time to transmit. To manage this sheer amount of data,
researchers have investigated different techniques so that image quality can be
conserved and compressibility can be improved. The principle component analysis
(PCA) can be employed to reduce the dimensions of spectral images to achieve
high compressibility and performance. Due to processing complexity of PCA, a
simple interpolation technique called cubic spline interpolation (CSI) was
considered to reduce the dimensionality of spectral domain of spectral images.
The CSI and PCA were employed one by one in the spectral domain and were
amalgamated with the JPEG, which was employed in spatial domain. Three measures
including compression rate (CR), processing time (Tp) and color difference
CIEDE2000 were used for performance analysis. Test results showed that for a
fixed value of compression rate, CSI based algorithm performed poor in terms of
dE00, in comparison with PCA, but is still reliable because of small color
difference. On the other hand it has lower complexity and is computationally
much better as compared to PCA based algorithm, especially for spectral images
with large size.

canonical model with a saddle node bifurcation and a slowly varying bifurcation
parameter. Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior
characterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In
the absence of the periodic forcing, it is well-known that a slowly varying
bifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the
bifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we
consider the effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative
to the drifting rate of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter.
  We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the
bifurcation parameter varies more slowly, with the advance of the tipping point
proportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low
frequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency,
amplitude and phase of the oscillation. The results are based on an analysis of
the local concavity of the trajectory, used for low frequencies both of the
same order as the drifting rate of the bifurcation parameter and for low
frequencies larger than the drifting rate. The tipping point location is
advanced with increased amplitude of the periodic forcing, with critical
amplitudes where there are jumps in the location, yielding significant advances
in the tipping point. We demonstrate the analysis for two applications with

similarities between networks. In computational biology, it can be used to
transfer biological knowledge from a well-studied species to a poorly-studied
species between aligned network regions. Typically, existing network aligners
first compute similarities between nodes in different networks (via a node cost
function) and then aim to find a high-scoring alignment (node mapping between
the networks) with respect to ""node conservation"", typically the total node
cost function over all aligned nodes. Only after an alignment is constructed,
the existing methods evaluate its quality with respect to an alternative
measure, such as ""edge conservation"". Thus, we recently aimed to directly
optimize edge conservation while constructing an alignment, which improved
alignment quality. Here, we approach a novel idea of maximizing both node and
edge conservation, and we also approach this idea from a novel perspective, by
aligning optimally edges between networks first in order to improve node cost
function needed to then align well nodes between the networks. In the process,
unlike the existing measures of edge conservation that treat each conserved
edge the same, we favor conserved edges that are topologically similar over
conserved edges that are topologically dissimilar. We show that our novel

have $r$ source-sink pairs and the goal is to delete a minimum-cost set of
edges to reduce the edge-connectivity of every source-sink pair to below $k$.
The $k$-route extensions of multiway cut ($k$-MWC), and the minimum $s$-$t$ cut
problem ($k$-$(s,t)$-cut), are similarly defined. We present various
approximation and hardness results for these $k$-route cut problems that
improve the state-of-the-art for these problems in several cases. (i) For {\em
$k$-route multiway cut}, we devise simple, but surprisingly effective,
combinatorial algorithms that yield bicriteria approximation guarantees that
markedly improve upon the previous-best guarantees. (ii) For {\em $k$-route
multicut}, we design algorithms that improve upon the previous-best
approximation factors by roughly an $O(\sqrt{\log r})$-factor, when $k=2$, and
for general $k$ and unit costs and any fixed violation of the connectivity
threshold $k$. The main technical innovation is the definition of a new,
powerful \emph{region growing} lemma that allows us to perform region-growing
in a recursive fashion even though the LP solution yields a {\em different
metric} for each source-sink pair. (iii) We complement these results by showing
that the {\em $k$-route $s$-$t$ cut} problem is at least as hard to approximate
as the {\em densest-$k$-subgraph} (DkS) problem on uniform hypergraphs.

$M_u\in\mathbb{N}$ antennas each, where $M_u$ need not be the same for all
$u\in[1:K]$.
  Starting from a $3$-user example, it is shown that existing cooperation-based
outer bounds are insufficient to characterize the DoF. Moreover, it is shown
that two distinct operating regimes exist. With a {\it dominant} user, i.e., a
user that has more antennas than the other two users combined, %(say $M_1\geq
M_2+M_3$), it is DoF optimal to let that user transmit alone on the IC.
Otherwise, it is DoF optimal to {\em decompose} and operate the 3-user MIMO IC
as an $(M_1+ M_2+M_3)$-user SISO IC. This indicates that MIMO operations are
useless from a DoF perspective in systems without a dominant user.
  The main contribution of the paper is the derivation of a novel outer bound
for the general $K$-user case that is tight in the regime where a dominant user
is not present; this is done by generalizing the insights from the 3-user
example to an arbitrary number of users.

remains an open question in modern astrophysics. There is a significant
discrepancy between what the existing methods predict for a response to mass
loss of the giant itself, as well as for the mass transfer rate during the
Roche lobe overflow. Here we show that the recombination energy in the
superadiabatic layer plays an important and hitherto unaccounted-for role in he
donor's response to mass loss, in particular on its luminosity and effective
temperature. Our improved optically thick nozzle method to calculate the mass
transfer rate via $L_1$ allows us to evolve binary systems for a substantial
Roche lobe overflow. We propose a new, strengthened criterion for the mass
transfer instability, basing it on whether the donor experiences overflow
through its outer Lagrangian point. We find that with the new criterion, if the
donor has a well-developed outer convective envelope, the critical initial mass
ratio for which a binary would evolve stably through the conservative mass
transfer varies from $1.5$ to $2.2$, which is about twice as large as
previously believed. In underdeveloped giants with shallow convective envelopes
this critical ratio may be even larger. When the convective envelope is still
growing, and in particular for most cases of massive donors, the critical mass
ratio gradually decreases to this value, from that of radiative donors.

also derive an improved condition showing that networks with the rich-club

visual system needs to extract rapidly the most important elements of the
external world from a large flux of information, for survival purposes. A rapid
and reliable detection of visual stimuli is essential for triggering autonomic
responses to emotive stimuli, for initiating adaptive behaviors and for
orienting towards potentially interesting/ dangerous stimuli. The speed of
visual processing can be as fast as 20 ms, about only 20 times the duration of
the elementary information exchanges by the action potential. The limitations
to the brain capacity to process visual information, imposed by intrinsic
energetic costs of neuronal activity, and ecological limits to the size of the
skull, require a strong data reduction at an early stage, by creating a compact
summary of relevant information, the so called ""primal sketch"", to be handled
by further levels of processing. This is quite similar to the problem of
experimental HEP of providing fast data reduction at a reasonable monetary
cost, and with a practical device size. As a result of a joint effort of HEP
physicists and practicing vision scientists, we recently proposed that not only
the problems are similar, but the solutions adopted in the two cases also have
strong similarities, and their parallel study can actually shed light on each
other. Modeling the visual system as a trigger processor leads to a deeper
understanding, and even very specific predictions of its functionality.
Conversely, the insights gained from this new approach to vision, can lead to
new ideas for enhancing the capabilities of artificial vision systems, and HEP
trigger systems as well.

show how to simplify ancilla preparation, reducing the cost of error correction
by more than a factor of four. Using this optimized ancilla preparation, we
develop improved techniques for proving rigorous lower bounds on the noise

  Additional overhead can be incurred because quantum algorithms must be
translated into sequences of gates that are actually available in the quantum
computer. In particular, arbitrary single-qubit rotations must be decomposed
into a discrete set of fault-tolerant gates. We find that by using a special
class of non-deterministic circuits, the cost of decomposition can be reduced
by as much as a factor of four over state-of-the-art techniques, which
typically use deterministic circuits.

classical result that the convolution of any $d$ non-trivial, $G$ -invariant,
orbital measures is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure on
$\mathfrak{g}$ and the sum of any $d$ non-trivial orbits has non-empty
interior. The number $d$ was later reduced to the rank of the Lie algebra (or
rank $+1$ in the case of type $A_{n}$). More recently, the minimal integer
$k=k(X)$ such that the $k$-fold convolution of the orbital measure supported on
the orbit generated by $X$ is an absolutely continuous measure was calculated
for each $X\in \mathfrak{g}$.
  In this paper $\mathfrak{g}$ is any of the classical, compact, simple Lie
algebras. We characterize the tuples $(X_{1},...,X_{L})$, with $X_{i}\in
\mathfrak{g},$ which have the property that the convolution of the $L$ -orbital
measures supported on the orbits generated by the $X_{i}$ is absolutely
continuous and, equivalently, the sum of their orbits has non-empty interior.
The characterization depends on the Lie type of $ \mathfrak{g}$ and the
structure of the annihilating roots of the $X_{i}$. Such a characterization was
previously known only for type $A_{n}$.

preferences models in social choice theory, we start from an abstract social
network framework, called preference networks; these consist of a finite set of
members where each member has a total-ranking preference of all members in the
set.
  Within this framework, we develop two complementary approaches to
axiomatically study the formation and structures of communities. (1) We apply
social choice theory and define communities indirectly by postulating that they
are fixed points of a preference aggregation function obeying certain desirable
axioms. (2) We directly postulate desirable axioms for communities without
reference to preference aggregation, leading to eight natural community axioms.
  These approaches allow us to formulate and analyze community rules. We prove
a taxonomy theorem that provides a structural characterization of the family of
community rules that satisfies all eight axioms. The structure is actually
quite beautiful: these community rules form a bounded lattice under the natural
intersection and union operations. Our structural theorem is complemented with
a complexity result: while identifying a community by the most selective rule
of the lattice is in P, deciding if a subset is a community by the most
comprehensive rule of the lattice is coNP-complete. Our studies also shed light
on the limitations of defining community rules solely based on preference
aggregation: any aggregation function satisfying Arrow's IIA axiom, or based on
commonly used aggregation schemes like the Borda count or generalizations
thereof, lead to communities which violate at least one of our community
axioms. Finally, we give a polynomial-time rule consistent with seven axioms
and weakly satisfying the eighth axiom.

Here we demonstrate the selective deposition of metal at chemical vapour
deposited graphene's line defects, notably grain boundaries, by atomic layer
deposition. Atomic layer deposition allows us to deposit Pt predominantly on
graphene's grain boundaries, folds, and cracks due to the enhanced chemical
reactivity of these line defects, which is directly confirmed by transmission
electron microscopy imaging. The selective functionalization of graphene defect
sites, together with the nanowire morphology of deposited Pt, yields a superior
platform for sensing applications. Using Pt-graphene hybrid structures, we
demonstrate high-performance hydrogen gas sensors at room temperatures and show
its advantages over other evaporative Pt deposition methods, in which Pt
decorates graphene surface non-selectively.

antiferromagnetic fluctuations were observed as a broad peak localized at ${\it

in the $hk0$ plane; longitudinal peak widths are considerably smaller than
transverse widths. The anisotropy is larger for the higher doping level. These
results are consistent with the random phase approximation (RPA) calculations
taking account of the orbital character of the electronic bands, confirming
that the anisotropic nature of the spin fluctuations in the normal states is
mostly dominated by the nesting of Fermi surfaces. On the other hand, the
quasi-two-dimensional spin correlations grow much rapidly for decreasing
temperature in the $x = 0$ parent compound, compared to that expected for
nearly antiferromagnetic metals. This may be another sign of the unconventional
nature of the antiferromagnetic transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$.

peeling process on a random hypergraph: vertices with degree less than k and

empty or not. In some settings, it may be possible to remove either vertices or

$D^{\pm}_{S}$) at the LHC energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The cross section for
inclusive production of $c \bar c$ pairs is calculated within the
$k_{\perp}$-factorization (or high-energy factorization) approach which
effectively includes higher-order corrections. Results of the
$k_{\perp}$-factorization approach are compared to NLO parton model
predictions. The hadronization of charm quarks is included with the help of the
Peterson fragmentation functions. Inclusive differential distributions in
(pseudo)rapidity and transverse momentum for several charmed mesons are
calculated and compared to recent results of the ALICE, ATLAS and LHCb
experiments. We also take into consideration a mechanism of double charm (two
pairs of $c \bar c$) production within a simple formalism of double-parton
scattering (DPS). Surprisingly for LHC energies the DPS cross sections are
found to be larger than those from the standard SPS mechanism. We compare our
predictions for $DD$ meson-meson pair production with recent measurements of
the LHCb collaboration, including correlation observables. Our calculations
clearly confirm the dominance of DPS in the production of double charm, however
some strength seems to be still lacking. Possible missing contribution from the
so-called single-ladder-splitting DPS mechanism is also discussed.

points of solids arising from fine, equidistant $n$-discretrizations of smooth,
convex surfaces. We showed that such discretizations carry equilibrium points
on two scales: the local scale corresponds to the discretization, the global
scale to the original, smooth surface. In that paper we showed that as $n$
approaches infinity, the number of local equilibria fluctuate around specific
values which we call the imaginary equilibrium indices associated with the
approximated smooth surface. Here we show how the number of global equilibria
can be interpreted, defined and computed on such discretizations. Our results
are relevant from the point of view of natural pebble surfaces, they admit a
comparison between field data based on hand measurements and laboratory data
based on 3D scans.

discriminating non-orthogonal quantum states. It captures the threat from an
adversary who can only query the actual state once. However, when the adversary
is able to use a brute-force strategy to query the state, discrimination
measurement with minimum error probability does not necessarily minimize the
number of queries to get the actual state. In light of this, we take Massey's
guesswork as the underlying optimization criterion and study the problem of
minimum guesswork discrimination. We show that this problem can be reduced to a
semidefinite programming problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions when a
measurement achieves minimum guesswork are presented. We also reveal the
relation between minimum guesswork and minimum error probability. We show that
the two criteria generally disagree with each other, except for the special
case with two states. Both upper and lower information-theoretic bounds on
minimum guesswork are given. For geometrically uniform quantum states, we
provide sufficient conditions when a measurement achieves minimum guesswork.
Moreover, we give the necessary and sufficient condition under which making no
measurement at all would be the optimal strategy.

width for the mass ranging from $1-50 \rm{GeV/c^2}$. The aim is not only to
investigate the decay signatures, but also, more generally, to establish lower

where an encoder wishes to transmit common and private messages to two
receivers while being oblivious to two possible channel realizations
controlling the communication. The focus is on the characterization of the
largest achievable rate region by resorting to more evolved encoding and
decoding techniques than the conventional coding for the standard BC. The role
of the decoder is first explored, and an achievable rate region is derived
based on the principle of ""Interference Decoding"" (ID) where each receiver
decodes its intended message and chooses to (non-uniquely) decode or not the
interfering message. This inner bound is shown to be capacity achieving for a
class of non-trivial compound BEC/BSC broadcast channels while the worst-case
of Marton's inner bound -based on ""Non Interference Decoding"" (NID)- fails to
achieve the capacity region. The role of the encoder is then studied, and an
achievable rate region is derived based on ""Multiple Description"" (MD) coding
where the encoder transmits a common as well as multiple dedicated private
descriptions to the many instances of the users channels. It turns out that MD
coding outperforms the single description scheme -Common Description (CD)
coding- for a class of compound Multiple Input Single Output Broadcast Channels
(MISO BC).

Chen","Entropy variation rate divided by temperature always decreases","11 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For an isolated assembly that comprises a system and its surrounding
reservoirs, the total entropy ($S_{a}$) always monotonically increases as time
elapses. This phenomenon is known as the second law of thermodynamics
($S_{a}\geq0$). Here we analytically prove that, unlike the entropy itself, the
entropy variation rate ($B=dS_{a}/dt$) defies the monotonicity for multiple
reservoirs ($n\geq2$). In other words, there always exist minima. For example,
when a system is heated by two reservoirs from $T=300\,K$ initially to
$T=400\,K$ at the final steady state, $B$ decreases steadily first. Then
suddenly it turns around and starts to increases at $387\,K$ until it reaches
its steady-state value, exhibiting peculiar dipping behaviors. In addition, the
crux of our work is the proof that a newly-defined variable, $B/T$, always
decreases. Our proof involves the Newton's law of cooling, in which the heat
transfer coefficient is assumed to be constant. These theoretical macro-scale
findings are validated by numerical experiments using the Crank-Nicholson

whether quasiparticle interference (QPI) method can distinguish between the two

factorization methods scalable with both the dimension and size of a tensor. In
this paper, we propose two distributed tensor factorization methods, SALS and

interesting trade-off between convergence speed and memory requirements. SALS
updates a subset of the columns of a factor matrix at a time, and CDTF, a

  Classification of Twin Buildings","PhD thesis, 221 pages",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Buildings have been introduced by J. Tits in order to study semi-simple
algebraic groups from a geometrical point of view. One of the most important
results in the theory of buildings is the classification of irreducible
spherical buildings of rank at least 3. About 25 years ago, M. Ronan and J.
Tits defined the class of twin buildings, which generalize spherical buildings
in a natural way. The motivation of their definition is provided by the theory
of Kac-Moody groups.
  A 2-spherical twin building is uniquely determined by its local structure in
almost all cases: The so-called foundation is the union of the rank 2 residues
which contain an (arbitrary) chamber. Therefore, the classification of
2-spherical twin buildings reduces to the classification of all foundations
which can be realized as the local structure of such a twin building. We call
such a foundation ""integrable"".
  By a result of Tits, an integrable foundation is Moufang, which means that
the rank 2 buildings in the foundation are Moufang polygons, and that the
glueings are compatible with the Moufang structures induced on the rank 1
residues. As a consequence, the classification of Moufang polygons and the
solution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets are essential to work out
which Moufang polygons fit together in order to form a foundation.
  The present thesis contributes to establish complete lists of integrable
foundations for certain types of diagrams, namely for simply laced diagrams and
for 443 triangle diagrams. In this process, we closely follow the approach for
the classification of spherical buildings. However, we have to refine the
techniques used there, since in general, foundations don't only depend on the
diagram and the defining field.
  Moreover, one of the main results in the context of Moufang sets is the
solution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets of pseudo-quadratic
spaces.

networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that can sample from arbitrary
probability distributions over binary random variables. We test our framework
for a model inference task based on a psychophysical phenomenon (the
Knill-Kersten optical illusion) and further assess its performance when applied
to randomly generated distributions. As the local computations performed by the
network strongly depend on the interaction between neurons, we compare several
types of couplings mediated by either single synapses or interneuron chains.
Due to its robustness to substrate imperfections such as parameter noise and
background noise correlations, our model is particularly interesting for
implementation on novel, neuro-inspired computing architectures, which can
thereby serve as a fast, low-power substrate for solving real-world inference
problems.

the geometric and thermodynamic parameters of the Bianchi type I Universe is
studied, by using both analytical and numerical methods, for some classes of
high density matter, described by the stiff causal, radiation, and pressureless
fluid equations of state. In all cases the study of the models with different
equations of state can be reduced to the integration of a highly nonlinear
second order ordinary differential equation for the energy density. The time
evolution of the anisotropic Bianchi type I Universe strongly depends on the
initial values of the energy density and of the Hubble function. An important
observational parameter, the mean anisotropy parameter is also studied in
detail, and we show that for the dust filled Universe the cosmological
evolution always ends into an isotropic phase, while for high density matter
filled universes the isotropization of Bianchi type I universes is essentially
determined by the initial conditions of the energy density.

bright long (50) and short (6) gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected by Swift. We
analysed the Swift/BAT data through a discrete cross-correlation function (CCF)
fitted with an asymmetric Gaussian function to estimate the lag and the
associated uncertainty. We find that half of the long GRBs have a positive lag
and half a lag consistent with zero. All short GRBs have lags consistent with
zero. The distributions of the spectral lags for short and long GRBs have
different average values. Limited by the small number of short GRBs, we cannot
exclude at more than 2 sigma significance level that the two distributions of
lags are drawn from the same parent population. If we consider the entire
sample of long GRBs, we do not find evidence for a lag-luminosity correlation,
rather the lag-luminosity plane appears filled on the left hand side, thus
suggesting that the lag-luminosity correlation could be a boundary. Short GRBs
are consistent with the long ones in the lag-luminosity plane.

given the cropped image of a word, we are interested in finding a descriptive,
robust, and compact fixed-length representation. Machine learning techniques
can then be supplied with these representations to produce models useful for
word retrieval or recognition tasks. Although many works have focused on the
machine learning aspect once a global representation has been produced, little
work has been devoted to the construction of those base image representations:
most works use standard coding and aggregation techniques directly on top of
standard computer vision features such as SIFT or HOG.
  We propose to learn local mid-level features suitable for building word image
representations. These features are learnt by leveraging character bounding box
annotations on a small set of training images. However, contrary to other
approaches that use character bounding box information, our approach does not
rely on detecting the individual characters explicitly at testing time. Our
local mid-level features can then be aggregated to produce a global word image
signature. When pairing these features with the recent word attributes
framework of Almaz\'an et al., we obtain results comparable with or better than
the state-of-the-art on matching and recognition tasks using global descriptors
of only 96 dimensions.

radio observations. We confirm that the time derivative of the rotational
frequency $\dot \nu$ is modulated quasi-periodically and show that it exhibits
a repeating double-peaked structure throughout the entire observation span. We
model the $\dot \nu$ variation of the pulsar assuming two spin-down rates with
sudden switches between them in time. Our results show that the double-peak
structure in $\dot \nu$ has a repetition time of about 630 days until MJD 52000
(April 2001) and 550 days since then. During this cycle, the pulsar spin varies
from the lower spin-down rate to the upper spin-down rate twice with different
amounts of time spent in each state, resulting in a further quasi-stable
secondary modulation of the two-state switching. This particular spin-down
state switching is broadly consistent with free precession of the pulsar,
however, a strong evidence linked with this mechanism is not clearly
established. We also confirm that the pulsar occasionally emits groups of
pulses which appear early in pulse phase, so-called ""flares"", and these events
significantly contribute to the pulse profile shape. We find the $\dot \nu$
modulation and the pulse shape variations are correlated throughout the
observations. However, the flare-state is not entirely responsible for this
correlation. In addition to the flare-state, we detect flare-like events from
the pulsar in single pulse observations. During these events, the shift in
pulse phase is small compared to that of the main flare-state and clearly
visible only in single pulse observations.

mass function (IMF) of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) varies with cosmic
time and/or with mean stellar mass density Sigma (M*/2\pi Re^2). For this
purpose we collected a sample of 18 dense (Sigma>2500 M_sun/pc^2) ETGs at
1.2<z<1.6 with available velocity dispersion sigma_e. We have constrained their
mass-normalization by comparing their true stellar masses (M_true) derived
through virial theorem, hence IMF independent, with those inferred through the
fit of the photometry assuming a reference IMF (M_ref). Adopting the virial
estimator as proxy of the true stellar mass, we have assumed for these ETGs
zero dark matter (DM). However, dynamical models and numerical simulations of
galaxy evolution have shown that the DM fraction within Re in dense high-z ETGs
is negligible. We have considered the possible bias of virial theorem in
recovering the total masses and have shown that for dense ETGs the virial
masses are in agreement with those derived through more sophisticated dynamical
models. The variation of the parameter Gamma = M_true/M_ref with sigma_e shows
that, on average, dense ETGs at <z> = 1.4 follow the same IMF-sigma_e trend of
typical local ETGs, but with a lower mass-normalization. Nonetheless, once the
IMF-sigma_e trend we have found for high-z dense ETGs is compared with that of
local ETGs with similar Sigma and sigma_e, they turn out to be consistent. The
similarity between the IMF-sigma_e trends of dense high-z and low-z ETGs over 9
Gyr of evolution and their lower mass-normalization with respect to the mean
value of local ETGs suggest that, independently on formation redshift, the
physical conditions characterizing the formation of a dense spheroid lead to a
mass spectrum of new formed stars with an higher ratio of high- to low-mass
stars with respect to the IMF of normal local ETGs.

experienced periods of higher activity in the past. The reflection of these
past outbursts is observed in the molecular material surrounding the black hole
but reconstructing its precise lightcurve is difficult since the distribution
of the clouds along the line of sight is poorly constrained. Using Chandra
high-resolution data collected from 1999 to 2011 we studied both the 6.4 keV
and the 4-8 keV emission of the region located between Sgr A* and the Radio
Arc, characterizing its variations down to 15"" angular scale and 1-year time
scale. The emission from the molecular clouds in the region varies
significantly, showing either a 2-year peaked emission or 10-year linear
variations. This is the first time that such fast variations are measured.
Based on the cloud parameters, we conclude that these two behaviors are likely
due to two distinct past outbursts of Sgr A* during which its luminosity rose

carrier frequency to within the operating frequency range of the digital
instrument. The validity of the proposed technique has been proven via
comparison with conventional methods. Digital noise measurements eliminate the
need for calibration and improve consistency of experimental results.
Mechanisms limiting the resolution of spectral measurements are also discussed.

are performed to obtain the electronic structure, the band gap (BG), and the

cations is inspected. RE 4f states form two bands of occupied and unoccupied
states separated by ~5 eV. In RE3+-doped compounds 4f states are shifted by ~6
eV to more negative energies compared with RE2+-compounds. This stabilization
causes that RE3+ 4f bands are in a different position relative to the valence
band and the conduction band than RE2+ 4f bands and therefore different
electronic transitions apply. BG of RE3+-compounds decreases from ~4.6 eV (Ce)
to ~0.5 eV (Eu). Except for Ce3+, exhibiting the 4f-5d transition, other
RE3+-compounds show the charge transfer of the p - 4f character. BG of
RE2+-compounds increases from ~0.80 eV (Ce, Pr) to ~0.95 eV (Nd, Pm), ~1.43 eV
(Sm), and ~3.28 eV (Eu) and the electronic transition is of the 4f-5d
character. The energy level scheme constructed from ab initio calculated
electronic structures agrees well with the experimental energy level diagram.
The agreement demonstrates the reliability of the hybrid functional HSE06 to
describe correctly bands of nonbonding RE 4f electrons.

Taking transceiver power consumption into consideration, for a given spectral

for the optimal SE-EE trade-off. It is observed that in contrast to the
classical SE-EE trade-off (which considers only the radiated power), with
transceiver power consumption taken into account, the EE increases with
increasing SE when SE is sufficiently small. Further, for a fixed SE we analyze
the impact of varying cell size (i.e., equivalently average channel gain $G_c$)
on the optimal EE. We show the interesting result that for sufficiently small
$G_c$, the optimal EE decreases as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{G_c})$ with decreasing

eccentric orbits with relatively long periods (30 days and 52.5 days), which

effects invoked to understand the discrepancy with observations are weaker for
these orbital distances. KOI-189 B has a mass M = 0.0745 +/- 0.0033 Msun and a

polynomials. Moreover a natural generalization of the construction easily leads
to the relative de Rham Witt complex.
  Our approach is based on the use of free or at least torsion free
presentations of a given commutative ring $R$ and it is an important fact that
the resulting objects are independent of all choices. The approach via
presentations also sheds new light on our previous description of the ring of
$p$-typical Witt vectors of a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra as a completion of
a semigroup algebra. We develop this description in different directions. For
example, we show that the semigroup algebra can be replaced by any free
presentation of $R$ equipped with a linear lift of the Frobenius automorphism.
Using the result in the appendix by Umberto Zannier we also extend the
description of the Witt vector ring as a completion to all

each RGS combining a reflection grating assembly (RGA) and a camera with CCDs

appropriate inflight calibration data including the changes in detector
performance over time, we aim at profound knowledge about the accuracy in the
calibration. This will be crucial for any correct scientific interpretation of
spectral features for a wide variety of objects. Methods: Ground calibrations
alone are not able to fully characterize the instrument. Dedicated inflight
measurements and constant monitoring are essential for a full understanding of
the instrument and the variations of the instrument response over time.
Physical models of the instrument are tuned to agree with calibration
measurements and are the basis from which the actual instrument response can be
interpolated over the full parameter space. Results: Uncertainties in the
instrument response have been reduced to < 10% for the effective area and < 6
mA for the wavelength scale (in the range from 8 A to 34 A. The remaining

rigid sphere oscillating inside a dilute polymer network. The network and its
solvent are treated using the two-fluid model. We show that the dynamics of the
medium can be decomposed into two independent incompressible flows. The first,
dominant at large distances and obeying the Stokes equation, corresponds to the
collective flow of the two components as a whole. The other, governing the
dynamics over an intermediate range of distances and following the Brinkman
equation, describes the flow of the network and solvent relative to one
another. The crossover between these two regions occurs at a dynamic length
scale which is much larger than the network's mesh size. The analysis focuses
on the spatial structure of the medium's response and the role played by the
dynamic crossover length. We examine different boundary conditions at the
sphere surface. The large-distance collective flow is shown to be independent
of boundary conditions and network compressibility, establishing the robustness
of two-point microrheology at large separations. The boundary conditions that
fit the experimental results for inert spheres in entangled F-actin networks
are those of a free network, which does not interact directly with the sphere.
Closed-form expressions and scaling relations are derived, allowing for the
extraction of material parameters from a combination of one- and two-point
microrheology. We discuss a basic deficiency of the two-fluid model and a way
to bypass it when analyzing microrheological data.

Catalog. We first test the calibration of the ugriz photometric system by using
model atmosphere fits to observed data. Our photometric analysis indicates that
the ugriz photometry appears well calibrated when the SDSS to AB_95 zeropoint
corrections are applied. The spectroscopic analysis of the same data set
reveals that the so-called high-log g problem can be solved by applying
published correction functions that take into account 3D hydrodynamical

spectra also suggests that the SDSS spectra still suffer from a small
calibration problem. We then compare the atmospheric parameters obtained from
both fitting techniques and show that the photometric temperatures are
systematically lower than those obtained from spectroscopic data. This
systematic offset may be linked to the hydrogen line profiles used in the model
atmospheres. We finally present the results of an analysis aimed at measuring

scattering amplitudes. Our analysis yields a suggestive, systematic way to
generate graphs which automatically satisfy the color-kinematic dualities.
Finally, we will extract the leading ultra-violet divergences of five-point
one- and two-loop amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ sYM, which represent a

  Communications,Sept.2014",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The flux of social media and the convenience of mobile connectivity has
created a mobile data phenomenon that is expected to overwhelm the mobile
cellular networks in the foreseeable future. Despite the advent of 4G/LTE, the
growth rate of wireless data has far exceeded the capacity increase of the
mobile networks. A fundamentally new design paradigm is required to tackle the
ever-growing wireless data challenge.
  In this article, we investigate the problem of massive content delivery over
wireless networks and present a systematic view on content-centric network
design and its underlying challenges. Towards this end, we first review some of
the recent advancements in Information Centric Networking (ICN) which provides
the basis on how media contents can be labeled, distributed, and placed across
the networks. We then formulate the content delivery task into a content rate
maximization problem over a share wireless channel, which, contrasting the
conventional wisdom that attempts to increase the bit-rate of a unicast system,
maximizes the content delivery capability with a fixed amount of wireless
resources. This conceptually simple change enables us to exploit the ""content
diversity"" and the ""network diversity"" by leveraging the abundant computation
sources (through application-layer encoding, pushing and caching, etc.) within
the existing wireless networks. A network architecture that enables wireless
network crowdsourcing for content delivery is then described, followed by an
exemplary campus wireless network that encompasses the above concepts.

with the lower probability of taking backward steps. Thus, as biological model

associated with the spiral arm structure of galaxies. It is yet not clearly
understood what effect such a cosmic ray source distribution has on the
particle transport in our Galaxy. We use the PICARD code to perform
high-resolution 3D simulations of electrons and protons in galactic propagation
scenarios that include four-arm and two-arm logarithmic spiral cosmic ray
source distributions with and without a central bar structure as well as the
spiral arm configuration of the NE2001 model for the distribution of free
electrons in the Milky Way. Results of these simulation are compared to an
axisymmetric radial source distribution. Also, effects on the cosmic ray flux
and spectra due to different positions of the Earth relative to the spiral
structure are studied. We find that high energy electrons are strongly confined
to their sources and the obtained spectra largely depend on the Earth's
position relative to the spiral arms. Similar finding have been obtained for
low energy protons and electrons albeit at smaller magnitude. We find that even
fractional contributions of a spiral arm component to the total cosmic ray
source distribution influences the spectra on the Earth. This is apparent when
compared to an axisymmetric radial source distribution as well as with respect
to the Earth's position relative to the spiral arm structure. We demonstrate
that the presence of a Galactic bar manifests itself as an overall excess of
low energy electrons at the Earth. Using a spiral arm geometry as a cosmic ray
source distributions offers a genuine new quality of modelling and is used to
explain features in cosmic ray spectra at the Earth that are else-wise
attributed to other propagation effects. We show that realistic cosmic ray
propagation scenarios have to acknowledge non-axisymmetric source
distributions.[Abbreviated]

are almost transparent and one-way reflectionless over a broad frequency range
around the Bragg frequency, i.e. unidirectionally invisible, regardless of the
thickness $L$ of the crystal. The $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric complex crystal is
synthesized by a supersymmetric transformation of an Hermitian square well
potential, and exact analytical expressions of transmission and reflection
coefficients are given. As $L$ is increased, the transmittance and reflectance
from one side remain close to one and zero, respectively, whereas the
reflectance from the other side secularly grows like $ \sim L^2$ owing to
unidirectional Bragg scattering. This is a distinctive feature as compared to
the previously studied case of the complex sinusoidal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
potential $V(x)=V_0 \exp(-2i k_ox)$ at the symmetry breaking point, where
transparency breaks down as $L \rightarrow \infty$.

ejecting material through stellar winds. To study the impact of the momentum
from the wind of a massive star on the surrounding neutral or ionized material,
we implemented a new HEALPix-based momentum conserving wind scheme in the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code SEREN. A qualitative study of the
impact of the feedback from an O7.5-like star on a self gravitating sphere
shows that, on its own, the transfer of momentum from a wind onto cold
surrounding gas has both a compressing and dispersing effect. It mostly affects
gas at low and intermediate densities. When combined with a stellar source's
ionizing UV radiation, we find the momentum driven wind to have little direct
effect on the gas. We conclude that, during a massive star's main sequence, the
UV ionizing radiation is the main feedback mechanism shaping and compressing
the cold gas. Overall, the wind's effects on the dense gas dynamics and on the
triggering of star formation are very modest. The structures formed in the
ionization-only simulation and in the combined feedback simulation are
remarkably similar. However, in the combined feedback case, different SPH
particles end up being compressed. This indicates that the microphysics of gas
mixing differ between the two feedback simulations and that the winds can
contribute to the localized redistribution and reshuffling of gas.

range of accretion rates, which lead to diversity of appearance. We consider
the effects of anisotropic radiation from accretion disks on the broad-line
region (BLR), from the Shakura-Sunyaev regime to slim disks with
super-Eddington accretion rates. The geometrically thick funnel of the inner
region of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to very
strong anisotropy of the radiation field. We demonstrate that the degree of
anisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. As a
result of this anisotropy, BLR clouds receive different spectral energy
distributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting in
diverse observational appearance of the BLR. We show that the self-shadowing of
the inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regions
of the BLR, depending on accretion rate. These two regions manifest themselves
as kinematically distinct components of the broad H$\beta$ line profile with
different line widths and fluxes, which jointly account for the Lorentzian
profile generally observed in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. In the time
domain, these two components are expected reverberate with different time lags
with respect to the varying ionizing continuum, depending on the accretion rate
and the viewing angle of the observer. The diverse appearance of the BLR due to
the anisotropic ionizing energy source can be tested by reverberation mapping
of H$\beta$ and other broad emission lines (e.g., \feii), providing a new tool
to diagnose the structure and dynamics of the BLR. Other observational
consequences of our model are also explored.

current in a two-dimensional system with generic $k$-linear spin-orbit
interaction are investigated. We calculate the response of the effective
conserved spin current to the applied electric field, which is composed of
conventional and spin torque currents, by using the Kubo formula. We find that
the conventional spin current is not determined by the Berry phase effect.
Remarkably, the spin torque Hall current is found to be proportional to the
Berry phase, and the longitudinal spin torque current vanishes because of the
Berry phase effect. When the $k$-linear spin-orbit interaction dominates the
system, the Berry phase on the Fermi surface maintains two invariant
properties. One is that the magnitude of the spin torque current protected by
the Berry phase is unchanged by a small fluctuation of energy dispersion. The
other one is that the change in the direction of the applied electric field
does not change the magnitude of the spin torque current even if the energy
dispersion is not spherically symmetric; i.e., the Berry phase effect has no
dependence on the two-dimensional material orientation. The spin torque current
is a universal value for all $k$-linear systems, such as Rashba, Dresselhaus,
and Rashba-Dresselhaus systems. The topological number attributed to the Berry
phase on the Fermi surface represents the phase of the orbital chirality of
spin in the $k$-linear system. The change in the topological number results in
a phase transition in which the orbital chirality of spin $s_z$ and $-s_z$ is
exchanged. We found that the spin torque current can be experimentally
measured.

sub-blocks, where each sub-block contains a subset of the attributes, but the
entire graph structure is replicated within each sub-block. This improves query
I/O, at the cost of increased storage overhead. We introduce optimal ILP

relativity and quantum mechanics differ from each other in one main aspect.
General relativity is based on the diffeomorphism covariant formulation of the
laws of physics while quantum mechanics is constructed such that its
fundamental laws remain invariant to a change of topology. It is the goal of
this paper to show that in order to obtain a complete description of quantum
gravity one has to extend the principle of diffeomorphism invariance from
general relativity in the sense of quantum mechanics i.e. the laws of physics
must be covariant to a change in the topology of spacetime. On the practical
side, I provide an answer to the black hole information paradox: the missing
information is permanently encoded in the higher cohomology of the quantum
field space allowed by the given situation. Notions like entanglement become
dependent on choices of coefficients in cohomology. There remains still an
uncertainty principle, namely the one given by the incompatibility of various
choices of coefficients required for the construction of the cohomology. In
this way the answer to the unitarity problem appears to be : indeed, unitarity
is restored, as required by standard quantum mechanics but one still needs an
extended uncertainty principle (envisioned already by Hawking) which has an
exact formulation in the universal coefficient theorem.

if its graph extends to a smooth Dirac structure over the singularity. An
example for this is the symplectic form of a magnetic monopole. A criterion for
the removability of singularities is given in terms of regularizing functions
for pure spinors. All removable singularities are poles in the sense that the
norm of $\omega$ is not locally bounded. The points at which removable
singularities occur are the non-regular points of the Dirac structure for which
we prove a general splitting theorem: Locally, every Dirac structure is the
gauge transform of the product of a tangent bundle and the graph of a Poisson
structure. This implies that in a neighborhood of a removable singularity
$\omega$ can be split into a non-singular presymplectic form and a singular
presymplectic form which is the partial inverse of a Poisson bivector that
vanishes at the singularity. An interesting class of examples is given by
log-Dirac structures which generalize log-symplectic structures. The analogous
notion of removable singularities of Poisson structures is also studied.

of (quasi-)energy levels of individual quantum dynamics are not self-averaging.
Only suitable smoothing turns them into useful characteristics of spectra. We
present numerical data for a fully chaotic kicked top, employing two types of
smoothing: one involves primitives of the spectral correlator, the second a
small imaginary part of the quasi-energy. Self-averaging universal (like the
CUE average) behavior is found for the smoothed correlator, apart from noise
which shrinks like $1\over\sqrt N$ as the dimension $N$ of the quantum Hilbert
space grows. There are periodically repeated quasi-energy windows of
correlation decay and revival wherein the smoothed correlation remains finite
as $N\to\infty$ such that the noise is negligible. In between those windows
(where the CUE averaged correlator takes on values of the order ${1\over N^2}$)
the noise becomes dominant and self-averaging is lost. We conclude that the
noise forbids distinction of CUE and GUE type behavior. Surprisingly, the
underlying smoothed generating function does not enjoy any self-averaging
outside the range of its variables relevant for determining the two-point
correlator (and certain higher-order ones). --- We corroborate our numerical
findings for the noise by analytically determining the CUE variance of the
smoothed single-matrix correlator.

modularization practices to the task of uncertainty propagation. Since the cost
of each deterministic PDE solve can be usually expected to be quite
significant, statistical sampling based methods like Monte-Carlo (MC) are
inefficient because they do not take advantage of the mathematical structure of
the problem, and suffer for poor convergence properties. On the other hand,
even if each module contains a moderate number of uncertain parameters,
implementing spectral methods on the combined high-dimensional parameter space
can be prohibitively expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. In this
work, we present a module-based and efficient intrusive spectral projection
(ISP) method for uncertainty propagation. In our proposed method, each
subproblem is separated and modularized via block Gauss-Seidel (BGS)
techniques, such that each module only needs to tackle the local stochastic
parameter space. Moreover, the computational costs are significantly mitigated
by constructing reduced chaos approximations of the input data that enter each

applications. In a common definition, two haplotypes are said to contain an IBD
segment if they share a segment that is inherited from a recent shared common
ancestor without intervening recombination. Long IBD segments (> 1cM) can be
efficiently detected by a number of algorithms using high-density SNP array
data from a population sample. However, these approaches detect IBD based on
contiguous segments of identity-by-state, and such segments may exist due to
the conflation of smaller, nearby IBD segments. We quantified this effect using
coalescent simulations, finding that nearly 40% of inferred segments 1-2cM long
are results of conflations of two or more shorter segments, under demographic
scenarios typical for modern humans. This biases the inferred IBD segment
length distribution, and so can affect downstream inferences. We observed this
conflation effect universally across different IBD detection programs and human
demographic histories, and found inference of segments longer than 2cM to be
much more reliable (less than 5% conflation rate). As an example of how this
can negatively affect downstream analyses, we present and analyze a novel
estimator of the de novo mutation rate using IBD segments, and demonstrate that
the biased length distribution of the IBD segments due to conflation can lead
to inflated estimates if the conflation is not modeled. Understanding the
conflation effect in detail will make its correction in future methods more
tractable.

Here we propose a quantitative measure of this structure-mediated cooperativity
that can be numerically calculated for an arbitrary RNA sequence. Focusing on
an RNA with two binding sites, we derive a characteristic difference of free
energy differences, i.e. \Delta\Delta G, as a measure of the effect of the
occupancy of one binding site on the binding strength of another. We apply this
measure to a large number of human and C. elegans mRNAs, and find that
structure-mediated cooperativity is a generic feature. Interestingly, this
cooperativity not only affects binding sites in close proximity along the
sequence but also configurations in which one binding site is located in the
5'UTR and the other is located in the 3'UTR of the mRNA. Furthermore, we find
that this end-to-end cooperativity is determined by the UTR sequences while the
sequences of the coding regions are irrelevant.

driving frequency in this non-local collisionless regime. Instead, a step-like
increase at a distinct driving frequency is observed. Based on the analytical
power balance model, in combination with a detailed analysis of the electron
kinetics, the density jump is found to be caused by an electron heating mode
transition from the classical $\alpha$-mode into a low density resonant heating
mode characterized by the generation of two energetic electron beams at each
electrode per sheath expansion phase. These electron beams propagate through
the bulk without collisions and interact with the opposing sheath. In the low
density mode, the second beam is found to hit the opposing sheath during its
collapse. Consequently, a high number of energetic electrons is lost at the
electrodes resulting in a poor confinement of beam electrons in contrast to the
classical $\alpha$-mode observed at higher driving frequencies. Based on the
analytical model this modulated confinement quality and the related modulation
of the energy lost per electron lost at the electrodes is demonstrated to cause
the step-like change of the plasma density. The effects of a variation of the
electrode gap, the neutral gas pressure, the electron sticking and secondary
electron emission coefficients of the electrodes on this step-like increase of

Everett's many-worlds interpretation, it has a clear ontology and a set of

consequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that
they live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single

Bounce at the early stage in the evolution of our currently observed universe.
A study of dark matter production in the pre-bounce contraction and the post
bounce expansion epochs of this universe reveals a new venue for achieving the
observed relic abundance of our present universe. Specifically, it predicts a
characteristic relation governing a dark matter mass and interaction cross
section and a factor of $1/2$ in thermally averaged cross section, as compared
to the non-thermal production in standard cosmology, is needed for creating
enough dark matter particle to satisfy the currently observed relic abundance
because dark matter is being created during the pre-bounce contraction, in
addition to the post-bounce expansion. As the production rate is lower than the
Hubble expansion rate information of the bounce universe evolution is
preserved. Therefore once the value of dark matter mass and interaction cross
section are obtained by direct detection in laboratories, this alternative
route becomes a signature prediction of the bounce universe scenario. This

important implications on dark matter searches.

  bibliometrics: Which method best reflects the judgements of experts?","Accepted for publication in the Journal of Informetrics",,,,"cs.DL stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Evaluative bibliometrics compares the citation impact of researchers,
research groups and institutions with each other across time scales and
disciplines. Both factors - discipline and period - have an influence on the
citation count which is independent of the quality of the publication.
Normalizing the citation impact of papers for these two factors started in the
mid-1980s. Since then, a range of different methods have been presented for
producing normalized citation impact scores. The current study uses a data set
of over 50,000 records to test which of the methods so far presented correlate
better with the assessment of papers by peers. The peer assessments come from
F1000Prime - a post-publication peer review system of the biomedical
literature. Of the normalized indicators, the current study involves not only
cited-side indicators, such as the mean normalized citation score, but also
citing-side indicators. As the results show, the correlations of the indicators
with the peer assessments all turn out to be very similar. Since F1000 focuses
on biomedicine, it is important that the results of this study are validated by
other studies based on datasets from other disciplines or (ideally) based on
multi-disciplinary datasets.

problems, but are often intractable for exhaustive verification methods. Recent
work has introduced lightweight approximative techniques that sample directly
from scheduler space, bringing the prospect of scalable alternatives to
standard numerical model checking algorithms. The focus so far has been on
optimising the probability of a property, but many problems require
quantitative analysis of rewards. In this work we therefore present lightweight
statistical model checking algorithms to optimise the rewards of Markov
decision processes. We consider the standard definitions of rewards used in
model checking, introducing an auxiliary hypothesis test to accommodate
reachability rewards. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on a
number of standard case studies.

relativistic hydrodynamics that takes into account the large momentum-space

it allows one to extend the regime of applicability of hydrodynamic treatments
to situations that can be quite far from isotropic thermal equilibrium. In this
paper, I review the material presented in a series of three introductory
lectures. I review the derivation of ideal and second-order viscous
hydrodynamics from kinetic theory. I then show how to extend the methods used
to a system that can be highly anisotropic in local-rest-frame momenta. I close
by discussing recent work on this topic and then present an outlook to the
future.

turbulence in the focusing regime of the one dimensional nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation (1D-NLSE). Our experiments are very similar in their
principle to water tank experiments with random initial conditions (see M.
Onorato {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. E {\bf 70} 067302 (2004)). Using an original
optical sampling setup, we measure precisely the probability density function
(PDF) of optical power of partially coherent waves rapidly fluctuating with
time. The PDF is found to evolve from the normal law to a strong heavy-tailed
distribution, thus revealing the formation of rogue waves in integrable
turbulence. Numerical simulations of 1D-NLSE with stochastic initial conditions
reproduce quantitatively the experiments. Our investigations suggest that the
statistical features experimentally observed rely on the stochastic generation
of coherent analytic solutions of 1D-NLSE such as Peregrine solitons.

their structure and dynamics remains limited, especially when dealing with such

Loop quantum effects are also clearly noticeable from the trajectories in past,

pronounced in the early universe, but alleviates as we tend towards the present

covariance matrix. It is shown that when the received signals are uncorrelated,
the true array covariance matrices lie in a specific subspace whose dimension
is typically much smaller than the dimension of the full space. Based on this
idea, a subspace based covariance matrix estimator is proposed. The estimator
is obtained as a solution to a semi-definite convex optimization problem. While
the optimization problem has no closed-form solution, a nearly optimal
closed-form solution is proposed making it easy to implement. In comparison to
the conventional approaches, the proposed method yields higher estimation
accuracy because it eliminates the estimation error which does not lie in the
subspace of the true covariance matrices. The numerical examples indicate that
the proposed covariance matrix estimator can significantly improve the
estimation quality of the covariance matrix.
