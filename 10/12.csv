assume three hypothesis. The first is the following: all roots of the
characteristic polynomial associated to the fourth order linear equation has
distinct real part. The other two hypothesis are related with the behavior of
the perturbation functions. Under this general hypothesis we obtain four main
results. The first two results are related with the application of fixed point
theorem to prove that the Riccati equation has a unique solution. The next
result concerns with the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Riccati

both methods, calculating the energy as well as heat capacity as a function of

can be drawn in the plane so that every pair of edges cross an even number of

the order in which edges leave the vertices. We prove a generalization of the
weak Hanani-Tutte theorem that also easily implies the monotone variant of the
weak Hanani-Tutte theorem by Pach and T\'oth. Thus, our result can be thought
of as a common generalization of these two neat results. In other words, we
prove the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem for strip clustered graphs, whose clusters
are linearly ordered vertical strips in the plane and edges join only vertices
in the same cluster or in neighboring clusters with respect to this order. In
order to prove our main result we first obtain a forbidden substructure
characterization of embedded strip clustered planar graphs.
  The Hanani-Tutte theorem says that a graph is planar, if it can be drawn in
the plane so that every pair of edges not sharing a vertex cross an even number
of times. We prove the variant of Hanani-Tutte theorem for strip clustered
graphs if the underlying abstract graph is three connected or a tree. In the
case of trees our result implies that c-planarity for flat clustered graphs
with three clusters is solvable in a polynomial time if the underlying abstract
graph is a tree. The proof of the latter result combines our forbidden
substructure characterization of embedded strip clustered planar graphs with
Tucker's characterization of 0-1 matrices with consecutive ones property.

  The combined effects of the gravity fields of the Earth, the Sun and the Moon
make the three satellites deviate from their nominally stationary, equatorial
and equilateral configuration. Since changes in the satellites relative
distances and orientations could negatively affect the precision of the laser
heterodyne measurements, we have derived the time-dependence of the
inter-satellite distances and velocities, the variations of the polar angles
made by the constellation's three arms with respect to a chosen reference
frame, and the time changes of the triangle's enclosed angles. We find that,
during the time between two consecutive station-keeping maneuvers (about two
weeks), the relative variations of the inter-satellite distances do not exceed
a value of $0.05$ percent, while the relative velocities between pairs of
satellites remain smaller than about $0.7 \ {\rm m/s}$. In addition, we find
the angles made by the arms of the triangle with the equatorial plane to be
periodic functions of time whose amplitudes grow linearly with time; the
maximum variations experienced by these angles as well as by those within the
triangle remain smaller than $3$ arc-minutes, while the East-West angular
variations of the three arms remain smaller than about $15$ arc-minutes during
the two-weeks period. The relatively small variations of these orbit parameters
result into a set of system functional and performance requirements that are

leptogenesis, and that in this case the direct detection bounds can be
significantly weakened due to interference. We quantify this by mapping out and
comparing the regions of parameter space that are excluded by direct detection
for the symmetric and asymmetric cases of lepton-flavored dark matter. In
particular, we show that the entire parameter region except for a narrow Higgs
resonance window is ruled out in the symmetric case for fermion dark matter
when the coupling to the Higgs dominates over the coupling to leptons, while
large portions of parameter space are still allowed for the asymmetric case.
The same is also true for a dark matter mass above 8 GeV for scalar dark matter
when the coupling to leptons dominates over the coupling to the Higgs.

the setting of coherent entanglement assisted quantum communication. For this,
we present a new technical tool that we call the convex split lemma, which is
inspired by the classical compression schemes that use rejection sampling
procedure. As a consequence, we show new bounds on the quantum communication
cost of single-shot entanglement-assisted one-way quantum state redistribution
task and for the sub-tasks quantum state splitting and quantum state merging.
Our upper and lower bounds are tight up to a constant and hence stronger than
previously known best bounds for above tasks. Our protocols use explicit
quantum operations on the sides of Alice and Bob, which are different from the
decoupling by random unitaries approach used in previous works. As another
application, we present a port-based teleportation scheme which works when the
set of input states is restricted to a known ensemble, hence potentially saving
the number of required ports. Furthermore, in case of no prior knowledge about
the set of input states, our average success fidelity matches the known average
success fidelity, providing a new port-based teleportation scheme with similar
performance as appears in literature.

uncertainty. As a result, the equilibrium of a game is intimately related to
the information available to its players. The \emph{signaling problem}
abstracts the task faced by an informed ""market maker"", who must choose how to
reveal information in order to effect a desirable equilibrium.
  In this paper, we consider two fundamental signaling problems: one for
abstract normal form games, and the other for single item auctions. For the
former, we consider an abstract class of objective functions which includes the
social welfare and weighted combinations of players' utilities, and for the
latter we restrict our attention to the social welfare objective and to
signaling schemes which are constrained in the number of signals used. For both
problems, we design approximation algorithms for the signaling problem which
run in quasi-polynomial time under various conditions, extending and
complementing the results of various recent works on the topic.
  Underlying each of our results is a ""meshing scheme"" which effectively
overcomes the ""curse of dimensionality"" and discretizes the space of
""essentially different"" posterior beliefs -- in the sense of inducing
""essentially different"" equilibria. This is combined with an algorithm for
optimally assembling a signaling scheme as a convex combination of such
beliefs. For the normal form game setting, the meshing scheme leads to a convex
partition of the space of posterior beliefs and this assembly procedure is
reduced to a linear program, and in the auction setting the assembly procedure
is reduced to submodular function maximization.

protecting the sample with a chemically inert, atomically smooth sheet of

electrolyte-gated strontium titanate, whose mobility improves more than tenfold
when protected with BN. We find this improvement even for our thinnest BN, of

bundles over ${\mathbb P}^2$ up to various notions of equivalence that arise
naturally in ${\mathbb A}^1$-homotopy theory, namely ${\mathbb A}^1$-weak
equivalence and ${\mathbb A}^1$-$h$-cobordism.
  First, we classify such varieties up to ${\mathbb A}^1$-weak equivalence:
over algebraically closed fields having characteristic unequal to two the
classification can be given in terms of characteristic classes of the
underlying vector bundle. When the base field is ${\mathbb C}$, this
classification result can be compared to a corresponding topological result and
we find that the algebraic and topological homotopy classifications agree.
  Second, we study the problem of classifying such varieties up to ${\mathbb
A}^1$-$h$-cobordism using techniques of deformation theory. To this end, we
establish a deformation rigidity result for ${\mathbb P}^1$-bundles over
${\mathbb P}^2$ which links ${\mathbb A}^1$-$h$-cobordisms to deformations of
the underlying vector bundles. Using results from the deformation theory of
vector bundles we show that if $X$ is a ${\mathbb P}^1$-bundle over ${\mathbb

is also ${\mathbb A}^1$-$h$-cobordant to $Y$.
  Finally, we discuss some subtleties inherent in the definition of ${\mathbb

built upon a separable model of click-through-rates that decomposes the
likelihood of a click into the product of a ""slot effect"" and an ""advertiser
effect"" --- if the first slot is twice as good as the second for some bidder,
then it is twice as good for everyone. Though appealing in its simplicity, this
model is quite suspect in practice. A wide variety of factors including
externalities and budgets have been studied that can and do cause it to be
violated. In this paper we adopt a view of GSP as an iterated second price
auction (see, e.g., Milgrom 2010) and study how the most basic violation of
separability --- position dependent, arbitrary public click-through-rates that
do not decompose --- affects results from the foundational analysis of GSP
(Varian 2007, Edelman et al. 2007). For the two-slot setting we prove that for
arbitrary click-through-rates, for arbitrary bidder values, an efficient
pure-strategy equilibrium always exists; however, without separability there
always exist values such that the VCG outcome and payments cannot be realized
by any bids, in equilibrium or otherwise. The separability assumption is
therefore necessary in the two-slot case to match the payments of VCG but not
for efficiency. We moreover show that without separability, generic existence
of efficient equilibria is sensitive to the choice of tie-breaking rule, and
when there are more than two slots, no (bid-independent) tie-breaking rule
yields the positive result. In light of this we suggest alternative mechanisms
that trade the simplicity of GSP for better equilibrium properties when there
are three or more slots.

planned for launch in 2016. OSIRIS-REx will orbit the near-Earth asteroid
(101955) Bennu, characterize it, and return a sample of the asteroid's regolith
back to Earth. The Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) is an instrument
on OSIRIS-REx designed and built by students at MIT and Harvard. The purpose of
REXIS is to collect and image sun-induced fluorescent X-rays emitted by Bennu,
thereby providing spectroscopic information related to the elemental makeup of
the asteroid regolith and the distribution of features over its surface.
Telescopic reflectance spectra suggest a CI or CM chondrite analog meteorite
class for Bennu, where this primitive nature strongly motivates its study. A
number of factors, however, will influence the generation, measurement, and
interpretation of the X-ray spectra measured by REXIS. These include: the
compositional nature and heterogeneity of Bennu, the time-variable Solar state,
X-ray detector characteristics, and geometric parameters for the observations.
In this paper, we will explore how these variables influence the precision to
which REXIS can measure Bennu's surface composition. By modeling the
aforementioned factors, we place bounds on the expected performance of REXIS
and its ability to ultimately place Bennu in an analog meteorite class.

Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu1957",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article, we test the conclusion of Donato et al. (2009) concerning
the universality of the DM halo surface density $\mu_{0D}=\rho_0r_0$. According
to our study, the dispersion of values of $\mu_{0D}$ is twice higher than that
found by Donato et al. (2009). We conclude, in contrast with Donato et al.
(2009), that the DM surface density and its Newtonian acceleration are not
constant but correlate with the luminosity, morphological type, $(B-V)_0$
colour index, and the content of neutral hydrogen. These DM parameters are
higher for more luminous systems of early types with red colour and low gas
content. We also found that the correlation of DM parameters with colour index
appears to be the manifestation of a stronger relation between DM halo mass and
the colour of a galaxy. This finding is in agreement with cosmological
simulations (Guo et al, 2011). These results leave little room for the recently
claimed universality of DM column density. We also found that isolated galaxies
in our sample (contained in the Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated
GAlaxies (AMIGA) catalogue) do not differ significantly in their value of
$\mu_{0D}$ from the entire sample. Thus, since the AMIGA catalogue gives a
sample of galaxies that have not interacted with a significant mass neighbour
in the past 3 Gyr, the difference between the systems with low and high values
of $\mu_{0D}$ is not related to the merging events during this period of time.

number of qubits and placing all of them in a single cavity quickly runs into
many fundamental and practical problems such as the increase of cavity decay
rate and decrease of qubit-cavity coupling strength. Therefore, future QIP most
likely will require quantum networks consisting of a large number of cavities,
each hosting and coupled to multiple qubits. In this work, we propose a way to
prepare a $W$-class entangled state of spatially-separated multiple qubits in
different cavities, which are connected to a coupler qubit. Because no cavity
photon is excited, decoherence caused by the cavity decay is greatly suppressed
during the entanglement preparation. This proposal needs only one coupler qubit
and one operational step, and does not require using a classical pulse, so that
the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly
simplified. As an example of the experimental implementation, we further give a
numerical analysis, which shows that high-fidelity generation of the $W$ state
using three superconducting phase qubits each embedded in a one-dimensional
transmission line resonator is feasible within the present circuit QED
technique. The proposal is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the
same task with other types of qubits such as superconducting flux qubits,
charge qubits, quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers and atoms.

obstacles arising in tackling the latter one. The results for the latter

can be constructed for interconnections whenever the small-gain condition

particular for iISS subsystems which are not ISS. As illustrative examples,
stability of two highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems is established by
the the proposed small-gain criterion.

$\Sigma^1_1$-complete and $\Pi^1_1$-hard, and ii) for $\epsilon = 0$,
respectively decidable and $\Sigma^0_1$-complete. The adjective ""general"" here
means ""uniformly over all languages.""
  We extend these results in the scenario of finite models. In particular, we
show that the problems of satisfiability by and validity over finite models in
$\epsilon$E-logic are, i) for rational $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, respectively
$\Sigma^0_1$- and $\Pi^0_1$-complete, and ii) for $\epsilon = 0$, respectively

models still remains largely unsolved. In addition, most of the results, of
this paper and of Kuyper and Terwijn, do not apply to individual languages with
a finite number of unary predicates. Reducing this requirement continues to be
a major point of research.
  On the positive side, we derive the decidability of the corresponding
problems for monadic relational languages --- equality- and function-free
languages with finitely many unary and zero other predicates. This result holds
for all three of the unrestricted, the countable, and the finite model cases.
  Applications in computational learning theory, weighted graphs, and neural

systems of ODEs or evolutionary PDEs. As these systems appear naturally in
engineering problems, time-subcycling techniques are widely used every day to
improve computational efficiency. These methods rely on a decomposition of the
vector field in a fast part and a slow part and take advantage of that
decomposition. This way, if an unconditionnally stable (semi-)implicit scheme
cannot be easily implemented, one can integrate the fast equations with a much
smaller time step than that of the slow equations, instead of having to
integrate the whole system with a very small time-step to ensure stability.
Then, one can build a numerical integrator using a standard composition method,
such as a Lie or a Strang formula for example. Such methods are primarily
designed to be convergent in short-time to the solution of the original
problems. However, their longtime behavior rises interesting questions, the
answers to which are not very well known. In particular, when the solutions of
the problems converge in time to an asymptotic equilibrium state, the question
of the asymptotic accuracy of the numerical longtime limit of the schemes as
well as that of the rate of convergence is certainly of interest. In this
context, the asymptotic error is defined as the difference between the exact
and numerical asymptotic states. The goal of this paper is to apply that kind
of numerical methods based on splitting schemes with subcycling to some simple
examples of evolutionary ODEs and PDEs that have attractive equilibrium states,
to address the aforementioned questions of asymptotic accuracy, to perform a
rigorous analysis, and to compare them with their counterparts without
subcycling. Our analysis is developed on simple linear ODE and PDE toy-models

radio heads (RRHs/antennas) are connected to a central processor (CP) via
capacity-limited backhaul links to facilitate joint transmission. The RRHs and
the CP are equipped with renewable energy harvesters and share their energies
via a lossy micropower grid for improving the efficiency in conveying
information and green energy to mobile receivers via radio frequency (RF)
signals. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a
mixed non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem taking into account the
limited backhaul capacity and the quality of service requirements for
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We aim at
minimizing the total network transmit power when only imperfect channel state
information of the wireless energy harvesting receivers, which have to be
powered by the wireless network, is available at the CP. In light of the
intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem
with binary selection, which facilitates the design of an iterative resource
allocation algorithm to solve the problem optimally using the generalized
Bender's decomposition (GBD). Furthermore, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed
to strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance.
Simulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based algorithm obtains the
global optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a
close-to-optimal performance. Besides, the distributed antenna network for
SWIPT with renewable energy sharing is shown to require a lower transmit power
compared to a traditional system with multiple co-located antennas.

taken into account when OLT assigns the start times for upstream bandwidth
grants. In most case, RTT is estimated before making bandwidth allocation
decisions in dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms. If the estimated RTT is
incorrect, the bandwidth allocation decisions are not matched with bandwidth
requests of channels. Thus, performance of PON can get worse by deviation of
RTT. There are several reasons that cause the RTT to be varying, such as
processing delay, distance of OLT and ONU, changing in fiber refractive index
resulting from temperature drift, and degree of accuracy of RTT estimation

Erez-Rosen solution, which is a static spacetime belonging to the Weyl class of
solutions to the vacuum Einstein's field equations, and reduces to the familiar
Schwarzschild solution when the quadrupole parameter vanishes. The radiation
flux has a fixed but arbitrary (non-zero) angular momentum. The interaction
with the radiation field is assumed to be Thomson-like, i.e., the particles
absorb and re-emit radiation, thus suffering for a friction-like drag force.
Such an additional force is responsible for the Poynting-Robertson effect,
which is well established in the framework of Newtonian gravity and has been
recently extended to the general theory of relativity. The balance between
gravitational attraction, centrifugal force and radiation drag leads to the
occurrence of equilibrium circular orbits which are attractors for the
surrounding matter for every fixed value of the interaction strength. The
presence of the quadrupolar structure of the source introduces a further degree
of freedom: there exists a whole family of equilibrium orbits parametrized by
the quadrupole parameter, generalizing previous works. This scenario is
expected to play a role in the context of accretion matter around compact
objects.

same symmetry, both observations suggesting a B$_{1g}$ symmetry-breaking
instability in the Kondo regime. Through optical conductivity, we detect clear
signatures of strong electron-phonon coupling, with temperature dependent
spectral weight and Fano line shape of some phonon modes. Surprisingly, the
line shapes of two phonon modes, E$_u$(1) and A$_{2u}$(2), show opposite
temperature dependencies. The A$_{2u}$(2) mode loses its Fano shape below 150

the evolution of binary and multiple stars. As in the Earth oceans, it
corresponds to the resonant excitation of their eigenmodes of oscillation and
their damping. Therefore, it strongly depends on the internal structure,
rotation, and dissipative mechanisms in each component. In this work, we
present a local analytical modeling of tidal gravito-inertial waves excited in
stellar convective and radiative regions respectively. This model allows us to
understand in details the properties of the resonant tidal dissipation as a
function of the excitation frequencies, the rotation, the stratification, and
the viscous and thermal properties of the studied fluid regions. Then, the
frequencies, height, width at half-height, and number of resonances as well as
the non-resonant equilibrium tide are derived analytically in asymptotic
regimes that are relevant in stellar interiors. Finally, we demonstrate how
viscous dissipation of tidal waves leads to a strongly erratic orbital
evolution in the case of a coplanar binary system. We characterize such a
non-regular dynamics as a function of the height and width of resonances, which
have been previously characterized thanks to our local fluid model.

different behaviors in terms of performance, power consumption and thermal

infrastructure (computing power, electrical power consumption) and in the heat
removal systems (different enclosure, fans, thermal sinks). Also the physical
locations of the servers become important with heterogeneity since some servers
can (over)heat others. While many studies address independently these
parameters (most of the time performance and power or energy), we show in this
paper the necessity to tackle all these aspects for an optimal resource
management of the computing resources. This leads to improved energy usage in a
heterogeneous datacenter including the cooling of the computer rooms. We build
our approach on the concept of heat distribution matrix to handle the mutual
influence of the servers, in heterogeneous environments, which is novel in this
context. We propose a heuristic to solve the server placement problem and we
design a generic greedy framework for the online scheduling problem. We derive
several single-objective heuristics (for performance, energy, cooling) and a
novel fuzzy-based priority mechanism to handle their tradeoffs. Finally, we
show results using extensive simulations fed with actual measurements on
