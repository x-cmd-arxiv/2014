  Powders in a Simplified Geometry",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We perform experiments and discrete element simulations on the dosing of
cohesive granular materials in a simplified geometry. The setup is a simplified
canister box where the powder is dosed out of the box through the action of a
constant-pitch screw feeder connected to a motor. A dose consists of a rotation
step followed by a period of rest before the next dosage.
  From the experiments, we report on the operational performance of the dosing
process through a variation of dosage time, coil pitch and initial powder mass.
We find that the dosed mass shows an increasing linear dependence on the dosage
time and rotation speed. In contrast, the mass output from the canister is not
directly proportional to an increase/decrease in the number coils. By
calibrating the interparticle friction and cohesion, we show that DEM
simulation can quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings for smaller
masses but also overestimate arching and blockage. With appropriate
homogenization tools, further insights into microstructure and macroscopic
fields can be obtained.
  This work shows that particle scaling and the adaptation of particle
properties is a viable approach to overcome the untreatable number of particles
inherent in experiments with fine, cohesive powders and opens the gateway to
simulating their flow in more complex geometries.

structure. This variability is thought to arise from single-neuron
stochasticity, neural dynamics on short time-scales, as well as from
modulations of neural firing properties on long time-scales, often referred to
as ""non-stationarity"". To better understand the nature of co-variability in
neural circuits and their impact on cortical information processing, we need
statistical models that are able to capture multiple sources of variability on
different time-scales. Here, we introduce a hierarchical statistical model of
neural population activity which models both neural population dynamics as well
as inter-trial modulations in firing rates. In addition, we extend the model to
allow us to capture non-stationarities in the population dynamics itself (i.e.,
correlations across neurons).
  We develop variational inference methods for learning model parameters, and
demonstrate that the method can recover non-stationarities in both average
firing rates and correlation structure. Applied to neural population recordings
from anesthetized macaque primary visual cortex, our models provide a better
account of the structure of neural firing than stationary dynamics models.

atomic and electronic structures of NG, and particularly explore the
feasibility of converting p-type NG with pyridinic, pyrrolic, and nitrilic N
into n- or bipolar type by introducing an additional dopant atom. Out of the
nine candidates, B, C, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, and Cl, we find that the B-, Al-,
and P-codoping can anneal even relatively large vacancy defects in p-type NG.
It will be also shown that, while the NG with pyridinic N can be converted into
n-type via codoping, only the bipolar type conversion can be achieved for the
NG with nitrilic or pyrrolic N. The amount of work function reduction was up to
0.64 eV for the pyridinic N next to a monovacancy. The atomistic origin of such
diverse type changes is analysed based on Mulliken and crystal orbital
Hamiltonian populations, which provide us with a framework to connect the local
bonding chemistry with macroscopic electronic structure in doped and/or
defective graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed codoping scheme
can recover the excellent charge transport properties of pristine graphene.
Both the type conversion and conductance recovery in codoped NG should have
significant implications for the electronic and energy device applications.

relative entropy (RE) to quantify the concentration of annual rainfall and the

Mediterranean-type regions (southern Europe, northern Africa and southern
Australia) and areas of South and Central America, implying an increase in the
number of dry days up to one month by the end of the twenty-first century.
Positive RE changes are also projected over the monsoon regions of southern
Africa and North America, South America. These trends are consistent with a
shortening of the wet season associated with a more prolonged pre-monsoonal dry
period. The extent of the global monsoon region, characterized by large DSI, is
projected to remain substantially unaltered. Centroid analysis shows that most
of CMIP5 projections suggest that the monsoonal annual rainfall distribution is
expected to change from early to late in the course of the hydrological year by
the end of the twenty-first century and particularly after year 2050. This
trend is particularly evident over Northern Africa, Southern Africa and western
Mexico, where more than 90 % of the models project a delay of the rainfall

linear programs (LPs) and logic programs. A relational linear program (RLP) is
a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through
the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables. This
allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a
varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating
them. Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program
consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP
is solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the
ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the
reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to
mainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of
declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a
more intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains.
We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in
Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision

shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this paper
is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide
examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own
statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These
varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations

correspond to the scale factor of a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)

part of the action is minimally coupled and a vector field of its kinetic
energy is coupled with the scalar field by a coupling function $f(\phi)$. Then,
the Noether symmetry of such a cosmological model is investigated by utilizing
the behavior of the corresponding Lagrangian under the infinitesimal generator

function between the scalar and the vector fields and also the scalar field
potential function for which such symmetry exists. Finally, by means of the

exact solutions for the scale factor, scalar and vector fields. It is shown
that the resulting cosmology is an accelerated expansion universe for which its
expansion is due to the presence of the vector field in the early times, while
the scalar field is responsible of its late time expansion.

two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides can result in very fast capture of
electrons and holes of excitons by mid-gap defects from Auger processes. In the
Auger processes considered here, an exciton is annihilated at a defect site
with the capture of the electron (or the hole) by the defect and the hole (or
the electron) is scattered to a high energy. In the case of excitons, the
probability of finding an electron and a hole near each other is enhanced many
folds compared to the case of free uncorrelated electrons and holes.
Consequently, the rate of carrier capture by defects from Auger scattering for
excitons in metal dichalcogenides can be 100-1000 times larger than for
uncorrelated electrons and holes for carrier densities in the
$10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ range. We calculate the capture times of
electrons and holes by defects and show that the capture times can be in the
sub-picosecond to a few picoseconds range. The capture rates exhibit linear as
well as quadratic dependence on the exciton density. These fast time scales
agree well with the recent experimental observations, and point to the
importance of controlling defects in metal dichalcogenides for optoelectronic
applications.

key parameter is the intrinsic exciton homogeneous linewidth, which reflects
irreversible quantum dissipation arising from system (exciton) and bath (vacuum

spectroscopy, we provide the first experimental determination of the exciton

Middle Drum (MD) fluorescence telescope station consists of 14 telescopes from
the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) experiment, providing a direct link back

with the telescope data improves the geometrical reconstruction of the showers
significantly, and hence, provides a more accurate reconstruction of the energy
of the primary particle. The Middle Drum hybrid spectrum is presented and
compared to that measured by the Middle Drum station in monocular mode.
Further, the hybrid data establishes a link between the Middle Drum data and
the surface array. A comparison between the Middle Drum hybrid energy spectrum

proposed to generate a cluster structure, where in the prior the number of

individuals and companies with access to remote computing and storage
infrastructures. In order to achieve highly-available yet high-performing
services, cloud data stores rely on data replication. However, providing
replication brings with it the issue of consistency. Given that data are
replicated in multiple geographically distributed data centers, and to meet the
increasing requirements of distributed applications, many cloud data stores
adopt eventual consistency and therefore allow to run data intensive operations
under low latency. This comes at the cost of data staleness. In this paper, we
prioritize data replication based on a set of flexible data semantics that can
best suit all types of Big Data applications, avoiding overloading both network
and systems during large periods of disconnection or partitions in the network.
Therefore we integrated these data semantics into the core architecture of a
well-known NoSQL data store (e.g., HBase), which leverages a three-dimensional
vector-field model (regarding timeliness, number of pending updates and
divergence bounds) to provision data selectively in an on-demand fashion to
applications. This enhances the former consistency model by providing a number
of required levels of consistency to different applications such as, social
networks or e-commerce sites, where priority of updates also differ. In
addition, our implementation of the model into HBase allows updates to be
tagged and grouped atomically in logical batches, akin to transactions,
ensuring atomic changes and correctness of updates as they are propagated.

rotation of the Sun. One of the important achievements was the discovery of two
radial shear layers: one near the bottom of the convection zone (the
tachocline) and one near the surface. These shear layers may be important
ingredients for explaining the magnetic cycle of the Sun. We measure the
logarithmic radial gradient of the rotation rate ($\rm d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$)
near the surface of the Sun using 15 years of f mode rotational frequency
splittings from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and four years of data from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). We model the angular velocity of
the Sun in the upper $\sim 10$ Mm as changing linearly with depth and use a
multiplicative optimally localized averaging inversion to infer the gradient of
the rotation rate as a function of latitude. Both the MDI and HMI data show
that $\rm d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$ is close to $-1$ from the equator to
60$^{\circ}$ latitude and stays negative up to 75$^{\circ}$ latitude. However,
the value of the gradient is different for MDI and HMI for latitudes above
$60^{\circ}$. Additionally, there is a significant difference between the value
of $d\ln\Omega/d\ln r$ using an older and recently reprocessed MDI data for
latitudes above $30^\circ$. We could reliably infer the value of $\rm
d\ln\Omega/\rm d\ln r$ up to 60$^{\circ}$, but not above this latitude, which
will hopefully constrain theories of the near-surface shear layer and dynamo.
Furthermore, the recently reprocessed MDI splitting data are more reliable than
the older versions which contained clear systematic errors in the high degree f
modes.

from a sample of plots containing count data, but the plot placements are
spatially irregular and non randomized. Our application had counts from
thousands of irregularly-spaced aerial photo images. We used change-of-support
methods to model counts in images as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson
process that used spatial basis functions to model the spatial intensity
surface. The method was very fast and took only a few seconds for thousands of
images. The fitted intensity surface was integrated to provide an estimate from
all unsampled areas, which is added to the observed counts. The proposed method
also provides a finite area correction factor to variance estimation. The
intensity surface from an inhomogeneous Poisson process tends to be too smooth
for locally clustered points, typical of animal distributions, so we introduce
several new overdispersion estimators due to poor performance of the classic
one. We used simulated data to examine estimation bias and to investigate
several variance estimators with overdispersion. A real example is given of
harbor seal counts from aerial surveys in an Alaskan glacial fjord.

irreducible components of the varieties that parametrize the $d$-dimensional

projective parametrizing variety ${\rm GRASS}_d(\Lambda)$. Our method is to
corner the components by way of a twin pair of upper semicontinuous maps from
${\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda)$ to a poset consisting of sequences of semisimple
modules.
  An excerpt of the main result is as follows. Given a sequence ${\bf S} =
({\bf S}_0, ..., {\bf S}_L)$ of semisimple modules with $\dim \bigoplus_{0 \le
l \le L} {\bf S}_l = d$, let ${\rm\bf{Rep}}\, {\bf S}$ be the subvariety of

$\Lambda$-module $M$ is the sequence $\bigl(J^l M / J^{l+1} M\bigr)_{0 \le l
\le L}$, where $J$ is the Jacobson radical of $\Lambda$.) Suppose the quiver
$Q$ has $r \ge 2$ loops. If $d \le L+1$, the variety
${\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda)$ is irreducible. If, on the other hand, $d > L+1$,
then the irreducible components of ${\rm\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\Lambda)$ are the
closures of the subvarieties ${\rm\bf{Rep}}\, {\bf S}$ for those sequences
${\bf S}$ which satisfy the inequalities $\dim {\bf S}_l \le r \dim {\bf
S}_{l+1}$ and $\dim {\bf S}_{l+1} \le r \dim {\bf S}_l$ for $0 \le l < L$. As a
byproduct, the main result provides generic information on the modules

d, in the homogeneous coordinate ring R=k[x1,...,xs] of projective s-1 space.
Our goal is to relate properties of Psi, of the homogeneous coordinate ring
A=k[g1,...,gn] of the variety parametrized by Psi, and of the Rees algebra
R[It], the bihomogeneous coordinate ring of the graph of Psi. For a regular map
Psi, for instance, we prove that R[It] satisfies Serre's condition R_i, for
some positive i, if and only if A satisfies R_{i-1} and Psi is birational onto
its image. Thus, in particular, Psi is birational onto its image if and only if
R[It] satisfies R_1. Either condition has implications for the shape of the
core, namely, the core of I is the multiplier ideal of I to the power s and the
core of I equals the maximal homogeneous ideal of R to the power sd-s+1.
Conversely, for s equal to two, either equality for the core implies
birationality. In addition, by means of the generalized rows of the syzygy
matrix of g1,...,gn, we give an explicit method to reduce the non-birational
case to the birational one when s is equal to 2.

Euler characteristic chi(G), characteristic length mu(G), mean clustering
nu(G), inductive dimension iota(G), edge density epsilon(G), scale measure
sigma(G), Hilbert action eta(G) and spectral complexity xi(G). A new insight in
this note is that the local cluster coefficient C(x) in a finite simple graph
can be written as a relative characteristic length L(x) of the unit sphere S(x)
within the unit ball B(x) of a vertex. This relation L(x) = 2-C(x) will allow
to study clustering in more general metric spaces like Riemannian manifolds or
fractals. If eta is the average of scalar curvature s(x), a formula mu ~
1+log(epsilon)/log(eta) of Newman, Watts and Strogatz relates mu with the edge
density epsilon and average scalar curvature eta telling that large curvature
correlates with small characteristic length. Experiments show that the
statistical relation mu ~ log(1/nu) holds for random or deterministic
constructed networks, indicating that small clustering is often associated to
large characteristic lengths and lambda=mu/log(nu) can converge in some graph
limits of networks. Mean clustering nu, edge density epsilon and curvature
average eta therefore can relate with characteristic length mu on a statistical
level. We also discovered experimentally that inductive dimension iota and
cluster-length ratio lambda correlate strongly on Erdos-Renyi probability
spaces.

circuitry is required, since the capability to track time-varying
self-interference coupling characteristics is of utmost importance in mobile
devices. In addition, novel adaptive nonlinear DSP methods are also required
for final self-interference suppression at digital baseband, since mobile-scale

active RF cancellation over an 80 MHz waveform bandwidth with a highly
nonlinear transmitter power amplifier. Measured examples also demonstrate the
good self-healing characteristics of the developed control loop against fast
changes in the coupling channel. Furthermore, when complemented with nonlinear
digital cancellation processing, the residual self-interference level is pushed
down to the noise floor of the demonstration system, despite the harsh
nonlinear nature of the self-interference. These findings indicate that
deploying the full-duplex principle can indeed be feasible also in mobile

canonical variables describing non-commutative spaces. The representations for
the corresponding operators obey algebras whose uncertainty relations lead to
minimal length, areas and volumes in phase space, which are in principle
natural candidates of many different approaches of quantum gravity. We study
some explicit models on these types of noncommutative spaces, first by
utilising the perturbation theory, later in an exact manner. In many cases the
operators are not Hermitian, therefore we use PT -symmetry and
pseudo-Hermiticity property, wherever applicable, to make them self-consistent.
Apart from building mathematical models, we focus on the physical implications
of noncommutative theories too. We construct Klauder coherent states for the
perturbative and nonperturbative noncommutative harmonic oscillator associated
with uncertainty relations implying minimal lengths. In both cases, the
uncertainty relations for the constructed states are shown to be saturated and
thus imply to the squeezed coherent states. They are also shown to satisfy the
Ehrenfest theorem dictating the classical like nature of the coherent
wavepacket. The quality of those states are further underpinned by the
fractional revival structure. More investigations into the comparison are
carried out by a qualitative comparison between the dynamics of the classical
particle and that of the coherent states based on numerical techniques. The
qualitative behaviour is found to be governed by the Mandel parameter
determining the regime in which the wavefunctions evolve as soliton like

performed using various numerical integration schemes, each one possess
different level of accuracy, alters in number of integration (Gauss) points and
requires different amount of computations. Herein semi-analytical approach is
suggested. Metric (Jacobian determinant) is approximately modeled using its
evaluations in certain points. Analytical integration is performed to derive
simple explicit closed-form expressions for each term of the mass matrix. Two
schemes are discussed: the first assumes constant metric (CM) in the initial
domain, using evaluation at the centroid. The second allows for linear
variation of the metric (LM linear metric) in the domain using 3 additional
evaluation points. Both schemes are exact for rectangular and non-rectangular
parallelepiped mesh. Careful symbolic manipulations and convenient choice of
evaluation points allow us to avoid unnecessary operations. The accuracy of
both schemes is studied numerically using randomly generated coarse mesh.
Significant superiority in accuracy over equivalent schemes is reported. An
important implication of this study is that it can replace currently used
schemes.

monitoring how the percentage of chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of

integrating the equations of motion as well as the variational equations to
extensive samples of orbits in order to distinguish safely between ordered and

used to identify the various families of regular orbits and also to recognize
the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Our investigation takes

better understanding of the orbital properties of the system. Our numerical
computations reveal that low angular momentum stars are most likely to move in

processing. In many applications, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), a
coherent state is functioned as a mixture of Fock states by assuming its phase
is continuously randomized. In practice, such a crucial assumption is often not
satisfied and, therefore, the security of existing QKD experiments is not
guaranteed. To bridge this gap, we provide a rigorous security proof of QKD
with discrete-phase-randomized coherent state sources. Our results show that
the performance of the discrete-phase randomization case is close to its
continuous counterpart with only a small number (say, 10) of discrete phases.
Comparing to the conventional continuous phase randomization case, where an
infinite amount of random bits are required, our result shows that only a small
amount (say, 4 bits) of randomness is needed.

our code we study the pros and cons of a moving mesh (in comparison to a static

our implementation of external sources and time advancement scheme is more
accurate and robust than AREPO's, when the mesh is allowed to move. We
performed a parameter study of the cell rounding mechanism (Llyod iterations)
and it effects. We find that in most cases a moving mesh gives better results
than a static mesh, but it is not universally true. In the case where matter
moves in one way, and a sound wave is traveling in the other way (such that
relative to the grid the wave is not moving) a static mesh gives better results
than a moving mesh. Moreover, we show that Voronoi based moving mesh schemes
suffer from an error, that is resolution independent, due to inconsistencies
between the flux calculation and change in the area of a cell. Our code is

degree of coherence in dissipative laser system with gain. Nonlinear mode
interactions can be competitive or cooperative: adjusting the intracavity
polarization state controls the process of loss of coherence. Single-shot
spectra reveal that fiber laser redistributes its energy from center wavelength
mode to sidebands through parametric instabilities, and subsequently
longitudinal modes are populated via cascaded four-wave-mixing. Parametric
frequency conversion populates longitudinal modes with a random distribution of
position, intensity and polarization, resulting in partially (rather than
highly) coherent pulses. These dynamics unveil a new route towards complex

variations. The combined analysis of the light curves and spectroscopic data
resulted in an orbital period of the substellar companion of 3.35 days, a

coefficient of friction) is subjected to superimposed oscillations in the
normal and tangential directions, then a specific damping appears, that is not
dependent on friction or dissipation in the material. We call this effect
""relaxation damping"". The rate of energy dissipation due to relaxation damping
is calculated in a closed analytic form for arbitrary axially-symmetric
contacts. In the case of equal frequency of normal and tangential oscillations,
the dissipated energy per cycle is proportional to the square of the amplitude
of tangential oscillation and to the absolute value of the amplitude of normal
oscillation, and is dependent on the phase shift between both oscillations. In
the case of low frequency tangential motion with superimposed high frequency
normal oscillations, the system acts as a tunable linear damper. Generalization
of the results for macroscopically planar, randomly rough surfaces is
discussed.

Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We systematically consider
various experimental constraints including the Dark Matter (DM) relic density,
DM direct detection results and indirect searches from dwarf galaxies. We find
that, for DM with mass ranging from $30 {\rm GeV}$ to $40 {\rm GeV}$, the GCE
can be explained by the annihilation $\chi \chi \to a^\ast \to b \bar{b}$ only
when the CP-odd scalar satisfies $m_a \simeq 2 m_\chi$, and in order to obtain
the measured DM relic density, a sizable $Z$-mediated contribution to DM
annihilation must intervene in the early universe. As a result, the higgsino
mass $\mu$ is upper bounded by about 350 GeV. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations
on the $3\ell+ E_T^{miss}$ signal from neutralino/chargino associated
production at 14-TeV LHC indicate that the explanation can be mostly
(completely) excluded at $95\%$ C.L. with an integrated luminosity of 100(200)
fb$^{-1}$. We also discuss the implication of possible large $Z$ coupling to DM
for the DM-nucleon spin dependent (SD) scattering cross section, and find that
although the current experimental bounds on $\sigma^{\rm SD}_p$ is less
stringent than the spin independent (SI) results, the future XENON-1T and LZ
data may be capable of testing most parts of the GCE-favored parameter region.

Both prograde and retrograde orbits have been proposed. We study a binary of a
small mass ratio, q, in a retrograde orbit immersed in and interacting with a
gaseous accretion disk in order to estimate time scales for inward migration
leading to coalescence and the accretion rate to the secondary component. We
employ both semi-analytic methods and two dimensional numerical simulations,
focusing on the case where the binary mass ratio is small but large enough to
significantly perturb the disk. We develop the theory of type I migration for
this case and determine conditions for gap formation finding that then inward
migration occurs on a time scale equal to the time required for one half of the
secondary mass to be accreted through the unperturbed disk, with accretion onto
the secondary playing only a minor role. The semi-analytic and fully numerical
approaches are in good agreement, the former being applicable over long time
scales. Inward migration induced by interaction with the disk alleviates the
final parsec problem. Accretion onto the secondary does not significantly
affect the orbital evolution, but may have observational consequences for high
accretion efficiency. The binary may then appear as two sources of radiation
rotating around each other. This study should be extended to consider orbits
with significant eccentricity and the effects of gravitational radiation at
small length scales. Note too that torques acting between a circumbinary disk
and a retrograde binary orbit may cause the mutual inclination to increase on a
timescale that can be similar to, or smaller than that for orbital evolution,
depending on detailed parameters. This is also an aspect for future study
(abridged).

class which is well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation is of
bounded clique-width. There are two reasons why this questions is interesting.
First, it connects two seemingly unrelated notions. Second, if the question is
answered affirmatively, this will have a strong algorithmic consequence. In
particular, this will mean (through the use of Courcelle theorem [2]), that any
problem definable in Monadic Second Order Logic can be solved in a polynomial
time on any class well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation. In the
present paper, we answer this question affirmatively for graphs without large
bicliques. Thus the above algorithmic consequence is true, for example, for
classes of graphs of bounded degree.

the values for N=4 conformal 4d supergravity and also twice the values for N=4

conformal supergravity and four N=4 Maxwell multiplets is anomaly free. The
values of (E, a, c) for the states at level p of Kaluza-Klein tower of 10d type
IIB supergravity compactified on S^5 turn out to be equal to those for p copies
of N=4 Maxwell multiplets. This may be related to the fact that these states
appear in the tensor product of p superdoubletons. Under a natural
regularization of the sum over p, the full 10d supergravity contribution is
then minus that of the Maxwell multiplet, in agreement with the standard

provided including: the projection $K^{n} \times \mathbb{P}^{m}(K) \to K^{n}$
and blow-ups of the $K$-rational points of smooth $K$-varieties are definably
closed maps, a descent property for blow-ups, curve selection for definable
sets, a general version of the \L{}ojasiewicz inequality for continuous
definable functions on subsets locally closed in the $K$-topology and extending
continuous hereditarily rational functions, established for the real and
$p$-adic varieties in our joint paper with J. Koll\'ar. The descent property
enables application of resolution of singularities and transformation to a
normal crossing by blowing up in much the same way as over the locally compact
ground field. Our approach relies on quantifier elimination due to Pas and a
concept of fiber shrinking for definable sets, which is a relaxed version of
curve selection. The last three sections are devoted to the theory of regulous
functions and sets over such valued fields. Regulous geometry over the real
ground field $\mathbb{R}$ was developed by Fichou--Huisman--Mangolte--Monnier.
The main results here are regulous versions of Nullstellensatz and Cartan's
Theorems A and B.

seen in a number of quadruply-lensed quasars. The most favored interpretation
of these anomalies is that CDM substructures present in lensing galaxies
perturb the lens potentials and alter image magnifications and thus flux
ratios. So far no consensus has emerged regarding whether or not the predicted
CDM substructure abundance fully accounts for the lensing flux anomaly
observations. Accurate modeling relies on a realistic lens sample in terms of
both the lens environment and internal structures and substructures. In this
paper we construct samples of generalised and specific lens potentials, to
which we add (rescaled) subhalo populations from the galaxy-scale Aquarius and
the cluster-scale Phoenix simulation suites. We further investigate the lensing
effects from subhalos of masses several orders of magnitude below the
simulation resolution limit. The resulting flux ratio distributions are
compared to the currently best available sample of radio lenses. The observed
anomalies in B0128+437, B0712+472 and B1555+375 are more likely to be caused by
propagation effects or oversimplified lens modeling, signs of which are already
seen in the data. Among the quadruple systems that have closely located image
triplets/pairs, the anomalous flux ratios of MG0414+0534 can be reproduced by
adding CDM subhalos to its macroscopic lens potential, with a probability of
5%-20%; for B0712+472, B1422+231, B1555+375 and B2045+265, these probabilities
are only of a few percent. We hence find that CDM substructures are unlikely to
be the whole reason for radio flux anomalies. We discuss other possible effects
that might also be at work.

a fine analysis that exposes the limiting distribution of the number of rounds

  Mousset, Angelika Steger","Bootstrap percolation with inhibition",,,,,"math.PR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bootstrap percolation is a prominent framework for studying the spreading of
activity on a graph. We begin with an initial set of active vertices. The
process then proceeds in rounds, and further vertices become active as soon as
they have a certain number of active neighbors. A recurring feature in
bootstrap percolation theory is an `all-or-nothing' phenomenon: either the size
of the starting set is so small that the process stops very soon, or it
percolates (almost) completely.
  Motivated by several important phenomena observed in various types of
real-world networks we propose in this work a variant of bootstrap percolation
that exhibits a vastly different behavior. Our graphs have two types of
vertices: some of them obstruct the diffusion, while the others facilitate it.
We study the effect of this setting by analyzing the process on
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Our main findings are two-fold. First we show
that the presence of vertices hindering the diffusion does not result in a
stable behavior: tiny changes in the size of the starting set can dramatically
influence the size of the final active set. In particular, the process is
non-monotone: a larger starting set can result in a smaller final set. In the
second part of the paper we show that this phenomenom arises from the
round-based approach: if we move to a continuous time model in which every edge
draws its transmission time randomly, then we gain stability, and the process
stops with an active set that contains a non-trivial constant fraction of all
vertices. Moreover, we show that in the continuous time model percolation
occurs significantly faster compared to the classical round-based model. Our
findings are in line with empirical observations and demonstrate the importance
of introducing various types of vertex behaviors in the mathematical model.

in the convective region of stars. Their dissipation plays a prominent role in
the long-term orbital evolution of short-period planets. If the star is assumed
to be rotating as a solid-body, the waves' Doppler-shifted frequency is
restricted to $[-2 \Omega, 2 \Omega]$ ($\Omega$ being the angular velocity of
the star) and they can propagate in the entire convective region. However,
turbulent convection can sustain differential rotation with an equatorial
acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration that may modify waves propagation.
We thus explore the properties of inertial modes of oscillation in a conically
differentially rotating background flow whose angular velocity depends on the
latitudinal coordinate only, close to what is expected in the external
convective envelope of low-mass stars. We find that their frequency range is
broadened by differential rotation, and that they may propagate only in a
restricted part of the envelope. In some cases, inertial waves form shear
layers around short-period attractor cycles. In others, they exhibit a
remarkable behavior when a turning surface or a corotation layer exists in the
star. We discuss how all these cases can impact tidal dissipation in stars.

gluon collisions has been considered and the regeneration rate has been
obtained using the principle of detailed balance. The modification in quarkonia
yields due to collisions with hadronic comovers has been estimated assuming
that the comovers are pions. The manifestations of these effects on the nuclear
modification factors for both $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ in different kinematic
regions has been demonstrated for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 2.76
TeV in comparison with the measurements. Both the suppression and regeneration
due to a deconfined medium strongly affect the low and intermediate $p_T$
range. The large observed suppression of $J/\psi$ at $p_T~>$ 10 GeV/$c$ exceeds
the estimates of suppression by gluon dissociation.

uniformizing variable method, and the charmonium decay processes
$J/\psi\to\phi(\pi\pi, K\bar{K})$, $\psi(2S)\to J/\psi(\pi\pi)$. Results of the
analysis confirm all our earlier conclusions on the scalar mesons. It is also
shown that in the final states of the $\Upsilon$-meson family decays (except
for the $\pi\pi$ scattering) the contribution of the coupled processes, e.g.,
$K\bar{K}\to\pi\pi$, is important even if these processes are energetically
forbidden. This is in accordance with our previous conclusions on the wide
resonances: If a wide resonance cannot decay into a channel which opens above
its mass but the resonance is strongly connected with this channel (e.g. the
$f_0(500)$ and the $K\bar}$ channel), one should consider this resonance as a
multi-channel state with allowing for the indicated channel taking into account
the Riemann-surface sheets related to the threshold branch-point of this

conserved regions of different networks. Typically, existing methods use a node
cost function (NCF) to compute similarity between nodes in different networks

the total NCF over all aligned nodes (or node conservation). But, they then
evaluate quality of their alignments via some other measure that is different
than the node conservation measure used to guide the alignment construction
process. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges, but only after
alignments are produced. Hence, a recent attempt aimed to directly maximize the
amount of conserved edges while constructing alignments, which improved
alignment accuracy. Here, we aim to directly maximize both node and edge
conservation during alignment construction to further improve alignment
accuracy. For this, we design a novel measure of edge conservation that (unlike
existing measures that treat each conserved edge the same) weighs each
conserved edge so that edges with highly NCF-similar end nodes are favored. As
a result, we introduce a novel AS, Weighted Alignment VotEr (WAVE), which can
optimize any measures of node and edge conservation, and which can be used with
any NCF or combination of multiple NCFs. Using WAVE on top of established
state-of-the-art NCFs leads to superior alignments compared to the existing
methods that optimize only node conservation or only edge conservation or that
treat each conserved edge the same. And while we evaluate WAVE in the
computational biology domain, it is easily applicable in any domain.

focus on a sample of 28 $\gamma$-ray-detected pulsars using data taken as part
of the Parkes telescope's \emph{FERMI} timing program. In doing so we find a
preference in the sample for low magnetic inclination angles, $\alpha$, in
stark contrast to both the expectation that the magnetic and rotation axes are
orientated randomly at the birth of the pulsar and to
$\gamma$-ray-emission-model-based expected biases. In this paper, after
exploring potential explanations, we conclude that there are two possible
causes of this preference, namely that low $\alpha$ values are intrinsic to the
sample, or that the emission regions extend outside what is traditionally
thought to be the open-field-line region in a way which is dependent on the
magnetic inclination. Each possibility is expected to have important
consequences, ranging from supernova physics to population studies of pulsars
and considerations of the radio beaming fraction. We also present a simple
conversion scheme between the observed and intrinsic magnetic inclinations
which is valid under the assumption that the observed skew is not intrinsic and
which can be applied to all existing measurements. We argue that extending the
active field-line region will help to resolve the existing tension between
emission geometries derived from radio polarisation measurements and those
required to model $\gamma$-ray light curves.

vertex $v$ of the tree. The main question to be considered is the existence or
not of an infinite path of nearest neighbors $v_1,v_2,v_3\ldots$ such that
$X_{v_1}<X_{v_2}<X_{v_3}<\cdots$ and which spans the entire graph. The event
defined by the existence of such path is called {\it{percolation}}.
  We consider the case of the accessibility percolation model on a spherically
symmetric tree with growth function given by $f(i)=\lceil (i+1)^ \alpha
\rceil$, where $\alpha>0$ is a given constant. We show that there is a
percolation threshold at $\alpha_c =1$ such that there is percolation if
$\alpha> 1$ and there is absence of percolation if $\alpha \leq 1$. Moreover,
we study the event of percolation starting at any vertex, as well as the
continuity of the percolation probability function. Finally, we provide a
comparison between this model with the well known $F^{\alpha}$ record model. We
also discuss a number of open problems concerning the accessibility percolation
model for further consideration in future research.

shift along the laser propagation direction during the under-the barrier

The significant change of the ionization rate is originated from the different

to perform sudden coherent changes in travel direction. While this collective
decision can be a response to an external perturbation, such as the presence of
a predator, recent studies show that such directional switching can also emerge
from the intrinsic fluctuations in the individual behaviour. However, the cause
and the mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not
fully understood yet. Here, we present an experimental study of spontaneous
collective turns in natural flocks of starlings. We employ a recently developed
tracking algorithm to reconstruct three-dimensional trajectories of each
individual bird in the flock for the whole duration of a turning event. Our
approach enables us to analyze changes in the individual behavior of every
group member and reveal the emergent dynamics of turning. We show that
spontaneous turns start from individuals located at the elongated edges of the
flocks, and then propagate through the group. We find that birds on the edges
deviate from the mean direction of motion much more frequently than other
individuals, indicating that persistent localized fluctuations are the crucial
ingredient for triggering a collective directional change. Finally, we
quantitatively show that birds follow equal radius paths during turning
allowing the flock to change orientation and redistribute risky locations among
group members. The whole process of turning is a remarkable example of how a
self-organized system can sustain collective changes and reorganize, while
retaining coherence.

the form domain is required to be densely embedded into the Hilbert space.
Recently, this requirement was relaxed by Arendt and ter Elst in the setting of

heterostructure proceeds in the plane with the NC and is the conduction of a
two-dimensional system of charge carriers that shows some unusual effects. The
temperature variation of resistivitymaybe treated as the result of the effect
of thermal activation but in this case it is characterized by a low activation
energy different in value in different temperature ranges. This suggests that
the mechanism of conduction is more complex. It is found that the conduction is
determined by the effect of temperature variation not only on carrier
concentration but also on its mobility. Magnetoresistivity is also of different
shape in different temperature ranges. All the above features are treated in
terms of the proposed model of electron hopping through the conduction band (or

trust and reputation models, based on interaction trust or witness reputation,
have been proposed, yet they often presuppose the use of a centralized

with skepticism, since users may question the trustworthiness and the
robustness of a central authority. Distributed models, on the other hand, are
more complex but they provide personalized estimations based on each agent's

limitations of physical acquisition systems, and to support the development of
high resolution displays. Previous example-based super-resolution approaches
mainly focus on analyzing the co-occurrence properties of low resolution and
high-resolution patches. Recently, we proposed a novel single image
super-resolution approach based on linear manifold approximation of the
high-resolution image-patch space [1]. The image super-resolution problem is
then formulated as an optimization problem of searching for the best matched
high resolution patch in the manifold for a given low-resolution patch. We
developed a novel technique based on the l1 norm sparse graph to learn a set of
low dimensional affine spaces or tangent subspaces of the high-resolution patch
manifold. The optimization problem is then solved based on the learned set of
tangent subspaces. In this paper, we build on our recent work as follows.
First, we consider and analyze each tangent subspace as one point in a
Grassmann manifold, which helps to compute geodesic pairwise distances among
these tangent subspaces. Second, we develop a min-max algorithm to select an
optimal subset of tangent subspaces. This optimal subset reduces the
computational cost while still preserving the quality of the reconstructed
high-resolution image. Third, and to further achieve lower computational
complexity, we perform hierarchical clustering on the optimal subset based on
Grassmann manifold distances. Finally, we analytically prove the validity of
the proposed Grassmann-distance based clustering. A comparison of the obtained
results with other state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability of
the new proposed framework.

two datasets and forms the most highly correlated possible pairs of linear
combinations between them. Each subsequent pair of linear combinations is
orthogonal to the preceding pair, meaning that new information is gleaned from
each pair. By looking at the magnitude of coefficient values, we can find out
which variables can be grouped together, thus better understanding multiple
interactions that are otherwise difficult to compute or grasp intuitively.
  CCA appears to have quite powerful applications to high throughput data, as
we can use it to discover, for example, relationships between gene expression
and gene copy number variation. One of the biggest problems of CCA is that the
number of variables (often upwards of 10,000) makes biological interpretation
of linear combinations nearly impossible. To limit variable output, we have
employed a method known as Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA), while
adding estimation which is resistant to extreme observations or other types of
deviant data. In this paper, we have demonstrated the success of resistant
estimation in variable selection using SCCA. Additionally, we have used SCCA to
find multiple canonical pairs for extended knowledge about the datasets at
hand. Again, using resistant estimators provided more accurate estimates than
standard estimators in the multiple canonical correlation setting.

galaxies, SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365. X-ray reverberation lags are due to
the light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and the
reprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionised accretion disc.
XMM-Newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with the
broad Fe K emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the line
is observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 keV, produced at larger
radii. Now we use NuSTAR to probe the lag at higher energies, where the
spectrum shows clear evidence for Compton reflection, known as the Compton
'hump'. The XMM-Newton data show Fe K lags in both SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC
1365. The NuSTAR data provide independent confirmation of these Fe K lags, and
also show evidence for the corresponding Compton hump lags, especially in SWIFT

and Fe K lag are produced at small radii. At low-frequencies in NGC 1365, where
the spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we find

invariant whose study started two decades ago. The distinguishing number $D(G)$
is the least integer $d$ such that $G$ has a $d$-distinguishing coloring. A
distinguishing $d$-coloring is a coloring $c:V(G)\rightarrow\{1,...,d\}$
invariant only under the trivial automorphism. In this paper, we introduce a
game variant of the distinguishing number. The distinguishing game is a game
with two players, the Gentle and the Rascal, with antagonist goals. This game
is played on a graph $G$ with a set of $d\in\mathbb N^*$ colors. Alternately,
the two players choose a vertex of $G$ and color it with one of the $d$ colors.
The game ends when all the vertices have been colored. Then the Gentle wins if
the coloring is distinguishing and the Rascal wins otherwise. This game leads
to define two new invariants for a graph $G$, which are the minimum numbers of
colors needed to ensure that the Gentle has a winning strategy, depending on
who starts. These invariants could be infinite, thus we start by giving
sufficient conditions to have infinite game distinguishing numbers. We also
show that for graphs with cyclic automorphisms group of prime odd order, both
game invariants are finite. After that, we define a class of graphs, the
involutive graphs, for which the game distinguishing number can be
quadratically bounded above by the classical distinguishing number. The
definition of this class is closely related to imprimitive actions whose blocks
have size $2$. Then, we apply results on involutive graphs to compute the exact
value of these invariants for hypercubes and even cycles. Finally, we study odd
cycles, for which we are able to compute the exact value when their order is
not prime. In the prime order case, we give an upper bound of $3$.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 110601 (2013)]. The adsorption isotherm and equilibrium
fluctuations in particle number are discussed as a function of the interaction.
Their behavior is similar to that of interacting particles in porous materials.
Different expressions for the particle jump rates are derived from transition
state theory. Which expression should be used depends on the strength of the
inter-particle interactions. Analytical expressions for the self- and transport
diffusion are derived when correlations, caused by memory effects in the
environment, are neglected. The diffusive behavior is studied numerically with
kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, which reproduces the diffusion including
correlations. The effect of correlations is studied by comparing the analytical
expressions with the kMC simulations. It is found that the Maxwell-Stefan
diffusion can exceed the self-diffusion. To our knowledge, this is the first
time this is observed. The diffusive behavior in one-dimensional and higher
dimensional systems is qualitatively the same, with the effect of correlations
decreasing for increasing dimension. The length dependence of both the self-
and transport diffusion is studied for one-dimensional systems. For long
lengths the self-diffusion shows a one over length dependence. Finally, we
discuss when agreement with experiments and simulations can be expected. The
assumption that particles in different cavities do not interact is expected to
hold quantitatively at low and medium particle concentrations, if the particles
are not strongly interacting.

  One-dimensional Diffusion via Dynkin Game",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB) associated with the time
inhomogeneous singular control problem is a parabolic partial differential
equation, and the existence of a classical solution is usually difficult to
prove. In this paper, a class of finite horizon stochastic singular control
problems of one dimensional diffusion is solved via a time inhomogeneous
zero-sum game (Dynkin game). The regularity of the value function of the Dynkin
game is investigated, and its integrated form coincides with the value function
of the singular control problem. We provide conditions under which a classical
solution to the associated HJB equation exists, thus the usual viscosity
solution approach is avoided. We also show that the optimal control policy is
to reflect the diffusion between two time inhomogeneous boundaries. For a more
general terminal payoff function, we showed that the optimal control involves a
possible impulse at maturity.

Halpern","Translucent Players: Explaining Cooperative Behavior in Social Dilemmas",,,,,"cs.GT physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last few decades, numerous experiments have shown that humans do not
always behave so as to maximize their material payoff. Cooperative behavior
when non-cooperation is a dominant strategy (with respect to the material
payoffs) is particularly puzzling. Here we propose a novel approach to explain
cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass (2013) call ""translucent players"".
Typically, players are assumed to be ""opaque"", in the sense that a deviation by
one player does not affect the strategies used by other players. But a player
may believe that if he switches from one strategy to another, the fact that he
chooses to switch may be visible to the other players. For example, if he
chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other player may sense his guilt.
We show that by assuming translucent players, we can recover many of the
regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied games such as
Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and the Public
Goods game.

this function, whose inverse, for reasons of tradition, we call the volume

differential signal when exactly two biological conditions are possible. For
more than two conditions, pairwise testing is typically used. Here the DESeq
method is extended so that three or more biological conditions can be assessed
simultaneously. Because the computation time grows exponentially in the number

To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt that
applies sentiment analysis to the domain of TCM on Sina Weibo (a twitter-like
microblogging service in China). In our work, firstly we collect tweets topic
about TCM from Sina Weibo, and label the tweets as supporting TCM and opposing
TCM automatically based on user tag. Then, a support vector machine classifier

  Non-parametric Mixture of Multivariate Poisson",,,,,"cs.OS cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing caching strategies, in the storage domain, though well suited to
exploit short range spatio-temporal patterns, are unable to leverage long-range
motifs for improving hitrates. Motivated by this, we investigate novel Bayesian
non-parametric modeling(BNP) techniques for count vectors, to capture long
range correlations for cache preloading, by mining Block I/O traces. Such
traces comprise of a sequence of memory accesses that can be aggregated into
high-dimensional sparse correlated count vector sequences.
  While there are several state of the art BNP algorithms for clustering and
their temporal extensions for prediction, there has been no work on exploring
these for correlated count vectors. Our first contribution addresses this gap
by proposing a DP based mixture model of Multivariate Poisson (DP-MMVP) and its
temporal extension(HMM-DP-MMVP) that captures the full covariance structure of
multivariate count data. However, modeling full covariance structure for count
vectors is computationally expensive, particularly for high dimensional data.
Hence, we exploit sparsity in our count vectors, and as our main contribution,
introduce the Sparse DP mixture of multivariate Poisson(Sparse-DP-MMVP),
generalizing our DP-MMVP mixture model, also leading to more efficient
inference. We then discuss a temporal extension to our model for cache
preloading.
  We take the first step towards mining historical data, to capture long range
patterns in storage traces for cache preloading. Experimentally, we show a
dramatic improvement in hitrates on benchmark traces and lay the groundwork for
further research in storage domain to reduce latencies using data mining
techniques to capture long range motifs.
