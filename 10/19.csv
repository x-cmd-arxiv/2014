arbitrary unitaries in SU(2), when the control set is restricted to rotations
around two non-parallel axes in the Bloch sphere. Our method bypasses commonly
used control-theoretical techniques, and easily imposes necessary conditions on
time-optimal sequences. In a straightforward fashion, we prove that
time-optimal sequences are solely parametrized by three rotation angles and
derive general bounds on those angles as a function of the relative rotation
speed of each control and the angle between the axes. Results are substantially
different whether both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations about the given
axes are allowed, or only clockwise rotations. In the first case, we prove that
any finite time-optimal sequence is composed at most of five control
concatenations, while for the more restrictive case, we present scaling laws on
the maximum length of any finite time-optimal sequence. The bounds we find for
both cases are stricter than previously published ones and severely constrain
the structure of time-optimal sequences, allowing for an efficient numerical
search of the time-optimal solution. Our results can be used to find the
time-optimal evolution of qubit systems under the action of the considered
control set, and thus potentially increase the number of realizable unitaries
before decoherence.

$(E_t,\nabla_t)$ of an irreducible Lam\'e connection, when the elliptic curve
$X_t$ varry in the Legendre family, is parametrized by a solution $q(t)$ of the
Painlev\'e VI differential equation $P_{VI}$. We compute the variation of the

Pb(Zr0.80Ti0.20)O3, was studied by polarized-Raman scattering as a function of
temperature. Raman spectra reveal that the local structure deviates from the
average structure in both ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. We show that
the crystal possesses several, inequivalent complex domain boundaries which
show no sign of instability even 200 K above the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric
phase transition temperature TC. Two types of boundaries are addressed. The
first boundary was formed between ferroelectric domains below TC. This boundary
remained stable up to the highest measurement temperatures, and stabilized the
domains so that they had the same orientation after repeated heating and
cooling cycles. These domains transformed normally to the cubic paraelectric
phase. Another type of boundary was formed at 673 K and exhibited no signs of
instability up to 923 K. The boundary formation was reversible: it formed and
vanished between 573 and 673 K during heating and cooling, respectively. A
model in which the crystal is divided into thin slices with different Zr/Ti
ratios is proposed. The physical mechanism behind the thermal-stress-induced
structural changes is related to the different thermal expansion of the slices,
which forces the domain to grow similarly after each heating and cooling cycle.
The results are interesting for non-volatile memory development, as it implies
that the original ferroelectric state can be restored after the material has
been transformed to the paraelectric phase. It also suggests that a
low-symmetry structure, stable up to high-temperatures, can be prepared through
controlled deposition of layers with desired compositions.

machines with abilities that resemble those of animals, but the field suffers
from a lack of strong foundations. In particular, evolutionary systems are
currently assessed solely by the fitness score their evolved artifacts can
achieve for a specific task, whereas such fitness-based comparisons provide
limited insights about how the same system would evaluate on different tasks,
and its adaptive capabilities to respond to changes in fitness (e.g., from
damages to the machine, or in new situations). To counter these limitations, we
introduce the concept of ""evolvability signatures"", which picture the
post-mutation statistical distribution of both behavior diversity (how
different are the robot behaviors after a mutation?) and fitness values (how
different is the fitness after a mutation?). We tested the relevance of this
concept by evolving controllers for hexapod robot locomotion using five
different genotype-to-phenotype mappings (direct encoding, generative encoding
of open-loop and closed-loop central pattern generators, generative encoding of
neural networks, and single-unit pattern generators (SUPG)). We observed a
predictive relationship between the evolvability signature of each encoding and
the number of generations required by hexapods to adapt from incurred damages.
Our study also reveals that, across the five investigated encodings, the SUPG
scheme achieved the best evolvability signature, and was always foremost in
recovering an effective gait following robot damages. Overall, our evolvability
signatures neatly complement existing task-performance benchmarks, and pave the
way for stronger foundations for research in evolutionary robotics.

between the unresolved component of the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sky-maps and the
CMB lensing potential map reconstructed by the Planck satellite. The matter
distribution in the Universe determines the bending of light coming from the
last scattering surface. At the same time, the matter density drives the growth
history of astrophysical objects, including their capability at generating
non-thermal phenomena, which in turn give rise to gamma-ray emissions. The
Planck lensing map provides information on the integrated distribution of
matter, while the integrated history of gamma-ray emitters is imprinted in the
Fermi-LAT sky maps. We report here the first evidence of their correlation. We
find that the multipole dependence of the cross-correlation measurement is in
agreement with current models of the gamma-ray luminosity function for AGN and
star forming galaxies, with a statistical evidence of 3.0$\sigma$. Moreover,
its amplitude can in general be matched only assuming that these extra-galactic
emitters are also the bulk contribution of the measured isotopic gamma-ray
background (IGRB) intensity. This leaves little room for a big contribution
from galactic sources to the IGRB measured by Fermi-LAT, pointing toward a
direct evidence of the extragalactic origin of the IGRB.

severely constrained by electroweak symmetry breaking as well as by the
astrophysical and particle physics data. They are further constrained by the
Higgs boson mass measurement. The sparticle mass hierarchies can be used to
generate simplified models consistent with the high scale models. In this work
we consider supergravity models with universal boundary conditions for soft
parameters at the unification scale as well as supergravity models with
nonuniversalities and delineate the list of sparticle mass hierarchies for the
five lightest sparticles. Simplified models can be obtained by a truncation of
these, retaining a smaller set of lightest particles. The mass hierarchies and
their truncated versions enlarge significantly the list of simplified models
currently being used in the literature. Benchmarks for a variety of
supergravity unified models appropriate for SUSY searches at future colliders
are also presented. The signature analysis of two benchmark models has been
carried out and a discussion of the searches needed for their discovery at LHC
RUN-II is given. An analysis of the spin independent neutralino-proton cross
section exhibiting the Higgs boson mass dependence and the hierarchical
patterns is also carried out. It is seen that a knowledge of the spin
independent neutralino-proton cross section and the neutralino mass will narrow
down the list of the allowed sparticle mass hierarchies. Thus dark matter
experiments along with analyses for the LHC Run-II will provide strong clues to
the nature of symmetry breaking at the unification scale.

kept small. We achieve overall linear complexity in the number of layers, by
direct solution of the resulting block tridiagonal system. For device

$\frac{K(M-1)}{K+M-2}$. By proposing an ANA approach, it is shown that the SDOF

  Recent Advances in Cloud Radio Access Networks, 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which
all the base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central computing cloud via
digital backhaul links with finite capacities. Each user is associated with a
user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with
the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint
beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS
clustering and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization
perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the
per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility
maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models
depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over
different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS
cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the
beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, while in the latter case the
user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user
scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints.
In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using
the reweighted l1-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate
the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and
solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted
minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic
clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing
naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static
clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.

algorithm is to insert a penalty of block-sparsity, which is a mixed \$l_{2,

cost function of traditional LMS algorithm. To describe a block-sparse system
response, we first propose a Markov-Gaussian model, which can generate a kind
of system responses of arbitrary average sparsity and arbitrary average block
length using given parameters. Then we present theoretical expressions of the
steady-state misadjustment and transient convergence behavior of BS-LMS with an
appropriate group partition size for white Gaussian input data. Based on the
above results, we theoretically demonstrate that BS-LMS has much better
convergence behavior than \$l_0\$-LMS with the same small level of
misadjustment. Finally, numerical experiments verify that all of the

discovering that the relationship between the HMMs and DPs is both simple and
fundamental in nature. We show that in the limit of large crystals, the DP is a

Shockley-Frank stacking faults in 6H-SiC. While applied here to planar faulting

the first-derivative operator twice that is the same as used for the

interior stencil, a decomposition is proposed that makes the application of
such operators particularly simple. A number of novel operators are
constructed, including operators on pseudo-spectral nodal distributions and
operators that have a repeating interior stencil, but unequal nodal spacing
near boundaries. The various operators are compared to the application of the

  linear models","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (20 pages)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many applications including communications, one may encounter a linear
model where the parameter vector $\hbx$ is an integer vector in a box. To
estimate $\hbx$, a typical method is to solve a box-constrained integer least
squares (BILS) problem. However, due to its high complexity, the
box-constrained Babai integer point $\x^\sBB$ is commonly used as a suboptimal
solution. In this paper, we first derive formulas for the success probability
$P^\sBB$ of $\x^\sBB$ and the success probability $P^\sOB$ of the ordinary
Babai integer point $\x^\sOB$ when $\hbx$ is uniformly distributed over the
constraint box. Some properties of $P^\sBB$ and $P^\sOB$ and the relationship
between them are studied. Then, we investigate the effects of some column
permutation strategies on $\P^\sBB$. In addition to V-BLAST and SQRD, we also
consider the permutation strategy involved in the LLL lattice reduction, to be
referred to as LLL-P. On the one hand, we show that when the noise is
relatively small, LLL-P always increases $P^\sBB$ and argue why both V-BLAST
and SQRD often increase $P^\sBB$; and on the other hand, we show that when the
noise is relatively large, LLL-P always decreases $P^\sBB$ and argue why both
V-BLAST and SQRD often decrease $P^\sBB$. We also derive a column permutation
invariant bound on $P^\sBB$, which is an upper bound and a lower bound under
these two opposite conditions, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate our
findings. Finally, we consider a conjecture concerning $\x^\sOB$ proposed by Ma
et al. We first construct an example to show that the conjecture does not hold
in general, and then show that it does hold under some conditions.

the constraints that can be imposed on cosmic strings in each of these

recovery can be significantly improved given that part of the signal's support

problem of sparse signal recovery when partial but partly erroneous prior
knowledge of the signal's support is available. Based on the conventional
sparse Bayesian learning framework, we propose a modified two-layer
Gaussian-inverse Gamma hierarchical prior model and, moreover, an improved
three-layer hierarchical prior model. The modified two-layer model employs an
individual parameter $b_i$ for each sparsity-controlling hyperparameter
$\alpha_i$, and has the ability to place non-sparsity-encouraging priors to
those coefficients that are believed in the support set. The three-layer
hierarchical model is built on the modified two-layer prior model, with a prior
placed on the parameters $\{b_i\}$ in the third layer. Such a model enables to
automatically learn the true support from partly erroneous information through
learning the values of the parameters $\{b_i\}$. Variational Bayesian
algorithms are developed based on the proposed hierarchical prior models.

The reduced integrable hierarchy for the orbifold version of the ordinary

That of the orbifold version of the modified melting crystal model is the

$x_1,x_2>0.2$ fractions of the photon momentum. Numerical results are presented
for the case of $\gamma p$ collisions at LHeC, HERA and in the ultraperipheral
$AA$ and $pA$ collisions at the LHC. We find that the events of this kind would
be abundantly produced at the LHeC. For $\sqrt{s}=1.3$ TeV the expected rate is
$2\cdot 10^8$ events for the luminosity $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}s^{-1}$, the running
time of $10^6$ s and the transverse cutoff of $p_t>5$ GeV. This would make it
feasible to use these processes for the model independent determination of two
parton GPDs in nucleon and in nuclei. For HERA the total accumulated number of
the events is also high, but efficiency of the detection of charm seems too low
to study the process. We also find that a significant number of such double
parton interactions should be produced in $p - Pb$ and $Pb- Pb$ collisions at

light intensity images and cannot be efficiently separated from dominating

telescope performance at lower energies is to use novel photosensors with
superior photon detection efficiency (PDE). Currently the best commercially
available superbialkali photomultipliers (PMTs) have a PDE of about 30-33%,
whereas the silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs, also known as MPPC, GAPD) from
some manufacturers show a photon detection efficiency of about 40-45%. Using
these devices can lower the energy threshold of the instrument and may improve
the background rejection due to intrinsic properties of SiPMs such as a superb
single photoelectron resolution. Compared to PMTs, SiPMs are more compact, fast
in response, operate at low voltage, and are insensitive to magnetic fields.
SiPMs can be operated at high background illumination, which would allow to
operate the IACT also during partial moonlight, dusk and dawn, hence increasing
the instrument duty cycle. We are testing the SiPMs for Cherenkov telescopes

randomness may lead to deep misunderstandings of theory and wrong
interpretations of experimental results. Since during my visits (in 2013 and
2014) to IQOQI a number of students (experimenters!) asked me permanently about
foundational problems of probability and randomness, especially inter-relation
between classical and quantum structures, this year I gave two lectures on
these problems. Surprisingly the interest of experiment-oriented students to
mathematical peculiarities was very high. This (as well as permanent reminding
of prof. Zeilinger) motivated me to write a text based on these lectures which
were originally presented in the traditional black-board form. I hope that this
might be useful for students from IQOQI as well as other young physicists.

of where the masses of elementary particles come from; this particle is usually
referred to as the Higgs particle or the Higgs boson. In July 2012, this Higgs
particle was finally found experimentally, a feat accomplished by the ATLAS
Collaboration and the CMS Collaboration using the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN. It is the purpose of this review to give my personal perspective on a
brief history of the experimental search for this particle since the '80s and
finally its discovery in 2012. Besides the early searches, those at the LEP
collider at CERN, the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab, and the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN are described in some detail. This experimental discovery of
the Higgs boson is often considered to be one of the most important advances in
particle physics in the last half a century, and some of the possible
implications are briefly discussed.
