Dahmen","Decoding Spatial Complexity in Strongly Correlated Electronic Systems","6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inside the metals, semiconductors, and magnets of our everyday experience,
electrons are uniformly distributed throughout the material. By contrast,
electrons often form clumpy patterns inside of strongly correlated electronic
systems (SCES) such as colossal magnetoresistance materials and high
temperature superconductors. In copper-oxide based high temperature
superconductors, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has detected an electron
nematic on the surface of the material, in which the electrons form nanoscale
structures which break the rotational symmetry of the host crystal. These
structures may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of high temperature
superconductivity in these materials, but only if the nematic also exists
throughout the entire bulk of the material. Using newly developed methods for
decoding these surface structures, we find that the nematic indeed persists
throughout the bulk of the material. We furthermore find that the intricate
pattern formation is set by a delicate balance among disorder, interactions,
and material anisotropy, leading to a fractal nature of the cluster pattern.
The methods we have developed can be extended to many other surface probes and
materials, enabling surface probes to determine whether surface structures are
confined only to the surface, or whether they extend throughout the material.

$W^*$-correspondence $E$. These algebras were introduced in 2004, ~\cite{MuS3},
by P. Muhly and B. Solel, and generalize the classical Hardy algebra of the
unit disc $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$. As a special case one obtains also the
algebra $\mathcal{F}^{\infty}$ of Popescu, which is $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{C}^n)$
in our setting.
  In this paper we view the algebra $H^\infty(E)$ as acting on a Hilbert space
via an induced representation $\rho(H^{\infty}(E))$, and we study the
reflexivity of $\rho(H^{\infty}(E))$. This question was studied by A. Arias and
G. Popescu in the context of the algebra $\mathcal{F}^{\infty}$, and by other
authors in several other special cases. As it will be clear from our work, the
extension to the case of a general $W^*$-correspondence $E$ over a general
$W^*$-algebra $M$ requires new techniques and approach.
  We obtain some partial results in the general case and we turn to the case of
a correspondence over factor. Under some additional assumptions on the
representation $\pi:M\rightarrow B(H)$ we show that $\rho_\pi(H^{\infty}(E))$
is reflexive. Then we apply these results to analytic crossed products
$\rho(H^{\infty}(\ _{\alpha}M))$ and obtain their reflexivity for any
automorphism $\alpha\in Aut(M)$ whenever $M$ is a factor. Finally, we show also
the reflexivity of the compression of the Hardy algebra to a suitable
coinvariant subspace $\mathfrak{M}$, which may be thought of as a generalized
symmetric Fock space.

a sophisticated, 1D, time-steady model of the solar wind with turbulence
dissipation. By varying the coronal magnetic field, they obtain, for a single
choice of wave properties, a realistic range of slow and fast wind conditions
with a sharp latitudinal transition between the two streams. Using a 1D,
time-dependent model of the solar wind of Lionello et al. (2014), which
incorporates turbulent dissipation of Alfv\'en waves to provide heating and
acceleration of the plasma, we have explored a similar configuration, obtaining
qualitatively equivalent results. However, our calculations suggest that the

disrupted in multidimensional MHD simulations by the requirement of transverse

considering the two cases of a constant effect and of an effect that increases
linearly in time, as the rotation of polarization induced by birefringence
accumulates during photon propagation. Both cases result into a mixing of E and
B modes before lensing effects take place, thus leading to the fact that
lensing is acting on spectra that are already mixed because of birefringence.
Moreover, if the polarization rotation angle increases during propagation,
birefringence affects more the large scales that the small scales. We put
constraints on the two cases using data from WMAP 9yr and BICEP 2013 and
compare these results with the constraints obtained when the usual procedure of
rotating the final power spectra is adopted, finding that this dataset
combination is unable to distinguish between effects, but it nevertheless hints
for a non vanishing value of the polarization rotation angle. We also forecast
the sensitivity that will be obtained using data from Planck and PolarBear,
highlighting how this combination is capable to rule out a vanishing
birefringence angle, but still unable to distinguish the different scenarios.
Nevertheless, we find that the combination of Planck and PolarBear is sensitive
enough to highlight the existence of degeneracies between birefringence
rotation and gravitational lensing of CMB photons, possibly leading to false
detection of non standard lensing effects if birefringence is neglected.

photometric variability with a number of frequencies. Aims. The aim of this
paper is to characterize the variations in spectroscopy and investigate their
origin. Methods. To sample its short-term variability, HD47129 was intensively
monitored during two spectroscopic campaigns of six nights each. The spectra
were disentangled and Fourier analyses were performed to determine possible
periodicities and to investigate the wavelength dependence of the phase
constant and the amplitude of the periodicities. Results. Complex line profile
variations are observed. Frequencies near 1.65, 0.82, and 0.37 d^-1 are
detected consistently in the He i 4471, He ii 4542, and N iii 4510-4518 lines.
These frequencies are consistent with those of the strongest signals detected
in photometry. The possibilities that these variations stem from pulsations, a
recently detected magnetic field or tidal interactions are discussed.
Conclusions. Whilst all three scenarios have their strengths, none of them can
currently account for all the observed properties of the line profile
variations.

from $G$, independently from all other vertices. We show that if
$\delta(G)=\omega(\log n)$ and $k\geq 2$, then the following holds for every

typical member of $\mathcal G_{\text{$k$-out}}(G)$ has average degree roughly

applications of this; for example, we use this result to prove that for

contains $(1-o(1))np/46$ edge-disjoint rainbow Hamilton cycles. More generally,
using a recent result of Frieze and Johansson, the same method allows us to
prove that if $G$ has minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq (1+\varepsilon)n/2$, then
there exist functions $c=O(n)$ and $t=\Theta(np)$ (depending on $\varepsilon$)

and uses the stored energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We
consider a simple transmission policy, which accounts for the fact that in
practice the EH node may not have knowledge of the EH profile nor of the UL
channel state information. In particular, in each time slot, the EH node
transmits with either a constant desired power or a lower power if not enough
energy is available in its energy buffer. For this simple policy, we use the
theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to analyze the limiting
distribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size energy buffers.
Moreover, we take into account imperfections of the energy buffer and the
circuit power consumption of the EH node. For a Rayleigh fading DL channel, we
provide the limiting distribution of the energy buffer content in closed form.
In addition, we analyze the average error rate and the outage probability of a
Rayleigh faded UL channel and show that the diversity order is not affected by
the finite capacity of the energy buffer. Our results reveal that the optimal
desired transmit power by the EH node is always less than the average harvested

flows as well as the dynamics close to a completely elliptic periodic point of
a symplectic diffeomorphism where the torsion is positive definite . Two
aspects of this theory are called the Aubry-Mather theory and the weak KAM

results concerning the link between different notions for minimizing measures
for twisting dynamics: their Lyapunov exponents; their Oseledet's splitting;
the shape of their support. The main question in which we are interested is:
given some minimizing measure of a conservative twisting dynamics, is there a

of stochastic dynamical systems with multiple time scales, replacing fast
variables with statistically equivalent stochastic processes in order to
analyze variables evolving on the slow time scale. These procedures have been
studied extensively for systems driven by Gaussian noise, but very little
attention has been given to the case of \alpha-stable noise forcing which
arises naturally from heavy-tailed stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we
study nonlinear fast-slow stochastic dynamical systems in which the fast
variables are driven by additive \alpha-stable noise perturbations, and the
slow variables depend linearly on the fast variables. Using a combination of
perturbation methods and Fourier analysis, we derive stochastic averaging
approximations for the statistical contributions of the fast variables to the
slow variables. In the case that the diffusion term of the reduced model
depends on the state of the slow variable, we show that this term is
interpreted in terms of the Marcus calculus. For the case \alpha = 2, which
corresponds to Gaussian noise, the results are consistent with previous results
for stochastic averaging in the Gaussian case. Although the main results are
derived analytically for 1 < \alpha < 2, we provide evidence of their validity
for \alpha < 1 with numerical examples. We numerically simulate both linear and
nonlinear systems and the corresponding reduced models demonstrating good
agreement for their stationary distributions and temporal dependence
properties.

the surrounding medium. However, most of the recent literature has neglected
the electron transfer mechanism occurring amongst living cells, and its role in
cell-cell communication. Each cell relies on a continuous flow of electrons
from its electron donor to its electron acceptor through the electron transport
chain to produce energy in the form of the molecule adenosine triphosphate, and
to sustain the cell's vital operations and functions. While the importance of
biological electron transfer is well-known for individual cells, the past
decade has also brought about remarkable discoveries of multi-cellular
microbial communities that transfer electrons between cells and across
centimeter length scales, e.g., biofilms and multi-cellular bacterial cables.
These experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of
electron-based communications networks in microbial communities, which may
coexist with the more well-known communication strategies based on molecular
diffusion, while benefiting from a much shorter communication delay. This paper
develops a stochastic model that links the electron transfer mechanism to the
energetic state of the cell. The model is also extensible to larger
communities, by allowing for electron exchange between neighboring cells.
Moreover, the parameters of the stochastic model are fit to experimental data
available in the literature, and are shown to provide a good fit.

which compares the solution obtained by the algorithm to that obtained by an
online adversary for the worst possible input sequence. Often this measure
turns out to be too pessimistic, and one popular approach especially for
scheduling problems has been that of ""resource augmentation"" which was first
proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs. Although resource augmentation has been
very successful in dealing with a variety of objective functions, there are
problems for which even a (arbitrary) constant speedup cannot lead to a
constant competitive algorithm. In this paper we propose a ""rejection model""
which requires no resource augmentation but which permits the online algorithm
to not serve an epsilon-fraction of the requests.
  The problems considered in this paper are in the restricted assignment
setting where each job can be assigned only to a subset of machines. For the
load balancing problem where the objective is to minimize the maximum load on
any machine, we give $O(\log^2 1/\eps)$-competitive algorithm which rejects at
most an $\eps$-fraction of the jobs. For the problem of minimizing the maximum
weighted flow-time, we give an $O(1/\eps^4)$-competitive algorithm which can
reject at most an $\eps$-fraction of the jobs by weight. We also extend this
result to a more general setting where the weights of a job for measuring its
weighted flow-time and its contribution towards total allowed rejection weight
are different. This is useful, for instance, when we consider the objective of
minimizing the maximum stretch. We obtain an $O(1/\eps^6)$-competitive
algorithm in this case.
  Our algorithms are immediate dispatch, though they may not be immediate
reject. All these problems have very strong lower bounds in the speed
augmentation model.

inter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput of
each flow. However, the corresponding scheduling solution (when assuming
dynamic arrivals instead and requiring bounded delay) is still nascent.
  For the 2-flow downlink scenario, we propose the first opportunistic INC +
scheduling solution that is provably optimal for time-varying channels, i.e.,
the corresponding stability region matches the optimal Shannon capacity.
Specifically, we first introduce a new binary INC operation, which is
distinctly different from the traditional wisdom of XORing two overheard
packets. We then develop a queue-length-based scheduling scheme, which, with
the help of the new INC operation, can robustly and optimally adapt to
time-varying channel quality. We then show that the proposed algorithm can be
easily extended for rate adaptation and it again robustly achieves the optimal
throughput. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling scheme for stochastic
processing networks (SPNs) with random departure, which relaxes the assumption
of deterministic departure in the existing results. The new SPN scheduler could
thus further broaden the applications of SPN scheduling to other real-world
scenarios.

the inclusion of target data from multiple states yields a less state-dependent

thermodynamic states than the standard IBI method. The inclusion of target data
from multiple states forces the algorithm to sample regions of potential phase
space that match the radial distribution function at multiple state points,
thus producing a derived potential that is more representative of the
underlying potential interactions. It is shown that the algorithm is able to
converge to the true potential for a system where the underlying potential is
known. It is also shown that potentials derived via the proposed method better
predict the behavior of n-alkane chains than those derived via the standard
method. Additionally, through the examination of alkane monolayers, it is shown
that the relative weight given to each state in the fitting procedure can
impact bulk system properties, allowing the potentials to be further tuned in

electroweak phase transition in the early Universe and significant clues on new
physics coupling with the Higgs field directly. This measurement has been
suggested to be pursued mainly via the $pp \to hh$ production. In this letter,
we propose a new strategy to do that, i.e., via the $pp \to t \bar t hh $
production. Because of its positive correlation with the rescaled tri-Higgs
coupling $\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm SM}}$ (in comparison to a negative one
for the $pp \to hh$ production) in the neighborhood of
$\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm SM}} \sim 1$, the $pp \to t\bar t hh$ production
complements the $pp \to hh$ one in measuring di-Higgs physics, particularly for
$\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{\rm SM}}>1$, at both the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)
and a next-generation $pp$-collider. As an illustration, we work on the process
$pp\to t\bar thh \to t\bar t b\bar b b\bar b$. We show that a statistical
significance of $> 2.0 \sigma$ at the HL-LHC, comparable to that of the $pp \to
hh \to b\bar b \gamma\gamma$ channel, and a statistical significance of $\sim 5
\sigma$ at a 100 TeV $pp$-collider, with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of data, are achievable

of four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theories using semiclassical methods. These
models have one or more compact directions, and much of the analysis is based
on the physics of finite-temperature gauge theories. The topology $R^{3}\times
S^{1}$ has been most often studied, using a small compactification
circumference $L$ such that the running coupling $g^{2}\left(L\right)$ is
small. The gauge action is modified by a double-trace Polyakov loop deformation
term, or by the addition of periodic adjoint fermions. The additional terms act
to preserve $Z(N)$ symmetry and thus confinement. An area law for Wilson loops
is induced by a monopole condensate. In the continuum, the string tension can
be computed analytically from topological effects. Lattice models display
similar behavior, but the theoretical analysis of topological effects is based
on Abelian lattice duality rather than on semiclassical arguments. In both

the maximal Abelian subgroup $U(1)^{N-1}$ while maintaining $Z(N)$ symmetry.

Using an ensemble of simulations in an isochrone potential where the actions
and frequencies are known, we derive an empirical recipe for the evolving
satellite mass and the corresponding mass loss rate, and the ejection
conditions of the stream material. The resulting stream can then be quickly
generated either with direct orbital integration, or by using the action-angle
formalism. The model naturally produces streaky features within the stream.
These are formed due to the radial oscillation of the progenitor and the bursts
of stars emitted near pericenter, rather than clumping at particular
oscillation phases as sometimes suggested. When detectable, these streaky
features are a reliable diagnostic for the stream's direction of motion and
encode other information on the progenitor and its orbit. We show several tests
of the recipe in alternate potentials, including a case with a chaotic
progenitor orbit which displays a marked effect on the width of the stream.
Although the specific ejection recipe may need adjusting when elements such as
the orbit or satellite density profile are changed significantly, our examples
suggest that model tidal streams can be quickly and accurately generated by
models of this general type for use in Bayesian sampling.

that a higher success rate of identifying defectors does not necessarily favor
cooperative behavior. These results are rooted in the spontaneous emergence of
cycling dominance and spatial patterns that give rise to fascinating phase
transitions, which in turn reveal the hidden complexity behind the evolution of

is highly uncertain. For fields at low or mid-range of observational estimates
(10--100 $\mu$G), no observable signal is possible. For fields at the high
range of observational estimates (a pervasive poloidal mG field over the
central 150 pc) it is possible to generate sufficient signal to explain recent
observations of a 3.5 keV line in the galactic centre. In this scenario, the
galactic centre line signal comes predominantly from the region with $z > 20$
pc, reconciling the results from the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes.
The dark matter to ALP to photon scenario also naturally predicts the
non-observation of the 3.5 keV line in stacked galaxy spectra. We further

the magnetic field in fast rotating protoneutron stars. The diffusion of
neutrinos trapped in the PNS induces a transport of momentum, which can be
modelled as a viscosity on length-scales longer than the neutrino mean free
path. This neutrino-viscosity can slow down the growth of MRI modes to such an
extent that a minimum initial magnetic field strength of $\gtrsim 10^{12}\,

potentially affect the explosion. It is uncertain whether the magnetic field of
fast rotating progenitor cores is strong enough to yield such an initial
magnetic field in PNS. At MRI wavelengths shorter than the neutrino mean free
path, on the other hand, neutrino radiation does not act as a viscosity but
rather induces a drag on the velocity with a damping rate independent of the

our analytical results to the PNS structure from a one-dimensional numerical

Methods: We obtained r-band polarimetric observations with the Telescopio

Optical Telescope (NOT) equipped with the ALFOSC instrument, covering ~ 2 hours
and ~ 0.5 hours observations, respectively. We carried out low resolution
spectroscopy of the system using the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with
FORS1 for ~ 1.5 hours (16 spectra covering the range 430-800 nm). Results: The
polarimetric analysis performed starting from the TNG dataset revealed a
polarisation degree in the r-band of 3 % +/- 1 %. From the NOT dataset, due to
the lower S/N ratio, we could obtain only a 3 sigma upper limit of 3.4 %. From
the joining of a spectroscopic and photometric analysis, through the study of
the equivalent width variations of the CII 724 nm line and the r-band light
curve, we could find a hint of a ~ 45 min periodicity. Conclusions: A
polarisation degree P of ~ 3 % in the r-band is consistent with the emission of
a relativistic particle jet, which is supposed to emit intrinsically linearly
polarised synchrotron radiation. Since no variations of P with time have been
detected, and the accretion disc of the system does not contain ionised
hydrogen, scattering by free electrons in the accretion disc has been rejected.
The period of ~ 45 min obtained through the analysis of the system light curve
and of the equivalent width variations of the selected spectral line is
probably linked to the presence of a hot spot or a superhump in the accretion
disc, and lead to an orbital period > 1 hour for the binary system.

the density power spectrum on small scales, compared to the CMB, while also
satisfying current bounds on tensor modes. Here we study hybrid inflation with
$N$ waterfall fields sharing a global $SO(N)$ symmetry. The inclusion of many
waterfall fields has the obvious advantage of avoiding topologically stable
defects for $N>3$. We find that it also has another advantage: it is easier to
engineer models that can simultaneously (i) be compatible with constraints on
the primordial spectral index, which tends to otherwise disfavor hybrid models,
and (ii) produce a spike on astrophysically large length scales. The latter may
have significant consequences, possibly seeding the formation of
astrophysically large black holes. We calculate correlation functions of the
time-delay, a measure of density perturbations, produced by the waterfall
fields, as a convergent power series in both $1/N$ and the field's correlation
function $\Delta(x)$. We show that for large $N$, the two-point function is
$<\delta t({\bf x})\,\delta t({\bf 0})>\,\propto\Delta^2(|{\bf x}|)/N$ and the
three-point function is $<\delta t({\bf x})\,\delta t({\bf y})\,\delta t({\bf

In accordance with the central limit theorem, the density perturbations on the

images at 250, 350, and 500 micron as a part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster
Survey (HeViCS). The source positions are determined by estimating the
likelihood to be a real source for each peak on the maps and the flux densities
are estimated using the sourceExtractorTimeline, a timeline-based point source
fitter. Afterwards, each source is subtracted from the maps, removing a
Gaussian function in every position with the full width half maximum equal to
that estimated in sourceExtractorTimeline. This procedure improves the
robustness of our algorithm in terms of source identification. The HeViCS
catalogs contain about 52000, 42200, and 18700 sources selected at 250, 350,
and 500 micron above 3sigma and are ~ 75%, 62%, and 50% complete at flux
densities of 20 mJy at 250, 350, 500 micron, respectively. We then measured
source number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron and we also cross-correlated
the catalogs with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the redshift
distribution of the nearby sources. From this cross-correlation, we select
~2000 sources with reliable fluxes and a high signal-to-noise ratio, finding an
average redshift z~0.3+/-0.22. The number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron
show an increase in the slope below 200 mJy, indicating a strong evolution in
number of density for galaxies at these fluxes. In general, models tend to
overpredict the counts at brighter flux densities, underlying the importance of
studying the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution to refine
the theoretical recipes of the models. Our iterative method for source
identification allowed the detection of a family of 500 micron sources that are

Keck Observatory. G2 is a dusty red object associated with gas that shows tidal
interactions as it nears closest approach with the Galaxy's central black hole.
Our observations, conducted as G2 passed through periapse, were designed to
test the proposal that G2 is a 3 earth mass gas cloud. Such a cloud should be
tidally disrupted during periapse passage. The data were obtained using the
Keck II laser guide star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) and the facility
near-infrared camera (NIRC2) through the K' [2.1 $\mu$m] and L' [3.8 $\mu$m]
broadband filters. Several results emerge from these observations: 1) G2 has
survived its closest approach to the black hole as a compact, unresolved source
at L'; 2) G2's L' brightness measurements are consistent with those over the
last decade; 3) G2's motion continues to be consistent with a Keplerian model.
These results rule out G2 as a pure gas cloud and imply that G2 has a central
star. This star has a luminosity of $\sim$30 $L_{\odot} $ and is surrounded by
a large ($\sim$2.6 AU) optically thick dust shell. The differences between the
L' and Br-$\gamma$ observations can be understood with a model in which L' and
Br-$\gamma$ emission arises primarily from internal and external heating,
respectively. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger product and will
ultimately appear similar to the B-stars that are tightly clustered around the
black hole (the so-called S-star cluster).

tidally stripping stellar features beyond tidal radius, in the form of tidal

substructures are likely to be associated with the effect of the dynamic
interaction with the Galaxy and the cluster space motion. The observed radial
density profiles of the four globular clusters also describe the extended
substructures; they depart from theoretical King and Wilson models and have an
overdensity feature with a break in a slope of profile at the outer region of
clusters. The observed results could imply that four globular clusters in the
Galactic bulge region have experienced strong environmental effect such as
tidal force or bulge or disk shock of the Galaxy in the dynamical evolution of

these elements from a short-duration gamma-ray burst. The hypothesis of a NS
merger origin is reinforced by a theoretical update of nucleosynthesis in NS
mergers successful in yielding r-process nuclides with A>130. On the other
hand, whether the origin of light r-process elements are associated with
nucleosynthesis in NS merger events remains unclear. We find a signature of
nucleosynthesis in NS mergers from peculiar chemical abundances of stars
belonging to the Galactic globular cluster M15. This finding combined with the
recent nucleosynthesis results implies a potential diversity of nucleosynthesis
in NS mergers. Based on these considerations, we are successful in the
interpretation of an observed correlation between [light r-process/Eu] and
[Eu/Fe] among Galactic halo stars and accordingly narrow down the role of
supernova nucleosynthesis in the r-process production site. We conclude that
the tight correlation by a large fraction of halo stars is attributable to the
fact that core-collapse supernovae produce light r-process elements while heavy
r-process elements such as Eu and Ba are produced by NS mergers. On the other
hand, stars in the outlier, composed of r-enhanced stars ([Eu/Fe]>+1) such as

problem, which is largely due to our poor understanding of initial seed
magnetic fields. If the seed magnetic fields have primordial origins, it is
likely that large-scale pervasive magnetic fields were present before the
formation of the large-scale structure. On the other hand, if they were ejected
from astrophysical bodies, they were highly localized in space at the time of
injection. In this paper, using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic
Prandtl number fluids, we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields. The
hydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in the intracluster
medium (ICM) is believed to be less than $O(10^2)$, while the magnetic Reynolds
number can be much larger than that. In this case, if the seed magnetic fields
have primordial origins, they should be stronger than $O(10^{-11})$G, which is
very close to the upper limit of $O(10^{-9})$G set by the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) observations. On the other hand, if the seed magnetic fields
were ejected from astrophysical bodies, any seed magnetic fields stronger than
$O(10^{-9})$G can safely magnetize the intracluster medium. Therefore, it is
less likely that primordial magnetic fields are the direct origin of

approaches bulk strength. The interfacial fracture energy $G_I$ is calculated
by coupling the simulation results to a continuum fracture mechanics model. As
in experiment, $G_I$ increases as $t^{1/2}$ before saturating at the average
bulk fracture energy $G_b$. As in previous simulations of shear strength,
saturation coincides with the recovery of the bulk entanglement density. Before
saturation, $G_I$ is proportional to the areal density of interfacial
entanglements. Immiscibiltiy limits interdiffusion and thus suppresses
entanglements at the interface. Even small degrees of immisciblity reduce
interfacial entanglements enough that failure occurs by chain pullout and $G_I
\ll G_b$.

challenge. This challenge involves fields like optical tweezing, Casimir
forces, integrated optics, bio-physics, and many others. Photonic ""robots""

light-activated devices increases, structural disorder unavoidably occurs and,
correspondingly, light scattering, diffusion and localization. Are
optically-driven mechanical forces affected by disorder-induced effects? A
possible hypothesis is that light scattering reduces the optomechanical
interaction. Conversely, we show that disorder is a mechanism that radically
enhances the mechanical effect of light. We determine the link between optical
pressure and the light diffusion coefficient, and unveil that when the Thouless
conductivity becomes smaller than the unity, at the so-called Anderson
transition, optical forces and their statistical fluctuations reach a maximum.
Recent advances in photonics demonstrate the possibility of harnessing disorder
for fundamental physics and applications. Designing randomness allows new
materials with innovative optical properties. Here we show that disorder and

selfish utility-maximizing agents has received much attention lately. Privacy
concerns are often modeled by altering the utility functions of agents to
consider also their privacy loss. Such privacy aware agents prefer to take a
randomized strategy even in very simple games in which non-privacy aware agents
play pure strategies. In some cases, the behavior of privacy aware agents
follows the framework of Randomized Response, a well-known mechanism that
preserves differential privacy.
  Our work is aimed at better understanding the behavior of agents in settings
where their privacy concerns are explicitly given. We consider a toy setting
where agent A, in an attempt to discover the secret type of agent B, offers B a
gift that one type of B agent likes and the other type dislikes. As opposed to
previous works, B's incentive to keep her type a secret isn't the result of
""hardwiring"" B's utility function to consider privacy, but rather takes the
form of a payment between B and A. We investigate three different types of
payment functions and analyze B's behavior in each of the resulting games. As
we show, under some payments, B's behavior is very different than the behavior
of agents with hardwired privacy concerns and might even be deterministic.
Under a different payment we show that B's BNE strategy does fall into the
framework of Randomized Response.

treated exactly within the limitations of the model. The joint-energy spectra

as interference patterns in the JES. The photoelectron spectrum and the nuclear
energy spectrum is obtained by integration of the JES. Without the JES, the
photoelectron spectrum itself is shown to be inadequate for the observation of
the dynamic interference effect. The resulting JES are analyzed in terms of two
models. In one model the wave function is expanded in terms of the ""essential""
states of the system, consisting of the ground state and the continuum states.

equation, which includes the effects of the Kerr nonlinearity and amplified

the absence of dispersion, this channel behaves as a collection of parallel
per-sample channels. The conditional probability density function of the
nonlinear per-sample channels is derived using both a sum-product and a
Fokker-Planck differential equation approach. It is shown that, for a fixed
noise power, the per-sample capacity grows unboundedly with input signal. The
channel can be partitioned into amplitude and phase subchannels, and it is
shown that the contribution to the total capacity of the phase channel declines
for large input powers. It is found that a two-dimensional distribution with a
half-Gaussian profile on the amplitude and uniform phase provides a lower bound
for the zero-dispersion optical fiber channel, which is simple and
asymptotically capacity-achieving at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A
lower bound on the capacity is also derived in the medium-SNR region. The exact
capacity subject to peak and average power constraints is numerically
quantified using dense multiple ring modulation formats. The differential model
underlying the zero-dispersion channel is reduced to an algebraic model, which
is more tractable for digital communication studies, and in particular it
provides a relation between the zero-dispersion optical channel and a $2 \times
2$ multiple-input multiple-output Rician fading channel. It appears that the
structure of the capacity-achieving input distribution resembles that of the

identify coefficients in the PC expansion via solution to a least-squares
regression problem. We present a related analysis which guarantees a mean
square convergence using a coherence parameter of the sampled PC basis that may
be both analytically bounded and computationally estimated. Utilizing
asymptotic results for orthogonal polynomials, we bound the coherence parameter
for polynomials of Hermite and Legendre type under each respective natural
sampling distribution. In both polynomial bases we identify an importance
sampling distribution which yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order
of the PC basis. For more general orthonormal bases, we propose the
coherence-optimal sampling: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, which directly
uses the basis functions under consideration to achieve a statistical
optimality among all such sampling schemes with identical support, and which
guarantees recovery with a number of samples that is, up to logarithmic
factors, linear in the number of basis functions considered. We demonstrate
these different sampling strategies numerically in both high-order and
high-dimensional manufactured PC expansions. In addition, the quality of each
sampling method is compared in the identification of solutions to two

  Abstract",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional anomaly detection on social media mostly focuses on individual
point anomalies while anomalous phenomena usually occur in groups. Therefore it
is valuable to study the collective behavior of individuals and detect group
anomalies. Existing group anomaly detection approaches rely on the assumption
that the groups are known, which can hardly be true in real world social media
applications. In this paper, we take a generative approach by proposing a
hierarchical Bayes model: Group Latent Anomaly Detection (GLAD) model. GLAD
takes both pair-wise and point-wise data as input, automatically infers the
groups and detects group anomalies simultaneously. To account for the dynamic
properties of the social media data, we further generalize GLAD to its dynamic
extension d-GLAD. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our models on
both synthetic and real world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that
our approach is effective and robust in discovering latent groups and detecting
group anomalies.

minimal input is required to describe the ships geometry. A surface

three-dimensional model. No three-dimensional gridding is required. The AMR
portion of the numerical algorithm automatically clusters grid points near the
ship in regions where wave breaking, spray formation, and air entrainment
occur. Away from the ship, where the flow is less turbulent, the mesh is
coarser. The numerical computations are implemented using parallel algorithms.
Together, the ease of input and usage, the ability to resolve complex
free-surface phenomena, and the speed of the numerical algorithms provide a
robust capability for simulating the free-surface disturbances near a ship.

probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which
provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space,
making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with
respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past
experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in
individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more
opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of
the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of
dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing
query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom
humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based
planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments
with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that
Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning

(Si). The role of the central-cell correction is studied by implementing both
the static and the non-static dielectric screenings of the donor potential, and
by including the effect of the lattice strain close to the donor site. The
dielectric screening of the donor potential tunes the value of the quadratic
Stark shift parameter ($\eta_2$) from -1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-3} \mu$m$^2$/V$^2$
for the static dielectric screening to -1.72 $\times$ 10$^{-3} \mu$m$^2$/V$^2$
for the non-static dielectric screening. The effect of lattice strain,
implemented by a 3.2% change in the As-Si nearest-neighbour bond length,
further shifts the value of $\eta_2$ to -1.87 $\times$ 10$^{-3}
\mu$m$^2$/V$^2$, resulting in an excellent agreement of theory with the
experimentally measured value of -1.9 $\pm$ 0.2 $\times$ 10$^{-3}

converges (in distribution) to the Weibull distribution, whereas that of the
right RIV converges to the Gumbel distribution. By adopting the RIV framework,
we bring to forefront that the current practice of using eigenvalues for RIC

whose initiation is clearly observed in low corona with high-cadence,
high-resolution EUV images, providing us a rare opportunity to witness the
early evolution of an energetic CME in detail. The eruption starts with a slow
expansion of cool overlying loops (~1 MK) following a jet-like event in the
periphery of the active region. Underneath the expanding loop system a reverse
S-shaped dimming is seen immediately above the brightening active region in hot
EUV passbands. The dimming is associated with a rising diffuse arch (~6 MK),
which we interpret as a preexistent, high-lying flux rope. This is followed by
the arising of a double hot channel (~10 MK) from the core of the active
region. The higher structures rise earlier and faster than lower ones, with the
leading front undergoing extremely rapid acceleration up to 35 km s$^2$. This
suggests that the torus instability is the major eruption mechanism and that it
is the high-lying flux rope rather than the hot channels that drives the
eruption. The compression of coronal plasmas skirting and overlying the
expanding loop system, whose aspect ratio $h/r$ increases with time as a result
of the rapid upward acceleration, plays a significant role in driving an
outward-propagating global EUV wave and a sunward-propagating local EUV wave,
respectively.

Dependent distribution (TMD) studies at a future multi-purpose fixed-target
experiment using the proton or lead ion LHC beams extracted by a bent crystal.
The LHC multi-TeV beams allow for the most energetic fixed-target experiments
ever performed, opening new domains of particle and nuclear physics and
complementing that of collider physics, in particular that of RHIC and the EIC
projects. The luminosity achievable with AFTER@LHC using typical targets would
surpass that of RHIC by more that 3 orders of magnitude in a similar energy
region. In unpolarised proton-proton collisions, AFTER@LHC allows for
measurements of TMDs such as the Boer-Mulders quark distributions, the
distribution of unpolarised and linearly polarised gluons in unpolarised
protons. Using the polarisation of hydrogen and nuclear targets, one can
measure transverse single-spin asymmetries of quark and gluon sensitive probes,
such as, respectively, Drell-Yan pair and quarkonium production. The
fixed-target mode has the advantage to allow for measurements in the
target-rapidity region, namely at large x^uparrow in the polarised nucleon.
Overall, this allows for an ambitious spin program which we outline here.

weighted power consumption of SU sessions, with a minimum PU transmission rate

highly challenging due to the nonconvex PU rate constraint. We propose a

a heuristic primal recovery method. We further develop a distributed algorithm
to jointly optimize covariance matrix at each transmitting SU node, bandwidth
allocation at each SU link, rate control at each session source and
multihop/multi-path routing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the
performance of the proposed distributed algorithm is close to that of the

by generalizing the idea of the coloring problem in graph theory to complex
networks. In our method, each node in a network is colored by one kind of color
and nodes with the same color are sorted into an independent set. Then, for a
given centrality index, the nodes with the highest centrality in an independent
set are chosen as multiple spreaders. Comparing this approach with the
traditional method, in which nodes with the highest centrality from the
\emph{entire} network perspective are chosen, we find that our method is more
effective in accelerating the spreading process and maximizing the spreading
coverage than the traditional method, no matter in network models or in real
social networks. Meanwhile, the low computational complexity of the coloring
algorithm guarantees the potential applications of our method.

the recent advances in spoofing detection, current solutions often rely on
domain knowledge, specific biometric reading systems, and attack types. We
assume a very limited knowledge about biometric spoofing at the sensor to
derive outstanding spoofing detection systems for iris, face, and fingerprint
modalities based on two deep learning approaches. The first approach consists
of learning suitable convolutional network architectures for each domain, while
the second approach focuses on learning the weights of the network via
back-propagation. We consider nine biometric spoofing benchmarks --- each one
containing real and fake samples of a given biometric modality and attack type
--- and learn deep representations for each benchmark by combining and
contrasting the two learning approaches. This strategy not only provides better
comprehension of how these approaches interplay, but also creates systems that
exceed the best known results in eight out of the nine benchmarks. The results
strongly indicate that spoofing detection systems based on convolutional

major interest in helioseismology. Here we apply techniques of Full Waveform
Inversion (FWI) to synthetic data to test flow inversions. In this idealized
setup, we do not model seismic realization noise, training the focus entirely
on the problem of whether a chosen supergranulation flow model can be
seismically recovered. We define the misfit functional as a sum of L_2 norm
deviations in travel times between prediction and observation, as measured
using short-distance f and p_1 filtered and large-distance unfiltered $p$
modes. FWI allows for the introduction of measurements of choice and
iteratively improving the background model, while monitoring the evolution of
the misfit in all desired categories. Although the misfit is seen to uniformly
reduce in all categories, convergence to the true model is very slow, possibly
because it is trapped in a local minimum. The primary source of error is
inaccurate depth localization, which, owing to density stratification, leads to
wrong ratios of horizontal and vertical flow velocities (`cross talk'). In the
present formulation, the lack of sufficient temporal frequency and spatial
resolution makes it difficult to accurately localise flow profiles at depth. We
therefore suggest that the most efficient way to discover the global minimum is
to perform a probabilistic forward search, involving calculating the misfit
associated with a broad range of models (generated, for instance, by a
Monte-Carlo algorithm) and locating the deepest minimum. Such techniques
possess the added advantage of being able to quantify model uncertainty as well
as realization noise (data uncertainty).

the change in the magnetic ground state from the ferromagnetic (FM) state at

the stripe-type AFM state with the AFM moment $m_{\rm AFM} \perp c$-axis and
changes by magnetic field perpendicular to $c$-axis. In addition, the

who pays for both total energy consumed (\$/kWh, including peak and off-peak
rates) and the peak rate of consumption in a month (a demand charge) (\$/kW).
The cost of electricity for the provider is based on a combination of capacity
costs (\$/kW) and fuel costs (\$/kWh). In the optimal thermostat programming
problem, the user minimizes the amount paid for electricity while staying
within a pre-defined temperature range. The user has access to energy storage
in the form of thermal capacitance of the interior structure of the building.
The provider sets prices designed to minimize the total cost of producing
electricity while meeting the needs of the user. To solve the user-problem, we
use a variant of dynamic programming. To solve the provider-problem, we use a
descent algorithm coupled with our dynamic programming code - yielding optimal
on-peak, off-peak and demand prices. We show that thermal storage and optimal

of the filament. The rising of the filament triggered two B-class flares at the
upper part of the filament. As the bright material was injected into the
filament from the sites of the flares, the filament exhibited a rapid uplift
accompanying the counterclockwise rotation of the filament body. From the
expansion of the filament, we can see that the filament is consisted of twisted
magnetic field lines. The total twist of the filament is at least 5$\pi$
obtained by using time slice method. According to the morphology change during
the filament eruption, it is found that the active-region filament was a
twisted flux rope and its unwinding motion was like a solar tornado. We also
find that there was a continuous magnetic helicity injection before and during
the filament eruption. It is confirmed that magnetic helicity can be
transferred from the photosphere to the filament. Using the extrapolated
potential fields, the average decay index of the background magnetic fields
over the filament is 0.91. Consequently, these findings imply that the
mechanism of solar filament eruption could be due to the kink instability and

that turbulent clustering significantly enhances the collision rate for
particles of similar sizes with tau_p corresponding to the inertial range of
the flow. If the friction time, tau_p,h, of the larger particle is in the
inertial range, the collision kernel per unit cross section increases with
increasing friction time, tau_p,l, of the smaller particle, and reaches the
maximum at tau_p,l = tau_p,h, where the clustering effect peaks. This feature
is not captured by the commonly-used kernel formula, which neglects the effect
of clustering. We argue that turbulent clustering helps alleviate the bouncing
barrier problem for planetesimal formation. We also investigate the collision
velocity statistics using a collision-rate weighting factor to account for
higher collision frequency for particle pairs with larger relative velocity.
For tau_p,h in the inertial range, the rms relative velocity with
collision-rate weighting is found to be invariant with tau_p,l and scales with
tau_p,h roughly as ~ tau_p,h^(1/2). The weighting factor favors collisions with
larger relative velocity, and including it leads to more destructive and less
sticking collisions. We compare two collision kernel formulations based on
spherical and cylindrical geometries. The two formulations give consistent
results for the collision rate and the collision-rate weighted statistics,

$\rho_{cr}$ is critical in the sense that there is no such subsonic flow if the

(SM)-singlet Dirac fermions with different $U(1)_{B-L}$ charges. A complex
scalar field charged under $U(1)_{B-L}$ is introduced to break the $U(1)_{B-L}$
symmetry. After $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking a remnant discrete symmetry
stabilizes the lightest state of the Dirac fermions, which can be a stable dark
matter (DM). The second lightest state, if mass splitting with the stable DM is
about 3.5 keV, decays dominantly to the stable DM and 3.5 keV photon through
two-loop diagrams, explaining the X-ray line signal. Two-loop suppression of
the decay amplitude makes its lifetime much longer than the age of the universe
and it can be a decaying DM candidate in large parameter region. We also
introduce a real scalar field which is singlet under both the SM and
$U(1)_{B-L}$ and can explain the current relic abundance of the Dirac fermionic
DMs. If the mixing with the SM Higgs boson is small, it does not contribute to
DM direct detection. The main contribution to the scattering of DM off atomic
nuclei comes from the exchange of $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$, and is
suppressed below current experimental bound when $Z'$ mass is heavy ($\gtrsim
10$ TeV). If the singlet scalar mass is about 0.1-10 MeV, the DM
self-interaction can be large enough to solve small scale structure problems in
simulations with the cold DM, such as, the core-vs-cusp problem and

against experimental data available in literature for a range of energy between
0.5 and 2.8 MeV for Al and Fe targets and for a value of energy of 70keV for
Al, Ag, W and Pb targets. All three independent sets of electromagnetic models
available in Geant4 to simulate bremsstrahlung are tested. A quantitative
analysis is performed reproducing with each model the energy spectrum for the
different configurations of emission angles, energies and targets. At higher
energies (0.5-2.8 MeV) of the impinging electrons on Al and Fe targets, Geant4
is able to reproduce the spectral shapes and the integral photon emission in
the forward direction. The agreement is within 10-30%, depending on energy,
emission angle and target material. The physics model based on the Penelope
Monte Carlo code is in slightly better agreement with the measured data than
the other two. However, all models over-estimate the photon emission in the
backward hemisphere. For the lower energy study (70 keV), which includes
higher-Z targets, all models systematically under-estimate the total photon
yield, while still providing a reasonable agreement between 10 and 50%. The
results of this work are of potential interest for medical physics
applications, where knowledge of the energy spectra and angular distributions
of photons is needed for accurate dose calculations with Monte Carlo and other

frustrated multiband superconductors/superfluids. The frustration originates
with multiple superconducting bands crossing the Fermi surface in conjunction
with interband Josephson-couplings with a positive sign. These couplings tend
to frustrate the phases of the various components of the superconducting order
parameter. This in turn leads to an effective description in terms of a
$\groupUZ$-symmetric system, where essentially only the $\groupU$-sector
couples to the gauge-field representing the rotation or magnetic field. By
imposing a large enough net vorticity on the system at low temperatures, one
may therefore reveal a resistive vortex liquid state which will feature an
unusual additional phase transition in the $\groupZ$-sector. At low enough
vorticity there is a corresponding vortex-lattice phase featuring a $\groupZ$
phase transition. We argue that this Ising transition phase should be readily
observable in experiments.

is given by the transverse field Ising model with/without next-nearest neighbor
coupling. The ladder has three phases, namely, the Kitaev SPT, symmetry broken
ferro/antiferromagnetic order and classical spin-liquid. The non-zero quantum
critical point and its corresponding central charge are provided by the
effective theory, which are in full agreement with the numerical results, i.e.,
the divergence of entanglement entropy at the critical point, change of the
entanglement spectrum degeneracy and a drop in the ground-state fidelity. The
central charge of the critical points are either c=1 or c=2, with the
magnetization and correlation exponents being 1/4 and 1/2, respectively. In the
absence of frustration, the 2D lattice shows a topological phase transition
from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-liquid state to the long-range ordered Ising phase
at finite ratio of couplings, while in the presence of frustration, an
order-by-disorder transition is induced by the Kitaev term. The 2D classical
spin-liquid phase is unstable against the addition of Kitaev term toward an
ordered phase before the transition to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-liquid state.

non-volatile storage elements suited for nanoscale memory applications. In
terms of logic operations, ReRAM devices were suggested to be used as
programmable interconnects, large-scale look-up tables or for sequential logic
operations. However, without additional selector devices these approaches are
not suited for use in large scale nanocrossbar memory arrays, which is the
preferred architecture for ReRAM devices due to the minimum area consumption.
To overcome this issue for the sequential logic approach, we recently
introduced a novel concept, which is suited for passive crossbar arrays using
complementary resistive switches (CRSs). CRS cells offer two high resistive
storage states, and thus, parasitic sneak currents are efficiently avoided.
However, until now the CRS-based logic-in-memory approach was only shown to be
able to perform basic Boolean logic operations using a single CRS cell. In this
paper, we introduce two multi-bit adder schemes using the CRS-based
logic-in-memory approach. We proof the concepts by means of SPICE simulations
using a dynamical memristive device model of a ReRAM cell. Finally, we show the
advantages of our novel adder concept in terms of step count and number of
devices in comparison to a recently published adder approach, which applies the
conventional ReRAM-based sequential logic concept introduced by Borghetti et
al.

opens a new paradigm that one tries to understand the electro-weak symmetry

problem is obtained by solving one or more related initial value problems. This
paper is concerned with the application of the iterative transformation method
to the Sakiadis problem. This method is an extension of the Toepfer's
non-iterative algorithm developed as a simple way to solve the celebrated
Blasius problem. As shown by this author [Appl. Anal., 66 (1997) pp. 89-100]
the method provides a simple numerical test for the existence and uniqueness of
solutions. Here we show how the method can be applied to problems with a
homogeneous boundary conditions at infinity and in particular we solve the
Sakiadis problem of boundary layer theory. Moreover, we show how to couple our
method with Newton's root-finder. The obtained numerical results compare well
with those available in literature. The main aim here is that any method
developed for the Blasius, or the Sakiadis, problem might be extended to more
challenging or interesting problems. In this context, the iterative
transformation method has been recently applied to compute the normal and
reverse flow solutions of Stewartson for the Falkner-Skan model [Comput. &

Leo. Different diagnostics probing different geometrical scales have pointed
toward a non-homogeneous mass-loss process: dust clumps are observed at
milli-arcsec scale, a bipolar structure is seen at arcsecond-scale and
multi-concentric shells are detected beyond 1"". We present the first ALMA Cycle
0 band 9 data around 650 GHz. The full-resolution data have a spatial
resolution of 0"".42x0"".24, allowing us to study the morpho-kinematical
structure within ~6"". Results: We have detected 25 molecular lines. The
emission of all but one line is spatially resolved. The dust and molecular
lines are centered around the continuum peak position. The dust emission has an
asymmetric distribution with a central peak flux density of ~2 Jy. The
molecular emission lines trace different regions in the wind acceleration
region and suggest that the wind velocity increases rapidly from about 5 R*
almost reaching the terminal velocity at ~11 R*. The channel maps for the
brighter lines show a complex structure; specifically for the 13CO J=6-5 line
different arcs are detected within the first few arcseconds. The curved
structure present in the PV map of the 13CO J=6-5 line can be explained by a
spiral structure in the inner wind, probably induced by a binary companion.
From modeling the ALMA data, we deduce that the potential orbital axis for the
binary system lies at a position angle of ~10-20 deg to the North-East and that
the spiral structure is seen almost edge-on. We infer an orbital period of 55
yr and a binary separation of 25 au (or ~8.2 R*). We tentatively estimate that
the companion is an unevolved low-mass main-sequence star. The ALMA data hence
provide us for the first time with the crucial kinematical link between the
dust clumps seen at milli-arcsecond scale and the almost concentric arcs seen
at arcsecond scale.

proton and nucleus. In this process, the nucleon in the nucleus can be excited
to resonances $N^*$ and the $\eta$ meson in the final state can arise due to
$N^* \to N\eta$. We investigate the dynamics of resonances, including nucleon
Born terms, and their interferences in the coherently added cross section of

well-established. The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitment-based MAS)

a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which
are external to the MAS. This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed

Obviously, it is different among fields of science, social science, and

behaviour across disciplines. In the past, the citation potential was studied
at journal level considering the average number of references in established
groups of journals (for example, the crown indicator is based on the journal
subject categories in the Web of Science database). In this paper, some
characterizations of the author's scientific research through three different
research dimensions are proposed: production (journal papers), impact (journal
citations), and reference (bibliographical sources). Then, we propose different
measures of the citation potential for authors based on a proportion of these
dimensions. An empirical application, in a set of 120 randomly selected highly
productive authors from the CSIC Research Centre (Spain) in four subject areas,
shows that the ratio between production and impact dimensions is a normalized
measure of the citation potential at the level of individual authors. Moreover,
this ratio reduces the between-group variance in relation to the within-group
variance in a higher proportion than the rest of the indicators analysed.
Furthermore, it is consistent with the type of journal impact indicator used. A
possible application of this result is in the selection and promotion process
within interdisciplinary institutions, since it allows comparisons of authors
based on their particular scientific research.

higher computational complexity. Hence, in order to address the complexity

the gas, whose bulk mass is in the outer cold ($T\lesssim30$K) regions. This
zone can be well traced by rotational lines of less abundant CO isotopologues,
that probe the gas down to the midplane. The total CO gas mass is then obtained
with the isotopologue ratios taken to be constant at the elemental isotope
values found in the local ISM. This approach is however imprecise, because
isotope selective processes are ignored. The aim of this work is an
isotopologue selective treatment of CO isotopologues, in order to obtain a more
accurate determination of disk masses. The isotope-selective photodissociation,
the main process controlling the abundances of CO isotopologues in the
CO-emissive layer, is properly treated for the first time in a full disk model
(DALI, Bruderer et al. 2012; Bruderer 2013). The chemistry, thermal balance,
line and continuum radiative transfer are all considered together with a
chemical network that treats $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O, isotopes of all
included atoms, and molecules, as independent species. Isotope selective
processes lead to regions in the disk where the isotopologues abundance ratios
are considerably different from the elemental ratio. The results of this work
show that considering CO isotopologue ratios as constants can lead to an
underestimate of disk masses by up to almost two orders of magnitude if grains
have grown to larger sizes. This may explain observed discrepancies in mass
determinations from different tracers. The dependence of the various
isotopologues emission on stellar and disk parameters is investigated.
Including CO isotope selective processes is crucial to determine the gas mass
of the disk accurately (through ALMA observations) and thus to provide the
amount of gas which may eventually form planets or change the dynamics of
forming planetary systems.

find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their
own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the
typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New

electron pocket induced by bidirectional charge order in high field, we propose
that the mass enhancement is very anisotropic around the small Fermi surface.
The corners of the pocket are proposed to have a big enhancement without any
enhancement along the diagonal nodal direction. A natural mechanism for such
angle dependent mass enhancement comes from the destruction of the Landau
quasiparticle at hot spots on the large Fermi surface at a proximate quantum
critical point. The possibility of a divergent cyclotron effective mass is
discussed within a scaling theory for such a quantum critical point. We
consider both a conventional quantum critical point associated with the onset
of charge order in a metal and an unconventional one where an antinodal
pseudogap opens simultaneously with the onset of charge order. The latter may
describe the physics of the strange metal regime at zero magnetic field.

computation of a large number of lepton and quark flavor observables, using
generic analytical expressions for the Wilson coefficients of the relevant
operators. The setup is based on the public codes SARAH and SPheno, and thus
allows for the analytical and numerical computation of the observables in the
model defined by the user. If necessary, the user can also go beyond the basic
usage and define his own operators and/or observables. For this purpose, a
Mathematica package called PreSARAH has been developed. This tool uses FeynArts

coefficients at the tree- and 1-loop levels. Similarly, the user can easily
implement new observables. With all these tools properly combined, the user can

order of magnitude more receivers than classical synthesis arrays, such as the

Several alternating direction implicit (ADI) approaches have therefore been
proposed that reduce numerical complexity for this task from $\mathcal{O}(P^3)$
to $\mathcal{O}(P^2)$, where $P$ is the number of receive paths to be
calibrated.
  Aims. We present an ADI method, show that it converges to the optimal
solution, and assess its numerical, computational and statistical performance.
We also discuss its suitability for application in self-calibration and report
on its successful application in LOFAR standard pipelines.
  Methods. Convergence is proved by rigorous mathematical analysis using a
contraction mapping. Its numerical, algorithmic, and statistical performance,
as well as its suitability for application in self-calibration, are assessed
using simulations.
  Results. Our simulations confirm the $\mathcal{O}(P^2)$ complexity and
excellent numerical and computational properties of the algorithm. They also
confirm that the algorithm performs at or close to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB,
lower bound on the variance of estimated parameters). We find that the
algorithm is suitable for application in self-calibration and discuss how it
can be included. We demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speed improvement in
calibration over traditional methods on actual LOFAR data.
  Conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that ADI methods are a valid and
computationally more efficient alternative to traditional gain calibration
method and we report on its successful application in a number of actual data
reduction pipelines.

other carbonaceous compounds in the interstellar medium, in particular
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this paper we study several
photodissociation regions (PDRs) where C$_{60}$ and PAHs are detected and the
local physical conditions are reasonably well constrained, to provide
observational insights into these questions. C$_{60}$ is found to emit in PDRs
where the dust is cool ($T_d = 20-40$ K) and even in PDRs with cool stars.
These results exclude the possibility for C$_{60}$ to be locked in grains at
thermal equilibrium in these environments. We observe that PAH and C$_{60}$
emission are spatially uncorrelated and that C$_{60}$ is present in PDRs where
the physical conditions (in terms of radiation field and hydrogen density)
allow for full dehydrogenation of PAHs, with the exception of Ced 201. We also
find trends indicative of an increase in C$_{60}$ abundance within individual
PDRs, but these trends are not universal. These results support models where
the dehydrogenation of carbonaceous species is the first step towards C$_{60}$
formation. However, this is not the only parameter involved and C$_{60}$

Some of them are located very close to their host star, receiving large amounts
of UV radiation. Many M stars emit strong chromospheric emission in the H I
Lyman $\alpha$ line (Ly$\alpha$) at 1215.67 \AA, the brightest far-UV emission
line. We show that the effect of incoming Ly$\alpha$ flux can significantly
change the photochemistry of mini-Neptunes' atmospheres. We use GJ 436b as an
example, considering different metallicities for its atmospheric composition.
For solar composition, H$_2$O-mixing ratios show the largest change because of
Ly$\alpha$ radiation. H$_2$O absorbs most of this radiation, thereby shielding
CH$_4$, whose dissociation is driven mainly by radiation at other far-UV
wavelengths ($\sim1300$ \AA). H$_2$O photolysis also affects other species in
the atmosphere, including H, H$_2$, CO$_2$, CO, OH and O. For an atmosphere
with high metallicity, H$_2$O- and CO$_2$-mixing ratios show the biggest
change, thereby shielding CH$_4$. Direct measurements of the UV flux of the
host stars are important for understanding the photochemistry in exoplanets'
atmospheres. This is crucial, especially in the region between 1 and 10$^{-6}$
bars, which is the part of the atmosphere that generates most of the observable

to thwart static analysis approaches and bypassing antivirus tools. Dynamic
analysis techniques, however, have essentially overcome these deceits by
observing the actual behaviour of the code execution. In this regard, various
methods, techniques and tools have been proposed. However, because of the
diverse concepts and strategies used in the implementation of these methods and
tools, security researchers and malware analysts find it difficult to select
the required optimum tool to investigate the behaviour of a malware and to
contain the associated risk for their study. Focusing on two dynamic analysis
techniques: Function Call monitoring and Information Flow Tracking, this paper
presents a comparison framework for dynamic malware analysis tools. The
framework will assist the researchers and analysts to recognize the tools
implementation strategy, analysis approach, system wide analysis support and
its overall handling of binaries, helping them to select a suitable and
effective one for their study and analysis.

single climbing image (C1-NEB) successfully finds the TS, C2-NEB finds it with
higher stability and accuracy. However, C2-NEB is suitable for more complex
cases, where C1-NEB misses the TS because the MEP and NEB directions near the
saddle point are different. Generally, C2-NEB not only finds the TS but
guarantees that the climbing images approach it from the opposite sides along
the MEP, and it estimates accuracy from the three images: the highest-energy
one and its climbing neighbors. C2-NEB is suitable for fixed-cell NEB and the
generalized solid-state NEB (SS-NEB).

obtained using a 3D reduced fluid code. First, systematic scans were performed
to investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude,
perpendicular size and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament
was found to have a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the
relative importance of parallel currents to polarisation and viscous currents,
whilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the
blob was increased sufficiently.
  Next, the 3D simulations were compared to 2D simulations using different
parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects
parallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the
influence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to
not replicate the 3D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial
radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more
satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even
in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no
longer valid. Specifically it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments
with different perpen- dicular sizes that were observed in the 3D simulations
which the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither
closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects and associated
poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3D simulations.
  Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful
in replicating the 3D dynamics, it is emphasised that the vorticity closure may
still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from
closing through the sheath due to effects such as increased resistivity near
the targets.

energy scales is known to the observer, but their exact values are completely
uncertain. The prior probability distribution for the uncertain energy
parameters is argued to be Jeffreys' prior. We define an average measure for
performance of the model by averaging, over the prior distribution, the power
output (heat engine) or the $\chi$-criterion (refrigerator) which is the
product of rate of heat absorbed from the cold reservoir and the coefficient of
performance. We observe that the figure of merit, at optimal performance close
to equilibrium, is reproduced by the prior-averaging procedure. Further, we
obtain the well-known expressions of finite-time thermodynamics for the
efficiency at optimal power and the coefficient of performance at optimal
$\chi$-criterion, given by $1-\sqrt{\theta}$ and $1/\sqrt{1-\theta}-1$
respectively. This analogy is explored further and we point out that the
expected heat flow from and to the reservoirs, behaves as an effective
Newtonian flow. We also show, in a class of quasi-static models of quantum heat

scientific fields, especially in the modern era with explosion of massive data.
To address this problem, procedures based on quantile regression and Least
Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression have been devel- oped in recent years.
These methods essentially estimate the conditional median (or quantile)
function. They can be very different from the conditional mean functions when
distributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efficiently
estimate the mean regression functions in ultra-high dimensional setting with
existence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a
penalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the
traditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate quadratic
(RA-quadratic) loss will be called RA-Lasso. In the ultra-high dimensional
setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size,
our results reveal that the RA-lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator
at the same rate as the optimal rate under the light-tail situation. We further
study the computational convergence of RA-Lasso and show that the composite
gradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same
optimal rate after sufficient iterations. As a byproduct, we also establish the
concentration inequality for estimat- ing population mean when there exists
only the second moment. We compare RA-Lasso with other regularized robust
estimators based on quantile regression and LAD regression. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of
RA-Lasso.

on $\Gamma$ is ergodic, and that the discrete dynamics is much faster than the
piecewise deterministic dynamics (separation of time-scales). Using the
Perron-Frobenius theorem and the calculus-of-variations, we evaluate the rate
function of a large deviation principle in terms of a classical action, whose
Hamiltonian is given by the Perron eigenvalue of a $|\Gamma|$-dimensional
linear equation. The corresponding linear operator depends on the transition
rates of the Markov chain and the nonlinear functions of the piecewise

using path-integrals and WKB methods. We illustrate the theory by considering
the example of stochastic ion channels.

investigated based on coronal EUV observations and photospheric magnetic field
measurements obtained from Solar Dynamic Observatory. The AR consists of a
filament channel originating from major sunspot and its south section is
associated with inverse-S sigmoidal system as observed in AIA passbands. We
regard the sigmoid as the main body of the flux rope (FR). There also exists a
twisted flux bundle crossing over this FR. This overlying flux bundle
transforms in shape similar to kink-rise evolution which has correspondence
with rise motion of the FR. The emission measure and temperature along the FR
exhibits increasing trend with its rising motion, indicating reconnection in
the thinning current sheet underneath the FR. Net magnetic flux of the AR
evaluated at north and south polarities showed decreasing behavior whereas the
net current in these fluxes exhibits increasing trend. As the negative
(positive) flux is having dominant positive (negative) current, the chirality
of AR flux system is likely negative (left handed) to be consistent with the
chirality of inverse S-sigmoidal FR. This analysis of magnetic fields of source
AR suggest that the cancelling fluxes are prime factors to the monotonous
twisting of the FR system reaching to a critical state to trigger kink
instability and the rise motion. This rise motion possibly led to onset of
torus instability resulting in Earth-directed CME and the progressive
reconnection in thinning current sheet underneath the rising FR leads to M6.5
flare.

properties of this system become quite different depending on whether the
number of layers is odd or even. In odd-number-th layers in an odd-number-layer
system, finite magnetization emerges even with an infinitesimal interaction.
This is a striking feature of the flatband ferromagnetic state in multilayer
systems as a consequence of the Lieb theorem. In contrast, in even-number
layers, magnetization develops from zero on a finite interaction. These
different magnetic behaviours are triggered by the flat bands in the local
density of states and become identical in the limit of the infinite-layer
(i.e., three-dimensional) system. We also address how interlayer hopping
affects the magnetization process. Further, we point out that layer
magnetization, which is a population imbalance between up and down atoms on a
layer, can be employed to detect the emergence of the flat-band ferromagnetic
state without addressing sublattice magnetization.

electrical communication using information theory metrics in 2-dimensional cell
lattice models of cardiac excitation propagation. The time series generated by
each cell was coarse-grained to 1 when excited or 0 when resting. The Shannon
entropy for each cell was calculated from the time series during four
clinically important heart rhythms: normal heartbeat, anatomical reentry,
spiral reentry, and multiple reentry. We also used mutual information to
perform spatial profiling of communication during these cardiac arrhythmias. We
found that information sharing between cells was spatially heterogeneous. In
addition, cardiac arrhythmia significantly impacted information sharing within
the heart. Entropy localized the path of the drifting core of spiral reentry,
which could be an optimal target of therapeutic ablation. We conclude that
information theory metrics can quantitatively assess electrical communication
among cardiomyocytes. The traditional concept of the heart as a functional
syncytium sharing electrical information cannot predict altered entropy and
information sharing during complex arrhythmia. Information theory metrics may
find clinical application in the identification of rhythm-specific treatments

to flat spectrum at higher frequencies, plus a Gaussian-shaped contribution
that varies depending on the region studied. This Fourier spectral shape is in
contrast to the commonly-held assumption that coronal time-series are well
described by the sum of a long time-scale background trend plus
Gaussian-distributed noise, with some specific locations also showing an
oscillatory signal. The implications of this discovery to the field of coronal

important implications on the interpretation of local measurements of
cosmological parameters. Galaxy clusters have been shown to be ideal probes to
trace the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this paper we study the
local density distribution in the southern sky with the X-ray detected galaxy
clusters from the REFLEX II cluster survey. From the normalized comoving number
density of clusters we find an average underdensity of ~30 - 40% in the
redshift range out to z ~0.04 (~170 Mpc) in the southern extragalactic sky with
a significance larger than 3.4sigma. On larger scales from 300 Mpc to over 1
Gpc the density distribution appears remarkably homogeneous. The local
underdensity seems to be dominated by the South Galactic Cap region. A
comparison of the cluster distribution with that of galaxies in the K-band from
a recent study shows that galaxies and clusters trace each other very closely
in density. In the South Galactic Cap region both surveys find a local
underdensity in the redshift range z= 0 to 0.05 and no significant underdensity
in the North Galactic Cap at southern latitudes. Our results to not support

of numbers in real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits
approximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more
frequently than high digits in the first place. The two essential prerequisites
for data configuration with regards to compliance with Benford's Law are high
order of magnitude and positive skewness with a tail falling to the right of
the histogram, so that quantitative configuration is such that the small is
numerous and the big is rare. A related topic in the study of Benford's Law is
the stark contrast between multiplications and additions of random variables
and their distinct resultant quantitative and digital configurations. Random
multiplication processes induce substantial increase in order of magnitude and
they tend to the skewed Lognormal Distribution, favoring the small over the
big. Random addition processes on the other hand do not induce any increase in
order of magnitude and they tend to the symmetrical Normal Distribution as
predicated by the Central Limit Theorem, favoring the medium over the small and
the big. Thus, while multiplication processes are highly conducive to Benford
behavior, addition processes are highly detrimental to Benford behavior. In
this article it is shown that often in real-life data, multiplication and
addition processes mix together within one measurement or expression, and
consequently they fiercely compete for dominance, each attempting to exert the
greatest influence upon sizes and digits. Such tugs of war between additions
and multiplications are won or lost depending on the orders of magnitude of the
generating random variables, as well as on the relative strength of the two
warring sides, measured in terms of the comparative arithmetical involvement in
the algebraic expression of the process.

schemes for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Deliberately
clipping the transmission signal degrades system performance, and clipping
mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration. In this
work, we acknowledge the sparse nature of the clipping signal and propose a
low-complexity Bayesian clipping estimation scheme. The proposed scheme
utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for
enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against
inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase
property of the clipped signal, as well as the clipping likelihood, is utilized
for enhanced reconstruction. Further, motivated by the nature of modern
OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping reconstruction
approach to multiple antenna receivers, and multi-user OFDM. We also address
the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping
distortion. Numerical findings are presented, that depict favourable results
for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction
schemes.

Within the diluted periodic Anderson model, we investigate the changes in
single-particle dynamics as well as response functions, as a function of Kondo
hole concentration ($x$) and temperature. We show that the spectral weight
transfers due to Kondo hole substitution has characteristics that are different
from those induced by temperature; The dc resistivity crosses over from a
highly non-monotonic form with a coherence peak in the $x\rightarrow 0$ limit
to a monotonic single-impurity like form that saturates at low temperature. The
thermopower exhibits a characteristic maximum as a function of temperature, the
value of which changes sign with increasing $x$, and its location is shown to
correspond to a low energy scale of the system. The Hall coefficient also
changes sign with increasing $x$ at zero temperature and is highly temperature
dependent for all $x$. As $x$ is increased beyond a certain $x_c$, the Drude
peak and the mid-infrared peak in the optical conductivity vanish almost
completely; A peak in the optical scattering rate melts and disappears
eventually. We discuss the above-mentioned changes in the properties in terms
of a crossover from coherent, Kondo lattice behaviour to single impurity like,
incoherent behaviour with increasing $x$. A comparison of theory with
experiments carried out for the dc resistivity and the thermopower of
Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$ yields good agreement.

The fraction of planets in/near resonance is then plotted as a function of both
resonance number and resonance order for all the exoplanet population and,
separately, for each planet type. In the resonance number plot it appears that
the 2/1 and 3/2 resonances and near-resonances are dominant overall and for the
giant planets, but the observed distribution profile changes significantly with
each planet category, with terrestrial planets, neptunes and mini-neptunes
showing the largest variation. Resonances/near resonances around the value 5/3
were dominant for mini neptunes and terrestrial planets. In the order-based
resonance/near-resonance plot, the observed distribution appears to follow an
exponential decay for the general population and its profile appears to be
influenced by the planet type. Approximate methods to estimate resonance/near
resonance distributions are also attempted for the systems with unknown planet
mass or with unknown star and/or planet mass and compared with the distribution

The BIon is a configuration in flat space of a D-brane and a parallel
anti-D-brane connected by a wormhole with F-string charge. When the branes and
antibranes are well separated and the brane's spike is far from the antibrane's
spike, wormhole isn't formed however when two branes are close to each other,
they can be connected by a wormhole. In this condition, there exists many
channels for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our universe and
inflation may naturally occur in a warm region. We present a model that allows
all cosmological parameters like the scale factor $a$, the Hubble parameter $H$
and universe energy density depend on the shape function and temperature of
wormhole in transverse dimension between two branes. In our model, the
expansion of 4D universe is controlled by the thermal wormhole between branes
and ends up in Big-Rip singularity. We show that at this singularity, universe
would be destroyed and one black F-string formed. Finally, we test our model
against WMAP, Planck and BICEP2 data and obtain the ripping time. According to
experimental data, $N\simeq 50$ case leads to $n_{s}\simeq 0.96$, where
\emph{N} and $n_{s}$ are the number e-folds and the spectral index
respectively. This standard case may be found in $0.01 < R_{Tensor-scalar } <
0.3$, where $R_{Tensor-scalar }$ is the tensor-scalar ratio. At this point, the
finite time that Big Rip singularity occurs is $t_{rip}=29(Gyr)$ for WMAP and
Planck data and $t_{rip}=27.5(Gyr)$ for BICEP2 data. Comparing this time with
the time of Big Rip in brane-antibrane, we find that the wormhole in BIonic
system accelerates the destruction of the universe.

gamma called the monomer activity) and the hard core model (which is defined as
a weighted sum over all independent sets where an independent set I is given a

of a graph which has been studied extensively in combinatorics and mathematical
physics, and can be bounded by a constant even for certain unbounded degree

  Our main technical contribution is to prove the best possible rates of decay
of correlations in the natural probability distributions induced by both the
hard core model and the monomer-dimer model in graphs with a given bound on the
connective constant. These results on decay of correlations are obtained using
a new framework based on the so-called message approach that has been
extensively used recently to prove such results for bounded degree graphs. We
then use these optimal decay of correlations results to obtain FPTASs for the
two problems on graphs of bounded connective constant.
  Our techniques also allow us to improve upon known bounds for decay of
correlations for the hard core model on various regular lattices, including
those obtained by Restrepo, Shin, Vigoda and Tetali (2011) for the special case
of Z^2 using sophisticated numerically intensive methods tailored to that

the extragalactic background light, yielding an electron-positron pair beam.
This pair beam is unstable to various plasma instabilities, especially the
""oblique"" instability, which can be the dominant cooling mechanism for the
beam. However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping
renders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a
low level. Here, we show with numerical calculations that the effective damping
rate is $8\times 10^{-4}$ of the growth rate of the linear instability, which
is sufficient for the ""oblique"" instability to be the dominant cooling
mechanism of these pair beams. In particular, we show that previous estimates
of this rate ignored the exponential cutoff in the scattering amplitude at
large wavenumber and assumed that the damping of scattered waves entirely
depends on collisions, ignoring collisionless processes. We find that the total
wave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by
increasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not
included the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long
wavelength modes, this scenario represents the ""worst-case"" scenario for the
oblique instability. As it continues to drain energy from the beam at a faster
rate than other processes, we conclude that the ""oblique"" instability is
sufficiently strong to make it the physically dominant cooling mechanism for
high-energy pair beams in the intergalactic medium.

for SC-FDMA systems. The proposed NBI cancellation scheme exploits the
frequency domain sparsity of the unknown signal and adopts a low complexity
Bayesian sparse recovery procedure. At the transmitter, a few randomly chosen
sub-carriers are kept data free to sense the NBI signal at the receiver.
Further, it is noted that in practice, the sparsity of the NBI signal is
destroyed by a grid mismatch between NBI sources and the system under
consideration. Towards this end, first an accurate grid mismatch model is
presented that is capable of assuming independent offsets for multiple NBI
sources. Secondly, prior to NBI reconstruction, the sparsity of the unknown
signal is restored by employing a sparsifying transform. To improve the
spectral efficiency of the proposed scheme, a data-aided NBI recovery procedure
is outlined that relies on adaptively selecting a subset of data carriers and
uses them as additional measurements to enhance the NBI estimation. Finally,
the proposed scheme is extended to single-input multi-output systems by
performing a collaborative NBI support search over all antennas. Numerical
results are presented that depict the suitability of the proposed scheme for
