rank-deficiency problem in meshless collocation methods for solid mechanics.
Specifically, Smooth-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in the Total Lagrangian
formalism is considered. This method is rank-deficient in the sense that the
SPH approximation of the deformation gradient is not unique with respect to the
positions of the integration points. The non-uniqueness can result in the
formation of zero-energy modes. If undetected, these modes can grow and
completely dominate the solution. Here, an algorithm is introduced, which
effectively suppresses these modes in a fashion similar to hour-glass control
mechanisms in Finite-Element methods. Simulations utilizing this control
algorithm result exhibit much improved stability, accuracy, and error
convergence properties. In contrast to an alternative method which eliminates
zero-energy modes, namely the use of additional integration points, the here
presented algorithm is easy to implement and computationally very efficient.

which cells engulf relatively large solid particles during phagocytosis is
still poorly understood. From movies of neutrophil phagocytosis of polystyrene
beads, we measure the fractional engulfment as a function of time and
demonstrate that phagocytosis occurs in two distinct stages. During the first
stage, engulfment is relatively slow and progressively slows down as
phagocytosis proceeds. However, at approximately half-engulfment, the rate of
engulfment increases dramatically, with complete engulfment attained soon
afterwards. By studying simple mathematical models of phagocytosis, we suggest
that the first stage is due to a passive mechanism, determined by receptor
diffusion and capture, whereas the second stage is more actively controlled,
perhaps with receptors being driven towards the site of engulfment. We then
consider a more advanced model that includes signaling and captures both stages
of engulfment. This model predicts that there is an optimum ligand density for
quick engulfment. Further, we show how this model explains why non-spherical
particles engulf quickest when presented tip-first. Our findings suggest that
active regulation may be a later evolutionary innovation, allowing fast and
robust engulfment even for large particles.

means that each of its evaluation takes significant amount of time, and
therefore our main goal to use a small number of function evaluations of $f(x)$
to further infer the sensitivity information of these different parameters.
Correspondingly, we consider the optimization procedure as an adaptive
experimental design and re-use its available function evaluations as the
initial design points to establish a surrogate model $s(x)$ (or called response
surface). The sensitivity analysis is performed on $s(x)$, which is an lieu of
$f(x)$. Furthermore, we propose a new local multivariate sensitivity measure,
for example, around the optimal solution, for high dimensional problems. Then a
corresponding ""objective-oriented experimental design"" is proposed in order to
make the generated surrogate $s(x)$ better suitable for the accurate
calculation of the proposed specific local sensitivity quantities. In addition,
we demonstrate the better performance of the Gaussian radial basis function
interpolator over Kriging in our cases, which are of relatively high

demonstrate that the optimization procedure and the ""objective-oriented

It is
designed to do compact source photometry allowing for varying spatial
resolution and sensitivity in multi-wavelength surveys. Hyper combines
multi-Gaussian fitting with aperture photometry to provide reliable photometry
in regions with variable backgrounds and in crowded fields. The background is
evaluated and removed locally for each source using polynomial fits of various
orders. Source de-blending is done through simultaneous multi-Gaussian fitting
of the main source and its companion(s), followed by the subtraction of the
companion(s). Hyper allows also simultaneous multi-wavelength photometry by
setting a fixed aperture size independent of the map resolution and evaluating
the source flux within the same region of the sky at multiple wavelengths at
the same time. This new code has been initially designed for precise aperture
photometry in complex fields such as the Galactic plane observed in the far
infrared (FIR) by the Herschel infrared survey of the Galactic plane (Hi-GAL).
Hyper has been tested on both simulated and real Herschel fields to quantify
the quality of the source identification and photometry. The code is highly
modular and fully parameterisable, therefore it can be easily adapted to
different experiments. Comparison of the Hyper photometry with the catalogued
sources in the Bolocam Galactic Plane survey (BGPS), the 1.1 mm survey of the
Galactic Plane carried out with the Caltech Sub-millimeter observatory,
demonstrates the versatility of Hyper on different datasets. It is fast and
light in its memory usage, and it is freely available to the scientific
community.

analytical result. We then use the analytical result to study the MSE behaviors

validate analytical ansatzs gaining physical insight over the numerically

take into account that the distinguishability of the third atom implies the
absence of any restriction over the wavefunction when interchanging this boson
with any of the other two. We find that there are degeneracies in the spectra
in some limiting regimes, that is, when the inter-species and/or the
intra-species interactions tend to infinity. This is in contrast with the
three-identical boson system, where no degeneracy occurs in these limits. We
show that, when tuning both types of interactions through a protocol that keeps
them equal while they are increased towards infinity, the systems's ground
state resembles that of three indistinguishable bosons. Contrarily, the
systems's ground state is different from that of three-identical bosons when
both types of interactions are increased towards infinity through protocols
that do not restrict them to be equal. We study the coherence and correlations
of the system as the interactions are tuned through different protocols, which
permit to built up different correlations in the system and lead to different

position of the jet radio core on the observational frequency. We derive a new
method of measuring the jet magnetic field based on both the value of the shift
and the observed radio flux, which complements the standard method that assumes
equipartition. Using both methods, we re-analyse the blazar sample of
Zamaninasab et al. We find that equipartition is satisfied only if the jet
opening angle in the radio core region is close to the values found
observationally, $\simeq$0.1--0.2 divided by the bulk Lorentz factor,
$\Gamma_{\rm j}$. Larger values, e.g., $1/\Gamma_{\rm j}$, would imply magnetic
fields much above equipartition. A small jet opening angle implies in turn the
magnetization parameter of $\ll 1$. We determine the jet magnetic flux taking
into account this effect. We find that the transverse-averaged jet magnetic
flux is fully compatible with the model of jet formation due to BH spin energy
extraction and the accretion being a magnetically arrested disc (MAD). We
calculate the jet average mass-flow rate corresponding to this model and find
it consists of a substantial fraction of the mass accretion rate. This suggests
the jet composition with a large fraction of baryons. We also calculate the
average jet power, and find it moderately exceeds the accretion power, $\dot M
c^2$, reflecting BH spin energy extraction. We find our results for radio
galaxies at low Eddington ratios are compatible with MADs but require a low
radiative efficiency, as predicted by standard accretion models.

pathway to introduce new functionalities to semiconductor devices. Key to
electrically coupling crystalline oxides with semiconductors to realize
functional behavior is controlling the manner in which their bands align at
interfaces. Here we apply principles of band gap engineering traditionally used
at heterojunctions between conventional semiconductors to control the band
offset between a single crystalline oxide and a semiconductor. Reactive
molecular beam epitaxy is used to realize atomically abrupt and structurally
coherent interfaces between SrZr$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_3$ and Ge, in which the
band-gap of the former is enhanced with Zr content $x$. We present structural
and electrical characterization of SrZr$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_3$-Ge heterojunctions
for $x$ = 0.2 to 0.75 and demonstrate the band offset can be tuned from type-II
to type-I, with the latter being verified using photoemission measurements. The
type-I band offset provides a platform to integrate the dielectric,
ferroelectric and ferromagnetic functionalities of oxides with semiconducting
devices.

luminosity, size and kinematics of early-type galaxies. Using unbiased
determinations of galaxy mass profiles from stellar dynamical models, a simple
picture has emerged in which scaling relations are driven by virial
equilibrium, accompanied by a trend in the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L).
This picture confirms the earliest insights. The trend is mainly due to the
combined variation of age, metallicity and the stellar initial mass function
(IMF). The systematic variations best correlate with the galaxy velocity
dispersion, which traces the bulge mass fraction. This indicates a link between
bulge growth and quenching of star formation. Dark matter is unimportant within
the half-light radius, where the total mass profile is close to isothermal
($\rho\propto r^{-2}$).

annually in terms of economic burden, morbidity, and mortality. With access to
accurate and reliable forecasts of a current or upcoming influenza epidemic's
behavior, policy makers can design and implement more effective
countermeasures. We developed a framework for in-season forecasts of epidemics
using a semiparametric Empirical Bayes framework, and applied it to predict the
weekly percentage of outpatient doctors visits for influenza-like illness, as
well as the season onset, duration, peak time, and peak height, with and
without additional data from Google Flu Trends, as part of the CDC's 2013--2014
""Predict the Influenza Season Challenge"". Previous work on epidemic modeling
has focused on developing mechanistic models of disease behavior and applying
time series tools to explain historical data. However, these models may not
accurately capture the range of possible behaviors that we may see in the
future. Our approach instead produces possibilities for the epidemic curve of
the season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons,
allowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the
seasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations. Since the framework does
not make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to other
diseases as well. Another important advantage of this method is that it
produces a complete posterior distribution for any desired forecasting target,
rather than mere point predictions. We report prospective
influenza-like-illness forecasts that were made for the 2013--2014 U.S.
influenza season, and compare the framework's cross-validated prediction error
on historical data to that of a variety of simpler baseline predictors.

coupling $\alpha_1$ is essentially independent of $w$ in contrast to the
decreasing linear Dresselhaus coefficient $\beta_1$. When we widen the well so
that the second subband can also be populated, we observe that $\alpha_2$
decreases and $\alpha_1$ increases, both almost linearly with $w$.
Interestingly, we find that in the parameter range studied (i.e., very
asymmetric wells) $\alpha_2$ can attain zero and change its sign, while
$\alpha_1$ is always positive. In this double-occupancy regime of $w$'s,
$\beta_1$ is mostly constant and $\beta_2$ decreases with $w$ (similarly to
$\beta_1$ for the single-occupancy regime). On the other hand, the intersubband
Rashba coupling strength $\eta$ decreases with $w$ while the intersubband
Dresselhaus $\Gamma$ remains almost constant. We also determine the
persistent-spin-helix symmetry points, at which the Rashba and the renormalized
(due to cubic corrections) linear Dresselhaus couplings in each subband are
equal, as a function of the well width and doping asymmetry. Our results should

non-isovalent doping, on the other hand, leads to the emergence of a dilute
metal with a superconducting ground state. The link between superconductivity
and the other two instabilities is an open question, which gathers momentum in
the context of the growing popularity of the paradigm linking unconventional
superconductors and quantum critical points. We present a set of specific-heat,
neutron-scattering and dielectric permittivity and polarization measurements on
Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$ ($0<x<0.009$) and a low-temperature electric
conductivity in Sr$_{0.9978}$Ca$_{0.0022}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$. Calcium
substitution was found to enhance the transition temperature for both
anti-ferrodistortive and ferroelectric transitions. Moreover, we find that
Sr$_{0.9978}$Ca$_{0.0022}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$ has a superconducting ground state.
The critical temperature in this rare case of a superconductor with a
ferroelectric parent, is slightly lower than in SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$ of
comparable carrier concentration. A three-dimensional phase diagram for
Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3-\delta}$ tracking the three transition temperatures
as a function of x and $\delta$ results from this study, in which ferroelectric
and superconducting ground states are not immediate neighbours.

features, with a view to improving generalization of predictive models by
reducing overfitting. Directly searching for the most relevant combination of
attributes is NP-hard. Variable selection is of critical importance in many
applications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number
of discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease
mechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The
recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a
hyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\boldmath{$\Theta$}) bound on its
VC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good
generalization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC
dimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear
classifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it
employs. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a
large number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones
that are chosen. Selected features are used to learn a kernel SVM classifier.
On a number of benchmark datasets, the features chosen by the linear MCM yield
comparable or better test set accuracy than when methods such as ReliefF and
FCBF are used for the task. The linear MCM typically chooses one-tenth the
number of attributes chosen by the other methods; on some very high dimensional
datasets, the MCM chooses about $0.6\%$ of the features; in comparison, ReliefF
and FCBF choose 70 to 140 times more features, thus demonstrating that
minimizing the VC dimension may provide a new, and very effective route for
feature selection and for learning sparse representations.

dust grains in cold portions of dense interstellar clouds. When molecular
hydrogen is adsorbed onto an icy mantle through physisorption, a common
assumption in gas-grain rate equation models is to use an adsorption energy for
molecular hydrogen on a pure water substrate. However, at high density and low
temperature, when H2 is efficiently adsorbed onto the mantle, its surface
abundance can be strongly overestimated if this assumption is still used.
Unfortunately, the more detailed microscopic Monte Carlo treatment cannot be
used to study the abundance of H2 in ice mantles if a full gas-grain network is
utilized. We present a numerical method adapted for rate-equation models that
takes into account the possibility that an H2 molecule can, while diffusing on
the surface, find itself bound to another hydrogen molecule, with a far weaker
bond than the H2-water bond, which can lead to more efficient desorption. We
label the ensuing desorption ""encounter desorption"". The method is implemented
first in a simple system consisting only of hydrogen molecules at steady state
between gas and dust using the rate-equation approach and comparing the results
with the results of a microscopic Monte Carlo calculation. We then discuss the
use of the rate-equation approach with encounter desorption embedded in a
complete gas-grain chemical network. For both systems, the rate-equation model
with encounter desorption reproduces the H2 granular coverage computed by the
microscopic Monte Carlo model. The method is especially useful for dense and
cold environments, and for time-dependent physical conditions, such as occur in
the collapse of dense cores and the formation of protoplanetary disks. It is
not significantly CPU time consuming, so can be used for example with complex
3D chemical-hydrodynamical simulations.

and feeds the rapid growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). SMBHs respond
to this fueling by supplying energy back to the ambient gas. Numerical studies
suggest that this feedback is necessary to explain why the properties of SMBHs
and the formation of bulges are closely related. This intimate link between the
SMBH's mass and the large scale dynamics and luminosity of the host has proven
to be a difficult issue to tackle with simulations due to the inability to
resolve all the relevant length scales simultaneously. In this paper we
simulate SMBH growth at high-resolution with {\it FLASH}, accounting for the
gravitational focusing effects of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which appear to
be ubiquitous in galactic nuclei. In the simulations, the NSC core is resolved
by a minimum cell size of about 0.001 pc or approximately $10^{-3}$ of the
cluster's radius. We discuss the conditions required for effective gas
funneling to occur, which are mainly dominated by a relationship between NSC
velocity dispersion and the local sound speed, and provide a sub-grid
prescription for the augmentation of central SMBH accretion rates in the
presence of NSCs. For the conditions expected to persist in the centers of
merging galaxies, the resultant large central gas densities in NSCs should
produce drastically enhanced embedded SMBH accretion rates - up to an order of
magnitude increase can be achieved for gas properties resembling those in
large-scale galaxy merger simulations. This will naturally result in faster
black hole growth rates and higher luminosities than predicted by the commonly
used Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion formalism.

infrared and submm emission from the ejecta of the core collapse supernova
SN\,1987A has been interpreted as indicating the presence of some
0.4--0.7\,M$_\odot$ of dust. We have constructed radiative transfer models of
the ejecta to fit optical to far-infrared observations from the literature at
epochs between 615 days and 24 years after the explosion, to determine when and
where this unexpectedly large amount of dust formed.
  We find that the observations by day 1153 are consistent with the presence of
3$\times$10$^{-3}$M$_\odot$ of dust. Although this is a larger amount than has
previously been considered possible at this epoch, it is still very small
compared to the amount present in the remnant after 24 years, and significantly
higher dust masses at the earlier epochs are firmly ruled out by the
observations, indicating that the majority of the dust must have formed at very
late times. By 8515-9200 days after the explosion, 0.6--0.8\,M$_\odot$ of dust
is present, and dust grains with radii greater than 2\,$\mu$m are required to
obtain a fit to the observed SED. This suggests that the dust mass increase at
late times was caused by accretion onto and coagulation of the dust grains
formed at earlier epochs.
  These findings provide further confirmation that core collapse supernovae can
create large quantities of dust, and indicate that the reason for small dust
masses being estimated in many cases is that the vast majority of the dust
forms long after most supernovae have been detectable at mid-infrared
wavelengths.

low-metallicity massive galaxies is crucial for the determination and
interpretation of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR). Using VLT-ISAAC
near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of 39 zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies, we have measured
Halpha and [NII] emission line fluxes for galaxies with [OII], Hbeta and [OIII]
available from VIMOS optical spectroscopy. The NIR spectroscopy enables us to
break the degeneracy of the R23 method to derive unambiguously O/H gas
metallicities, and also SFRs from extinction corrected Halpha. Using, as a
benchmark, the position in the D4000 vs. [OIII]/Hbeta diagram of galaxies with
reliable O/Hs from NIR spectroscopy, we were able to break the lower/upper
branch R23 degeneracy of additional 900 zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies. Additionally,
the Halpha-based SFR measurements were used to find the best SFR calibration
based on [OII] for the zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies without Halpha measurements. We
find a fraction of 19% of lower mass 9.5<logM/Msun<10.3 zCOSMOS galaxies which
shows a larger evolution of the MZR relation, compared to higher mass galaxies,
being more metal poor at a given mass by a factor of 2-3 compared to SDSS. This
indicates that the low-mass MZR slope is getting steeper at z~0.7 compared to
local galaxies. The existence of these metal-poor galaxies at z~0.7 can be
interpreted as the chemical version of galaxy downsizing. Moreover, the sample
of zCOSMOS galaxies shows direct evidence that SFR influences the MZR at these
redshifts. The comparison of the measured metallicities for the zCOSMOS sample
with the values expected for a non-evolving fundamental metallicity relation
(FMR) shows broadly agreement, and reveals that also galaxies with lower
metallicities and typically higher (specific) SFRs, as found in our zCOSMOS
sample at z~0.7, are in agreement with the predictions of a non-evolving
Z(M,SFR).

highly enriched, in stark contrast to that which is often assumed in galaxy
formation models. We use these findings in a simple model of galactic
enrichment evolution, in which the metallicity of forming galaxies is the
result of accretion of nearly pristine gas and outflow of enriched gas along an
equilibrium sequence. We compare these predictions to the observed

key controlling parameter. This explains the observed flattening of the

consistent with the downsizing trend, whereby more massive galaxies form
earlier than low-mass galaxies. We compared the mass of the post-starburst

star-formation rate and found that only a small amount ($\sim1\%$) of all
star-formation quenching in the redshift range $z=0.2-0.7$ results in
post-starburst galaxies in the luminosity range our sample is sensitive to.
Therefore, luminous post-starburst galaxies are not the place where most of the

sidestep some of the problems associated with non-linear optimization by taking
advantage of the quasi-linear nature of the foreground model. We demonstrate
our algorithm, linearized iterative least-squares (LIL), on the publicly
available Planck sky model FFP6 simulations and compare our result with the
other algorithms. We work at full Planck resolution and show that degrading the
resolution of all channels to that of the lowest frequency channel is not
necessary. Finally we present results for the publicly available Planck data.
Our algorithm is extremely fast, fitting 6 parameters to 7 lowest Planck
channels at full resolution (50 million pixels) in less than 160 CPU-minutes
(or few minutes running in parallel on few tens of cores). LIL is therefore
easily scalable to future experiments which may have even higher resolution and
more frequency channels. We also naturally propagate the uncertainties in
different parameters due to noise in the maps as well as degeneracies between
the parameters to the final errors on the parameters using Fisher matrix. One
indirect application of LIL could be a front-end for Bayesian parameter fitting
to find the maximum of the likelihood to be used as the starting point for the
Gibbs sampling. We show for rare components, such as the carbon-monoxide
emission, present in small fraction of sky, the optimal approach should combine
parameter fitting with model selection. LIL may also be useful in other
astrophysical applications which satisfy the quasi-linearity criteria.

working on our ""unWISE"" coaddds and taking account of the WISE point-spread
function and a noise model. The result is a measurement of the flux of each
SDSS source in each WISE band. Many sources have little flux in the WISE bands,
so often the measurements we report are consistent with zero. However, for many
sources we get three- or four-sigma measurements; these sources would not be
reported by the WISE pipeline and will not appear in the WISE catalog, yet they
can be highly informative for some scientific questions. In addition, these
small-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at catalog level.
The forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent
set of sources between SDSS and WISE, taking advantage of the resolution and
depth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are
resolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements

using our proposed physical definition that UV-bright clumps are discrete
star-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of the
rest-frame UV light of their galaxies. Clumps defined this way are
significantly brighter than the HII regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,
either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution and
cosmological dimming are considered. Under this definition, we measure the
fraction of SFGs that contain at least one off-center clump (Fclumpy) and the
contributions of clumps to the rest-frame UV light and star formation rate of
SFGs in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields, where our mass-complete sample
consists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q>0.5. The redshift evolution of
Fclumpy changes with the stellar mass (M*) of the galaxies. Low-mass
(log(M*/Msun)<9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant Fclumpy of about 60% from
z~3.0 to z~0.5. Intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their Fclumpy from
55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. We find that (1) the trend
of disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the Fclumpy
trend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of the
Fclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z<1.5, given a realistic
observability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for the
Fclumpy trend in all masses at z<1.5. The clump contribution to the rest-frame
UV light of SFGs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(M*/Msun)~10.5 at
all redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.

fraction of time during which the sources are active. However, DCs are
generally not provided with statistical uncertainties, since the standard
approach is to perform Monte Carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate them,
which can be quite time consuming for a large sample of sources. As an
alternative, considerably less time-consuming approach, we derived the
theoretical expectation value for the DC and its error for sources whose state
is one of two possible, mutually exclusive states, inactive (off) or flaring
(on), as based on a finite set of independent observational data points.
Following a Bayesian approach, we derived the analytical expression for the
posterior, the conjugated distribution adopted as prior, and the expectation
value and variance. We applied our method to the specific case of the
inactivity duty cycle (IDC) for supergiant fast X-ray transients. We also
studied IDC as a function of the number of observations in the sample. Finally,
we compare the results with the theoretical expectations. We found excellent
agreement with our findings based on the standard bootstrap method. Our
Bayesian treatment can be applied to all sets of independent observations of
two-state sources, such as active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, etc. In
addition to being far less time consuming than bootstrap methods, the
additional strength of this approach becomes obvious when considering a
well-populated class of sources ($N_{\rm src} \geq 50$) for which the prior can
be fully characterized by fitting the distribution of the observed DCs for all
sources in the class, so that, through the prior, one can further constrain the
DC of a new source by exploiting the information acquired on the DC
distribution derived from the other sources. [Abridged]

significantly shallower in massive (M_* >10e11M_sun) than in Milky Way like
systems. Theoretical models, based primarily on semi-analytical techniques,
have had a long-standing problem with reproducing these trends, instead
predicting too few blue satellites in general but also estimating a radial
distribution that is too shallow, regardless of primary mass. In this Letter,
we use the Illustris cosmological simulation to study the properties of
satellite galaxies around isolated primaries. For the first time, we find good
agreement between theory and observations. We identify the main source of this
success relative to earlier work to be a consequence of the large gas contents
of satellites at infall, a factor ~5-10 times larger than in semi-analytical
models. Because of their relatively large gas reservoirs, satellites can
continue to form stars long after infall, with a typical timescale for
star-formation to be quenched ~2 Gyr in groups but more than ~5 Gyr for
satellites around Milky Way like primaries. The gas contents we infer are
consistent with z=0 observations of HI gas in galaxies, although we find large
discrepancies among reported values in the literature. A testable prediction of
our model is that the gas-to-stellar mass ratio of satellite progenitors should
vary only weakly with cosmic time.

points invokes a higher number density in the faintest bin of the quasar
luminosity function than the previous estimate employed. This suggests a
steeper faint-end slope than lower-z, though it is yet uncertain based on a
small number of spectroscopically identified faint quasars and several quasar
candidates are still remain to be diagnosed. The steepening of the quasar
luminosity function at the faint-end does increase the expected emission rate
of the ionizing photon, however, it only changes by a factor of ~2-6. This was
found to be still insufficient for the required photon budget of reionization
at z~6.

formation histories closely linked to that of the host halo. In local clusters
they have larger sizes ($R_e$) and lower velocity dispersions (sigma) at fixed
stellar mass M_star, and much larger R_e at a fixed $\sigma$ than field and
satellite galaxies (non-CGs). Using spectroscopic observations of group
galaxies selected from the COSMOS survey, we compare the dynamical scaling
relations of early-type CGs and non-CGs at z~0.6, to distinguish possible
mechanisms that produce the required evolution. CGs are systematically offset
towards larger R_e at fixed $\sigma$ compared to non-CGs with similar M_star.
The CG R_e-M_star relation also shows differences, primarily driven by a
sub-population (~15%) of galaxies with large $R_e$, while the M_star-sigma
relations are indistinguishable. These results are accentuated when double
Sersic profiles, which better fit light in the outer regions of galaxies, are
adopted. They suggest that even group-scale CGs can develop extended components
by these redshifts that can increase total $R_e$ and M_star estimates by
factors of ~2. To probe the evolutionary link between our sample and cluster
CGs, we also analyze two cluster samples at z~0.6 and z~0. We find similar
results for the more massive halos at comparable z, but much more distinct CG
scaling relations at low-z. Thus, the rapid, late-time accretion of outer
components, perhaps via the stripping and accretion of satellites, would appear
to be a key feature that distinguishes the evolutionary history of CGs.

having experienced more dry mergers -- thought not to increase a galaxy's

gas-rich processes, on the other hand, preserve the main correlation. Due to
the scouring action of binary supermassive black holes, the extent of these dry
mergers (since the last significant wet merger) can be traced by the ratio
between the central stellar mass deficit and the black hole mass ($M_{\rm

depleted cores, including central cluster galaxies, we show that the
""overmassive"" black holes are actually hosted by galaxies that appear to have
undergone the lowest degree of such merging. In addition, the rotational
kinematics of 37 galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma$ diagram reveals that
fast and slow rotators are not significantly offset from each other, also
contrary to what is expected if these two populations were the product of wet

masse (i.e. SFR-M*) plane up to z 2. We start from a M*-selected sample of
galaxies with reliable SFR and redshift estimates. We then grid the SFR-M*
plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radio
luminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the FRC index (i.e. qFIR) of
each SFR-M*-z bin. The infrared luminosities of our SFR-M*-z bins are estimated
using their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observations
obtained with Herschel. Their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices
(i.e. alpha, where Snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4GHz and
610MHz flux densities from the VLA and GMRT, respectively. Our far-infrared and
radio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields
-GOODS-N/S, ECDFS, and COSMOS- covering a sky area of 2deg^2. Using this
methodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and FRC index of
star-forming galaxies with M*>10^10Msun and 0<z<2.3. We find that
alpha^1.4GHz_610MHz does not evolve significantly with redshift or with the
distance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane
(i.e. Delta_log(SSFR)_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). Instead,
star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonical
value of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated by
non-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. We find that qFIR displays a
moderate but statistically significant redshift evolution as
qFIR(z)=(2.35+/-0.08)*(1+z)^(-0.12+/-0.04), consistent with some previous
literature. Finally, we find no significant correlation between qFIR and
Delta_log(SSFR)_MS, though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of our
redshift bins, cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

redshifts is essential for the study of structure formation. Such a calibration
should include well understood correlations with halo mass, and the possibility
to identify galaxies which dominate their potential well (centrals), and their
satellites. Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental
calibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium
resolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures
on different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for
satellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is
found at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case
the density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the
aperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an
observationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure
and complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is
most meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of
environmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on
stellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,
observationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in
the model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the
sample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density.

reweighting method, the pion condensation in the phase-quenched theory and
associated zero-mode prevent us to go to the low-temperature high-density
region. We propose a method to circumvent them by a simple modification of the
density of state method. We first argue that the standard version of the
density of state method, which is invented to solve the overlapping problem, is
effective only for a certain `good' class of observables. We then modify it so
as to solve the overlap problem for `bad' observables as well. While, in the
standard version of the density of state method, we usually constrain an
observable we are interested in, we fix a different observable in our new
method which has a sharp peak at some particular value characterizing the
correct vacuum of the target theory. In the finite-density QCD, such an
observable is the pion condensate. The average phase becomes vanishingly small
as the value of the pion condensate becomes large, hence it is enough to
consider configurations with small values of pion condensate, where the zero
mode does not appear. We demonstrate an effectiveness of our method by using a
toy model (the chiral random matrix theory) which captures the properties of
finite-density QCD qualitatively. We also argue how to apply our method to
other theories including finite-density QCD. Although the example we study
numerically is based on the phase reweighting method, the same idea can be
applied to more general reweighting methods and we show how this idea can be
applied to find a possible QCD critical point.

for non-equilibrium transport problems in general relativity and also in
science and engineering applications with specific geometries. The method
achieves high-order accuracy using Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization
of phase space and strong stability-preserving, Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) time
integration. Special care in taken to ensure that the method preserves strict
bounds for the phase space distribution function $f$; i.e., $f\in[0,1]$. The
combination of suitable CFL conditions and the use of the high-order limiter
proposed in Zhang & Shu (2010) is sufficient to ensure positivity of the
distribution function. However, to ensure that the distribution function
satisfies the upper bound, the discretization must, in addition, preserve the
divergence-free property of the phase space flow. Proofs that highlight the
necessary conditions are presented for general curvilinear coordinates, and the
details of these conditions are worked out for some commonly used coordinate
systems (i.e., spherical polar spatial coordinates in spherical symmetry and
cylindrical spatial coordinates in axial symmetry, both with spherical momentum
coordinates). Results from numerical experiments --- including one example in
spherical symmetry adopting the Schwarzschild metric --- demonstrate that the
method achieves high-order accuracy and that the distribution function

XMM-Newton data from a similar, but not identical, portion of the rim over a
similar, but not identical, time interval (0.84 +/- 0.23 arcsec/yr, Katsuda et

then the results of a hydrodynamic analysis suggest that G266.2-1.2 is between
2.4 and 5.1 kyr old if it is expanding into a uniform ambient medium (whether
or not it was produced by a Type Ia or Type II event). If the remnant is
expanding into the material shed by a steady stellar wind, then the age could

existence of collisionless dark matter, while posing a serious challenge owing
to the unusually high inferred pairwise velocities of its progenitor clusters.
Here we investigate the probability of finding such a high-velocity pair in
large-volume N-body simulations, particularly focusing on differences between
halo finding algorithms. We find that algorithms that do not account for the
kinematics of infalling groups yield vastly different statistics and
probabilities. When employing the ROCKSTAR halo finder that considers particle
velocities, we find numerous Bullet-like pair candidates that closely match not
only the high pairwise velocity, but also the mass, mass ratio, separation
distance, and collision angle of the initial conditions that have been shown to
produce the Bullet Cluster in non-cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The
probability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with $M_{\rm
halo}\geq10^{14} M_{\odot}$ is $4.6\times 10^{-4}$ using ROCKSTAR, while it is
$\approx 34\times$ lower using a friends-of-friends (FOF) based approach as in
previous studies. This is because the typical spatial extent of Bullet
progenitors is such that FOF tends to group them into a single halo despite
clearly distinct kinematics. Further requiring an appropriately high average
mass among the two progenitors, we find the comoving number density of
potential Bullet-like candidates to be on the order of $\approx10^{-10} \,{\rm
Mpc}^{-3}$. Our findings suggest that $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ straightforwardly
produces massive, high relative velocity halo pairs analogous to Bullet Cluster
progenitors, and hence the Bullet Cluster does not present a challenge to the
$\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ model.

mass-to-light ratio referenced to Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) models
of the same age and metallicity, $\Upsilon_*/\Upsilon_{Sal}$, using new UV
magnitude measurements for a much larger sample of early-type galaxies, ETGs,
with dynamically determined mass-to-light ratios. We confirm the principal
empirical finding of our first study, a strong correlation between the GALEX
FUV-NUV colour and $\Upsilon_*$. We show that this finding is not the result of
spectral distortions limited to a single passband (eg. metallicity-dependent
line-blanketing in the NUV band), or of the analysis methodology used to
measure $\Upsilon_*$, or of the inclusion or exclusion of the correction for
stellar population effects as accounted for using $\Upsilon_*/\Upsilon_{Sal}$.
The sense of the correlation is that galaxies with larger $\Upsilon_*$, or
larger $\Upsilon_*/\Upsilon_{Sal}$, are bluer in the UV. We conjecture that
differences in the low mass end of the stellar initial mass function, IMF, are
related to the nature of the extreme horizontal branch stars generally
responsible for the UV flux in ETGs. If so, then UV color can be used to
identify ETGs with particular IMF properties and to estimate $\Upsilon_*$. We
also demonstrate that UV colour can be used to decrease the scatter about the
Fundamental Plane and Manifold, and to select peculiar galaxies for follow-up
with which to further explore the cause of variations in $\Upsilon_*$ and UV
colour.

field theories, namely field theories taking value in a field theory in one

theory is extended down to codimension 2, familiar facts about Hamiltonian
anomalies can be naturally recovered, such as the fact that the anomalous
symmetry group admits only a projective representation on the state space, or
that the latter is really an abelian gerbe rather than an ordinary Hilbert
space. We include in the discussion the case of non-invertible anomaly field
theories, which is relevant to six-dimensional (2,0) superconformal theories.
In this case, we show that the Hamiltonian anomaly is characterized by a degree
2 non-abelian group cohomology class, associated to the non-abelian gerbe
playing the role of the state space of the anomalous theory. We construct
Dai-Freed theories, governing the anomalies of chiral fermionic theories, and
Wess-Zumino theories, governing the anomalies of Wess-Zumino terms, as extended
field theories down to codimension 2.

from the near-ultraviolet to the I-band, with the Wide Field Camera 3, plus
parallel optical imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys, is being
collected for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 Mpc. The
filters used for the observations with the Wide Field Camera 3 are: F275W(2,704
A), F336W(3,355 A), F438W(4,325 A), F555W(5,308 A), and F814W(8,024 A); the
parallel observations with the Advanced Camera for Surveys use the filters:
F435W(4,328 A), F606W(5,921 A), and F814W(8,057 A). The multi-band images are
yielding accurate recent (<~50 Myr) star formation histories from resolved
massive stars and the extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters and
associations. The extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systems
will be used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of star
formation within galaxies. This will, in turn, inform theories of galaxy
evolution and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of the
gas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high redshift.
This paper describes the survey, its goals and observational strategy, and the
initial science results. Because LEGUS will provide a reference survey and a
foundation for future observations with JWST and with ALMA, a large number of
data products are planned for delivery to the community.

nucleosynthesis in intermediate-mass AGB models, including a super-AGB model,
of [Fe/H] = $-1.2$. We examine in detail a low-mass AGB model of 2 M$_{\odot}$
where the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,$n$)$^{16}$O reaction is the main source of
neutrons. We also examine an intermediate-mass AGB model of 5 M$_{\odot}$ where
intershell temperatures are high enough to activate the $^{22}$Ne neutron
source, which produces high neutron densities up to $\sim 10^{14}$ n cm$^{-3}$.
Hot bottom burning is activated in models with $M \geq 3$ M$_{\odot}$. With the
3 M$_{\odot}$ model we investigate the effect of varying the extent in mass of
the region where protons are mixed from the envelope into the intershell at the
deepest extent of each third dredge-up. We compare the results of the low-mass
models to three post-AGB stars with a metallicity of [Fe/H] $\simeq -1.2$. The
composition is a good match to the predicted neutron-capture abundances except
for Pb and we confirm that the observed Pb abundances are lower than what is
calculated by AGB models.

accessing a multi-channel system. The SU senses the channels sequentially to
detect if a primary user (PU) is occupying the channels, and stops its search
to access a channel if it offers a significantly high throughput. The optimal
stopping rule and power control problem is considered. The problem is
formulated as a SU's throughput-maximization problem under a power,
interference and packet delay constraints. We first show the effect of the
optimal stopping rule on the packet delay, then solve this optimization problem
for both the overlay system where the SU transmits only at the spectrum holes
as well as the underlay system where tolerable interference (or tolerable
collision probability) is allowed. We provide closed-form expressions for the

work to multiple SU scenario and show that when the number of SUs is large the
complexity of the solution becomes smaller than that of the single SU case. We
discuss the application of this problem in typical networks where packets
arrive simultaneously and have the same departure deadline. We further propose
an online adaptation policy to the optimal stopping rule that meets the
packets' hard-deadline constraint and, at the same time, gives higher

the fact that the galaxies lie on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, suggests
that HIGHz systems are rare, scaled-up versions of local disk galaxies. We show

instabilities via spin transfer torques (STT). At interface(s), spin current
generated from the spin Hall effect in a neighboring layer can exert torques,
referred to as the spin Hall torques, on the magnetic moments. Here, we study
current induced magnetization switching in perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB/MgO
heterostructures with a heavy metal (HM) underlayer. Depending on the thickness
of the HM underlayer, we find distinct differences in the inplane field
dependence of the threshold switching current. The STT is likely responsible
for the magnetization reversal for the thinner underlayer films whereas the
spin Hall torques cause the switching for thicker underlayer films. For the
latter, we find differences in the switching current for positive and negative

during the film deposition introduces an anisotropy that breaks the symmetry of
the system and causes the asymmetric switching. The presence of such symmetry
breaking anisotropy enables deterministic magnetization switching at zero

recently drawn a lot of attention due to its unique optoelectronic properties
and ambipolar transport behavior. However, direct chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) synthesis of 2D WSe2 is not as straightforward as other 2D materials due
to the low reactivity between reactants in WSe2 synthesis. In addition, the
growth mechanism of WSe2 in such CVD process remains unclear. Here we report
the observation of a screw-dislocation-driven (SDD) spiral growth of 2D WSe2
flakes and pyramid-like structures using a sulfur-assisted CVD method.
Few-layer and pyramid-like WSe2 flakes instead of monolayer were synthesized by
introducing a small amount of sulfur as a reducer to help the selenization of
WO3, which is the precursor of tungsten. Clear observations of steps, helical
fringes, and herring-bone contours under atomic force microscope
characterization reveal the existence of screw dislocations in the as-grown
WSe2. The generation and propagation mechanisms of screw dislocations during
the growth of WSe2 were discussed. Back-gated field-effect transistors were
made on these 2D WSe2 materials, which show on/off current ratios of 106 and
mobility up to 44 cm2/Vs.

988 TeO$_2$ bolometers for a total mass of about 741 kg. The detector is being
constructed at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy, where it will
start taking data in 2015. If the target background of 0.01
counts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$y) will be reached, in five years of data taking
CUORE will have an half life sensitivity around $1\times 10^{26}$ y at 90\%
C.L. As a first step towards CUORE a smaller experiment CUORE-0, constructed to
test and demonstrate the performances expected for CUORE, has been assembled

motion tracking so that they have gained popularity in recent years. However,
conventional methods tend to use a two-stage sampling paradigm, in which the
search space needs to be uniformly explored with an inefficient preliminary
sampling phase. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based method in the
Bayesian filtering framework to address the problem. Within the framework,
nearest neighbor field estimation is utilized to compute the importance
proposal probabilities, which guide the Markov chain search towards promising
regions and thus enhance the sampling efficiency; given the motion priors, a
smoothing stochastic sampling Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to approximate
the posterior distribution through a smoothing weight-updating scheme.
Moreover, to track the abrupt and the smooth motions simultaneously, we develop
an abrupt-motion detection scheme which can discover the presence of abrupt
motions during online tracking. Extensive experiments on challenging image
sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our algorithm in
handling the abrupt motions.

dimensional geometry typically produces complex fingering patterns. Because
interfacial tension suppresses short-wavelength fluctuations, its elimination
by using pairs of miscible fluids would suggest an instability producing highly
ramified singular structures. Previous studies focused on wavelength selection
at the instability onset and overlooked the striking features appearing more
globally. Here we investigate the non-linear growth that occurs after the
instability has been fully established. We find a rich variety of patterns that
are characterized by the viscosity ratio between the inner and the outer fluid,
$\eta_{in}$/$\eta_{out}$, as distinct from the most-unstable wavelength, which
determines the onset of the instability. As $\eta_{in}$/$\eta_{out}$ increases,
a regime dominated by long highly-branched fractal fingers gives way to one
dominated by blunt stable structures characteristic of proportionate growth.
Simultaneously, a central region of complete outer-fluid displacement grows
until it encompasses the entire pattern at
$\eta_{in}$/$\eta_{out}$$\approx$0.3.

different water-alcohol mixtures and show that this phenomenon is due to two
distinct solvation contributions governing the phase behavior of PNiPAM in the
water-rich and alcohol-rich regime respectively. While hydrophobic hydration is
the predominant contribution governing the phase behavior of PNiPAM in the
water-rich regime, the mixing contributions governing the phase behavior of
classical polymer solutions determine the phase behavior of PNiPAM in the
alcohol-rich regime. This is evidenced by distinct scaling relations denoting
the energetic state of the aqueous medium as a key parameter for the phase
behavior of PNiPAM in the water-rich regime, while the volume fractions of
respectively water, alcohol and PNiPAM become relevant parameters in the
alcohol-rich regime. Adding alcohol to water decreases the energetics of the
aqueous medium, which gradually suppresses hydrophobic hydration, while adding
water to alcohol decreases the solvent quality. Consequently, PNiPAM is
insoluble in the intermediate range of solvent composition, where neither
hydrophobic hydration nor the mixing contributions prevail. This accounts for
the co-nonsolvency phenomenon observed for PNiPAM in water-alcohol mixtures.

existing POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope in the Simons Array on Cerro
Toco in the Atacama desert of Chile. For increased sensitivity, it will feature
a larger area focal plane, with a total of 7,588 polarization sensitive
antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers, with a design
sensitivity of 4.1 uKrt(s). The focal plane will be cooled to 250 milliKelvin,
and the bolometers will be read-out with 40x frequency domain multiplexing,
with 36 optical bolometers on a single SQUID amplifier, along with 2 dark
bolometers and 2 calibration resistors. To increase the multiplexing factor
from 8x for POLARBEAR-1 to 40x for POLARBEAR-2 requires additional bandwidth
for SQUID readout and well-defined frequency channel spacing. Extending to
these higher frequencies requires new components and design for the LC filters
which define channel spacing. The LC filters are cold resonant circuits with an
inductor and capacitor in series with each bolometer, and stray inductance in
the wiring and equivalent series resistance from the capacitors can affect
bolometer operation. We present results from characterizing these new readout
components. Integration of the readout system is being done first on a small
scale, to ensure that the readout system does not affect bolometer sensitivity

Time-resolved terahertz photoconductivity measurements using a tunable
mid-infrared pump probed these samples at photon energies between 0.35eV to
1.55eV, approximately one half to three times the Fermi energy of the samples.
Although interband optical transitions in graphene are blocked for pump photon
energies less than twice the Fermi energy, we observe negative
photoconductivity at all pump photon energies investigated, indicating that
interband excitation is not required to observe this effect. Our results are
consistent with a thermalized free carrier population that cools by
electron-phonon scattering, but inconsistent with models of negative
photoconductivity based on population inversion.

transmit-and-receive node pairs communicate within a certain range while
sharing a common spectrum. By modeling the spatial locations of nodes based on
stochastic geometry, analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency
of a typical node pair are derived as a function of the channel state
information available at a receiver (CSIR) in terms of relevant system
parameters: the density of communication links, the number of receive antennas,
the path loss exponent, and the operating signal-to-noise ratio. One key
finding is that when the receiver only exploits CSIR for the direct link, the
sum of spectral efficiencies linearly improves as the density increases, when
the number of receive antennas increases as a certain super-linear function of
the density. When each receiver exploits CSIR for a set of dominant interfering
links in addition to the direct link, the sum of spectral efficiencies linearly
increases with both the density and the path loss exponent if the number of
antennas is a linear function of the density. This observation demonstrates
that having CSIR for dominant interfering links provides a multiplicative gain
in the scaling law. It is also shown that this linear scaling holds for direct
CSIR when incorporating the effect of the receive antenna correlation, provided
that the rank of the spatial correlation matrix scales super-linearly with the
density. Simulation results back scaling laws derived from stochastic geometry.

the target clusters. The data have been collected using FORS2 mounted at the
ESO/VLT@UT1 telescope in UBVI filters. From these data sets we extracted
high-accuracy photometry and constructed color-magnitude diagrams. We exploit
appropriate combination of colors and magnitudes which are powerful tools to
identify multiple stellar populations, like B versus U-B and V versus
c_{U,B,I}=(U-B)-(B-I) CMDs. We confirm previous findings of a split MS in NGC
6752 and NGC 6121. Apart from the extreme case of omega Centauri, this is the
first detection of multiple MS from ground-based photometry. For NGC 6752 and
NGC 6121 we compare the number ratio of the blue MS to the red MS in the
cluster outskirts with the fraction of first and second generation stars
measured in the central regions. There is no evidence for significant radial
trend. The MS of NGC 6397 is consistent with a simple stellar population. We
propose that the lack of multiple sequences is due both to observational errors
and to the limited sensitivity of U,B,V,I photometry to multiple stellar
populations in metal-poor GCs. Finally, we compute the helium abundance for the
stellar populations hosted by NGC 6121 and NGC 6752, finding a mild (Delta Y ~

algorithm is known for the problem for constant $\delta> 0$. This is true even
for certain special cases, most notably the restricted assignment problem where
each job has the same load on any machine but can be assigned to one from a
specified subset. Recently in a breakthrough result, Svensson [Svensson, 2011]
proved that the integrality gap of a certain configuration LP relaxation is
upper bounded by $1.95$ for the restricted assignment problem; however, the
rounding algorithm is not known to run in polynomial time.
  In this paper we consider the $(1,\varepsilon)$-restricted assignment problem
where each job is either heavy ($p_j = 1$) or light ($p_j = \varepsilon$), for
some parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. Our main result is a $(2-\delta)$-approximate
polynomial time algorithm for the $(1,\epsilon)$-restricted assignment problem
for a fixed constant $\delta> 0$. Even for this special case, the best
polynomial-time approximation factor known so far is 2. We obtain this result
by rounding the configuration LP relaxation for this problem. A simple

R_e/2 < R < R_e, where R_e is the spheroids' effective half light radius.
However there are some interesting differences. We find a median ""inner""
ellipticity at R_b of e_med = 0.13 +- 0.01, rounder than the median ellipticity
of the ""outer"" regions e_med = 0.20 +- 0.01, which is thought to reflect the
influence of the central supermassive black hole at small radii. In addition,
for the first time we find a trend, albeit weak (2 sigma significance), such
that galaxies with larger (stellar deficit)-to- (supermassive black hole) mass
ratios---thought to be a measure of the number of major dry merger
events---tend to have rounder inner and outer isophotes, suggesting a
connection between the galaxy shapes and their merger histories. We show that
this finding is not simply reflecting the well known result that more luminous
galaxies are rounder, but it is no doubt related.

two-component model matches the dust spectrum near its peak, accounts for the
spectrum's flattening at millimeter wavelengths, and specifies dust temperature
at 6.1' FWHM, our model provides reliable, high-resolution thermal dust
emission foreground predictions from 100 to 3000 GHz. We find that, in diffuse
sky regions, our two-component 100-217 GHz predictions are on average accurate
to within 2.2%, while extrapolating the Planck Collaboration (2013a) single-MBB

spending as little sensing energy. We introduce a dynamic programming framework
which enables the characterization of an explicit solution for several models,
particularly when the OFF periods are exponentially distributed. While the
problem for non-exponential OFF periods is ill-posed in general, a usual
workaround in literature is to make the mobile device aware if one ON period is
completely missed. In this restricted setting, using the DP framework, the
deterministic nature of the optimal sensing policy is established, and value
iterations are shown to converge to the optimal solution. Finally, we address
the blind situation where the distributions of ON and OFF periods are unknown.

that the carbon atoms close to pyridinic nitrogen are the main active sites

and division of data points into weak and strong field ranges to compare the
contributions from different scales and field strengths. We found that the
current helicity follows the so-called hemispheric sign rule when the weak
magnetic fields (absolute field strength $< 300$ gauss) are considered and no
smoothing is applied. On the other hand, the pattern of current helicity
fluctuates and violates the hemispheric sign rule when stronger magnetic fields
are considered and the smoothing of 2.0 arcsec (mimicking ground-based
observations) is applied. Furthermore, we found a tendency that the weak and
inclined fields better conform to and the strong and vertical fields tend to
violate the hemispheric sign rule. These different properties of helicity

broad line flux for the broad balmer lines of the long-term observed AGN PG
1613+658. Rather than the expected negative correlations under the widely
accepted virialization assumption for AGN BLRs, the positive correlations
indicate much different BLR structures of PG 1613+658 from the commonly
considered BLR structures which are dominated by the equilibrium between
radiation pressure and gas pressure. Therefore, accretion disk origin is
preferred for the observed broad single-peaked optical balmer lines of PG
1613+658, because of the mainly gravity dominated disk-like BLRs with radial
structures having few effects from radiation pressure.

brought a secure and efficient way to meet the challenges of secure multimedia

Grayscale image encryption methodology in wavelet domain. The proposed
algorithm performs shuffling followed by encryption using states of chaotic map
in a secure manner. Firstly, the image is transformed from spatial domain to
wavelet domain by the Haar wavelet. Subsequently, Fisher Yates chaotic
shuffling technique is employed to shuffle the image in wavelet domain to
confuse the relationship between plain image and cipher image. A key dependent
piece-wise linear chaotic map is used to generate chaos for the chaotic
shuffling. Further, the resultant shuffled approximate coefficients are
chaotically modulated. To enhance the statistical characteristics from
cryptographic point of view, the shuffled image is self keyed diffused and
mixing operation is carried out using keystream extracted from one-dimensional
chaotic map and the plain-image. The proposed algorithm is tested over some
standard image dataset. The results of several experimental, statistical and

multi-component analysis where one component is a blackbody representing
emission from a photosphere has enabled both a more detailed understanding of
the energy content of the jet as well as the ability to examine the dynamic
structure of the outflow. While the existence of a blackbody-like component has
been shown to be significant and not a byproduct of background fluctuations, it
is very possible that it can be an artifact of spectral evolution of a single
component that is being poorly resolved in time. Herein, this possibility is
tested by simulating a single component evolving in time and then folding the
spectra through the $Fermi$ detector response to generate time-tagged event
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data. We then fit both the time integrated and
resolved generated spectral data with a multi-component model using standard
tools. It is found that in {\it time-integrated} spectra, a blackbody can be
falsely identified due to the spectral curvature introduced by the spectral
evolution. However, in time-resolved analysis defined by time bins that can
resolve the evolution of the spectra, the significance of the falsely
identified blackbody is very low. Additionally, the evolution of the artificial
blackbody parameters does not match the recurring behavior that has been
identified in the actual observations. These results reinforce the existence of
the blackbody found in {\it time-resolved} analysis of GRBs and stress the
point that caution should be taken when using time-integrated spectral analysis

difficulties and ill-posedness of the statistical problem. New estimation
methods that use some nonparametric devices have been proposed to circumvent
these issues. We present a new estimator that shares properties with Two-Step
estimator and Generalized Smoothing (introduced by Ramsay et al, 2007). We
introduce a perturbed model and we use optimal control theory for constructing
a criterion that aims at minimizing the discrepancy with data and the model.
Here, we focus on the case of linear Ordinary Differential Equations as our
criterion has a closed-form expression that permits a detailed analysis. Our
approach avoids the use of a nonparametric estimator of the derivative, which
is one of the main cause of inaccuracy in Two-Step estimators. Moreover, we
take into account model discrepancy and our estimator is more robust to model
misspecification than classical methods. The discrepancy with the parametric
ODE model correspond to the minimum perturbation (or control) to apply to the
initial model. Its qualitative analysis can be informative for misspecification
diagnosis. In the case of well-specified model, we show the consistency of our
estimator and that we reach the parametric root-n rate when regression splines

interactions between nearest-neighbor sites, $J_1$, and those between
next-nearest-neighbor sites, $J_2$. We perform variational Monte Carlo
simulations together with the quantum-number-projection technique and clarify
the phase diagram in the ground state together with its excitation spectra. We
obtain the nonmagnetic phase in the region $0.4< J_2/J_1\le 0.6$ sandwiched by
the staggered and stripe antiferromagnetic (AF) phases. Our direct calculations
of the spin gap support the notion that the triplet excitation from the singlet
ground state is gapless in the range of $0.4 < J_2/J_1 \le 0.5$, while the
gapped valence-bond-crystal (VBC) phase is stabilized for $0.5 < J_2/J_1 \le
0.6$. The VBC order is likely to have the columnar symmetry with a spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the $C_{4v}$ symmetry. The power-law behaviors of the
spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlation functions in the gapless region are
consistent with the emergence of the algebraic quantum-spin-liquid phase
(critical phase). The exponent of the spin correlation $\langle S(0)S(r)\rangle
\propto 1/r^{z+\eta}$ at a long distance $r$ appears to increase from
$z+\eta\sim 1$ at $J_2/J_1\sim0.4$ toward the continuous transition to the VBC
phase at $J_1/J_1\sim0.5$. Our results, however, do not fully exclude the
possibility of a direct quantum transition between the staggered AF and VBC
phases with a wide critical region and deconfined criticality.

modeling complex systems. Parameter estimation from times series can be done by
Nonlinear Least Squares (or other classical approaches), but this can give
unsatisfactory results because the inverse problem can be ill-posed, even when
the differential equation is linear.
  Following recent approaches that use approximate solutions of the ODE model,
we propose a new method that converts parameter estimation into an optimal
control problem: our objective is to determine a control and a parameter that
are as close as possible to the data. We derive then a criterion that makes a
balance between discrepancy with data and with the model, and we minimize it by
using optimization in functions spaces: our approach is related to the
so-called Deterministic Kalman Filtering, but different from the usual
statistical Kalman filtering. e show the root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic
normality of the estimators for the parameter and for the states. Experiments
in a toy model and in a real case shows that our approach is generally more
accurate and more reliable than Nonlinear Least Squares and Generalized
Smoothing, even in misspecified cases.

distribution relative to the rearrangement energy threshold. The process
whereby a CRR changes its configuration is viewed as consisting of two distinct
steps: a reduced number of monomers reaches initially an activated state
allowing for some local rearrangement; then, the regression of the energy
fluctuation may take place through the configurational degrees of freedom, thus
allowing for further rearrangements on larger length-scales. The latter are
indeed those to which the well known Donth's scheme refers. Two main regimes
are envisaged, depending on wether the role played by the configurational
degrees of freedom in the regression of the energy fluctuation is significant

arrhenian dependence of the central relaxation time. Data of the literature are

a consequence, alternative estimators to classical parametric estimators are
needed for obtaining reliable estimates. We propose a gradient matching
approach for the estimation of parametric Ordinary Differential Equations
observed with noise. Starting from a nonparametric proxy of a true solution of
the ODE, we build a parametric estimator based on a variational
characterization of the solution. As a Generalized Moment Estimator, our
estimator must satisfy a set of orthogonal conditions that are solved in the
least squares sense. Despite the use of a nonparametric estimator, we prove the

the asymptotic variance. Finally, the OC estimator is compared to classical
estimators in several (simulated and real) experiments and ODE models in order
to show its versatility and relevance with respect to classical Gradient
Matching and Nonlinear Least Squares estimators. In particular, we show on a

exponentially with the number of quantum degrees of freedom. Efforts to
circumvent these limitations can be traced down to two approaches: methods that
treat a small subset of the degrees of freedom with rigorous quantum mechanics,
considering the rest of the system as a static or classical environment, and
methods that treat the whole system quantum mechanically, but using approximate
dynamics. Here we perform a systematic comparison between these two
philosophies for the description of quantum effects in vibrational
spectroscopy, taking the Embedded Local Monomer (LMon) model and a mixed
quantum-classical (MQC) model as representatives of the first family of
methods, and centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) and thermostatted ring polymer

exceptions the different techniques yield IR absorption frequencies that are
consistent with one another within a few tens of cm$^{-1}$. Comparison with
classical molecular dynamics demonstrates the importance of nuclear quantum
effects up to the highest temperature, and a detailed discussion of the
discrepancies between the various methods let us draw some (circumstantial)
conclusions about the impact of the very different approximations that underlie
them. Such cross validation between radically different approaches could
indicate a way forward to further improve the state of the art in simulations

investigate total correlation in the evolution of elementary CA for all update
rules that are unique with respect to negation or reflection. For each rule we
consider the usual, deterministic CA behavior, assuming that the initial state
is chosen uniformly at random, and also the probabilistic variant in which
every cell, at all time steps and independently of all others, disobeys the

central problem in systems biology. Alignments between these networks aid
functional understanding as they uncover important information, such as
evolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs.
The objective of a multiple network alignment is to create clusters of nodes
that are evolutionarily conserved and functionally consistent across all
networks. Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not fully
meet this objective, as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize
the entire functional and topological information across all networks. To
overcome this weakness, we propose FUSE, a multiple network aligner that
utilizes all functional and topological information in all PPI networks. It
works in two steps. First, it computes novel similarity scores of proteins
across the PPI networks by fusing from all aligned networks both the protein
wiring patterns and their sequence similarities. It does this by using
Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF). When we apply NMTF on the five
largest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF finds a
larger number of protein pairs across the PPI networks that are functionally
conserved than can be found by using protein sequence similarities alone. This
demonstrates complementarity of protein sequence and their wiring patterns in
the PPI networks. In the second step, FUSE uses a novel maximum weight
k-partite matching approximation algorithm to find an alignment between
multiple networks. We compare FUSE with the state of the art multiple network
aligners and show that it produces the largest number of functionally
consistent clusters that cover all aligned PPI networks. Also, FUSE is more
computationally efficient than other multiple network aligners.

the effect of superconductivity enhancement by microwave field is common and

enhancement by microwave irradiation in wide films can be described by the
Eliashberg theory, which was used to explain the same phenomenon in narrow

derive the age of the Cepheids. A break in the PL relations of the

suggesting that stars that originated in the inner Galaxy have fewer refractory

peculiarities (small refractory-to-volatile ratio) of planet-hosting stars is

transmission spectrum which is apparent at wavelengths $>0.52\mu$m. The cloud
deck is present at high altitudes and low pressures, as it covers the majority
of the expected optical Na line and near-IR H$_2$O features. While Na I
absorption is not clearly identified, the resulting spectrum does show a very
strong potassium feature detected at the 4.2-$\sigma$ confidence level.
Broadened alkali wings are not detected, indicating pressures below $\sim$10
mbar. The lack of Na and strong K is the first indication of a sub-solar Na/K
abundance ratio in a planetary atmosphere (ln[Na/K]$=-3.3\pm2.8$), which could
potentially be explained by Na condensation on the planet's night side, or
primordial abundance variations. A strong Rayleigh scattering signature is
detected at short wavelengths, with a 4-$\sigma$ significant slope. Two
distinct aerosol size populations can explain the spectra, with a smaller
sub-micron size grain population reaching high altitudes producing a blue
Rayleigh scattering signature on top of a larger, lower-lying population
responsible for the flat cloud deck at longer wavelengths. We estimate that the
atmospheric circulation is sufficiently strong to mix micron size particles
upward to the required 1-10 mbar pressures, necessary to explain the cloud
deck. These results further confirm the importance of clouds in hot-Jupiters,

galaxies to probe the turbulence of the ionized gas in these objects,
particularly using Space VLBI with baselines of 350,000 km at frequencies below

intergalatic scatter broadening can be of order $\sim 100\, \mu$as at 1 GHz and
$\sim 3\, \mu$as at 5 GHz for outer scales $\sim 1$ kpc, assuming a

constructed using nested LDA lattices can achieve the capacity of the power
constrained AWGN channel, the capacity of the dirty paper channel, the rates
guaranteed by the compute-and-forward protocol, and the best known rates for
bidirectional relaying with perfect secrecy.

transformation is used to map a deformed crystal back to geometrically
undeformed structure with deformed crystal potential. The single-particle
Schr\""{o}dinger equation is solved in the undeformed coordinates using envelope
function expansion, wherein electronic wavefunctions are written in terms of
strain-parametrized Bloch functions modulated by slowly varying envelope
functions. Adopting local approximation of electronic structure, the unknown
crystal potential in Schr\""{o}dinger equation can be replaced by the
strain-parametrized Bloch functions and the associated strain-parametrized
energy eigenvalues, which can be constructed from unit-cell level ab initio or
semi-empirical calculations of homogeneously deformed crystals at a chosen
crystal momentum. The Schr\""{o}dinger equation is then transformed into a
coupled differential equation for the envelope functions and solved as a
generalized matrix eigenvector problem. As the envelope functions are slowly
varying, coarse spatial or Fourier grid can be used to represent the envelope
functions, enabling the method to treat relatively large systems. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method using a one-dimensional model,
where we show that the method can achieve high accuracy in the calculation of
energy eigenstates with relatively low cost compared to direct diagonalization
of Hamiltonian. We further derive envelope function equations that allow the
method to be used empirically, in which case certain parameters in the envelope
function equations will be fitted to experimental data.

found in many reaction networks that involve the control and execution of
important biological functions, such as signalling processes. Positive feedback
loops, composed of species and reactions, are necessary for bistability, and
generally for multi-stationarity, to occur. These loops are therefore often
used to illustrate and pinpoint the parts of a multi-stationary network that
are relevant (`responsible') for the observed multi-stationarity. However
positive feedback loops are generally abundant in reaction networks but not all
of them are important for subsequent interpretation of the network's dynamics.
  We present an automated procedure to determine the relevant positive feedback
loops of a multi-stationary reaction network. The procedure only reports the
loops that are relevant for multi-stationarity (that is, when broken
multi-stationarity disappears) and not all positive feedback loops of the
network. We show that the relevant positive feedback loops must be understood
in the context of the network (one loop might be relevant for one network, but
cannot create multi-stationarity in another). Finally, we demonstrate the
procedure by applying it to several examples of signaling processes, including
a ubiquitination and an apoptosis network, and to models extracted from the
Biomodels database.
  We have developed and implemented an automated procedure to find relevant
positive feedback loops in reaction networks. The results of the procedure are
useful for interpretation and summary of the network's dynamics.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has produced a myriad of possible models that have the
potential of explaining the observations. Generally, the empirical Band
function is fit to the observed gamma-ray data and the fit parameters are used
to infer which radiative mechanisms are at work in GRB outflows. In particular,
the distribution of the Band function's low-energy power law index, $\alpha$,
has led to the so-called synchrotron ""line-of-death"" (LOD) which is a statement
that the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models
alone. As an alternatively fitting model, a combination of a blackbody in
addition to the Band function is used, which in many cases provide a better or
equally good fit. It has been suggested that such fits would be able to
alleviate the LOD problem for synchrotron emission in GRBs. However, these
conclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum
within the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case,
we simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through
the instrumental response of the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We then
perform a standard data analysis by fitting the simulated data with both Band
and Band+blackbody models. We find two important results: the synchrotron LOD
is actually more severe than the original predictions: $\alpha_{\bf LOD} \sim
-0.8$. Moreover, we find that intrinsic synchrotron+blackbody emission is
insufficient to account for the entire observed $\alpha$ distribution. This
implies that some other emission mechanism(s) are required to explain a large
fraction of observed GRBs.

one dimensional lattice, it becomes subject to a dissipation that converts the
kinetic energy into lattice vibrations. Eventually the kinetic energy does no
longer enable the excitation to cross over the minimum energy barrier between
neighboring sites, and the excitation becomes localized within a lattice cell.
In the case of a protein, the lattice structure consists of the C-alpha
backbone. The self-localized quasiparticle excitation is the elemental building
block of loops. It can be modeled by a kink which solves a variant of the
discrete non-linear Schroedinger equation (DNLS). We study the propagation of
such a kink in the case of protein G related albumin-binding domain, using the
UNRES coarse-grained molecular dynamics force field. We estimate the height of
the energy barriers the kink needs to cross over, in order to propagate along
the backbone lattice. We analyse how these barriers gives rise to both stresses
and reliefs which control the kink movement. For this, we deform a natively
folded protein structure by parallel translating the kink along the backbone
away from its native position. We release the transposed kink, and we follow
how it propagates along the backbone towards the native location. We observe
that the dissipative forces which are exerted on the kink by the various energy
barriers, have a pivotal role in determining how a protein folds towards its
native state.

scaling laws for convective heat flow, mantle velocity, and plate velocity
across the stagnant lid and plate-tectonic regimes. Three main cases are
presented in order of increasing complexity: a simple case wherein viscosity is
only dependent on grainsize, a case where viscosity depends on temperature and
grainsize, and finally a case where viscosity is temperature and grainsize
sensitive, and the grain-growth (or healing) is also temperature sensitive. In
all cases, convection with grain-damage scales differently than Newtonian
convection due to the effects of grain-damage. For the fully realistic case,
numerical results show stagnant lid convection, fully mobilized convection that
resembles the temperature-independent viscosity case, and partially mobile or
transitional convection, depending on damage to healing ratio, Rayleigh number,
and the activation energies for viscosity and healing. Applying our scaling
laws for the fully realistic case to Earth and Venus we demonstrate that
increasing surface temperature dramatically decreases plate speed and heat
flow, essentially shutting down plate tectonics, due to increased healing in
lithospheric shear zones, as proposed previously. Contrary to many previous
studies, the transitional regime between the stagnant lid and fully mobilized
regimes is large, and the transition from stagnant lid to mobile convection is
gradual and continuous. Thus planets could exhibit a full range of surface
mobility, as opposed to the bimodal distribution of fully mobile lid planets
and stagnant lid planets that is typically assumed.

detected in Data Release 10 (DR10) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Among them, we found one more member of the so-called hot-wind DO WDs, which
show ultrahigh excitation absorption lines. Our non-LTE model atmosphere
analyses of these objects and two not previously analyzed hot-wind DO WDs,
revealed effective temperatures and gravities in the ranges Teff=45-80kK and
log g= 7.50-8.75. In eight of the spectra we found traces of C (0.001-0.01, by
mass). Two of these are the coolest DO WDs ever discovered that still show a
considerable amount of C in their atmospheres. This is in strong contradiction
with diffusion calculations, and probably, similar to what is proposed for DB
WDs, a weak mass-loss is present in DO WDs. One object is the most massive DO
WD discovered so far with a mass of 1.07 M_sun if it is an ONe-WD or 1.09 M_sun
if it is a CO-WD. We furthermore present the mass distribution of all known hot
non-DA (pre-) WDs and derive the hot DA to non-DA ratio for the SDSS DR7
spectroscopic sample. The mass distribution of DO WDs beyond the wind limit
strongly deviates from the mass distribution of the objects before the wind
limit. We address this phenomenon by applying different evolutionary input
channels. We argue that the DO WD channel may be fed by about 13% by
post-extreme-horizontal branch stars and that PG1159 stars and O(He) stars may
contribute in a similar extent to the non-DA WD channel.

accretion rates that are higher than those that can be achieved via a standard
Bondi-Hoyle accretion. This implies that the wind mass transfer in symbiotic
binaries has to be more efficient.
  Aims: We suggest that the accretion rate onto the white dwarfs (WDs) in
S-type symbiotic binaries can be enhanced sufficiently by focusing the wind
from their slowly rotating normal giants towards the binary orbital plane.
  Methods: We applied the wind compression model to the stellar wind of slowly
rotating red giants in S-type symbiotic binaries.
  Results: Our analysis reveals that for typical terminal velocities of the
giant wind, 20 to 50 km/s, and measured rotational velocities between 6 and 10
km/s, the densities of the compressed wind at a typical distance of the
accretor from its donor correspond to the mass-loss rate, which can be a factor
of $\sim$10 higher than for the spherically symmetric wind. This allows the WD
to accrete at rates of $10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ M(Sun)/year, and thus to power its
luminosity.
  Conclusions: We show that the high wind-mass-transfer efficiency in S-type
symbiotic stars can be caused by compression of the wind from their slowly
rotating normal giants, whereas in D-type symbiotic stars, the high mass
transfer ratio can be achieved via the gravitational focusing, which has
recently been suggested for very slow winds in Mira-type binaries.

principle, be possible to measure the mass and cross sections of
weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. Recent work has shown
that, with a polynomial parameterisation of the WIMP speed distribution, it is
possible to make an unbiased measurement of the WIMP mass, without making any
astrophysical assumptions. However, direct detection experiments are not
sensitive to low-speed WIMPs and, therefore, any model-independent approach
will lead to a bias in the cross section. This problem can be solved with the
addition of measurements of the flux of neutrinos from the Sun. This is because
the flux of neutrinos produced from the annihilation of WIMPs which have been
gravitationally captured in the Sun is sensitive to low-speed WIMPs. Using mock
data from next-generation direct detection experiments and from the IceCube
neutrino telescope, we show that the complementary information from IceCube on
low-speed WIMPs breaks the degeneracy between the cross section and the speed
distribution. This allows unbiased determinations of the WIMP mass and
spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections to be made, and the speed
distribution to be reconstructed. We use two parameterisations of the speed
distribution: binned and polynomial. While the polynomial parameterisation can

  Partial Differential Equations","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an alternative to the perturbative diagrammatic approach for
studying stochastic dynamics. Our approach is based on an auxiliary field loop
expansion for the path integral representation for the generating functional of
the noise induced correlation functions. We derive two different effective
actions, one based on the Onsager-Machlup (OM) approach, and the other on the
Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) response function approach. In particular we determine
the leading order approximation for the effective action and effective
potential for arbitrary spatial dimensions for several simple systems. These
include the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, the chemical reaction
annihilation and diffusion process $A+A \rightarrow 0$, and the Ginzburg-Landau
(GL) model for spin relaxation. We show how to obtain the effective potential
of the OM approach from the effective potential in the MSR approach. For the
KPZ equation we find that our approximation, which is non-perturbative and
obeys broken symmetry Ward identities, does not lead to the appearance of a
fluctuation induced symmetry breakdown. This contradicts the results of earlier
studies. We also obtain some of the renormalization group flows directly from
the effective potential and compare our results with exact and perturbative
results.

a small length scale, since the material in this transition does not have a

using anisotropic mesh adaptation. We use the method of moving asymptotes with
interpolation of sensitivities, asymptotes and design variables between

suggest relaxing the L-bracket problem statement by introducing a rounded

based dependence measure using histogram density estimates. Finding a suitable
bin length for histogram is an open problem. We propose a new way of computing
the bin length for histogram using a function of maximum separation between
points. The chosen bin length leads to consistent density estimates for
histogram method. The values of density thus obtained are used to calculate an
estimate of an existing dependence measure. The proposed estimate is named as
Mutual Information Based Dependence Index (MIDI). Some important properties of
MIDI have also been stated. The performance of the proposed method has been
compared to generally accepted measures like Distance Correlation (dcor),
Maximal Information Coefficient (MINE) in terms of accuracy and computational
complexity with the help of several artificial data sets with different amounts
of noise. The proposed method is able to detect many types of relationships
between variables, without making any assumption about the functional form of
the relationship. The power statistics of proposed method illustrate their
effectiveness in detecting non linear relationship. Thus, it is able to achieve
generality without a high rate of false positive cases. MIDI is found to work
better on a real life data set than competing methods. The proposed method is
found to overcome some of the limitations which occur with dcor and MINE.
Computationally, MIDI is found to be better than dcor and MINE, in terms of
time and memory, making it suitable for large data sets.

The family satisfies for all $n = 4t$ an interesting property of the Kim

a permutation on $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$. As another contribution of the paper,
we consider a family of hexanomials $g_{C,k}$ which was shown to be
differentially $2^{\mathsf{gcd}(m,k)}$-uniform by Budaghyan and Carlet (2008)
when a quadrinomial $P_{C,k}$ has no roots in a specific subgroup. In this
paper, for all $(m,k)$ pairs, we characterize, construct and count all $C \in

Tan and Li (2014) constructed some elements $C$ satisfying the condition when

the phenomenology of a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) Dirac Dark
Matter candidate which is exothermic (i.e. is metastable and interacts with
nuclear targets down-scattering to a lower-mass state) and $Ge$-phobic (i.e.
whose couplings to quarks violate isospin symmetry leading to a suppression of
its cross section off Germanium targets). We discuss the specific example of
the CDMS-II Silicon three-candidate effect showing that a region of the
parameter space of the model exists where WIMP scatterings can explain the
excess in compliance with other experimental constraints, while at the same
time the Dark Matter particle can have a thermal relic density compatible with
observation. In this scenario the metastable state $\chi$ and the lowest-mass
one $\chi^{\prime}$ have approximately the same density in the present Universe
and in our Galaxy, but direct detection experiments are only sensitive to the
down-scatters of $\chi$ to $\chi^{\prime}$. We include a discussion of the
recently calculated Next-to-Leading Order corrections to Dark Matter-nucleus
scattering, showing that their impact on the phenomenology is typically small,
but can become sizable in the same parameter space where the thermal relic
density is compatible to observation.

endocytosis, strongly depends on nanoparticle size. There is an optimal size,
approximately 50 nm in diameter, at which cellular uptake is the highest. In
addition, there is a maximum size, approximately 200 nm, beyond which uptake
via receptor-mediated endocytosis does not occur. By comparing results from
different experiments, we found that these sizes weakly depend on the type of
cells, nanoparticles, and ligands used in the experiments. Here, we argue that
these observations are consequences of the energetics and assembly dynamics of
the protein coat that forms on the cytoplasmic side of the outer cell membrane
during receptor-mediated endocytosis. Specifically, we show that the energetics
of coat formation imposes an upper bound on the size of the nanoparticles that
can be internalized, whereas the nanoparticle-size-dependent dynamics of coat
assembly results in the optimal nanoparticle size. The weak dependence of the
optimal and maximum sizes on cell-nanoparticle-ligand type also follows
naturally from our analysis.

non-planar and simply connected type, and non-planar and non-simply connected
type. For each type, we make at least one algorithm to find the throats. Here I
introduce an example that has a non-planar and simply connected throat, and my

the throat for each path. It selects one of them, which has the smallest inner
