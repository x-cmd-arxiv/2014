dissolution-precipitation are widely encountered in energy and environment
systems. A pore-scale two-phase multi-mixture model based on the lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM) is developed for such complex transport processes, where
each phase is considered as a mixture of miscible components in it. The
liquid-gas fluid flow with large density ratio is simulated using the
multicomponent multiphase pseudo-potential LB model; the transport of certain
solute in the corresponding solvent is solved using the mass transport LB
model; and the dynamic evolutions of the liquid-solid interface due to
dissolution-precipitation are captured by an interface tracking scheme. The
model developed can predict coupled multiple physicochemical processes
including multiphase flow, multicomponent mass transport, homogeneous reactions
in the bulk fluid and heterogeneous dissolution-precipitation reactions at the
fluid-solid interface, and dynamic evolution of the solid matrix geometries at
the pore-scale. The model is then applied to a physicochemical system
encountered in shale gas/oil industry involving multiphase flow, multicomponent
reactive transport and dissolution-precipitation, with several reactions whose
rates can be several orders of magnitude different at a given temperature. The
pore-scale phenomena and complex interaction between different sub-processes
are investigated and discussed in detail.

spectrum in the framework of the covariant confined quark model. One of the
underlying principles of this model is the compositeness condition which means
that the wave function renormalization constant of the elementary hadron is
equal to zero. In particular, this equation allows to express the Yukawa
coupling of the meson fields to the constituent quarks as a function of other
model parameters. In addition to the compositeness condition we also employ a
further equation which relates the meson mass function to the Fermi coupling.
Both equations guarantee that the Yukawa-type theory is equivalent to the
Fermi-type theory thereby providing an interpretation of the meson field as the
bound state of its constituent fermions (quarks). We evaluate the
Fermi-coupling as a function of meson (pseudoscalar and vector) masses and vary
the values of the masses in such a way to obtain a smooth behavior for the
resulting curve. The mass spectrum obtained in this manner is found to be in
good agreement with the experimental data. We also compare the behavior of our
Fermi-coupling with the strong QCD coupling alpha_s calculated in an
QCD-inspired approach.

spin-down power, to a nearly force-free solution for high plasma multiplicity
characterized by a prominent equatorial current sheet and high spin-down power.
We find significant magnetic dissipation in the current sheet, up to 30% within
5 light-cylinder radii in the high-multiplicity regime. The simulations
unambiguously demonstrate that the dissipated Poynting flux is efficiently
channeled to the particles in the sheet, close to the Y-point within about 1-2
light cylinder radii from the star. The mean particle energy in the sheet is
given by the upstream plasma magnetization at the light cylinder. The study of
particle orbits shows that all energetic particles originate from the boundary

stream outward, while high-energy electrons precipitate back towards the star
through the sheet and along the separatrices, which may result in auroral-like

X}\sim10^{33}{\rm~erg~s}^{-1}$) revealed a hard power-law component
($\Gamma\sim1$-$1.5$) with a relatively low cut-off energy (~10 keV),
suggesting bremsstrahlung emission. The physical requirements for
bremsstrahlung combined with other observed properties of Cen X-4 suggest the
emission comes from a boundary layer rather than the accretion flow. The
accretion flow itself is thus undetected (with an upper limit of $L_{\rm
flow}\lesssim0.3 L_{\rm X}$). A deep search for coherent pulsations (which
would indicate a strong magnetic field) places a 6 per cent upper limit on the
fractional amplitude of pulsations, suggesting the flow is not magnetically
regulated. Considering the expected energy balance between the accretion flow
and the boundary layer for different values of the neutron star parameters
(size, magnetic field, and spin) we use the upper limit on $L_{\rm flow}$ to
set an upper limit of $\varepsilon\lesssim0.3$ for the intrinsic radiative
efficiency of the accretion flow for the most likely model of a fast-spinning,
non-magnetic neutron star. The non-detection of the accretion flow provides the
first direct evidence that this flow is indeed 'radiatively inefficient', i.e.
most of the gravitational potential energy lost by the flow before it hits the
star is not emitted as radiation.

  what happened at Saturn in 1983","53 Pages, 11 Figures, Accepted for publication in Icarus, Includes
  small corrections found in the proof stage",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2014.10.021",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous investigations of Saturn's outer D ring (73,200-74,000 km from
Saturn's center) identified periodic brightness variations whose radial
wavenumber increased linearly over time. This pattern was attributed to a
vertical corrugation, and its temporal variability implied that some event
--possibly an impact with interplanetary debris-- caused the ring to become
tilted out the planet's equatorial plane in 1983. This work examines these
patterns in greater detail using a more extensive set of Cassini images in
order to obtain additional insights into the 1983 event. These additional data
reveal that the D ring is not only corrugated, but also contains a
time-variable periodic modulation in its optical depth that probably represents
organized eccentric motions of the D-ring's particles. This second pattern
suggests that whatever event tilted the rings also disturbed the radial or
azimuthal velocities of the ring particles. Furthermore, the relative
amplitudes of the two patterns indicate that the vertical motions induced by
the 1983 event were 2.3+/-0.5 times larger than the corresponding in-plane
motions. If these structures were indeed produced by an impact, material would
need to strike the ring at a steep angle (more than 60 degrees from the ring
plane) to produce such motions. Meanwhile, the corrugation wavelengths in the D
ring are about 0.7% shorter than one would predict based on extrapolations from
similar structures in the nearby C ring. This could indicate that the D-ring
was tilted/disturbed about 60 days before the C ring. Such a timing difference
could be explained if the material that struck the ring was derived from debris
released when some object broke up near Saturn some months earlier. This debris
would need to have a substantial initial velocity dispersion and have its
orbital properties perturbed by solar tides prior to its collision with the
rings.

common criticism of LF tests is that they have poor detection limits compared
to analytical techniques, like ELISA, which confines their application as a
diagnostic tool. The low detection limit of LF assays and associated long
equilibration times is due to kinetically limited surface reactions that result
from low target concentrations. Here we use isotachophoresis (ITP), a powerful
electrokinetic preconcentration and separation technique, to focus target
analytes into a thin band and transport them to the LF capture line resulting
is a dramatic increase in the surface reaction rate and equilibrium binding. We
show that ITP is able to improve limit of detection (LOD) of LF assays by
400-fold for 90 second assay time and by 160-fold for a longer 5 minutes time
scale. ITP-enhanced LF (ITP-LF) also shows up to 30% target extraction from 100
uL of the sample, while conventional LF captures less than 1% of the target.
ITP improves LF assay LOD to the level of some lab based immunoassays, such as
ELISA, and may provide sufficient analytical sensitivity for application to a
broader range of analytes and diseases that require higher sensitivity and
lower detection limits.

insulators has been extensively studied and widely applied for decades in the
contexts of ferromagnetic resonance, and more recently of Bose-Einstein
condensation as well as spintronics. Moreover, towards hybrid systems for
quantum memories and transducers, coupling of magnons and microwave photons in
a resonator have been investigated. However, quantum-state manipulation at the
single-magnon level has remained elusive because of the lack of anharmonic
element in the system. Here we demonstrate coherent coupling between a magnon
excitation in a millimetre-sized ferromagnetic sphere and a superconducting
qubit, where the interaction is mediated by the virtual photon excitation in a
microwave cavity. We obtain the coupling strength far exceeding the damping
rates, thus bringing the hybrid system into the strong coupling regime.
Furthermore, we find a tunable magnon-qubit coupling scheme utilising a
parametric drive with a microwave. Our approach provides a versatile tool for
quantum control and measurement of the magnon excitations and thus opens a new

finite-energy waveforms. This paper presents a novel, resource-efficient method
for identifying the parametric description of such systems, i.e., the time
shifts, frequency shifts, and scalings, from the sampled response to linear
frequency modulated (LFM) waveforms, with emphasis on the application to radar
processing. If the LTV operator is probed with a sufficiently diverse set of
LFM waveforms, then the system can be identified with high accuracy. In the
case of noiseless measurements, the identification is perfect, while in the
case of noisy measurements, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the noise
level. The use of parametric estimation techniques with recently proposed
denoising algorithms allows the estimation of the parameters with high
accuracy.

The ac modulation changes the occupation of the Andreev bound states formed at
the constriction by transitions between bound states and the continuum. In a
short junction, the non-equilibrium Andreev bound state population may relax
through processes that conserve parity of the occupation number on the same
bound state and processes that do not conserve it. We argue that the parity
conserving processes occur on a much faster time scale. In this case, even a
weak driving may lead to a large deviation of the supercurrent from its
equilibrium value. We show that this effect is accompanied by a quasiparticle
current which may lead to a measurable charge imbalance in the vicinity of the
junction. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the supercurrent after
switching off the ac drive. On a time scale where parity relaxation is
negligible, the supercurrent relaxes to a stationary non-equilibrium state.
Finally, we briefly outline the regime of ultraweak driving where the
ac-induced processes occur on a time scale comparable to parity relaxation.

function of energy, above $\sim$ 10 GeV. This behaviour contradicts standard
astrophysical mechanisms, in which positrons are secondary particles, produced
in the interactions of primary cosmic rays during the propagation in the
interstellar medium. The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered a
lot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the
presence of dark matter species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be
produced by nearby astrophysical sources, such as pulsars. Both hypotheses are
probed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction
measurements. The transport of the primary and secondary positrons in the
Galaxy is described using a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to
model the positron flux generated by dark matter species. The description of
the positron fraction from astrophysical sources is based on the pulsar
observations included in the ATNF catalogue. We find that the mass of the
favoured dark matter candidates is always larger than 500 GeV. The only dark
matter species that fulfils the numerous gamma ray and cosmic microwave
background bounds is a particle annihilating into four leptons through a light
scalar or vector mediator, with a mixture of tau (75%) and electron (25%)
channels, and a mass between 0.5 and 1 TeV. The positron anomaly can also be
explained by a single astrophysical source and a list of five pulsars from the
ATNF catalogue is given. Those results are obtained with the cosmic ray
transport parameters that best fit the B/C ratio. Uncertainties in the
propagation parameters turn out to be very significant. In the WIMP
annihilation cross section to mass plane for instance, they overshadow the
error contours derived from the positron data.

for many atomic sensors, and their performance is ultimately limited by the
quantum fluctuations of the optical read-out. Here we demonstrate that
off-resonant interactions can significantly modify the quantum noise of the
optical field, even when their effect on the mean signal is negligible. We
illustrate this concept by using an atomic magnetometer based on the nonlinear
Faraday effect: the rotation of the light polarization is mainly determined by
the resonant light-induced spin alignment, which alone does not change the
photon statistics of the optical probe. Yet, we found that the minimum noise of
output polarization rotation measurements is above the expected shot noise
limit. This excess quantum noise is due to off-resonant coupling and grows with
atomic density. We also show that the detection scheme can be modified to
reduce the measured quantum noise (even below the shot-noise limit) but only at
the expense of the reduced rotational sensitivity. These results show the
existence of previously unnoticed factors in fundamental limitations in atomic
magnetometry and could have impacts in many other atom-light based precision
measurements.

standard model (SM) $b$ quarks or $\tau$ leptons may, however, be in tension
with various experimental constraints on antiproton and positron fluxes. We
present a framework that is free from such constraints. The key idea is that
the mediators between the dark matter and the SM are themselves part of a
strongly coupled sector: a hidden valley. In this scenario, the dark matter
particles annihilate only into hidden quarks that subsequently shower and
hadronize. Hidden quark effective couplings to SM hypercharge allow the
lightest hidden bound states to subsequently decay into SM photons, producing
the observed photon energy spectrum. Associated production of SM fermions is,
in contrast, suppressed by electroweak, loop or helicity effects. We find that,
generically, $\sim$ 10 GeV DM and a confinement scale $\sim$ 1 GeV provide a
good fit to the observed spectrum. An $SU(2)$ hidden confining group is
preferred over $SU(3)$ or higher rank gauge groups, up to uncertainties in the
extraction of the astrophysical background. An explicit realization of this
framework is also presented, and its phenomenology is discussed in detail,
along with pertinent cosmological, astrophysical and collider bounds. This
framework may be probed by model-independent searches, including future

CI-chondrites, and Mars. The ""hit-and-run"" model (Reufer et al., 2012) allows
for a Theia similar to enstatite-chondrites and other Earth-like materials. If
the Earth and Moon inherited their different mantle FeO contents from the bulk
mantles of the proto-Earth and Theia, the high angular momentum models cannot
explain the observed difference. However, both the hit-and-run as well as the

as the consequence of a simple mixture of two mantles with different FeO.
Therefore, the simplest way to reconcile the isotopic similarity, and FeO

composition and a higher (~20%) mantle FeO content.

application of the method and simulations of isolated explosions (performed at
different resolutions) motivate a resolution-dependent scaling for the injected

sensitive to the initial kinetic energy fraction due to early and rapid

evolution of the system, resulting in an order of magnitude suppression of
stellar mass. The overall behavior of the galaxy in the two highest resolution

objects dynamically inspiralling within a common envelope (CE). Flow in the
vicinity of the embedded object is gravitationally focused leading to drag and
potential to gas accretion. This process has been studied numerically and
analytically in the context of Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion (HLA). Yet, within a
CE, accretion structures may span a large fraction of the envelope radius, and
in so doing sweep across a substantial radial gradient of density. We quantify
these gradients using detailed stellar evolution models for a range of CE
encounters. We provide estimates of typical scales in CE encounters that
involve main sequence stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes with
giant-branch companions of a wide range of masses. We apply these typical
scales to hydrodynamic simulations of 3D HLA with an upstream density gradient.
This density gradient breaks the symmetry that defines HLA flow, and imposes an
angular momentum barrier to accretion. Material that is focused into the
vicinity of the embedded object thus may not be able to accrete. As a result,
accretion rates drop dramatically, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while drag rates
are only mildly affected. We provide fitting formulae to the
numerically-derived rates of drag and accretion as a function of the density
gradient. The reduced ratio of accretion to drag suggests that objects that can
efficiently gain mass during CE evolution, such as black holes and neutron
stars, may grow less than implied by the HLA formalism.

accretion of hot halo gas onto star-forming galaxies. Correlated supernovae
events create converging 'superbubbles' in the halo gas. Where these collide,
the density increases, driving cooling filaments of low metallicity gas that
feed the disc. At our current numerical resolution (20 pc) we are only able to
resolve the most dramatic events; these could be responsible for the build-up
of galaxy discs after the most massive gas-rich mergers have completed (z < 1).
As we increase the numerical resolution, we find that the filaments persist for
longer, driving continued late-time star formation. This suggests that
SNe-driven accretion could act as an efficient mechanism for extracting cold
gas from the hot halo, driving late-time star formation in disc galaxies. We
show that such filament feeding leads to a peak star formation rate (SFR) of
$\sim 3$ M$_{\rm sun}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with estimates for the Milky Way.
By contrast, direct cooling from the hot halo ('hot-mode' accretion, not
present in the simulations that show filament feeding) falls short of the
SNe-driven SFR by a factor of 3-4, and is sustained over a shorter time period.
The filaments we resolve extend to $\sim$ 50 kpc, reaching column densities of
$\sim 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. We show that such structures can plausibly explain
the broad dispersion in Mg II absorption seen along sight lines to quasars. Our
results suggest a dual role for stellar feedback in galaxy formation,
suppressing hot-mode accretion while promoting cold-mode accretion along
filaments. This ultimately leads to more star formation, suggesting that the
positive feedback effect outweighs the negative. Finally, since the filamentary
gas has higher angular momentum than that coming from hot-mode accretion, we
show that this leads to the formation of substantially larger gas discs.

our survey is sensitive down to $\log N(H2) = 14.4$ corresponding to a
molecular fraction of $\log f_{H2} = -4.9$ at the median $N(HI)$. H2 is
detected in 10 cases (3/5 DLAs and 7/22 sub-DLAs) down to this $f_{H2}$ limit.
The H2 detection rate of $50^{+25}_{-12}$ percent seen in our sample, is a
factor of $\gtrsim 2$ higher than that of the high-$z$ sample of Noterdaeme et
al. (2008), for systems with $N(H2) > 10^{14.4}$ cm$^{-2}$. In spite of having
$N(HI)$ values typically lower by a factor of 10, low-$z$ H2 systems show
molecular fractions ($\log f_{H2}=-1.93\pm0.63$) that are comparable to the
high-$z$ sample. The rotational excitation temperatures ($T_{01} = 133\pm55$
K), as measured in our low-$z$ sample, are typically consistent with high-$z$
measurements. Simple photoionization models favour a radiation field much
weaker than the mean Galactic ISM field for a particle density in the range 10
- 100 cm$^{-3}$. The impact parameters of the identified host-galaxy candidates
are in the range $10 \lesssim \rho$ (kpc) $\lesssim 80$. We, therefore,
conjecture that the low-$z$ H2 bearing gas is not related to star-forming disks
but stems from self-shielded, tidally stripped or ejected disk-material in the
extended halo.

history of the Milky Way. Our model assumes that the Milky Way is formed from a
closed box-like system in the inner regions, while the outer parts of the disc
experience some accretion. Unlike the usual procedure, we do not fix the star
formation prescription (e.g. Kennicutt law) in order to reproduce the chemical
abundance trends. Instead, we fit the abundance trends with age in order to
recover the star formation history of the Galaxy. Our method enables one to
recover with unprecedented accuracy the star formation history of the Milky Way
in the first Gyrs, in both the inner (R<7-8kpc) and outer (R>9-10kpc) discs as
sampled in the solar vicinity. We show that, in the inner disc, half of the
stellar mass formed during the thick disc phase, in the first 4-5 Gyr. This
phase was followed by a significant dip in the star formation activity (at 8-9
Gyr) and a period of roughly constant lower level star formation for the
remaining 8 Gyr. The thick disc phase has produced as many metals in 4 Gyr as
the thin disc in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our results suggest that a closed box
model is able to fit all the available constraints in the inner disc. A closed
box system is qualitatively equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate, at
high redshift, maintains a high gas fraction in the inner disc. In such
conditions, the SFR is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the ISM. By
z~1 it is possible that most of the accretion takes place in the outer disc,
while the star formation activity in the inner disc is mostly sustained by the
gas not consumed during the thick disc phase, and the continuous ejecta from
earlier generations of stars. The outer disc follows a star formation history
very similar to that of the inner disc, although initiated at z~2, about 2 Gyr
before the onset of the thin disc formation in the inner disc.

RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of

different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational
renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning

of large grains. State-of-the-art streaming instability models do not take into
account realistic size distributions resulting from the collisional evolution

planetesimal formation by streaming instability and implement it in our dust
coagulation code based on the Monte Carlo algorithm with the representative

instability may preferentially work outside the snow line, where sticky icy
aggregates are present. The efficiency of the process depends strongly on local
dust abundance and radial pressure gradient, and requires a super-solar
metallicity. If planetesimal formation is possible, the dust coagulation and
settling typically need ~100 orbits to produce sufficiently large and settled
grains and planetesimal formation lasts another ~1000 orbits. We present a
simple analytical model that computes the amount of dust that can be turned

and gas caused by gains or losses of angular momentum that result from
gravitational interaction with non-axisymmetric structure. This has been shown
to have significant impact on the metallicity distribution in galactic discs,
and therefore affects the interpretation of Galactic archeology. We use a
simulation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy to examine the effect of radial
migration on the star and gas radial metallicity distribution. We find that
both the star and gas component show significant radial migration. The stellar
radial metallicity gradient remains almost unchanged but the radial metallicity
distribution of the stars is broadened to produce a greater dispersion at all
radii. However, the metallicity dispersion of the gas remains narrow. We find
that the main drivers of the gas metallicity distribution evolution are metal
enrichment and mixing: more efficient metal enrichment in the inner region
maintains a negative slope in the radial metallicity distribution, and the
metal mixing ensures the tight relationship of the gas metallicity with the
radius. The metallicity distribution function reproduces the trend in the
age-metallicity relation found from observations for stars younger than 1.0 Gyr
in the Milky Way.

results are: (1) the fraction of red clump (RC) stars in secondary RCs in eMSTO

Gyr; (2) the width of the pseudo-age distributions of eMSTO clusters is
correlated with their central escape velocity $v_{\rm esc}$, both currently and
at an age of 10 Myr. We find that these two results are unlikely to be
reproduced by the effects of interactive binary stars or a range of stellar
rotation velocities. We therefore argue that the eMSTO phenomenon is mainly
caused by extended star formation within the clusters; (3) we find that $v_{\rm

featuring eMSTOs, while $v_{\rm esc} \leq 12$ km/s at all ages for two

argue that eMSTOs only occur for clusters whose early escape velocities are
higher than the wind velocities of stars that provide material from which

with wind velocities of intermediate-mass AGB stars in the literature.

is emptying out at a rate of 16 km/s/Mpc. In a co-moving frame, the Local Sheet
is found to be moving away from the Local Void at ~ 260 km/s. Our model shows
how asymmetric collapse due to unbalanced voids on either side of a developing
sheet or wall can lead to a systematic movement of the sheet. We conjectured
that asymmetries could lead to a large-scale separation of dark matter and
baryons, thereby driving a dependence of galaxy properties with environment,
but we do not find any evidence for this effect.

meticulous detail, utilizing the full expressivity of natural language. Often
it is particularly these detailed observations (facts) that are of interest,
and thus specific to the research questions that motivated observing and
reporting them. However, research aiming to synthesize or integrate phenotype
data across many studies or even fields is often faced with the need to
abstract from detailed observations so as to construct phenotypic concepts that
are common across many datasets rather than specific to a few. Yet,
observations or facts that would fall under such abstracted concepts are
typically not directly asserted by the original authors, usually because they
are ""obvious"" according to common domain knowledge, and thus asserting them
would be deemed redundant by anyone with sufficient domain knowledge. For
example, a phenotype describing the length of a manual digit for an organism
implicitly means that the organism must have had a hand, and thus a forelimb;
the presence or absence of a forelimb may have supporting data across a far
wider range of taxa than the length of a particular manual digit. Here we
describe how within the Phenoscape project we use a pipeline of OWL axiom
generation and reasoning steps to infer taxon-specific presence/absence of
anatomical entities from anatomical phenotypes. Although presence/absence is
all but one, and a seemingly simple way to abstract phenotypes across data
sources, it can nonetheless be powerful for linking genotype to phenotype, and
it is particularly relevant for constructing synthetic morphological
supermatrices for comparative analysis; in fact presence/absence is one of the
prevailing character observation types in published character matrices.

that is they do not find the optimal solution for the secondary tasks. Other
frameworks are optimal, but they tackle the control problem at kinematic level,
hence they neglect the robot dynamics and they do not allow for force control.
Still other frameworks are optimal and consider force control, but they are
computationally less efficient than ours. Our final claim is that, for
fully-actuated robots, computing the operational-space inverse dynamics is
equivalent to computing the inverse kinematics (at acceleration level) and then
the joint-space inverse dynamics. Thanks to this fact, our control framework
can efficiently compute the optimal solution by decoupling kinematics and
dynamics of the robot. We take into account: motion and force control, soft and
rigid contacts, free and constrained robots. Tests in simulation validate our
control framework, comparing it with other state-of-the-art equivalent
frameworks and showing remarkable improvements in optimality and efficiency.

values for the deciles of income. This is the first paper to our knowledge
which tackles expenditure, especially using a method to describe expenditure
such as lower limit on expenditure. This is also relevant since it allows the
approach of macroeconomic systems using more variables characterizing their
activity, can help in the investigation of living standards and inequality, and
points to more theoretical explorations which can be very useful for the
Economics and business practice.

generally increases with distance to the central star, but the fractional
expansion decreases, i.e., the expansion is not homologous. As a result, there
is not a unique expansion age, which is estimated to be 610-950 yr for A30 and
600-1140 yr for A78. The knots and filaments have experienced complex dynamical
processes: the current fast stellar wind is mass loaded by the material ablated
from the inner knots; the ablated material is then swept up until it shocks the
inner edges of the outer, hydrogen-rich nebula. The angular expansion of the
outer filaments shows a clear dependence on position angle, indicating that the
interaction of the stellar wind with the innermost knots channels the wind
along preferred directions. The apparent angular expansion of the innermost
knots seems to be dominated by the rocket effect of evaporating gas and by the
propagation of the ionization front inside them. Radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations show that a single ejection of material followed by a rapid onset
of the stellar wind and ionizing flux can reproduce the variety of clumps and
filaments at different distances from the central star found in A30 and A78.

these dense redshift surveys, we construct galaxy number density maps using
several galaxy subsamples. The shape of the main cluster concentration in the
weak-lensing maps is similar to the global morphology of the number density
maps based on cluster members alone, mainly dominated by red members. We cross
correlate the galaxy number density maps with the weak-lensing maps. The cross
correlation signal when we include foreground and background galaxies at
0.5$z_{\rm cl}<z<2z_{\rm cl}$ is $10-23$% larger than for cluster members alone

cluster. Cross correlating the galaxy number density and weak-lensing maps
suggests that superimposed structures close to the cluster in redshift space
contribute more significantly to the excess cross correlation signal than
unrelated large-scale structure along the line of sight. Interestingly, the
weak-lensing mass profiles are not well constrained for the clusters with the
largest cross correlation signal excesses ($>$20% for A383, A689 and A750). The

"1410.3886","Srinadh Bhojanapalli","Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Prateek Jain, Sujay Sanghavi","Tighter Low-rank Approximation via Sampling the Leveraged Element","36 pages, 3 figures, Extended abstract to appear in the proceedings
  of ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA15)",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we propose a new randomized algorithm for computing a low-rank
approximation to a given matrix. Taking an approach different from existing
literature, our method first involves a specific biased sampling, with an
element being chosen based on the leverage scores of its row and column, and
then involves weighted alternating minimization over the factored form of the
intended low-rank matrix, to minimize error only on these samples. Our method
can leverage input sparsity, yet produce approximations in {\em spectral} (as
opposed to the weaker Frobenius) norm; this combines the best aspects of
otherwise disparate current results, but with a dependence on the condition
number $\kappa = \sigma_1/\sigma_r$. In particular we require $O(nnz(M) +
\frac{n\kappa^2 r^5}{\epsilon^2})$ computations to generate a rank-$r$
approximation to $M$ in spectral norm. In contrast, the best existing method
requires $O(nnz(M)+ \frac{nr^2}{\epsilon^4})$ time to compute an approximation
in Frobenius norm. Besides the tightness in spectral norm, we have a better
dependence on the error $\epsilon$. Our method is naturally and highly
parallelizable.
  Our new approach enables two extensions that are interesting on their own.
The first is a new method to directly compute a low-rank approximation (in
efficient factored form) to the product of two given matrices; it computes a
small random set of entries of the product, and then executes weighted
alternating minimization (as before) on these. The sampling strategy is
different because now we cannot access leverage scores of the product matrix
(but instead have to work with input matrices). The second extension is an
improved algorithm with smaller communication complexity for the distributed
PCA setting (where each server has small set of rows of the matrix, and want to
compute low rank approximation with small amount of communication with other
servers).

realizing the power of quantum information processing. For closed quantum
systems the relevant input/output maps are unitary transformations, and the
fundamental challenge becomes how to implement these with high fidelity in the
presence of experimental imperfections and decoherence. For two-level systems
(qubits) most aspects of unitary control are well understood, but for systems
with Hilbert space dimension d>2 (qudits), many questions remain regarding the
optimal design of control Hamiltonians and the feasibility of robust
implementation. Here we show that arbitrary, randomly chosen unitary
transformations can be efficiently designed and implemented in a large
dimensional Hilbert space (d=16) associated with the electronic ground state of
atomic 133Cs, achieving fidelities above 0.98 as measured by randomized
benchmarking. Generalizing the concepts of inhomogeneous control and dynamical
decoupling to d>2 systems, we further demonstrate that these qudit unitary maps
can be made robust to both static and dynamic perturbations. Potential
applications include improved fault-tolerance in universal quantum computation,
nonclassical state preparation for high-precision metrology, implementation of
quantum simulations, and the study of fundamental physics related to open

has been extensively carried out. In this paper, two possible smart charging
scenarios in China are studied: centralized optimal charging operated by an
aggregator and decentralized optimal charging managed by individual users.
Under the assumption that the aggregators and individual users only concern the
economic benefits, new load peaks will arise under time of use (TOU) pricing
which is extensively employed in China. To solve this problem, a simple
incentive mechanism is proposed for centralized optimal charging while a
rolling-update pricing scheme is devised for decentralized optimal charging.
The original optimal charging models are modified to account for the developed
schemes. Simulated tests corroborate the efficacy of optimal scheduling for
charging EVs in various scenarios.

insulating. This confers to black phosphorus a native oxide that can be used as
barrier material and protective layer. Further, the bandgap of phosphorene
oxides depends on the oxygen concentration, suggesting that controlled
oxidation can be used as a means to engineer the bandgap. For the oxygen
saturated composition, P$_2$O$_5$, both the planar and tubular phases have a
large bandgap energy of about 8.5eV, and are transparent in the near UV. These
two forms of phosphorene oxides are predicted to have the same formation
enthalpy as o$^\prime$-P$_2$O$_5$, the most stable of the previously known

considerably deeper and core temperatures significantly cooler than those of
main sequence stars. Consequently, DM evaporation is less important in WDs and
DM with masses $M_{\chi} \gtrsim 100\, \kev$ and annihilation cross-sections
orders of magnitude below the canonical thermal cross-section ($\sigmav \gtrsim

of the cluster's halo (potentially even ruling out the presence of a halo if
the inferred density is of order the ambient Galactic density). Recently
several direct detection experiments have seen signals whose origins might be

low-velocity ($\lesssim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$) CS emission shows an extended
($\sim$1000 AU) feature that exhibits slight south (blueshifted) to north
(redshifted) emission offsets, which is modeled with a rotating and infalling
envelope with a conserved angular momentum. The rotational motion of the
envelope connects smoothly to the inner Keplerian rotation at a radius of
$\sim$64 AU. The infalling velocity of the envelope is $\sim$three times lower
than the free-fall velocity toward the central stellar mass of 0.5 $M_{\odot}$.
These results demonstrate transition from the infalling envelope to the
Keplerian disk, consistent with the latest theoretical studies of disk
formation. We suggest that sizable ($r\sim$50--200 AU) Keplerian disks are
already formed when the protostars are still deeply embedded in the envelopes.

galaxies. We find that all 235 objects in our sample, regardless of their
morphology, lie on a tight relation linking stellar mass ($M_{*}$) to internal
velocity quantified by the $S_{0.5}$ parameter, which combines the contribution
of both dispersion ($\sigma$) and rotational velocity ($V_{rot}$) to the
dynamical support of a galaxy ($S_{0.5}=\sqrt{0.5V_{rot}^{2}+\sigma^{2}}$). Our
results are independent of the baryonic component from which $\sigma$ and
$V_{rot}$ are estimated, as the $S_{0.5}$ of stars and gas agree remarkably
well. This represents a significant improvement compared to the canonical
$M_{*}$ vs. $V_{rot}$ and $M_{*}$ vs. $\sigma$ relations. Not only is no sample
pruning necessary, but also stellar and gas kinematics can be used
simultaneously, as the effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once
$V_{rot}$ and $\sigma$ are combined. Our findings illustrate how the
combination of dispersion and rotational velocities for both gas and stars can
provide us with a single dynamical scaling relation valid for galaxies of all
morphologies across at least the stellar mass range
8.5$<log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<$11. Such relation appears to be more general and at
least as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a unique

in two-dimensional infinite expanding nozzles, which are governed by a
quasilinear hyperbolic equation being singular at the sonic and vacuum state.
The flow satisfies the slip condition on the walls and the flow velocity is
prescribed at the inlet. First, it is proved that if the incoming flow is away
from the sonic and vacuum state and its streamlines are rarefactive at the
inlet, then a flow in a straight nozzle never approaches the sonic and vacuum
state in any bounded region. Furthermore, a sufficient and necessary condition
of the incoming flow at the inlet is derived for the existence of a global
smooth supersonic flow in a straight nozzle. Then, it is shown that for each
incoming flow satisfying this condition, there exists uniquely a global smooth
supersonic flow in a symmetric nozzle with convex upper wall. It is noted that
such a flow may contain a vacuum. If there is a vacuum for a global smooth
transonic flow in a symmetric nozzle with convex upper wall, it is proved that
for the symmetric upper part of the flow, the first vacuum point along the
symmetric axis must be located at the upper wall and the set of vacuum points
is the closed domain bounded by the tangent half-line of the upper wall at this
point to downstream and the upper wall after this point. Moreover, the flow
speed is globally Lipschitz continuous in the nozzle, and on the boundary
between the gas and the vacuum, the flow velocity is along this boundary and
the normal derivatives of the flow speed and the square of the sound speed both
are zero. As an immediate consequence, the local smooth transonic flow obtained
in [10] can be extended into a global smooth transonic flow in a symmetric
nozzle whose upper wall after the local flow is convex.

For a
graph signal in the low-frequency subspace, the missing data associated with
unsampled vertices can be reconstructed through the sampled data by exploiting
the smoothness of the graph signal. In this paper, the concept of local set is
introduced and two local-set-based iterative methods are proposed to
reconstruct bandlimited graph signal from sampled data. In each iteration, one
of the proposed methods reweights the sampled residuals for different vertices,
while the other propagates the sampled residuals in their respective local
sets. These algorithms are built on frame theory and the concept of local sets,
based on which several frames and contraction operators are proposed. We then
prove that the reconstruction methods converge to the original signal under
certain conditions and demonstrate the new methods lead to a significantly
faster convergence compared with the baseline method. Furthermore, the
correspondence between graph signal sampling and time-domain irregular sampling
is analyzed comprehensively, which may be helpful to future works on graph

(superradiance) of emitters (as atoms) near metal nanoparticle, when
frequencies of transitions of emitters coincide with frequency of localized
plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle. Our approach is based on Schrodinger
description and it uses wave functions of states of systems. Interactions
between emitters and between the nanoparticle and emitters are taken into
account. We consider an example of two emitters and show that radiation is
occurred through symmetric states of emitters as it is in Dicke model of
superradiance. The nanoparticle accelerates collective spontaneous emission
similar how it accelerates spontaneous emission of single emitter. Radiation
from two emitters near the nanoparticle is faster than the radiation from two
separated and non-interacted ""nanoparticle+single emitter"" systems. Efficiency
of superradiance, i.e. the ratio of emitted photons to total number initial
excitations in the system, is smaller than 1 due to non-radiative losses in the
nanoparticle. However the efficiency is the same for single and for two
emitters near the nanoparticle. The approach can be straightforwardly
generalized to the case of many emitters near the nanoparticle.

  Model Coupled to Two Turbulence Models","29 pages, submitted to Journal of Power and Propulsion",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the thick boundary layers in hypersonic flows, the state of the
boundary layer significantly influences the whole flow field as well as surface
heat loads. Hence, for engineering applications the efficient numerical
prediction of laminar-to-turbulent transition is a challenging and important
task. Within the framework of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations,
Langtry/Menter [1] proposed the $\gamma$-$Re_{\theta_t}$ transition model using
two transport equations for the intermittency and $\gamma$-$Re_{\theta_t}$
combined with the Shear Stress Transport turbulence model (SST) [2]. The
transition model contains two empirical correlations for onset and length of
transition. Langtry/Menter [1] designed and validated the correlations for the
subsonic and transonic flow regime. For our applications in the hypersonic flow
regime, the development of a new set of correlations proved necessary, even
when using the same SST turbulence model [3]. Within this paper, we propose a
next step and couple the transition model with the SSG/LRR-$\omega$ Reynolds
stress turbulence model [4] which we found to be well suited for scramjet
intake simulations. First, we illustrate the necessary modifications of the
Reynolds stress model and the hypersonic in-house correlations using a
hypersonic flat plate test case. Next, the transition model is successfully
validated for its use coupled to both turbulence models using a hypersonic
double ramp test case. Regardless of the turbulence model, the transition model
is able to correctly predict the transition process compared to experimental
data. In addition, we apply the transition model combined with both turbulence
models to three different fully 3D scramjet intake configurations which are
experimentally investigated in wind tunnel facilities. The agreement with the
available experimental data is also shown.

cycle-rich architecture in a physically relevant, mathematically compact way is
sparse. In order to fill this void, we have developed a new algorithm that
rests on an abstraction of the physical `tiling' in the case of a two
dimensional network to an effective tiling of an abstract surface in space that
the network may be thought to sit in. Generically these abstract surfaces are
richer than the flat plane and as a result there are now two families of
fundamental units that may aggregate upon cutting weakest links -- the
plaquettes of the tiling and the longer `topological' cycles associated with
the abstract surface itself. Upon sequential removal of the weakest links, as
determined by the edge weight, neighboring plaquettes merge and a tree
characterizing this merging process results. The properties of this
characteristic tree can provide the physical and topological data required to
describe the architecture of the network and to build physical models. The new
algorithm can be used for automated phenotypic characterization of any weighted

subsample by the inverse of nonmissing probability is both intuitive and easy
to implement. When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known
and when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians
have developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse
probability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data
analysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling
literature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized
into a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working
model is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different
sets of calibration weights for estimating different parameters. This paper
considers calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a
single or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting
hurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the
missing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression
models for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle
property: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true
outcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is
misspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of
the outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of
calibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple
parameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency
bounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class
of calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical
likelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and
survey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample
properties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results
being studied.

stringent empirical and profound conceptual conflicts within the development of
atomic physics at the beginning of the last century. At first glance, it seems
to be bizarre and even ridiculous to apply ideas of quantum physics in order to
improve current psychological and linguistic or semantic ideas. However, a
closer look shows that there are some parallels in the development of quantum
physics and advanced theories of cognitive science. In psychology, geometric
models of meaning have a long tradition. However, they suffer from many
shortcomings which are illustrated by discussing several puzzles of bounded
rationality. In the first part of this article, we argue that the present
account of quantum cognition - taking quantum probabilities rather than
classical probabilities - can give a more systematic description of these
puzzles than the alternate and rather eclectic treatments in the traditional
framework of bounded rationality. Unfortunately, the quantum probabilistic
treatment does not always and does not automatically provide a deeper
understanding and a true explanation of these puzzles. In the second part of
this article, we explain the foundational issue from the perspective of Piron,
Foulis, Randall, and others, and we apply it to the foundation of quantum
cognition. In this connection, we show that quantum probabilities are of
(virtual) conceptual necessity if grounded in an abstract algebraic framework
of orthomodular lattices. This framework is motivated by assuming partial
Boolean algebras (describing particular perspectives) that are combined into a
uniform system while considering certain capacity restrictions. It is at this
point that one important aspect of the whole idea of bounded rationality
directly enters the theoretical scenery of quantum cognition: resource
limitation.

populations in globular clusters. One of the main constraints is the
present-day ratio of first- and second-generation stars that are currently
identified based on their sodium content. We propose an alternative
interpretation of the observed sodium distribution, and suggest that stars with
low sodium abundance that are counted as members of the first stellar
generation could actually be second-generation stars. We compute the number
ratio of second-generation stars along the Na distribution following the fast
rotating massive star model using the same constraints from the well-documented
case of NGC 6752 as in our previous developments. We reproduce the typical
percentage of low-sodium stars usually classified as first-generation stars by
invoking only secondary star formation from material ejected by massive stars
and mixed with original globular cluster material in proportions that account
for the Li-Na anti-correlation in this cluster. Globular clusters could be
totally devoid of first-generation low-mass stars today. This can be tested
with the determination of the carbon isotopic ratio and nitrogen abundance in
turn-off globular cluster stars. Consequences and related issues are briefly
discussed.

particular choice of Kasner parameters, by relating the integrand in the wave

displayed, which relies upon the method of integration in the complex domain
for the solution of hyperbolic equations with variable coefficients. In order
to study the propagation of wave fronts, we integrate the equations of
bicharacteristics which are null geodesics, and we are able to express them,
for the first time in the literature, with the help of elliptic integrals for
another choice of Kasner parameters. For generic values of the three Kasner
parameters, the solution of the Cauchy problem is built through a pair of
integral operators, where the amplitude and phase functions in the integrand
solve a coupled system of partial differential equations. The first is the
so-called transport equation, whereas the second is a nonlinear equation that
reduces to the eikonal equation if the amplitude is a slowly varying function.
Remarkably, the analysis of such a coupled system is proved to be equivalent to
building first an auxiliary covariant vector having vanishing divergence, while
all nonlinearities are mapped into solving a covariant generalization of the
Ermakov-Pinney equation for the amplitude function. Last, from a linear set of
equations for the gradient of the phase one recovers the phase itself. This is
the parametrix construction that relies upon Fourier-Maslov integral operators,
but with a novel perspective on the nonlinearities in the dispersion relation.
Furthermore, the Adomian method for nonlinear partial differential equations is
applied to generate a recursive scheme for the evaluation of the amplitude
function in the parametrix.

another process with fewer states, called herein the approximating process. The
approximation problem is formulated using two different methods.
  The first method, utilizes the total variation distance to discriminate the
transition probabilities of a high dimensional Markov process and a reduced
order Markov process. The approximation is obtained by optimizing a linear
functional defined in terms of transition probabilities of the reduced order
Markov process over a total variation distance constraint. The transition
probabilities of the approximated Markov process are given by a water-filling
solution.
  The second method, utilizes total variation distance to discriminate the
invariant probability of a Markov process and that of the approximating
process. The approximation is obtained via two alternative formulations: (a)
maximizing a functional of the occupancy distribution of the Markov process,
and (b) maximizing the entropy of the approximating process invariant
probability. For both formulations, once the reduced invariant probability is
obtained, which does not correspond to a Markov process, a further
approximation by a Markov process is proposed which minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler divergence. These approximations are given by water-filling
solutions.
  Finally, the theoretical results of both methods are applied to specific
examples to illustrate the methodology, and the water-filling behavior of the
approximations.

protocol is influenced heavily by the vehicular density dynamics. However, most
of the previous works on VANET performance modeling paid little attention to
vehicle distribution, or simply assumed homogeneous car distribution. It is
obvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment
due to traffic signals and speed limits at different portions of the road, as
well as vehicle interactions that are significant on busy streets. In light of
the inadequacy, we present in this paper an original methodology to study the
broadcasting performance of 802.11p VANETs with practical vehicle distribution
in urban environments. Firstly, we adopt the empirically verified stochastic
traffic models, which incorporates the effect of urban settings (such as
traffic lights and vehicle interactions) on car distribution and generates
practical vehicular density profiles. Corresponding 802.11p protocol and
performance models are then developed. When coupled with the traffic models,
they can predict broadcasting efficiency, delay, as well as throughput
performance of 802.11p VANETs based on the knowledge of car density at each
location on the road. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the accuracy
of the developed mathematical models with the consideration of vehicle
interaction. In general, our results demonstrate the applicability of the
proposed methodology on modeling protocol performance in practical signalized
road networks, and shed insights into the design and development of future
communication protocols and networking functions for VANETs.

thermal fluctuations of their environment. Physicists model such systems by
means of stochastic processes. Stochastic Thermodynamics (ST) defines entropy
changes and other thermodynamic notions for individual realizations of such
processes. It applies to situations far from equilibrium and provides a unified
approach to stochastic fluctuation relations. Its predictions have been studied
and verified experimentally.
  This thesis addresses the theoretical foundations of ST. Its focus is on the
following two aspects: (i) The stochastic nature of mesoscopic observations has
its origin in the molecular chaos on the microscopic level. Can one derive ST
from an underlying reversible deterministic dynamics? Can we interpret ST's
notions of entropy and entropy changes in a well-defined
information-theoretical framework? (ii) Markovian jump processes on finite
state spaces are common models for bio-chemical pathways. How does one quantify
and calculate fluctuations of physical observables in such models? What role
does the topology of the network of states play? How can we apply our abstract
results to the design of models for molecular motors?

unobserved degrees of freedom --- a perspective that yields a consistency
criterion between dynamical models formulated on various levels of description.

to point case are provided. Furthermore, an approach for bounding mutual
information in the low SNR regime using the symmetrized KL divergence is
introduced and its applicability to Poisson channels is shown. To best of our
knowledge, the first non-trivial upper bound on the capacity of Poisson channel
with a maximum transmission constraint in the low SNR regime is found.
Numerical results show that the proposed upper bound is of the same order as
the capacity in the low SNR regime.

$\mathcal{C}[\mathbf{W}^{-1}]$, where all the morphisms of $\mathbf{W}$ are
turned into internal equivalences, and that is universal with respect to this

infinitely many symmetric periodic points. We prove an analogous statement for
symmetric odd-periodic points of area preserving reversible maps isotopic to

Our approach is simple, elementary and far from Franks' proof. We also show
that a reversible map has a symmetric fixed point if and only if it is a twist

sense of Poincar\'e-Birkhoff. Applications to symmetric periodic orbits in
reversible dynamical systems with two degrees of freedom are briefly discussed.

notion of large optically thick molecular spheres around the stars (MOLspheres)
has been invoked in order to explain e.g. spectro-interferometric observations.
However, high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not easily fit into this
picture. They rule out any large sphere of water vapour in LTE surrounding red
giants. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-infrared spectra
for a range of red giants, from early-K to mid M. We have recorded 12 microns
spectra of 10 well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES on the IRTF. We find
that all giants in our study cooler than 4300 K, spanning a range of effective
temperatures, show water absorption lines stronger than expected. The strengths
of the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We identify several spectral
features in the wavelength region that undoubtedly are formed in the
photosphere. From a study of water-line ratios of the stars, we find that the
excitation temperatures, in the line-forming regions, are several hundred
Kelvin lower than expected from a classical photospheric model. This could
either be due to an actually lower temperature structure in the outer regions
of the photospheres caused by, for example, extra cooling, or due to non-LTE
level populations, affecting the source function and line opacities. We have
demonstrated that these diagnostically interesting water lines are a general
feature of red giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general
explanation of their formation rather than explanations requiring specific
properties. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by emission) nor
appear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere models in their simplest
forms, the evidence for the existence of such large optically-thick, molecular
spheres enshrouding the stars is weakened. (abbreviated)

observations are allocated to arms with the posterior probability that an arm
is optimal. While sometimes easy to implement and asymptotically optimal,
Thompson sampling can be computationally demanding in large scale bandit
problems, and its performance is dependent on the model fit to the observed
data. We introduce bootstrap Thompson sampling (BTS), a heuristic method for
solving bandit problems which modifies Thompson sampling by replacing the
posterior distribution used in Thompson sampling by a bootstrap distribution.
We first explain BTS and show that the performance of BTS is competitive to
Thompson sampling in the well-studied Bernoulli bandit case. Subsequently, we
detail why BTS using the online bootstrap is more scalable than regular
Thompson sampling, and we show through simulation that BTS is more robust to a
misspecified error distribution. BTS is an appealing modification of Thompson
sampling, especially when samples from the posterior are otherwise not
available or are costly.

Specifically, our method can (soundly and completely) decide if computed values
are polynomially bounded as a function of the input; and similarly for the
running time. Such complexity properties are undecidable for a Turing-complete
programming language, and a common work-around in program analysis is to settle
for sound but incomplete solutions. In contrast, we consider a class of
programs that is Turing-incomplete, but strong enough to include several
challenges for this kind of analysis. For a related language that has
well-structured syntax, similar to Meyer and Ritchie's LOOP programs, the
problem has been previously proved to be decidable. The analysis relied on the
compositionality of programs, hence the challenge in obtaining similar results
for flowchart programs with arbitrary control-flow graphs. Our answer to the
challenge is twofold: first, we propose a class of loop-annotated flowcharts,
which is more general than the class of flowcharts that directly represent
structured programs; secondly, we present a technique to reuse the ideas from
the work on tructured programs and apply them to such flowcharts. The technique
is inspired by the classic translation of non-deterministic automata to regular
expressions, but we obviate the exponential cost of constructing such an
expression, obtaining a polynomial-time analysis. These ideas may well be
applicable to other analysis problems.

null models for community assembly. In Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of
Biodiversity (UNTB), many local communities are connected to a single
metacommunity through differing immigration rates. Our ability to fit the full
multi-site UNTB has hitherto been limited by the lack of a computationally
tractable and accurate algorithm. We show that a large class of neutral models
with this mainland-island structure but differing local community dynamics
converge in the large population limit to the hierarchical Dirichlet process.
Using this approximation we developed an efficient Bayesian fitting strategy
for the multi-site UNTB. We can also use this approach to distinguish between
neutral local community assembly given a non-neutral metacommunity distribution
and the full UNTB where the metacommunity too assembles neutrally. We applied
this fitting strategy to both tropical trees and a data set comprising 570,851
sequences from 278 human gut microbiomes. The tropical tree data set was
consistent with the UNTB but for the human gut neutrality was rejected at the
whole community level. However, when we applied the algorithm to gut microbial
species within the same taxon at different levels of taxonomic resolution, we
found that species abundances within some genera were almost consistent with
local community assembly. This was not true at higher taxonomic ranks. This
suggests that the gut microbiota is more strongly niche constrained than
macroscopic organisms, with different groups adopting different functional
roles, but within those groups diversity may at least partially be maintained
by neutrality.We also observed a negative correlation between body mass index
and immigration rates within the family Ruminococcaceae.

present a NIR imaging (H2 and Ks) and low-resolution spectroscopic (0.95-2.50
um) survey of 18 massive jets towards GLIMPSE extended green objects, driven by
intermediate- and high-mass YSOs, which have Lbol between 4x10^2 and 10^5 Lsun.
As in low-mass jets, H2 is the primary NIR coolant, detected in all the
analysed flows, whereas the most important ionic tracer is [FeII], detected in
half of the sampled jets. Our analysis indicates that the emission lines
originate from shocks at high temperatures and densities. No fluorescent
emission is detected along the flows, regardless of the source Lbol. On
average, the physical parameters of these massive jets (i.e. Av, temperature,
column density, mass, and luminosity) have higher values than those measured in
their low-mass counterparts. The morphology of the H2 flows is varied, mostly
depending on the complex, dynamic, and inhomogeneous environment in which these
massive jets form and propagate. All flows and jets in our sample are
collimated, showing large precession angles. Additionally, the presence of both
knots and jets suggests that the ejection process is continuous with burst
episodes, as in low-mass YSOs. We compare the flow H2 luminosity with the
source Lbol confirming the tight correlation between these two quantities. Five
sources, however, display a lower L(H2)/Lbol efficiency, which might be related
to YSO evolution. Most important, the inferred L(H2) vs Lbol relationship
agrees well with the correlation between the momentum flux of the CO outflows
and the bolometric luminosities of high-mass YSOs indicating that outflows from
high-mass YSOs are momentum driven, as are their low-mass counterparts.

beam interacting with plasma and generating Langmuir waves. Its extension to
weak-turbulence theory treats resonant interactions of these Langmuir waves
with other plasma wave modes, in particular ion-sound waves. These are strongly
damped in plasma of equal ion and electron temperatures, as sometimes seen in,
for example, the solar corona and wind. Weak turbulence theory is derived in
the weak damping limit, with a term describing ion-sound wave damping then
added. In this paper we use the EPOCH particle-in-cell code to numerically test
weak turbulence theory for a range of electron-ion temperature ratios. We find
that in the cold ion limit the results agree well, but increasing ion
temperature the three-wave resonance becomes broadened in proportion to the
ion-sound wave damping rate. This may be important in, for example, the theory
of solar radio bursts, where the spectrum of Langmuir waves is critical.
Additionally we establish lower limits on the number of simulation particles
needed to accurately reproduce the electron and wave distributions in their
saturated states, and to reproduce their intermediate states and time
evolution.

Gamma Cassiopeiae (herein gamma Cas) based on observations made with both the

prototypical example of a small subclass of Be stars with moderately strong
X-ray emission dominated by a hot thermal component in the 0.5-12 keV energy
range Lx ~ 10^32 - 10^33 erg s^-1. This places them at the high end of the
known luminosity distribution for stellar emission, but several orders of
magnitude below typical accretion powered Be X-ray binaries. The INTEGRAL
observations spanned an 8 year baseline and represent the deepest measurement
to date at energies above ~50 keV. We find that the INTEGRAL data are
consistent within statistics to a constant intensity source above 20 keV, with
emission extending up to ~100 keV and that searches for all of the previously
reported periodicities of the system at lower energies led to null results. We
further find that our combined Suzaku and INTEGRAL spectrum, which we suggest
is the most accurate broad-band X-ray measurement of gamma Cas to date, is
fitted extremely well with a thermal plasma emission model with a single
absorption component. We found no compelling need for an additional non-thermal
high-energy component. We discuss these results in the context of a currently
favored models for gamma Cas and its analogs.

First, we introduce a new notion of $\epsilon$-stationarity, which is suitable

randomized sampling to avoid computing the expectations exactly. For the
general block optimization model, the proximal subroutines are performed for
each block according to either the block-coordinate-descent (BCD) or the
maximum-block-improvement (MBI) updating rule. If the gradient of the nonconvex

iteration complexity reduces to $O(1/\epsilon)$. Our numerical experiments for
tensor approximation problems show promising performances of the new solution

Kannan,
M. Naor, S. Rudich, Implicit representation of graphs, SIAM J. Discrete
Mathematics, 5 (1992) 596--603] and can be defined as follows. A representation
of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is said to be implicit if it assigns to each vertex
of $G$ a binary code of length $O(\log n)$ so that the adjacency of two
vertices is a function of their codes. Since an implicit representation of an
$n$-vertex graph uses $O(n\log n)$ bits, any class of graphs admitting such a
representation contains $2^{O(n\log n)}$ labelled graphs with $n$ vertices. In
the terminology of [J. Balogh, B. Bollob\'{a}s, D. Weinreich, The speed of
hereditary properties of graphs, J. Combin. Theory B 79 (2000) 131--156] such
classes have at most factorial speed of growth. In this terminology, the
implicit graph conjecture can be stated as follows: every class with at most
factorial speed of growth which is hereditary admits an implicit
representation. The question of deciding whether a given hereditary class has
at most factorial speed of growth is far from being trivial. In the present
paper, we introduce a number of tools simplifying this question. Some of them
can be used to obtain a stronger conclusion on the existence of an implicit
representation. We apply our tools to reveal new hereditary classes with the
factorial speed of growth. For many of them we show the existence of an

macromolecules called ribosomes ""read"" the mRNA strand in a sequential manner
and produce a corresponding protein. Translation is known to consume most of
the cell's energy. Maximizing the protein production rate in mRNA translation,
subject to the bounded biomolecullar budget, is thus an important problem in
both biology and biotechnology. We consider this problem using a mathematical
model for mRNA translation called the ribosome flow model (RFM). For an mRNA
strand with $n$ sites the RFM includes $n$ state-variables that encode the
normalized ribosomal density at each site, and $n+1$ positive parameters: the
initiation rate and elongation rates along the chain. An affine constraint on
these rates is used to model the bounded cellular budget. We show that for a
homogeneous constraint the rates that maximize the steady-state protein
production rate have a special structure. They are symmetric with respect to
the middle of the chain, and monotonically increase as we move towards the
center of the chain. The ribosomal densities corresponding to the optimal rates
monotonically decrease along the chain. We discuss some of the biological
implications of these results.

polynomials over such fields and then apply these techniques to generalising
the cube attack to $GF(p)$. The crucial difference is that now the degree in

differentiate several times with respect to each variable (unlike the classical
cube attack and its larger field version described by Dinur and Shamir, both of
which differentiate at most once with respect to each variable).
  Finally we describe differentiation over finite fields $GF(p^m)$ with $p^m$

planets - are largely unknown because they are difficult to detect with
currently available techniques. Results from the Kepler satellite and other
studies indicate a minimum occurrence rate of circumbinary giant planets of ~10
%, yet only a handful are presently known. Here, we study the potential of
ESA's Gaia mission to discover and characterise extrasolar planets orbiting
nearby binary stars by detecting the binary's periodic astrometric motion
caused by the orbiting planet. We expect that Gaia will discover hundreds of
giant planets around binaries with FGK dwarf primaries within 200 pc of the
Sun, if we assume that the giant planet mass distribution and abundance are
similar around binaries and single stars. If on the other hand all circumbinary
gas giants have masses lower than two Jupiter masses, we expect only four
detections. Gaia is critically sensitive to the properties of giant
circumbinary planets and will therefore make the detailed study of their
population possible. Gaia's precision is such that the distribution in mutual
inclination between the binary and planetary orbital planes will be obtained.
It also possesses the capacity to establish the frequency of planets across the
H-R diagram, both as a function of mass and of stellar evolutionary state from
pre-main sequence to stellar remnants. Gaia's discoveries can reveal whether a
second epoch of planetary formation occurs after the red-giant phase.

bounds that truncate the probability tail. Aban, Meerschaert and Panorska
(2006) derived the maximum likelihood estimator for the Pareto tail index of a
truncated Pareto distribution with a right truncation point $T$. The Hill
(1975) estimator is then obtained by letting $T \to \infty$. The problem of
extreme value estimation under right truncation was also introduced in Nuyts
(2010) who proposed a similar estimator for the tail index and considered
trimming of the number of extreme order statistics. Given that in practice one
does not always know whether the distribution is truncated or not, we discuss
estimators for the Pareto index and extreme quantiles both under truncated and
non-truncated Pareto-type distributions. We also propose a truncated Pareto
QQ-plot in order to help deciding between a truncated and a non-truncated case.
In this way we extend the classical extreme value methodology adding the
truncated Pareto-type model with truncation point $T \to \infty$ as the sample
size $n \to \infty$. Finally we present some practical examples, asymptotics

states of the optimally doped nonmagnetic bismuthate superconductor
Ba0.63K0.37BiO3. The magnetic data along with previous muSR, resistivity, and
tunneling data consistently show that there is a large polaronic enhancement in
the density of states and effective electron-phonon coupling constant. The
first-principle calculation within the density-functional theory indicates a
small electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.3-0.4, which can only lead
to about 1 K superconductivity within the conventional phonon-mediated
mechanism. Remarkably, the polaronic effect increases the electron-phonon
coupling constant to about 1.4, which is large enough to leads to 32 K
superconductivity. The present work thus uncovers the mystery of
high-temperature superconductivity in bismuthate superconductors, which will
also provide important insight into the pairing mechanism of other
high-temperature superconductors.

low-eccentricity and low-inclination. Objects following these trajectories
experience repeated trappings in the 1:1 commensurability with the Earth and
can become temporary Trojans, horseshoe librators, quasi-satellites, and even
transient natural satellites. Here, we review what we know about this peculiar
dynamical group and use a Monte Carlo simulation to characterize geometrically
the Arjuna orbital domain, studying its visibility both from the ground and
with the European Space Agency Gaia spacecraft. The visibility analysis from
the ground together with the discovery circumstances of known objects are used
as proxies to estimate the current size of this population. The impact
cross-section of the Earth for minor bodies in this resonant group is also
investigated. We find that, for ground-based observations, the solar elongation
at perigee of nearly half of these objects is less than 90 degrees. They are
best observed by space-borne telescopes, but Gaia is not going to improve
significantly the current discovery rate for members of this class. Our results
suggest that the size of this population may have been underestimated by
current models. On the other hand, their intrinsically low encounter velocities
with the Earth induce a 10-1000-fold increase in the impact cross-section with
respect to what is typical for objects in the Apollo or Aten asteroid
populations. We estimate that their probability of capture as transient natural
satellites of our planet is about 8%.

consists in extending kernel estimation techniques developed for longitudinal

fractal viewpoint in order to determine the scale where the self-similar
scaling property of the DM halo distribution transits to homogeneity. Methods
based on well-established `counts-in-cells' as well as new methods based on
anomalous diffusion and random walks are investigated. Both are applied to DM
halos of the biggest N-Body simulation in the `Dark Sky Simulations' (DS)
catalogue and an equivalent randomly distributed catalogue. Results based on
the smaller `Millennium Run' (MR) simulation are revisited and improved. It is
found that the MR simulation volume is too small and prone to bias to reliably
identify the onset of homogeneity. Transition to homogeneity is defined when
the fractal dimension of the clustered and random distributions cannot be
distinguished within the associated uncertainties. The `counts-in-cells' method
applied to the DS simulation then yields a homogeneity scale roughly consistent
with previous work ($\sim 150$$h^{-1}$Mpc). The characteristic length-scale for
anomalous diffusion to behave homogeneously is found to be at about
250$h^{-1}$Mpc. The behaviour of the fractal dimensions for a halo catalogue
with the same two-point function as the original but with shuffled Fourier
phases is investigated. The methods based on anomalous diffusion are shown to
be sensitive to the phase information, whereas the `counts-in-cells' methods
are not.

than often reported and further derive a new formula for expressing the value
of $\zeta(2n+1)$ in terms of zeta at other fractional points. This paper also
establishes and presents new expository notes and perspectives on zeta function
theory and functional analysis. In addition, a new fundamental result, in form
of a new function called omega $\Omega(s)$, is introduced to analytic number
theory for the first time. This new function together with some of its most
fundamental properties and other related identities are here disclosed and
presented as a new approach to the analysis of sums of generalised harmonic
series, related alternating series and polygamma functions associated with
Riemann zeta function.
