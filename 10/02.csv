The way the asymptotic freedom manifests itself in terms of two-quark

relativistic consideration of quark interaction problem by single-time

energy dependence of the interaction quasipotential, the character of the
forces changes qualitatively during the transition from the discrete spectrum

spectrum (that of the positive values of the binding energy): the smooth
behaviour of the interaction quasipotential in the discrete spectrum goes into
the oscillation in the continuous spectrum. This result gives a visual physical

classical picture of reflection and refraction of rays, which leads to
phenomena of caustics, rainbow, and critical scattering. Refraction can be

follows that when both diffusive and ohmic transport are considered to be

(TMDC), shows great potential as active material in optoelectronic devices due
to its ambipolarity and direct bandgap in its single-layer form. Recently,
different groups have exploited the ambipolarity of WSe2 to realize
electrically tunable PN junctions, demonstrating its potential for digital
electronics and solar cell applications. In this Letter, we focus on the
different photocurrent generation mechanisms in a double-gated WSe2 device by
measuring the photocurrent (and photovoltage) as the local gate voltages are
varied independently in combination with above- and below-bandgap illumination.
This enables us to distinguish between two main photocurrent generation
mechanisms: the photovoltaic and photothermoelectric effect. We find that the
dominant mechanism depends on the defined gate configuration. In the PN and NP
configurations, photocurrent is mainly generated by the photovoltaic effect and
the device displays a maximum responsivity of 0.70 mA/W at 532 nm illumination
and rise and fall times close to 10 ms. Photocurrent generated by the
photothermoelectric effect emerges in the PP configuration and is a factor of
two larger than the current generated by the photovoltaic effect (in PN and NP
configurations). This demonstrates that the photothermoelectric effect can play
a significant role in devices based on WSe2 where a region of strong optical
absorption, caused by e.g. an asymmetry in flake thickness or optical
absorption of the electrodes, generates a sizeable thermal gradient upon
illumination.

function $f$, such that for all integers $w,t>1$, every graph $G$ containing a
wall of size $f(w,t)$, must contain either (i) a $K_t$-minor; or (ii) a small
subset $A\subset V(G)$ of vertices, and a flat wall of size $w$ in $G\setminus
A$. Kawarabayashi, Thomas and Wollan recently showed a self-contained proof of
this theorem with the following two sets of parameters: (1)
$f(w,t)=\Theta(t^{24}(t^2+w))$ with $|A|=O(t^{24})$, and (2)
$f(w,t)=w^{2^{\Theta(t^{24})}}$ with $|A|\leq t-5$. The latter result gives the
best possible bound on $|A|$. In this paper we improve their bounds to
$f(w,t)=\Theta(t(t+w))$ with $|A|\leq t-5$. For the special case where the
maximum vertex degree in $G$ is bounded by $D$, we show that, if $G$ contains a
wall of size $\Omega(Dt(t+w))$, then either $G$ contains a $K_t$-minor, or
there is a flat wall of size $w$ in $G$. This setting naturally arises in
algorithms for the Edge-Disjoint Paths problem, with $D\leq 4$. Like the proof
of Kawarabayashi et al., our proof is self-contained, except for using a
well-known theorem on routing pairs of disjoint paths. We also provide
efficient algorithms that return either a model of the $K_t$-minor, or a vertex
set $A$ and a flat wall of size $w$ in $G\setminus A$.
  We complement our result for the low-degree scenario by proving an almost
matching lower bound: namely, for all integers $w,t>1$, there is a graph $G$,
containing a wall of size $\Omega(wt)$, such that the maximum vertex degree in
$G$ is 5, and $G$ contains no flat wall of size $w$, and no $K_t$-minor.

significantly improve the performance of tailbiting SC codes codes over the

gap to capacity as their terminated counterparts, at a lower FEC overhead. For
the considered terminated SC codes, the optimization only results in marginal
performance improvements, suggesting that in this case a sequential allocation
is close to optimal.

for a long time from a state where two halves are independently thermalized.
One says that a non-equilibrium steady state emerges if there are nonzero
steady currents in the central region. In particular, their presence is a
signature of ballistic transport. We analyze the consequences of the current
observable being a conserved density; near equilibrium this is known to give
rise to linear wave propagation and a nonzero Drude peak. Using the
Lieb-Robinson bound, we derive, under a certain regularity condition, a lower
bound for the non-equilibrium steady-state current determined by equilibrium
averages. This shows and quantifies the presence of ballistic transport far
from equilibrium. The inequality suggests the definition of ""nonlinear sound
velocities"", which specialize to the sound velocity near equilibrium in
non-integrable models, and ""generalized sound velocities"", which encode
generalized Gibbs thermalization in integrable models. These are bounded by the
Lieb-Robinson velocity. The inequality also gives rise to a bound on the energy
current noise in the case of pure energy transport. We show that the inequality
is satisfied in many models where exact results are available, and that it is
saturated at one-dimensional criticality.

varying intensity all over the Brillouin zone. It forms a broad hump centered
at the (111) scattering vector, surrounded by minima of intensity at (002),
(220) and equivalent wave vectors. The momentum-space structure distinguishes
this signal from a simple crystal-field excitation at 0.31 meV, suggested
previously, and rather lets us ascribe it to short-range dynamical correlations
between the neighboring Ce ions, mediated by the itinerant heavy f-electrons

abstractly capture atomic changes in the program state. Our key observation is
that histories form a partial commutative monoid, a structure fundamental for
representation of concurrent resources. This insight provides us with a
unifying mechanism that allows us to treat histories just like heaps in
separation logic. For example, both are subject to the same assertion logic and
inference rules (e.g., the frame rule). Moreover, the notion of ownership
transfer, which usually applies to heaps, has an equivalent in histories. It
can be used to formally represent helping---an important design pattern for
concurrent algorithms whereby one thread can execute code on behalf of another.
Specifications in terms of histories naturally abstract granularity, in the
sense that sophisticated fine-grained algorithms can be given the same
specifications as their simplified coarse-grained counterparts, making them
equally convenient for client-side reasoning. We illustrate our approach on a
number of examples and validate all of them in Coq.

lack of a local order parameter. Still in the quantum Hall effect, hidden order
parameters exist and constitute the basis for the celebrated composite-particle
approach. Whether similar hidden orders exist in 2D and 3D symmetry protected
topological phases (SPTs) is a largely open question. Here we introduce a new
approach for generating SPT groundstates, based on a generalization of the
Laughlin wavefunction. This approach gives a simple and unifying picture of
some classes of SPTs in 1D and 2D, and reveals their hidden order and flux
attachment structures. For the 1D case, we derive exact relations between the
wavefunctions obtained in this manner and group cohomology wavefunctions, as
well as matrix product state classification. For the 2D Ising SPT, strong
analytical and numerical evidence is given to show that the wavefunction
obtained indeed describes the desired SPT. The Ising SPT then appears as a
state with quasi-long-range order in composite degrees of freedom consisting of
Ising-symmetry charges attached to Ising-symmetry fluxes.

declines, because harvest costs increase. This prevents harvesting to
extinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining
species' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare
and valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas.
We analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the
geographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance
declines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining
populations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance
declines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range
contractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors--which,
ironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat
loss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of
range contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from
profitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find
that some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments
experience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow
profitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and
some high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases.
For terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but
available evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be
common among declining mammals and birds. Thus, factors causing range
contraction as abundance declines may pose unexpectedly large extinction risks
to harvested species.

task can only be executed if all input and output data fit into memory, and a
data can only be removed from memory after the completion of the task that uses
it as an input data. Such trees arise, for instance, in the multifrontal method
of sparse matrix factorization. The peak memory needed for the processing of
the entire tree depends on the execution order of the tasks. With one processor
the objective of the tree traversal is to minimize the required memory. This
problem was well studied and optimal polynomial algorithms were proposed. Here,
we extend the problem by considering multiple processors, which is of obvious
interest in the application area of matrix factorization. With multiple
processors comes the additional objective to minimize the time needed to
traverse the tree, i.e., to minimize the makespan. Not surprisingly, this
problem proves to be much harder than the sequential one. We study the
computational complexity of this problem and provide inapproximability results
even for unit weight trees. We design a series of practical heuristics
achieving different trade-offs between the minimization of peak memory usage

the memory usage under a given memory limit. The different heuristics are
evaluated in an extensive experimental evaluation using realistic trees.

focus on learning classification models defined as a weighted majority vote
over a set of real-val ued functions. In this context, Germain et al. (2013)
have shown that a measure of disagreement between these functions is crucial to
control. The core of this measure is a theoretical bound--the C-bound (Lacasse

majority vote learning algorithm in usual non-adaptative supervised setting:
MinCq. In this work, we propose a framework to extend MinCq to a domain

variation divergence between distributions proposed by Harel and Mannor (2012).
Justified by a theoretical bound on the target risk of the vote, we provide to
MinCq a target sample labeled thanks to a perturbed variation-based
self-labeling focused on the regions where the source and target marginals

layers of the OSI model. In some precedent works, the Reverse Cross Layer (RCL)
method has been proposed to facilitate the design of cross layer conceptual
models. The method has the advantage to highlight the impact of each cross
layer interaction on each protocol in order to update its source code and to
describe the intuitive gains that can be achieve. The method may be applied to
a given protocol stack or to an existent cross layer model to integrate new
interactions. In this paper, we are applying the RCL method on the stack that
uses the Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) at the transport layer and
the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) at the network layer. Cross layer
conceptual models are produced based on new cross layer interactions that are
proposed to populate the environment subsystem built with the application of
the RCL method. The improvement of the environment subsystem is specified
through the performance gains provide by the new interactions. The
implementation of the interactions that impact the SCTP protocol is described
in the Interaction Description Array. After the introduction, Section II of
this paper presents an overview of the SCTP protocol. Section III is related to
the overview of the OLSR protocol. Section IV is used for the application of
the RCL method and the different interaction arrays it generates. Section V
presents the improvement of the environment subsystem and the definition of the
performance gain of each Cross Layer Atomic Action (CLAA).

general relativity (GR) and quantum theory, and is supposed to replace GR at
extremely small distances (high-energies). It may be that quantum gravity
represents the breakdown of spacetime geometry described by GR. The
relationship between quantum gravity and spacetime has been deemed ""emergence"",
and the aim of this thesis is to investigate and explicate this relation. After
finding traditional philosophical accounts of emergence to be inappropriate, I
develop a new conception of emergence by considering physical case studies
including condensed matter physics, hydrodynamics, critical phenomena and
quantum field theory understood as effective field theory.
  This new conception of emergence is independent of reduction and derivation.
Instead, a low-energy theory is understood as emergent from a high-energy
theory if it is novel and autonomous compared to the high-energy theory, and
the low-energy physics is dependent (in a particular, minimal sense) on the
high-energy physics (this dependence is revealed by the techniques of effective
field theory and the renormalisation group). These ideas are important in
exploring the relationship between quantum gravity and GR, where GR is
understood as an effective, low-energy theory of quantum gravity. Without
experimental data or a theory of quantum gravity, we rely on principles and
techniques from other areas of physics to guide the way. As well as considering
the idea of emergence appropriate to treating GR as an effective field theory,
I investigate the emergence of spacetime (and other aspects of GR) in several
concrete approaches to quantum gravity, including examples of the condensed
matter approaches, the ""discrete approaches"" (causal set theory, causal
dynamical triangulations, quantum causal histories and quantum graphity) and
loop quantum gravity.

estimators to aggregate. It is proved that for affine estimators, the minimax
rate of aggregation is unchanged: it is possible to handle the linear
dependence between the affine estimators and the data used for aggregation at
no extra cost. The minimax rate is not impacted either by the variance of the
affine estimators, or any other measure of their statistical complexity. The
minimax rate is attained with a penalized procedure over the convex hull of the
estimators, for a penalty that is inspired from the $Q$-aggregation procedure.
The results follow from the interplay between the penalty, strong convexity and

  across the mass scale","18 pages, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv648",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I present an organic description of the regimes of collisionless tidal
streams and define the orderings between the physical quantities that shape
their morphology. Three fundamental dichotomies are identified in the form of
dimensionless inequalities. These govern i) the speed of the stream's growth,
ii) its internal coherence, iii) its thickness or opening angles. The
mechanisms that regulate such main properties are analysed. The slope of the
host's density profile influences the speed of the stream's growth, in both
length and width, as steeper profiles enhance differential streaming. Internal
coherence is the requirement for the appearance of substructure in tidal
debris, and I concentrate on the `feathering' typical of GC streams.
Overdensities are associated with minima in the relative streaming velocity of
the stream members. For streams with high circularity, these are caused by the
epicyclic oscillations of stars; however, for highly non-circular progenitor's
orbits, substructure is caused by the oscillating differences in energy and
actions with which material is shed at different orbital phases of the
progenitor. This modulation results in different streaming speeds: the
streakline of material shed between two successive apocentric passages is
folded along its length, pulled at its centre by the faster streaming of
particles released near pericenter, which are therefore more widely scattered.
When the stream is coherent enough, this mechanism is potentially capable of
generating a bimodal profile in the density distributions of the longer wraps
of more massive progenitors, which I dub `bifurcations'. The conditions for
internal coherence are explored and I comment on the cases of Palomar 5,
Willman 1, the Anticenter and Sagittarius' streams. Analytical methods are
accompanied by numerical experiments, performed using a purposely built
generative model, also presented here.

~600 will be detectable in both Euclid's VIS (optical) channel and NISP H-band

stripping in haloes less massive than ~10^14 Msun, and to modify our model for
radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our
previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the
overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is
calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass
function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass.
Massive galaxies (M>10^11 [Msun]) assemble most of their mass before z=1 and
are predominantly old and passive at z=0, while lower mass galaxies assemble
later and, for M<10^9.5 (Msun), are still predominantly blue and star forming

star wandering too close to a supermassive black hole (BH) leading to a tidal
disruption event. This unusual flare displayed highly super-Eddington X-ray
emission which likely originated in a relativistic, collimated jet. This
presents challenges to modern accretion and jet theory as upper limits of prior
BH activity, which we obtain from the radio afterglow of this event, imply that
both the pre-disruption BH and stellar magnetic fluxes fall many orders of
magnitude short of what is required to power the observed X-ray luminosity. We
argue that a pre-existing, ""fossil"" accretion disc can contain a sufficient
reservoir of magnetic flux and that the stellar debris stream is capable of
dragging this flux into the BH. To demonstrate this, we perform local, 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disc--stream interaction and demonstrate
that the interface between the two is unstable to mixing. This mixing entrains
a sufficient amount of fossil disc magnetic flux into the infalling stellar
debris to power the jet. We argue that the interaction with the fossil disc can
have a pronounced effect on the structure and dynamics of mass fallback and
likely the resulting transient. Finally, we describe possible ramifications of
these interactions on unresolved problems in tidal disruption dynamics, in
particular, the efficiency of debris circularization, and effects of the
disruption on the preexisting black hole system.

historical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal models

almost complete recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico
Fermi generalized this statistical approach, in which he started with a general
cross-section formula and inserted into it simplifying assumptions about the
matrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of
the high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final
states. In 1964, Hagedorn systematically analysed the high-energy phenomena
using all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting
temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns to be quite
often that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of
statistical-thermal methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in
high-energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical
equilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception, as
they are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields
fulfill statistical equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium
statistical-thermal models for particle production, fluctuations and collective
flow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction of the lattice
QCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential. During the last
decade, five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior
of the chemical freeze out parameters.

from multiple agents. In order to successfully aggregate the predictions of
agents, the principal needs to elicit some notion of confidence from agents,
capturing how much experience or knowledge led to their predictions. To
formalize this, we consider a principal who wishes to elicit predictions about
a random variable from a group of Bayesian agents, each of whom have privately
observed some independent samples of the random variable, and hopes to
aggregate the predictions as if she had directly observed the samples of all
agents. Leveraging techniques from Bayesian statistics, we represent confidence
as the number of samples an agent has observed, which is quantified by a
hyperparameter from a conjugate family of prior distributions. This then allows
us to show that if the principal has access to a few samples, she can achieve
her aggregation goal by eliciting predictions from agents using proper scoring
rules. In particular, if she has access to one sample, she can successfully
aggregate the agents' predictions if and only if every posterior predictive
distribution corresponds to a unique value of the hyperparameter. Furthermore,
this uniqueness holds for many common distributions of interest. When this

consistently apply the conservation of energy principle when analyzing
mechanical scenarios. In observing elementary and secondary teachers engaged in
learning activities that require tracking and conserving energy, we find that
challenges to energy conservation often arise in dissipative scenarios in which
kinetic energy transforms into thermal energy (e.g., a ball rolls to a stop).
We find that teachers expect that when they can see the motion associated with
kinetic energy, they should be able to perceive the warmth associated with
thermal energy. Their expectations are violated when the warmth produced is
imperceptible. In these cases, teachers reject the idea that the kinetic energy
transforms to thermal energy. Our observations suggest that apparent
difficulties with energy conservation may have their roots in a strong and
productive association between forms of energy and their perceptible
indicators. We see teachers resolve these challenges by relating the original
scenario to an exaggerated version in which the dissipated thermal energy is
associated with perceptible warmth. Using these exaggerations, teachers infer
that thermal energy is present to a lesser degree in the original scenario.
They use this exaggeration strategy to productively track and conserve energy
in dissipative scenarios.

interpret these methods as learning easiness and hardness of the objects in the

classifier in the original space. We provide a thorough analysis and comparison
of information transfer from privileged to the original data spaces for both
LUPI methods. Our experiments show that incorporating privileged information

more luminous in the past. For the highest luminosity states the two-phase
medium can be created up to 1.4 pc from the centre. The presence of dust grains
tends to suppress the instability, but the dust is destroyed in the presence of
strong radiation field and hot plasma. The clumpiness is thus induced in the
high activity period, and the cooling/heating timescales are long enough to
preserve later the past multi-phase structure. The instability enhances the
clumpiness of the mini-spiral medium and creates a possibility of episodes of
enhanced accretion of cold clumps towards Sgr A*. The mechanism determines the

unimportant reaction elimination, isomer lumping, and analytic QSS reduction

developed and demonstrated to be capable of removing more species for the same

skeletal reduction methods. Using this new greedy algorithm, several skeletal
and reduced mechanisms were developed at varying levels of complexity and for
different target condition ranges. The final skeletal and reduced mechanisms
consisted of 213 and 148 species, respectively, for a lean-to-stoichiometric,
low-temperature HCCI-like range of conditions. For a lean-to-rich,
high-temperature, SI/CI-like range of conditions, skeletal and reduced
mechanisms were developed with 97 and 79 species, respectively. The skeletal

and validated using homogeneous autoignition simulations over engine-relevant

Furthermore, extended validation was performed, including comparison of
autoignition temperature profiles, PSR temperature response curves and
extinction turning points, and laminar flame speed calculations. All the
extended validation showed results within the 10% error limit, demonstrating
the adequacy of the resulting reduced chemistry.

functions for a class of nonlinear stochastic control systems. The technique
relies on a transformation of the classical nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
partial differential equation to a linear partial differential equation for a
class of problems with a particular constraint on the stochastic forcing. This
linear partial differential equation can then be relaxed to a linear
differential inclusion, allowing for relaxed solutions to be generated using
sum of squares programming. The resulting relaxed solutions are in fact
viscosity super/subsolutions, and by the maximum principle are pointwise upper
and lower bounds to the underlying value function, even for coarse polynomial
approximations. Furthermore, the pointwise upper bound is shown to be a
stochastic control Lyapunov function, yielding a method for generating
nonlinear controllers with pointwise bounded distance from the optimal cost
when using the optimal controller. These approximate solutions may be computed
with non-increasing error via a hierarchy of semidefinite optimization
problems. Finally, this paper develops a-priori bounds on trajectory
suboptimality when using these approximate value functions, as well as
demonstrates that these methods, and bounds, can be applied to a more general
class of nonlinear systems not obeying the constraint on stochastic forcing.

of inhomogeneous polymer melts and solutions, both in self-consistent
mean-field calculations and in numerical simulations of the full theory
capturing composition fluctuations. The models commonly used can be grouped
into two categories, namely {\it species} models and {\it exchange} models.
Species models involve integrations of functionals that explicitly depend on
fields originating both from species density operators and their conjugate
chemical potential fields. In contrast, exchange models retain only linear
combinations of the chemical potential fields. In the two-component case,
development of exchange models has been instrumental in enabling stable complex
Langevin (CL) simulations of the full complex-valued theory. No comparable
stable CL approach has yet been established for field theories of the species
type. Here we introduce an extension of the exchange model to an arbitrary
number of components, namely the multi-species exchange (MSE) model, which
greatly expands the classes of soft material systems that can accessed by the
complex Langevin simulation technique. We demonstrate the stability and
accuracy of the MSE-CL sampling approach using numerical simulations of
triblock and tetrablock terpolymer melts, and tetrablock quaterpolymer melts.
This method should enable studies of a wide range of fluctuation phenomena in
multiblock/multi-species polymer blends and composites.

were designed to rule out hidden-variable theories, assume the existence of
observables having infinitely sharp eigenvalues. A paradigmatic example is
spin-1/2. It is measured with a Stern-Gerlach array whose outputs are divided
into two classes, spin-up and spin-down, in correspondence to the two spots
observed on a detection screen. The spot's finite size is attributed to
imperfections of the measuring device. This assumption turns the experimental
output into a dichotomic, discrete one, thereby allowing the assignment of each
spot to an infinitely sharp eigenvalue. Alternatively, one can assume that the
spot's finite size stems from eigenvalues spanning a continuous range. Can we
disprove such an assumption? Can we rule out hidden-variable theories that
reproduce quantum predictions by assuming that, e.g., the electron's magnetic
moment is not exactly the same for all electrons? We address these questions by
focusing on the Peres-Mermin version of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem. It is
shown that the assumption of unsharp eigenvalues precludes ruling out
non-contextual hidden-variable theories and hence quantum contextuality does
not arise. Analogous results hold for Bell-like inequalities. This represents a
new loophole that spoils several fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and

where each node takes the measurement, communicates with its local neighbors,
and updates its local estimate and estimation error covariance at the same
frequency. In such a scenario, if the target is not directly observed by
neither a certain node nor its local neighbors, this node is naive about the
target. The well-known Kalman Consensus filter (KCF) has been shown to perform
well if there exists no naive node in the network. The case in presence of
naive nodes has been considered by the generalized KCF (GKCF) and the
Information Weighted Consensus filter (ICF) later on. However, all these
consensus-embedded filters require some global information such as the maximum
degree of the graph, or the total number of the nodes. If these global
information are changing over the time, such as time-varying topologies or
unexpected sensor failures in the network, the performance of the GKCF or the
ICF might be degraded. With communication topology changes, node failures, or
addition of new nodes, the filter performance would be adversely affected. In
this paper, we consider a novel local Weighted Least Square estimator for each
node that utilizes its generalized measurement formed by not only its own and
local neighbors' measurements but their prior local estimates to track the
target. With some approximations in the derivation of the covariance matrix, we
propose the Information-driven Fully Distributed Kalman filter (IFDKF), which
is able to deal with the existence of naive nodes without knowing any global
information. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs
better than the existing algorithms in the considered realistic scenario.

The crosswind and cross drift meander; (3) Swirling jets are organized into

growth need to be considered together with the turbulent fluctuations in the
lower atmosphere; and (8) Extreme events are most likely when waves are not in

satisfy a relativistic equation of motion with an effective confining potential
$U$ which systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon
Fock states. If one requires that the effective action which underlies the QCD
Lagrangian remains conformally invariant and extends the formalism of de
Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to light front Hamiltonian theory, the potential $U$
has a unique form of a harmonic oscillator potential, and a mass gap arises.
The result is a nonperturbative relativistic light-front quantum mechanical

spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics, including a massless
pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in
the radial quantum number $n$ and orbital angular momentum $L$. Only one mass

relation between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space

$\kappa$ underlying confinement and hadron masses determines the scale
$\Lambda_{\overline{MS}} $ controlling the evolution of the perturbative QCD

nonperturbative dynamics, as described by an effective conformal theory mapped
to the light-front and its embedding in AdS space, to the perturbative QCD
regime computed to four-loop order. The result is an effective coupling defined

and categorical variables, with the intention of developing a flexible engine
for multiple imputation of missing values. The model fuses Dirichlet process
mixtures of multinomial distributions for categorical variables with Dirichlet
process mixtures of multivariate normal distributions for continuous variables.
We incorporate dependence between the continuous and categorical variables by
(i) modeling the means of the normal distributions as component-specific
functions of the categorical variables and (ii) forming distinct mixture
components for the categorical and continuous data with probabilities that are
linked via a hierarchical model. This structure allows the model to capture
complex dependencies between the categorical and continuous data with minimal
tuning by the analyst. We apply the model to impute missing values due to item
nonresponse in an evaluation of the redesign of the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP). The goal is to compare estimates from a field
test with the new design to estimates from selected individuals from a panel
collected under the old design. We show that accounting for the missing data
changes some conclusions about the comparability of the distributions in the
two datasets. We also perform an extensive repeated sampling simulation using
similar data from complete cases in an existing SIPP panel, comparing our
proposed model to a default application of multiple imputation by chained

galaxy shows higher central mass concentration and has a longer and stronger

angular momentum mainly to the dark halo. Consequently the rotation speed of
the bar decreases with time, while the amplitude of the bar increases with
time. These features qualitatively agree with the results obtained by idealized
simulations. The pattern speed of the stronger bar largely goes up and down
within a half revolution in its early evolutionary stage. These oscillations
occur when the bar is misaligned with the $m = 4$ mode Fourier component. These
oscillations correlate with the oscillations in the triaxilality of the dark
matter halo, but differently from the way identified by idealized simulations.
The amplitude of the weaker bar does not increase despite the fact that its
rotation slows down with time.This result contradicts what is expected from
idealized simulations and is caused by the decline of the central density
associated with the mass loss and feedback from the stellar populations. The
amplitude of the weaker bar is further weakens by the angular momentum
injection by the interactions with stellar clumps in the disk. In the both
galaxies, the bars are terminated around the 4:1 resonance.

quantum annealing by analyzing phase diagrams for two cases where the number of
embedded patterns is finite or extensively large. The phase diagrams of the
model with finite patterns show that there exist annealing paths that avoid
first-order transitions at least for $5 \le k \le 21$. The same is true for the
extensive case with $k=4$ and $5$. In contrast, it is impossible to avoid
first-order transitions for the case of finite patterns with $k=3$ and the case
of extensive number of patterns with $k=2$ and $3$. The spin-glass phase
hampers the quantum annealing process in the case of $k=2$ and extensive

the specific quadrotor parameters, meaning that this same gain matrix can be
used on a wide variety of quadrotors without modification. The hover and

(un)weighted graph (bi)partitioning problem using branch-and-bound and related
methods. In this note we present and improve an easily computable, purely
combinatorial lower bound for the weighted bipartitioning problem. The bound is
computable in $O(n\log n+m)$ time steps for weighted graphs with $n$ vertices
and $m$ edges. In the branch-and-bound setting, the bound for each new
subproblem can be updated in $O(n+(m/n)\log n)$ time steps amortized over a
series of $n$ branching steps; a rarely triggered tightening of the bound
requires search on the graph of unassigned vertices and can take from $O(n+m)$
to $O(nm+n^2\log n)$ steps depending on implementation and possible bound
quality. Representing a subproblem uses $O(n)$ space. Although the bound is
weak, we believe that it can be advantageous in a parallel setting to be able
to generate many subproblems fast, possibly out-weighting the advantages of
tighter, but much more expensive (algebraic, spectral, flow) lower bounds.
  We use a recent priority task-scheduling framework for giving a parallel
implementation, and show the relative improvements in bound quality and
solution speed by the different contributions of the lower bound. A detailed
comparison with standardized input graphs to other lower bounds and frameworks
is pending. Detailed investigations of branching and subproblem selection rules
are likewise not the focus here, but various options are discussed.

Neininger [Refined Quicksort Asymptotics, Rand. Struct. and Alg., to appear],
but we also prove a similar theorem for uniform random recursive trees.
Moreover, we replace weak convergence in Neininger's theorem by the almost sure
weak (a.s.w.) convergence of probability transition kernels. In the case of
binary search trees, our result states that $$ L\left\{\sqrt{\frac{n}{2\log n}}

conditional distribution w.r.t. the $\sigma$-algebra $G_n$ generated by
$X_1,\ldots,X_n$. A.s.w. convergence is stronger than weak and even stable

flavor $SU(3)$ and isospin symmetries. Such analyses are usually hampered by
$SU(3)$ breaking effects due to a relatively large strange quark mass which
breaks SU(3) symmetry down to isospin symmetry. The isospin symmetry also
breaks down when up and down quark mass difference is non-zero. It is therefore
interesting to find relations which are not sensitive to $SU(3)$ and isospin
breaking effects. We find that the relations among several fully-symmetric $B
\to PPP$ decay amplitudes are not affected by first order $SU(3)$ breaking
effects due to a non-zero strange quark mass, and also some of them are not
affected by first isospin breaking effects. These relations, therefore, hold to
good precisions. Measurements for these relations can provide important
information about B decays in the SM.

structure and classification theory of C*-algebras. It captures more
information than K-theory but is often more delicate to handle. We
systematically study the lattice and category theoretic aspects of Cuntz
semigroups.
  Given a C*-algebra $A$, its (concrete) Cuntz semigroup $Cu(A)$ is an object
in the category $Cu$ of (abstract) Cuntz semigroups, as introduced by Coward,
Elliott and Ivanescu. To clarify the distinction between concrete and abstract
Cuntz semigroups, we will call the latter $Cu$-semigroups.
  We establish the existence of tensor products in the category $Cu$ and study
the basic properties of this construction. We show that $Cu$ is a symmetric,
monoidal category and relate $Cu(A\otimes B)$ with $Cu(A)\otimes_{Cu}Cu(B)$ for
certain classes of C*-algebras.
  As a main tool for our approach we introduce the category $W$ of
pre-completed Cuntz semigroups. We show that $Cu$ is a full, reflective
subcategory of $W$. One can then easily deduce properties of $Cu$ from
respective properties of $W$, e.g. the existence of tensor products and
inductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in $W$ are much easier
since the objects are purely algebraic.
  We also develop a theory of $Cu$-semirings and their semimodules. The Cuntz
semigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving
it the structure of a $Cu$-semiring. We give explicit characterizations of
$Cu$-semimodules over such $Cu$-semirings. For instance, we show that a
$Cu$-semigroup $S$ tensorially absorbs the $Cu$-semiring of the Jiang-Su

extracting the full topological information of a 2d quantum lattice model from

outflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. Bright
afterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.
Afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, when
measured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet and
the ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. High values of
optical polarization detected minutes after burst in GRB 120308A indicate the
presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the central
engine (the power source of the GRB). Theoretical models predict low degrees of
linear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, when
the energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient medium
and propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. Here we report the
detection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of GRB
121024A, measured 0.15 days after the burst. We show that the circular
polarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dust
scattering or plasma propagation effects. A possible explanation is to invoke
anisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angle
distributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce the
complex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

structure of exotic hadron candidates. First, the constituent counting rule of
perturbative QCD can be used for finding internal configurations of an exotic
hadron candidate. It is because the number of constituents ($n$), which
participate in the exclusive reaction, is found by the scaling behavior of the
cross section $d\sigma/dt \propto 1/s^{n-2}$ at large momentum transfer, where
$s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared. As an example, we show that the
internal structure of $\Lambda \, (1405)$ should be found, for example, by the
reaction $\pi^- + p \to K^0 + \Lambda (1405)$. Second, the internal structure
of exotic hadron candidates should be investigated by hadron tomography with
generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes
(GDAs) in exclusive reactions. Exotic nature should be reflected in the GPDs
which contain two factors, longitudinal parton distributions as indicated by
the constituent counting rule and transverse form factors as suggested by the
hadron size. The GDAs should be investigated by the two-photon process
$\gamma^* \gamma \to h\bar h$, for example $h=f_0$ or $a_0$, in
electron-positron annihilation. Since the GDAs contain information on a
time-like form factor, exotic nature should be found by studying the $h\bar h$
invariant mass dependence of the cross section. The internal structure of
exotic hadron candidates should be clarified by the exclusive reactions at
facilities such as J-PARC and KEKB.

statistical estimation, applicable to arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary
prior distributions. A lower bound on the Bayes risk not only serves as a lower
bound on the minimax risk, but also characterizes the fundamental limit of any
estimator given the prior knowledge. Our bounds are based on the notion of
$f$-informativity, which is a function of the underlying class of probability
measures and the prior. Application of our bounds requires upper bounds on the
$f$-informativity, thus we derive new upper bounds on $f$-informativity which
often lead to tight Bayes risk lower bounds. Our technique leads to
generalizations of a variety of classical minimax bounds (e.g., generalized
Fano's inequality). Our Bayes risk lower bounds can be directly applied to
several concrete estimation problems, including Gaussian location models,
generalized linear models, and principal component analysis for spiked
covariance models. To further demonstrate the applications of our Bayes risk
lower bounds to machine learning problems, we present two new theoretical
results: (1) a precise characterization of the minimax risk of learning
spherical Gaussian mixture models under the smoothed analysis framework, and
(2) lower bounds for the Bayes risk under a natural prior for both the
prediction and estimation errors for high-dimensional sparse linear regression
under an improper learning setting.

$\mathcal{O}$($\alpha_s \alpha_t$) to the masses in the Higgs-boson sector of
the MSSM are computed. Adopting the Feynman-diagrammatic approach and using a
mixed on-shell/$\overline{DR}$ renormalization scheme, the new corrections can
directly be matched onto the higher-order corrections included in the code
FeynHiggs. Two-loop diagrams involving several mass scales are evaluated with
the program SecDec. The combination of the new momentum dependent two-loop
contribution with the existing one- and two-loop corrections leads to an
improved prediction of the light MSSM Higgs-boson mass with reduced theoretical
uncertainty. The resulting shifts in the lightest Higgs-boson mass $M_h$ can
extend up to the level of the current experimental uncertainty of about 500 MeV
in the scenario considered in these proceedings.

function, which allows to obtain plasticity rules for the afferent synaptic
weights. The adaption rules are Hebbian, self-limiting, and result from the
minimization of the Fisher information with respect to the synaptic flux. We
perform a series of simulations examining the behavior of the new learning
rules in various circumstances. The vector of synaptic weights aligns with the
principal direction of input activities, whenever one is present. A linear
discrimination is performed when there are two or more principal directions;
directions having bimodal firing-rate distributions, being characterized by a
negative excess kurtosis, are preferred. We find robust performance and full
homeostatic adaption of the synaptic weights results as a by-product of the
synaptic flux minimization. This self-limiting behavior allows for stable
online learning for arbitrary durations. The neuron acquires new information
when the statistics of input activities is changed at a certain point of the
simulation, showing however, a distinct resilience to unlearn previously
acquired knowledge. Learning is fast when starting with randomly drawn synaptic
weights and substantially slower when the synaptic weights are already fully
adapted.

of spanwise-invariant flows is addressed. A 2nd-order sensitivity analysis is
conducted for the linear temporal stability of parallel flows U0 subject to
small-amplitude spanwise-periodic modification e*U1, e<<1. Spanwise-periodic
modifications have a quadratic effect on stability, i.e. the 1st-order
eigenvalue variation is zero. A 2nd-order sensitivity operator is computed from
a 1D calculation, allowing one to predict how eigenvalues are affected by any
U1, without actually solving for modified eigenvalues/eigenmodes. Comparisons
with full 2D stability calculations in a plane channel flow and in a mixing
layer show excellent agreement. Next, optimisation is performed on the
2nd-order sensitivity operator: for each eigenmode streamwise wavenumber and
base flow modification spanwise wavenumber b, the most stabilising profiles U1
are computed, together with lower bounds for the variation in leading
eigenvalue. These bounds increase like b^-2 as b goes to 0, yielding a large
stabilising potential. However, 3D modes with wavenumbers |b0|=b and b/2 are
destabilised, thus larger control wavenumbers should be preferred. The
modification U1 optimised for the most unstable streamwise wavenumber has a
stabilising effect on other streamwise wavenumbers too. Finally, the potential
of transient growth to amplify perturbations and stabilise the flow is
assessed. Combined optimal perturbations that achieve the best balance between
transient linear amplification and flow stabilisation are determined. In the
mixing layer with b<1.5, these combined optimal perturbations appear similar to
transient growth-only optimal perturbations, and achieve a more efficient
overall stabilisation than optimal 1D and 2D modifications computed for
stabilisation only. This is consistent with the efficiency of streak-based
control strategies.

nanostructures to create a lattice of magnetic traps with sub--micron period
for trapping ultracold atoms. These magnetic nanostructures were fabricated by
patterning a Co/Pd multilayered magnetic film grown on a silicon substrate
using high precision e-beam lithography and reactive ion etching. The Co/Pd
film was chosen for its small grain size and high remanent magnetization and
coercivity. The fabricated structures are designed to magnetically trap
$^{87}$Rb atoms above the surface of the magnetic film with 1D and 2D
(triangular and square) lattice geometries and sub-micron period. Such magnetic
lattices can be used for quantum tunneling and quantum simulation experiments,
including using geometries and periods that may be inaccessible with optical
lattice.

mainly devoted to DC properties. The fluctuations of the electrical current

The computation of quantum noise is intrinsically linked (by temporal
correlations) to our ability to understand/compute the time-evolution of a
quantum system that is measured several times. There are several quantum
theories that provide different (but empirically equivalent) ways of
understanding/computing the perturbation of the wave function when it is
measured. In this work, quantum noise associated to an electron impinging upon
a semitransparent barrier is explained using Bohmian mechanics (which deals
with wave functions and point-like particles). From this result, the
fundamental understanding and practical computation of quantum noise with
Bohmian trajectories are discussed. Numerical simulations of low and high
frequency features of quantum shot noise in a resonant tunneling diode are
presented (through the BITLLES simulator), showing the usefulness of the
Bohmian approach.

the distribution of effective temperatures, the shape of the color-magnitude
diagram, and the corresponding magnitude and color distributions. We do so
using an up-to-date population synthesis code based on Monte Carlo techniques,
that incorporates the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an
accurate modeling of the observational biases. We find a good agreement between
our theoretical models and the observed data. Thus, our study, rules out
previous claims that there are still missing physics in the white dwarf cooling
models at moderately high effective temperatures. We also derive the age of the
cluster using the termination of the cooling sequence, obtaining a good
agreement with the age determinations using the main-sequence turn-off.
Finally, we find that the star formation history of the cluster is compatible
with that btained using main sequence stars, which predict the existence of two
distinct populations. We conclude that a correct modeling of the white dwarf

Linear sensitivity analysis is applied to the two-dimensional steady flow past

subcritical and supercritical regimes. Regions which are the most sensitive to
volume forcing and wall blowing/suction are identified. Control configurations
which reduce the recirculation length are designed based on the sensitivity
information, in particular small cylinders used as control devices in the wake
of the main cylinder, and fluid suction at the cylinder wall. Validation
against full non-linear Navier-Stokes calculations shows excellent agreement
for small-amplitude control. The linear stability properties of the controlled
flow are systematically investigated. At moderate Reynolds numbers, we observe

regions where it has a stabilising effect on the most unstable global mode
associated to vortex shedding, while this property does not hold any more at

restricted to isothermal disks, with moderate aspect ratio and viscosity. Here
we simulate the orbital evolution of the gas giants in disks with viscous
heating and radiative cooling. We find that Jupiter and Saturn migrate outward
in 3:2 resonance in modest-mass ($M_{disk} \approx M_{MMSN}$, where MMSN is the
""minimum-mass solar nebula"") disks with viscous stress parameter $\alpha$
between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} $. In disks with relatively low-mass ($M_{disk}
\lesssim M_{MMSN}$) , Jupiter and Saturn get captured in 2:1 resonance and can
even migrate outward in low-viscosity disks ($\alpha \le 10^{-4}$). Such disks
have a very small aspect ratio ($h\sim 0.02-0.03$) that favors outward
migration after capture in 2:1 resonance, as confirmed by isothermal runs which
resulted in a similar outcome for $h \sim 0.02$ and $\alpha \le 10^{-4}$. We
also performed N-body runs of the outer Solar System starting from the results
of our hydrodynamical simulations and including 2-3 ice giants. After dispersal
of the gaseous disk, a Nice model instability starting with Jupiter and Saturn
in 2:1 resonance results in good Solar Systems analogs. We conclude that in a

outward migration of the system, and this may represent an alternative scenario

iron garnet (YIG) has been investigated by both externally heating the sample
(using an on-chip Pt heater on top of the device) as well as by current-induced
heating. For SSE measurements, external heating is the most common method to
obtain clear signals. Here we show that also by current-induced heating it is
possible to directly observe the SSE, separate from the also present spin-Hall
magnetoresistance (SMR) signal, by using a lock-in detection technique. Using
this measurement technique, the presence of additional 2nd order signals at low
applied magnetic fields and high heating currents is revealed. These signals
are caused by current-induced magnetic fields (Oersted fields) generated by the
used AC-current, resulting in dynamic SMR signals.

Both the existence of vacuum squeezing \cite{PAN_squeezing} and generation of

demonstrate that this electromagnetic field also violates Bell-like
inequalities, thereby proving its true quantum nature. This is achieved by the

field quadratures at two different frequencies can be so correlated that their
difference goes below vacuum fluctuations. Thus, electronic noise contains
entangled photon pairs, a key ingredient for quantum computing and

The time dependency is obtained by forming the state dynamics matrix as a

the weights in the linear combination is modelled by another linear Gaussian
dynamical model allowing the model to learn how the dynamics of the process
changes. Previous approaches have used switching models which have a small set
of possible state dynamics matrices and the model selects one of those matrices
at each time, thus jumping between them. Our model forms the dynamics as a
linear combination and the changes can be smooth and more continuous. The model
is motivated by physical processes which are described by linear partial
differential equations whose parameters vary in time. An example of such a
process could be a temperature field whose evolution is driven by a varying
wind direction. The posterior inference is performed using variational Bayesian
approximation. The experiments on stochastic advection-diffusion processes and
real-world weather processes show that the model with time-varying dynamics can
outperform previously introduced approaches.

to a topological Chern--Simons term, in the large $N$ limit is analyzed in
details. We determine the conditions for the existence of a massless conformal
invariant ground state as well as the conditions for a massive phase. We
analyze the phase structure and calculate gauge invariant corelators comparing
them in several cases to existing results. In addition to the non-critical
explicitly broken scale invariance massive case we consider also a massive
ground state where the scale symmetry is spontaneously broken. We show that
such a phase appears only in the presence of a marginal deformation that is
introduced by adding a certain scalar auxiliary field and discuss the
fermion-boson dual mapping. The ground state contains in this case a massless
$U(N)$ singlet bound state goldstone boson- the dilaton whose properties are
determined. We employ here the temporal gauge which is at variance with respect
to past calculations using the light-cone gauge and thus, a check (though
limited) of gauge independence is at hand. The large $N$ properties are
determined by using a field integral formalism and the steepest descent method.
The saddle point equations, which take here the form of integral equations for
non-local fields, determine the mass gap and the dressed fermion propagator.
Vertex functions are calculated at leading order in $1/N$ as exact solutions of
integral equations. From the vertex functions, we infer gauge invariant
two-point correlation functions for scalar operators and a current. Indications
about the consistency of the method are obtained by verifying that
gauge-invariant quantities have a natural $O(3)$ covariant form. As a further
verification, in several occasions, a few terms of the perturbative expansion
are calculated and compared with the exact results in the appropriate order.

earthlike aquaplanet setup is used to study the impact of changes in the
oceanic heat transport on the global atmospheric circulation. Focus is put on
the Lorenz energy cycle and the atmospheric mean meridional circulation. The
latter is analysed by means of the Kuo-Eliassen equation.
  The atmospheric heat transport compensates the imposed oceanic heat transport
changes to a large extent in conjunction with significant modification of the
general circulation. Up to a maximum about 3PW, an increase of the oceanic heat
transport leads to an increase of the global mean near surface temperature and
a decrease of its equator-to-pole gradient. For larger transports, the gradient
is reduced further but the global mean remains approximately constant. This is
linked to a cooling and a reversal of the temperature gradient in the tropics.
  A larger oceanic heat transport leads to a reduction of all reservoirs and
conversions of the Lorenz energy cycle but of different relative magnitude for
the individual components. The available potential energy of the zonal mean
flow and its conversion to eddy available potential energy are affected most.
  Both Hadley and Ferrel cell show a decline for increasing oceanic heat
transport with the Hadley cell being more sensitive. Both cells exhibit a
poleward shift of their maxima, and the Hadley cell broadens for larger oceanic
transports. The partitioning by means of the Kuo-Eliassen equation reveals that
zonal mean diabatic heating and friction are the most important sources for
changes of the Hadley cell while the behaviour of the Ferrell cell is mostly
controlled by friction.

solutions for this problem. For instance, our algorithm needs only one thousand
API requests in order to find the top-100 most followed users in Twitter, a
network with approximately a billion of registered users, with more than 90%

many different purposes, such as finding the most popular users or the most
popular interest groups in social networks. An important contribution of this
work is the analysis of the proposed algorithm using Extreme Value Theory -- a
branch of probability that studies extreme events and properties of largest
order statistics in random samples. Using this theory, we derive an accurate
prediction for the algorithm's performance and show that the number of API
requests for finding the top-k most popular entities is sublinear in the number
of entities. Moreover, we formally show that the high variability among the
entities, expressed through heavy-tailed distributions, is the reason for the
algorithm's efficiency. We quantify this phenomenon in a rigorous mathematical
way.

We construct ELMs by adopting the generalized Wang-Landau algorithm and

Gaussian mixture models or Bernoulli templates; and ii) bi-clustering. We
propose a way to measure the difficulties (or complexity) of these learning
problems and study how various conditions affect the landscape complexity, such

In-operando characterization of such devices by scanned probe techniques is
particularly well-suited for the microscopic study of these properties. We have
developed a scanned probe microscope (SPM) which is capable of both standard
force imaging (atomic, magnetic, electrostatic) and simultaneous electrical
transport measurements. We utilize flexible and inexpensive FPGA (field
programmable gate array) hardware and a custom software framework developed in
National Instrument's LabVIEW environment to perform the various aspects of
microscope operation and device measurement. The FPGA-based approach enables
sensitive, real-time cantilever frequency-shift detection. Using this system,
we demonstrate electrostatic force microscopy of an electrically-biased
graphene FET device. The combination of SPM and electrical transport also
enables imaging of the transport response to a localized perturbation provided
by the scanned cantilever tip. Facilitated by the broad presence of LabVIEW in
the experimental sciences and the openness of our software solution, our system
permits a wide variety of combined scanning and transport measurements by
providing standardized interfaces and flexible access to all aspects of a
measurement (input and output signals, and processed data). Our system also
enables precise control of timing (synchronization of scanning and transport
operations) and implementation of sophisticated feedback protocols, and thus
should be broadly interesting and useful to practitioners in the field.

reproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.
Since pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial
separation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of
pathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic
reproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field
sizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a
maximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This
pattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that
decrease exponentially or faster as well as for ""fat-tailed"" dispersal kernels
that decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this
approach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by
Puccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were
thoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,
95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of
large fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with
independent field observations [Cowger et al. (2005), Phytopathology, 95,
97282; Farber et al. (2013), Phytopathology, 103, 41]. We present a proof of
principle of a novel approach to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of
plant pathogens using wheat stripe rust as a case study. We found that the
spatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m
of the linear extension of the field). Our results indicate that in order to
optimize the spatial scale of deployment of fungicides or host resistances, the
adjustments should be made at a fine spatial scale.

Seymour and Thomas [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, Vol 82, 2001] as
a first step towards an algorithmic metatheory for digraphs. They showed that
some NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial
time on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more
than one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems
that are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of
constant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this
list by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the
monadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most
of the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed
treewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we
show how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two
classes of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context
of directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \in
\mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed
treewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the
union of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the
union of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove
our metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of
independent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of
a digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times
directed treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice
language, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite
sets of digraphs.

  July 2013, PhD Advisors: P. Olko and M.P. Waligorski",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radiation therapy with carbon ions is a novel technique of cancer
radiotherapy, applicable in particular to treating radioresistant tumours at
difficult localisations. Therapy planning, where the medical physicist,
following the medical prescription, finds the optimum distribution of cancer
cells to be inactivated by their irradiation over the tumour volume, is a basic
procedure of cancer radiotherapy. The main difficulty encountered in therapy
planning for ion radiotherapy is to correctly account for the enhanced
radiobiological effectiveness of ions in the Spread Out Bragg Peak (SOBP)
region over the tumour volume. In this case, unlike in conventional
radiotherapy with photon beams, achieving a uniform dose distribution over the
tumour volume does not imply achieving uniform cancer cell inactivation.
  In this thesis, an algorithm of the basic element (kernel) of a treatment
planning system (TPS) for carbon ion therapy is developed. The algorithm
consists of a radiobiological part which suitably corrects for the enhanced
biological effect of ion irradiation of cancer cells, and of a physical beam
transport model. In the radiobiological component, Katz's track structure model
of cellular survival is applied, after validating its physical assumptions and
improving some aspects of this model. The Katz model offers fast and accurate
predictions of cell survival in mixed fields of the primary carbon ions and of
their secondary fragments. The physical beam model was based on available
tabularized data, prepared earlier by Monte Carlo simulations. Both components
of the developed TPS kernel are combined within an optimization tool, allowing
the entrance energy-fluence spectra of the carbon ion beam to be selected in
order to achieve a pre-assumed uniform (flat) depth-survival profile over the
SOBP region, assuring uniform cancer cell inactivation over the tumour depth.

  Therefore, an upgrade of the CMS pixel detector is planned, including a new
readout chip. The chip design comprises additional on-chip buffer cells as well
as high-speed data links and low-threshold comparators in the pixel cells. With
these changes the upgraded pixel detector will be able to maintain or even
improve the efficiency of the current detector at the increased requirements
imposed by high luminosities and pile-up.
  The effects of these design changes on e.g. position resolution and charge
collection efficiency were studied in detail using a precision tracking
telescope at the DESY test beam facilities. The high telescope track resolution
enables precise studies of tracking efficiency, charge sharing and collection
even within single pixel cells of the device under test.
  This publication focuses on the improved performance and capabilities of the
new pixel readout chip and summarizes results from test beam campaigns with
both unirradiated and irradiated devices. The functionality of the chip design
with its improved charge threshold, redesigned data transmission and buffering

stochastic natural gradient descent method, i.e. a method which accounts for
the information geometry in the parameter space of the statistical model. We
show how this learning algorithm can be used to train probabilistic generative
models by minimizing different discriminative loss functions, such as the
negative conditional log-likelihood and the Hinge loss. The resulting models
trained by sdEM are always generative (i.e. they define a joint probability
distribution) and, in consequence, allows to deal with missing data and latent
variables in a principled way either when being learned or when making
predictions. The performance of this method is illustrated by several text
classification problems for which a multinomial naive Bayes and a latent
Dirichlet allocation based classifier are learned using different
discriminative loss functions.
