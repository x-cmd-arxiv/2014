  calls",,,,,"q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.GN q-fin.PR q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A motivating question in this paper is whether a sensible investment strategy
may systematically contain long positions in out-of-the-money European calls
with short expiry. Here we consider a very simple trading strategy for calls.
The main points of this note are the following. First, the presented trading
strategy appears very lucrative in the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework. In
fact, it is such even to the extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a
sense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models
together, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying
state price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile and
this is the main point of the paper. Moreover, these observations arise from
purely structural considerations.

extremely sensitive to perturbations of some entries of the transition matrix,

bounds on the relative error of the invariant distribution that reveal these
variations in sensitivity.
  Our bounds are sharp, we do not impose any structural assumptions on the
transition matrix or on the perturbation, and computing the bounds has the same
complexity as computing the invariant distribution or computing other bounds in

exhibit Parisi's broken symmetry of replicas. The finite size corrections given
by our exact calculation can be reproduced using replicas if we make specific
assumptions about the fluctuations (with negative variances!) of the number and
sizes of the blocks when replica symmetry is broken. As an alternative we show
that the exact expression for the non-integer moments of the partition function
can be written in terms of coupled contour integrals over what can be thought
of as ""complex replica numbers"". Parisi's one step replica symmetry breaking
arises naturally from the saddle point of these integrals without making any
ansatz or using the replica method. The fluctuations of the ""complex replica
numbers"" near the saddle point in the imaginary direction correspond to the
negative variances we observed in the replica calculation. Finally, our
approach allows one to see why some apparently diverging series or integrals
are harmless.

iteration of block ciphers. In the classical case, the Meet-in-the-middle
attack is a generic attack against those constructions. This attack reduces the
time required to break double iterations to only twice the time it takes to
attack a single block cipher, given that the attacker has access to a large
amount of memory. More abstractly, it shows that security by composition does
not achieve exact multiplicative amplification. We present a quantized version
of this attack based on an optimal quantum algorithm for the Element
Distinctness problem. We then use the generalized adversary method to prove the
optimality of the attack. An interesting corollary is that the time-space
tradeoff for quantum attacks is very different from what classical attacks
allow. This first result seems to indicate that composition resists better to
quantum attacks than to classical ones because it prevents the quadratic
speedup achieved by quantizing an exhaustive search.
  We investigate security amplification by composition further by examining the
case of four iterations. We quantize a recent technique called the dissection
attack using the framework of quantum walks. Surprisingly, this leads to better
gains over classical attacks than for double iterations, which seems to
indicate that when the number of iterations grows, the resistance against
quantum attacks decreases.

near infrared spectroscopic follow-up to constrain the physical properties of
SFGs in CL~J1449+0856 and in a mass-matched field sample. After a conservative
active galactic nuclei (AGN) removal, stacking individual MOIRCS spectra of $6$
($31$) sources in the cluster (field) in the mass range $10 \leq
\mathrm{log(M/M_{\odot}}) \leq 11$, we find a $\sim4\sigma$ significant lower
[N II]/H$\alpha$ ratio in the cluster than in the field. Stacking a subsample
of $16$ field galaxies with H$\beta$ and [O III] in the observed range, we
measure a [O III]/H$\beta$ ratio fully compatible with the cluster value.
Converting these ratios into metallicities, we find that the cluster SFGs are
up to $0.25\,\mathrm{dex}$ poorer in metals than their field counterparts,
depending on adopted calibrations. The low metallicity in cluster sources is
confirmed using alternative indicators. Furthermore, we observe a significantly
higher H$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width in the average cluster
spectrum than in the field. This is likely due to enhanced specific star
formation rate, even if lower dust reddening and/or an uncertain environmental
dependence of the continuum-to-nebular emission differential reddening may play
a role. Our findings might be explained by the accretion of pristine gas around
galaxies at $z=2$ and from cluster-scale reservoirs, possibly connected with a
phase of rapid halo mass assembly at $z>2$ and of high galaxy merging rate.

$A$, $B$, and $C$ as a measure of how well one can recover the full state on
all three systems if system $A$ is lost and a recovery operation is performed
on system $C$ alone. The surprisal of the fidelity of recovery (its negative
logarithm) is an information quantity which obeys nearly all of the properties
of the conditional quantum mutual information $I(A;B|C)$, including
non-negativity, monotonicity with respect to local operations, duality,
invariance with respect to local isometries, a dimension bound, and continuity.
We then define a (pseudo) entanglement measure based on this quantity, which we
call the geometric squashed entanglement. We prove that the geometric squashed
entanglement is a 1-LOCC monotone, that it vanishes if and only if the state on
which it is evaluated is unentangled, and that it reduces to the geometric
measure of entanglement if the state is pure. We also show that it is invariant
with respect to local isometries, subadditive, continuous, and normalized on
maximally entangled states. We next define the surprisal of measurement
recoverability, which is an information quantity in the spirit of quantum
discord, characterizing how well one can recover a share of a bipartite state
if it is measured. We prove that this discord-like quantity satisfies several
properties, including non-negativity, faithfulness on classical-quantum states,
invariance with respect to local isometries, a dimension bound, and
normalization on maximally entangled states. This quantity combined with a
recent breakthrough of Fawzi and Renner allows to characterize states with
discord nearly equal to zero as being approximate fixed points of entanglement
breaking channels. Finally, we discuss a multipartite fidelity of recovery and
several of its properties.

evolution, i.e. a general form of time-autonomous positivity and
trace-preserving dynamical equation for reduced density operators, by only
allowing unitarity-breaking dissipative terms acting at the boundaries of a
system. Such setup enables to simulate macroscopic reservoirs for different
values of effective thermodynamic potentials, causing incoherent transitions
between quantum states which are modeled with aid of the Lindblad operators.
This serves as a simple minimalistic model for studying quantum transport
properties, either in the linear response domain or in more general regimes far
from canonical equilibrium. We are mainly exploring possibilities of
identifying nonequilibrium situations which are amenable to exact description
within matrix product state representation, by exclusively focusing on steady
states, i.e. fixed points of the Lindblad equation, of certain prototypic
interacting integrable spin chains driven by incoherent polarizing processes.
Finally, we define a concept of pseudo-local extensive almost-conserved
quantities by allowing a violation of time-invariance up to boundary-localized
terms. We elucidate the role of such quantities on non-ergodic behaviour of
temporal correlation functions rendering anomalous transport properties. It
turns out that such conservation laws can be generated by means of boundary

educated North from the ignorant South. It became attractive to produce, under
the name 'statistics', more or less quantitative descriptions on any subject.
Beyond literary records, the phenomenon can be measured by its semantic
penetration in the press. Even if the ambition of most of these amateurs has
remained strictly descriptive, some of them did raise the issue of proving
through numbers. This is particularly remarkable, since within institutional
science, the techniques of statistical proving, that had been introduced by
Laplace at the end of the 18th century, have remained largely ignored for a

important information about the astrophysical environment in which the solar
system formed. The discovery of now extinct $^{10}$Be in calcium-aluminum-rich
inclusions (CAIs) with Fractionation and Unidentified Nuclear isotope anomalies
(FUN-CAIs) suggests that a baseline concentration of $^{10}$Be in the early
solar system was inherited from the protosolar molecular cloud. In this paper,
we first show that the $^{10}$Be recorded in FUN-CAIs cannot have been produced
in situ by cosmic-ray (CR) irradiation of the FUN-CAIs themselves. We then show
that trapping of Galactic CRs (GCRs) in the collapsing presolar cloud core
induced a negligible $^{10}$Be contamination of the protosolar nebula.
Irradiation of the presolar molecular cloud by background GCRs produced a
steady-state $^{10}$Be/$^9$Be ratio ~2.3 times lower than the ratio recorded in
FUN-CAIs, which suggests that the presolar cloud was irradiated by an
additional source of CRs. Considering a detailed model for CR acceleration in a
supernova remnant (SNR), we find that the $^{10}$Be abundance recorded in
FUN-CAIs can be explained within two alternative scenarios: (i) the irradiation
of a giant molecular cloud by CRs produced by >50 supernovae exploding in a
superbubble of hot gas generated by a large star cluster of at least 20,000
members and (ii) the irradiation of the presolar molecular cloud by freshly
accelerated CRs escaped from an isolated SNR at the end of the Sedov-Taylor
phase. The second model naturally provides an explanation for the injection of
other short-lived radionuclides of stellar origin into the cold presolar
molecular cloud ($^{26}$Al, $^{41}$Ca and $^{36}$Cl) and is in agreement with
the solar system originating from the collapse of a molecular cloud shocked by
a supernova blast wave.

probability distribution on $X_0$ conditioned on the `$n$-past', $(X_i)_{-n\leq

Markov chain of order $n$ and has the property that the distribution on the
present given the past can be uniformly approximated given the $n$-past, for
$n$ sufficiently large. Processes with the latter property are called uniform
martingales, closely related to the notion of a `continuous $g$-function'.
  We show that every stationary process on a countable alphabet that is a
uniform martingale and is dominated by a finite measure is also a random Markov
process and that the random variables $(L_i)_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}$ and associated

in $\{0,1\}$. In the case of finite alphabets, those random-step Markov
processes for which $L_0$ can be chosen with finite expected value are
characterized. For stationary processes on an uncountable alphabet, a stronger

suitable for plasmonic applications. This may seem surprising given the number
of metal compounds to choose from. Unfortunately, most of them either exhibit a
strong damping of surface plasmons or easily oxidize and corrode. To this end,
there has been continuous search for alternative plasmonic materials that are,
unlike gold, the current metal of choice in plasmonics, compatible with
complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. Here we show that copper

with one to a few graphene layers show excellent plasmonics characteristics
surpassing those of gold films. They can be used to fabricate plasmonic devices

Transmission electron microscopy was performed subsequently to the

platinum and is in agreement with the bulk, $\sigma(T)$ and $\lambda(T)$ showed
reduced values with respect to the bulk. The latter are both notably dominated
by surface scattering caused by an increased surface-to-volume ratio. By
lowering $T$ the electron mean free path strongly exceeds the NW's diameter of
$150\,\mathrm{nm}$ so that the transition from diffusive transport to quasi
ballistic one dimensional transport is observed. An important result of this
work is that the Lorenz number $L(T)$ turns out to be independent of surface

  It focuses on the special context of critical symplectic connections on

projectively flat and preferred symplectic connections are critical, and the
relations between these and other related conditions are examined in detail.

spatiotemporal patterns in continuum neural fields. Our main focus is how
fluctuations impact patterns when they are weakly coupled to an external
stimulus or another equivalent pattern. Showing the generality of our approach,
we study both propagating fronts and stationary bumps. Using a separation of
time scales, we represent the effects of noise in terms of a phase-shift of a
pattern from its uniformly translating position at long time scales, and
fluctuations in the pattern profile around its instantaneous position at short
time scales. In the case of a stimulus-locked front, we show that the
phase-shift satisfies a nonlinear Langevin equation (SDE) whose deterministic
part has a unique stable fixed point. Using a linear-noise approximation, we
thus establish that wandering of the front about the stimulus-locked state is
given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Analogous results hold for the
relative phase-shift between a pair of mutually coupled fronts, provided that
the coupling is excitatory. On the other hand, if the mutual coupling is given
by a Mexican hat function (difference of exponentials), then the linear-noise
approximation breaks down due to the co-existence of stable and unstable
phase-locked states in the deterministic limit. Similarly, the stochastic
motion of mutually coupled bumps can be described by a system of nonlinearly
coupled SDEs, which can be linearized to yield a multivariate OU process. As in
the case of fronts, large deviations can cause bumps to temporarily decouple,
leading to a phase-slip in the bump positions.

specific mnemonic technique enable users to successfully recall multiple strong
passwords over time. Remote research participants were asked to memorize 4
Person-Action-Object (PAO) stories where they chose a famous person from a
drop-down list and were given machine-generated random action-object pairs.
Users were also shown a photo of a scene and asked to imagine the PAO story
taking place in the scene (e.g., Bill Gates---swallowing---bike on a beach).
Subsequently, they were asked to recall the action-object pairs when prompted
with the associated scene-person pairs following a spaced repetition schedule
over a period of 127+ days. While we evaluated several spaced repetition
schedules, the best results were obtained when users initially returned after
12 hours and then in $1.5\times$ increasing intervals: 77% of the participants
successfully recalled all 4 stories in 10 tests over a period of 158 days. Much
of the forgetting happened in the first test period (12 hours): 89% of
participants who remembered their stories during the first test period
successfully remembered them in every subsequent round. These findings, coupled
with recent results on naturally rehearsing password schemes, suggest that 4
PAO stories could be used to create usable and strong passwords for 14
sensitive accounts following this spaced repetition schedule, possibly with a
few extra upfront rehearsals. In addition, we find that there is an
interference effect across multiple PAO stories: the recall rate of 100% (resp.
90%) for participants who were asked to memorize 1 PAO story (resp. 2 PAO
stories) is significantly better than the recall rate for participants who were
asked to memorize 4 PAO stories. These findings yield concrete advice for
improving constructions of password management schemes and future user studies.

importance - still an open problem. Many-body localization provides a general
framework for quantum ergodicity, and may therefore offer important insights.
However, the characterization of many-body localization through simple
observables is a difficult task. In this article, we introduce a measure for
distances in Hilbert space for spin-1/2 systems that can be interpreted as a
generalization of the Anderson localization length to the many-body Hilbert
space. We show that this many-body localization length is equivalent to a
simple local observable in real space, which can be measured in experiments of
superconducting qubits, polar molecules, Rydberg atoms, and trapped ions. Using
the many-body localization length and a necessary criterion for ergodicity that
it provides, we study many-body localization and quantum ergodicity in
power-law-interacting Ising models subject to disorder in the transverse field.
Based on the nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group, numerically exact
diagonalization, and an analysis of the statistics of resonances we find a
many-body localized phase at infinite temperature for small power-law
exponents. Within the applicability of these methods, we find no indications of
a delocalization transition.

fluctuations at sharp boundaries or point-like field sources in the vacuum. The
presence of singular energy densities of a field may be relevant from a
conceptual point of view, because they contribute to the self-energy of the
system. They should also generate significant gravitational effects. We first
consider the case of the interface between a metallic boundary and the vacuum,
and obtain the structure of the singular electric and magnetic energy densities
at the interface through an appropriate limit from a dielectric to an ideal
conductor. Then, we consider the case of a point-like source of the
electromagnetic field, and show that also in this case the electric and
magnetic energy densities show a singular structure at the source position. We
discuss how, in both cases, these singularities give an essential contribution
to the electromagnetic self-energy of the system; moreover, they solve an
apparent inconsistency between the space integral of the field energy density
and the average value of the field Hamiltonian. The singular behavior we find
is softened, or even eliminated, for boundaries fluctuating in space and for
extended field sources. We discuss in detail the case in which a reflecting
boundary is not fixed in space but is allowed to move around an equilibrium
position, under the effect of quantum fluctuations of its position.
Specifically, we consider the simple case of a one-dimensional massless scalar
field in a cavity with one fixed and one mobile wall described
quantum-mechanically. We investigate how the possible motion of the wall
changes the vacuum fluctuations and the energy density of the field, compared
with the fixed-wall case. Also, we explicitly show how the fluctuating motion
of the wall smears out the singular behaviour of the field energy density at
the boundary.

limitations on the number and locations of observations motivate the need for
practical and efficient models for spatial interpolation, or kriging. A key
component of models for continuously-indexed spatial data is the covariance
function, which is traditionally assumed to belong to a parametric class of
stationary models. However, stationarity is rarely a realistic assumption.
Alternative methods which more appropriately model the nonstationarity present
in environmental processes often involve high-dimensional parameter spaces,
which lead to difficulties in model fitting and interpretability. To overcome
this issue, we build on the growing literature of covariate-driven
nonstationary spatial modeling. Using process convolution techniques, we
propose a Bayesian model for continuously-indexed spatial data based on a
flexible parametric covariance regression structure for a convolution-kernel
covariance matrix. The resulting model is a parsimonious representation of the
kernel process, and we explore properties of the implied model, including a
description of the resulting nonstationary covariance function and the
interpretational benefits in the kernel parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that our model provides a practical compromise between stationary and highly
parameterized nonstationary spatial covariance functions that do not perform
well in practice. We illustrate our approach through an analysis of annual
precipitation data.

$10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$. In contrast, the abundance of large voids found using
haloes in $f(R)$ gravity is lower than in GR. The more efficient halo formation
in underdense regions makes $f(R)$ voids less empty of haloes. This counter
intuitive result suggests that voids are not necessarily emptier in $f(R)$ if
one looks at galaxies in voids. Indeed, the halo number density profiles of
voids are not distinguishable from GR. However, the same $f(R)$ voids are more
empty of dark matter. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational
lensing of voids, for which the combination of a spec-$z$ and a photo-$z$
survey over the same sky is necessary. For a volume of 1~(Gpc/$h$)$^3$,
neglecting the lensing shape noise, $|f_{R0}|=10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$ may be
distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids by
4 and 8$\sigma$. The line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the
main systematics that limits the significance of this signal, limiting the
constraining power for $|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$. The halo void abundance being
smaller and the steepening of dark matter void profiles in $f(R)$ models are
unique features that can be combined to break the degeneracy between $|f_{R0}|$

are greater in $f(R)$. Model differences in velocity profiles imply potential
powerful constraints of the model in phase space and in redshift space.

flux running along an idealized cosmic string in a high-dimensional spacetime,
admitting that the coordinate along the string's axis is compactified.
Additionally we admit the presence of an magnetic flux enclosed by the
compactification axis. In order to develop this analysis we calculate the
complete set of normalized bosonic wave-functions obeying a quasiperiodicity
condition, with arbitrary phase $\beta$, along the compactified dimension. In
this context, only azimuthal and axial currents densities take place. As to the
azimuthal current, two contributions appear. The first contribution corresponds
to the standard azimuthal current in a cosmic string spacetime without
compactification, while the second contribution is a new one, induced by the
compactification itself. The latter is an even function of the magnetic flux
enclosed by the string axis and is an odd function of the magnetic flux along
its core with period equal to quantum flux, $\Phi_0=2\pi/e$. On the other hand,
the nonzero axial current density is an even function of the magnetic flux
along the core of the string and an odd function of the magnetic flux enclosed
by it. We also find that the axial current density vanishes for untwisted and
twisted bosonic fields in the absence of the magnetic flux enclosed by the
string axis. Some asymptotic expressions for the current density are provided
for specific limiting cases of the physical parameter of the model.

contributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter
annihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic
ray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We
revisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray
boron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark
matter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation
parameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the
resulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously
reported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple
GALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray
antiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,
but that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the
complexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it
difficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the
possibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark
matter. Suggestively, we find that this excess is best fit for a dark matter
mass of approximately 35 GeV and annihilation cross section of approximately
1e-26 cm^3/s (to b-bbar), in good agreement with the mass and cross section
previously shown to be required to generate the gamma-ray excess observed from
the Galactic Center.

Camera (DECam) on the CTIO 4 meter telescope. We obtained broad-band colors of
62412 at the Magellan telescope, which along with 62412's low albedo suggest it
is a C-type asteroid. 62412's orbital dynamics and color strongly correlate
with the Hygiea family in the outer main belt, making it the first active
asteroid known in this heavily populated family. We also find 62412 to have a
very short rotation period of 3.33+-0.01 hours from a double-peaked light curve
with a maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.45+-0.01 magnitudes. We identify
62412 as the fastest known rotator of the Hygiea family and the nearby Themis
family of similar composition, which contains several known main belt comets.
The activity on 62412 was seen over 1 year after perihelion passage in its 5.6
year orbit. 62412 has the highest perihelion and one of the most circular
orbits known for any active asteroid. The observed activity is probably linked
to 62412's rapid rotation, which is near the critical period for break-up. The
fast spin rate may also change the shape and shift material around 62412's
surface, possibly exposing buried ice. Assuming 62412 is a strengthless rubble

in the orbital plane. An accretion wake behind the companion is clearly visible
and the projected arc separation is of order 5''. In the blue wing of the line
emission, offset from the main line, several large ($\sim$5-10''), opposing
arcs are found. We tentatively suggest that this structure is created by the

$z\sim8$ galaxies, including those as faint as $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\simeq-16.6$. We
find that half-light radii $r_\mathrm{e}$ positively correlates with UV
luminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very tight.
Largest ($r_\mathrm{e}>0.8$ kpc) galaxies are mostly red in UV color while
smallest ($r_\mathrm{e} < 0.08$ kpc) ones tend to be blue. We also find that
galaxies with multiple cores tend to be brighter. Combined with previous
results at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim12$, our result confirms that the average
$r_{\mathrm{e}}$ of bright ($(0.3-1)L^\star_{z=3}$) galaxies scales as
$r_{\mathrm{e}}\propto(1+z)^{-m}$ with $m=1.24\pm0.1$. We find that the ratio
of $r_\mathrm{e}$ to virial radius is virtually constant at $3.3\pm0.1\%$ over
a wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos are
derived based on the abundance matching. This constant ratio is consistent with
the disk formation model by Mo et al. (1998) with $j_\mathrm{d}\sim
m_\mathrm{d}$, where $j_\mathrm{d}$ and $m_\mathrm{d}$ are the fractions of the
angular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. A comparison with
various types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar to
circumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that a
sizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.

excess of counts has been found and upper limits have been placed. It is shown
that a similar GRB close to zenith would be easily detected by the full HAWC
detector, which will be completed soon. The detection rate of the full HAWC
detector may be as high as one to two GRBs per year. A detection could provide
important information regarding the high energy processes at work and the
observation of a possible cut-off beyond the $\mathit{Fermi}$-LAT energy range
could be the signature of gamma-ray absorption, either in the GRB or along the
line of sight due to the extragalactic background light.

environments, with the former regulating multiphase thermal structure and the
latter regulating turbulence and star formation rates in the interstellar
medium (ISM). However, systematic studies quantifying the impact of SNe in
realistic inhomogeneous ISM conditions have been lacking. Using
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the dependence of
radial momentum injection on both physical conditions (considering a range of
mean density n=0.1-100) and numerical parameters. Our inhomogeneous simulations
adopt two-phase background states that result from thermal instability in
atomic gas. Although the SNR morphology becomes highly complex for
inhomogeneous backgrounds, the radial momentum injection is remarkably
insensitive to environmental details. For our two-phase simulations, the final
momentum produced by a single SN is given by 2.8*10^5 M_sun*km/s n^{-0.17}.
This is only 5% less than the momentum injection for a homogeneous environment
with the same mean density, and only 30% greater than the momentum at the time
of shell formation. The maximum mass in hot gas is quite insensitive to
environmental inhomogeneity. Strong magnetic fields alter the hot gas mass at
very late times, but the momentum injection remains the same. Initial
experiments with multiple spatially-correlated SNe show a momentum per event
nearly as large as single-SN cases. We also present a full numerical parameter
study to assess convergence requirements. For convergence in the momentum and
other quantities, we find that the numerical resolution dx and the initial size
of the SNR r_init must satisfy dx, r_init<r_sf/3, where the shell formation
radius is given by r_sf = 30 pc n^{-0.46} for two-phase models (or 30% smaller
for a homogeneous medium).

Quasar (FSRQ) subclasses, corresponding to radiatively inefficient and
efficient accretion regimes, respectively, largely based on the equivalent
width (EW) of their optical broad emission lines (BEL). However, EW-based
classification criteria are not physically motivated, and a few blazars have
previously 'transitioned' from one subclass to the other. We present the first
systematic search for these transition blazars in a sample of 602 unique pairs
of repeat spectra of 354 blazars in SDSS, finding six clear cases. These
transition blazars have bolometric Eddington ratios of ~0.3 and low-frequency
synchrotron peaks, and are thus FSRQ-like. We show that the strong EW
variability (up to an unprecedented factor of >60) is due to swamping of the
BELs from variability in jet continuum emission, which is stronger in amplitude
and shorter in timescale than typical blazars. Although these transition
blazars appear to switch between FSRQ and BLL according to the
phenomenologically-based EW scheme, we show that they are most likely rare
cases of FSRQs with radiatively efficient accretion flows and especially
strongly-beamed jets. These results have implications for the decrease of the

Ryu-Takayanagi formula states that the entanglement entropy of a subregion is
given by the length of a certain bulk geodesic. The entanglement entropy can be
operationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the
subregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a
reference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other
bulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information
theoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more
general bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new
task called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary
subregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale
in a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that
the cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of
constrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the
signed length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,
constrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This
demonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the
length of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that
it uses the minimum amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we
additionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for
intervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge
are well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts. We also revisit the
relationship between the differential entropy and the maximum entropy among
locally consistent density operators, demonstrating large quantitative
discrepancy between the two quantities in conformal field theories.

wherein low mass halo formation is heavily suppressed, is nearly
indistinguishable to that of a CDM universe whose low mass halos are not seen
because galaxy formation is suppressed below some threshold halo mass. However,
if the scatter between dwarf galaxy luminosity and halo properties is large
enough, low mass CDM halos would sometimes host relatively bright galaxies
thereby populating CDM voids with the occasional isolated galaxy and reducing
the numbers of completely empty voids. Otherwise, without high mass to light
scatter, all mock galaxy clustering statistics that we consider--the
auto-correlation function, the numbers and radial profiles of satellites, the
numbers of isolated galaxies, and the PDF of small voids--are nearly identical
in CDM and WDM. WDM voids are neither larger nor emptier than CDM voids, when
constructed from abundance-matched halo catalogs. It is thus a challenge to
determine whether the CDM problem of the over-abundance of small halos with
respect to the number density of observed dwarf galaxies has a cosmological

the dependence on the binary mass ratio with $q\equiv m_{\rm bh}/M_{\rm

of magnetic field energy is the smallest. The cooling luminosity around merger
is only marginally smaller than that of a single, non-spinning black hole.
Incipient jets are launched independently of the mass ratio, while the same
initial disk accreting on a single non-spinning black hole does not lead to a
jet, as expected. For all mass ratios we see a transient behavior in the
collimated, magnetized outflows lasting $2-5 ( M/10^8M_\odot ) \rm days$ after
merger: the outflows become increasingly magnetically dominated and accelerated
to higher velocities, boosting the Poynting luminosity. These sudden changes
can alter the electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially help
distinguish mergers of black holes in AGNs from single accreting black holes
based on jet morphology alone.

that the narrow feature is superimposed on a broad, shallow component. The
total line profile appears to be correlated with the 21 cm H I line profile

bright radio flare, peaking at around 90 mJy, occurred around one day later,

metallicity, are both consistent with previous z~1 studies of star-forming
galaxies. We then study the relationship between the three properties using
various plane-fitting techniques (Lara-Lopez et al.) and a curve-fitting
projection (Mannucci et al.). In all cases, we exclude strong dependence of the
M-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and no
dependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR
studies. We check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependence
on the SFR by using mock samples drawn from the SDSS. These experiments reveal
that the adopted signal-to-noise cuts may have a significant effect on the
measured dependence. Further work is needed to investigate these results, and
to test whether a ""fundamental metallicity relation"" or a ""fundamental plane""
describes star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.

the Virgo cluster. Based on the specific stellar angular momentum lambda_e and
the ellipticity, we find 11 slow rotators and 28 fast rotators. The fast
rotators in the outer parts of the Virgo cluster rotate significantly faster
than fast rotators in the inner parts of the cluster. Moreover, 10 out of the
11 slow rotators are located in the inner 3 degrees (D < 1 Mpc) of the cluster.
The fast rotators contain subtle disky structures that are visible in high-pass
filtered optical images, while the slow rotators do not exhibit these
structures. In addition, two of the dEs have kinematically decoupled cores and
four more have emission partially filling in the Balmer absorption lines. These
properties suggest that Virgo cluster dEs may have originated from late-type
star-forming galaxies that were transformed by the environment after their
infall into the cluster. The correlation between lambda_e and the
clustercentric distance can be explained by a scenario where low luminosity
star-forming galaxies fall into the cluster, their gas is rapidly removed by
ram pressure stripping, although some of it can be retained in their core,
their star-formation is quenched but their stellar kinematics are preserved.
After a long time in the cluster and several passes through its center, the
galaxies are heated up and transformed into slow rotating dEs.

a bulk-insulating state carries dissipationless spin transport along the
surfaces, embedded by the $Z_2$ topological invariant. In the noninteracting
limit, this exotic state has been intensively studied and explored with
realistic systems, such as HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. Yet an interacting
topological insulator is still an elusive subject, and most related analyses
rely on the mean-field approximation and numerical simulations. Among the
approaches, the mean-field approximation fails to predict the topological phase
transition, in particular at intermediate interaction strength without
spontaneously breaking symmetry. In this review, we develop an analytical
approach based on a combined perturbative and self-consistent mean-field
treatment of interactions that is capable of capturing topological phase
transitions beyond either method when used independently. As an illustration of
the method, we study the effects of short-ranged interactions on the $Z_2$
topological insulator phase, also known as the quantum spin Hall phase, in
three generalized versions of the Kane-Mele model at half-filling on the
honeycomb lattice. The results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte
Carlo calculations on the same model, and cannot be reproduced by either a
perturbative treatment or a self-consistent mean-field treatment of the
interactions. Our analytical approach helps to clarify how the symmetries of
the one-body terms of the Hamiltonian determine whether interactions tend to
stabilize or destabilize a topological phase. Moreover, our method should be
applicable to a wide class of models where topological transitions due to
interactions are in principle possible, but are not correctly predicted by
either perturbative or self-consistent treatments.

of axion(-like) particles (ALPs) that could be detected through their coupling
to photons in external magnetic fields. This coupling could lead to
modifications of $\gamma$-ray spectra from extragalactic sources. Above a
certain energy, the $\gamma$-ray flux should be exponentially damped due to the
interaction with photons of background radiations fields. ALPs, on the other
hand, propagate unimpeded over cosmological distances and a reconversion into
$\gamma$-rays could lead to an additional component in the spectra. Here, we
present the sensitivity of the proposed Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to
detect this spectral hardening. Using the full instrumental response functions
of CTA, a combined likelihood analysis of four $\gamma$-ray sources shows that
a significant detection of the ALP signal is possible for couplings

foreground Galactic column densities (N_H < 5*10^20 cm^-2). A total of 53 ULXs
were detected and we confirm that this is a complete catalogue of ULXs for the
LIRG sample. We examine the evolution of ULX spectra with luminosity by
stacking the spectra of individual objects in three luminosity bins, finding a
distinct change in spectral index at luminosity ~2 *10^39 erg s^-1. This may be
a change in spectrum as 10 M_sun black holes transit from a ~Eddington to a
super-Eddington accretion regime, and is supported by a plausible detection of
partially-ionised absorption imprinted on the spectrum of the luminous ULX (L_X
~5*10^39 erg s^-1) CXOU J024238.9-000055 in NGC 1068, consistent with the
highly ionised massive wind that we would expect to see driven by a
super-Eddington accretion flow. This sample shows a large deficit in the number
of ULXs detected per unit SFR (0.2 ULXs M_sun^-1 yr^-1). This deficit also
manifests itself as a lower differential X-ray luminosity function
normalisation for the LIRG sample than for samples of other star forming
galaxies. We show that it is unlikely that this deficit is a purely
observational effect. Part of this deficit might be attributable to the high
metallicity of the LIRGs impeding the production efficiency of ULXs and/or a
lag between the star formation starting and the production of ULXs; however, we
argue that the evidence -- including very low N_ULX/L_FIR, and an even lower
ULX incidence in the central regions of the LIRGs -- shows that the main
culprit for this deficit is likely to be the high column of gas and dust in
these galaxies, that fuels the high SFR but also acts to obscure many ULXs from
our view.

the third Chern character of ""tilt-stable"" two-term complexes on smooth

absorption of a single x-ray photon quickly diffuse and generate charge-spots
often larger than pixel dimensions. In the soft x-ray range this phenomenon
drastically limits the effective spatial resolution to approximately 25\mu m,
irrespective of the pixel size. For very low fluence the charge-cloud centroid
determination can be used, on each individual spot, to estimate the actual
photon impact position with sub-pixel precision. The readout noise and speed,
together with the charge and spatial undersampling, are the main factors
limiting the accuracy of this procedure in commercial devices. We have
developed and extensively tested an algorithm for efficient centroid
reconstruction on images acquired by low noise detectors not designed for
single photon counting. We have thus measured a position uncertainty of 6-7\mu
m in CCDs with 13.5\mu m and 20.0\mu m pixel size, around 1 keV photon energy.
We have analyzed the centroid calculation performances by modelling the spot
generation process. We show how the resolution is affected by both random
uncertainty, mainly ascribed to the readout noise, and systematic error, due to
the undersampling of the charge spot. This study was motivated by the growing
need of of high-resolution high-sensitivity 2D position sensitive detectors in

different genes, leading to patterning in the developing embryos. The current
view of the formation of morphogen gradients is that it is a result of complex
reaction-diffusion processes that include the strongly localized production,
diffusion and uniform degradation of signaling molecules. However, multiple
experimental studies also suggest that the production of morphogen in many
cases is delocalized. We develop a theoretical method that allows us to
investigate the role of the delocalization in the formation of morphogen
gradients. The approach is based on discrete-state stochastic models that can
be solved exactly for arbitrary production lengths and production rates of
morphogen molecules. Our analysis shows that the delocalization might have a
strong effect on mechanisms of the morphogen gradient formation. The physical

process-independent method to derive renormalization scheme- and scale-
independent fixed-order pQCD predictions. In Ref.\cite{pmc3}, we studied the
top-quark charge asymmetry at the Tevatron. By applying the PMC, we have shown
that the large discrepancies for the top-quark charge asymmetry between the
Standard Model estimate and the CDF and D0 data are greatly reduced. In the
present paper, with the help of the Bernreuther-Si program, we present a
detailed PMC analysis on the top-quark pair production up to
next-to-next-to-leading order level at the LHC. After applying PMC scale
setting, the pQCD prediction for the top-quark charge asymmetry at the LHC has
very small scale uncertainty; e.g., $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 7 TeV;PMC}
=\left(1.15^{+0.01}_{-0.03}\right)\%$, $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 8 TeV;PMC}
=\left(1.03^{+0.01}_{+0.00}\right)\%$, and $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 14 TeV;PMC}
=\left(0.62^{+0.00}_{-0.02}\right)\%$. The corresponding predictions using
conventional scale setting are: $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 7 TeV;Conv.}
=\left(1.23^{+0.14}_{-0.14}\right)\%$, $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 8 TeV;Conv.}
=\left(1.11^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\right)\%$, and $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 14 TeV;Conv.}
=\left(0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.05}\right)\%$. In these predictions, the scale errors
are predicted by varying the initial renormalization and factorization scales
in the ranges $\mu^{\rm init}_r\in[m_t/2,2m_t]$ and $\mu_f\in[m_t/2,2m_t]$. The
PMC predictions are also in better agreement with the available ATLAS and CMS
data. In addition, we have calculated the top-quark charge asymmetry assuming
several typical cuts on the top-pair invariant mass $M_{t\bar{t}}$. For
example, assuming $M_{t\bar{t}}>0.5 ~ {\rm TeV}$ and $\mu_f=\mu^{\rm init}_r
=m_t$, we obtain $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 7 TeV;PMC}=2.67\%$, $A_{\rm C}|_{\rm 8

(NGS) technologies typically involves mapping reads to a reference sequence or
clustering reads. For a number of species a reference genome is not available
so the analyses of targeted sequencing data, for example polymorphic structural
variation caused by mobile elements is difficult; clustering methods are
preferred for such data analysis. Clustering of reads requires a clustering
threshold parameter, which is used to compare and group reads. However,
determining the optimal clustering threshold for a read dataset is challenging
because of different sequence composition, the number of sequences present, and
also the amount of sequencing errors in the dataset. High values of the
clustering threshold parameter can falsely inflate the number of recovered
genomic regions, while low values of clustering threshold can merge reads from
distinct regions into a single cluster. Thus, an algorithm that can empirically
determine clustering threshold is needed. We propose a pipeline for clustering
genomic sequences wherein the clustering threshold is empirically determined
from the NGS data. The optimal threshold is decided based on two internal
clustering measures which assess clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and
large inter-cluster distances. We evaluate the pipeline on two simulated
datasets derived from human genome sequence simulating different genomic
regions and sequencing depth. The total number of clusters obtained from our
pipeline is closer to the actual number of reference sequences when compared to
single round of clustering. Also, the number of clusters whose consensus
sequence matches a corresponding reference sequence is higher in our pipeline.
We observe that the presence of repeat regions affects clustering accuracy.

presents a severe attack on ZigBee networks termed as ghost, which leverages
the underlying vulnerabilities of the IEEE 802.15.4 security suites to deplete
the energy of the devices. We manifest that the impact of ghost is severe as it
can reduce the lifetime of devices from years to days and facilitate a variety
of threats including denial of service and replay attacks. We highlight that
merely deploying a standard suite of advanced security techniques does not
necessarily guarantee improved security, but instead might be leveraged by
adversaries to cause severe disruption in the network. We propose several

in which these processes modify the electron self-energy---a fundamental
quantity describing many-body interactions in a material---has been little
discussed. Here we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission to directly
measure the self-energy's ultrafast response to near-infrared photoexcitation
in high-temperature cuprate superconductor. Below the superconductor's critical
temperature, ultrafast excitations trigger a synchronous decrease of electron
self-energy and superconducting gap, culminating in a saturation in the
weakening of electron-boson coupling when the superconducting gap is fully
quenched. In contrast, electron-boson coupling is unresponsive to ultrafast
excitations above the superconductor's critical temperature and in the metallic
state of a related material. These findings open a new pathway for studying

the cumulants up to third order, extending the Zel'dovich approximation and
providing the power spectrum analogous to the calculations recently performed
for the correlation function. We compare the results to the N-body simulations
and to the Lagrangian perturbation simulations up to the second order. We find
that the analytic calculations are in a good agreement with the LPT
simulations, but when compared to full N-body simulations, we find that while
one loop calculations improve upon the Zel'dovich approximation in the power
spectrum, they still significantly lack power. As found previously in the
correlation function one loop CLPT improves slightly against Zel'dovich above
30Mpc/h, but is actually worse than Zel'dovich below that. We investigate the
deficiencies of the CLPT approach and argue that main problem of CLPT is its
inability to trap particles inside dark matter halos, which leads to an
overestimate of the small scale power of the displacement field and to an
underestimate of the small scale power from one halo term effects. We model
this using the displacement field damped at a nonlinear scale (CLPTs). To
explore this in more detail we decompose the power spectrum and correlation
function into three additive components: Zel'dovich, residual BAO wiggle, and
residual broad band. One loop CLPT predicts small modifications to BAO wiggles
that are enhanced in CLPTs, with up to 5\% corrections to correlation function

data enable us to study the dust in its inner circumstellar environment at a
spatial resolution of 129 mas at 321 GHz and 59 mas at 658 GHz, thus allowing
us to trace dust on spatial scales down to 11 R$_{\star}$ (71 AU). Two
prominent dust components are detected and resolved. The brightest dust
component, C, is located 334 mas (61 R$_{\star}$) South East of the star and
has a dust mass of at least $2.5\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$. It has a dust
emissivity spectral index of $\beta =-0.1$ at its peak, implying that it is
optically thick at these frequencies with a cool core of $T_{d}\lesssim 100$ K.
Interestingly, not a single molecule in the ALMA data has emission close to the
peak of this massive dust clump. The other main dust component, VY, is located
at the position of the star and contains a total dust mass of $4.0 \times

$60$ R$_{\star}$ to the North with the total component having a typical dust
emissivity spectral index of $\beta =0.7$. We find that at least $17\%$ of the
dust mass around VY CMa is located in clumps ejected within a more quiescent
roughly spherical stellar wind, with a quiescent dust mass loss rate of $5

indicates a continuous, directed mass loss over a few decades, suggesting that
this mass loss cannot be driven by large convection cells alone.

from mean field theory which does not describe adequately these systems.
Satisfactory numerical simulations for interfaces at atomistic to mesoscopic
scales remains a challenge. In the present work, the interfacial tension
between mixtures of organic solvents and water is obtained from mesoscopic
computer simulations. The temperature dependence of the interfacial tension is
found to obey a scaling law with an average critical exponent mu = 1.23.
Additionally, we calculate the evolution of the correlation length, defined as
the thickness of the interface between the immiscible fluids, as a function of
temperature and find that it obeys also a scaling law with the average critical
exponent being nu = 0.67. Lastly, we show that the comparison of mu and nu for
these binary mixtures constitutes the first test of Widom hyperscaling relation
between these exponents in 3d, expressed as mu = nu (d - 1). Based on these
values and those for the 3d Ising model it is argued that both systems belong
to the same universality class, which opens up the way for the calculation of
new scaling exponents.

theory and rate statements for stochastic approximation schemes are limited to
monotone maps. However, non-monotone stochastic variational inequality problems
are not uncommon and are seen to arise from product pricing, fractional
optimization problems, and subclasses of economic equilibrium problems.
Motivated by the need to address a broader class of maps, we make the following
contributions: (i) We present an extragradient-based stochastic approximation
scheme and prove that the iterates converge to a solution of the original
problem under either pseudomonotonicity requirements or a suitably defined
acute angle condition. Such statements are shown to be generalizable to the
stochastic mirror-prox framework; (ii) Under strong pseudomonotonicity, we show
that the mean-squared error in the solution iterates produced by the
extragradient SA scheme converges at the optimal rate of O(1/k) statements that
were hitherto unavailable K in this regime. Notably, we optimize the initial
steplength by obtaining an {\epsilon}-infimum of a discontinuous nonconvex
function. Similar statements are derived for mirror-prox generalizations and
can accommodate monotone SVIs under a weak-sharpness requirement. Finally, both
the asymptotics and the empirical rates of the schemes are studied on a set of
variational problems where it is seen that the theoretically specified initial
steplength leads to significant performance benefits.

we propose a neat and economical model for both the fermion mass hierarchy
problem of the SM and a solution to the strong CP problem, in a way that no
domain wall problem occurs, based on $A_{4}\times U(1)_{X}$ symmetry in a
supersymmetric framework. Here we refer to the global $U(1)_X$ symmetry that
can explain the above problems as ""flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetry"". In the
model, a direct coupling of the SM gauge singlet flavon fields responsible for
spontaneous symmetry breaking to ordinary quarks and leptons, both of which are
charged under $U(1)_X$, comes to pass through Yukawa interactions, and all
vacuum expectation values breaking the symmetries are connected each other. So,
the scale of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking is shown to be roughly located
around $10^{12}$ GeV section through its connection to the fermion masses.
  The model predictions are shown to lie on the testable regions in the very
near future through on-going experiments for neutrino oscillation, neutrinoless
double beta decay and axion. We examine the model predictions, arisen from the
$\mu$--$\tau$ power law, on leptonic $CP$ violation, neutrinoless double beta
decay and atmospheric mixing angle, and show that the fermion mass and mixing
hierarchies are in good agreement with the present data. Interestingly, we show

theory, tackled with increasingly sophisticated mathematical methods and number
of matrix models have been solved exactly. However, the somewhat paradoxical
situation is that either models can be solved exactly or little can be said.
Since the solved models display critical points and universal properties, it is
tempting to use renormalization group ideas to determine universal properties,
without solving models explicitly. Initiated by Br\'ezin and Zinn-Justin, the
approach has led to encouraging results, first for matrix integrals and then
quantum mechanics with matrices, but has not yet become a universal tool as
initially hoped. In particular, general quantum field theories with matrix
fields require more detailed investigations. To better understand some of the
encountered difficulties, we first apply analogous ideas to the simpler O(N)
symmetric vector models, models that can be solved quite generally in the large
N limit. Unlike other attempts, our method is a close extension of Br\'ezin and
Zinn-Justin. Discussing vector and matrix models with similar approximation
scheme, we notice that in all cases (vector and matrix integrals, vector and
matrix path integrals in the local approximation), at leading order,
non-trivial fixed points satisfy the same universal algebraic equation, and
this is the main result of this work. However, its precise meaning and role

reduce to it on pure states. We provide an operational connection between our

AGN feedback onto the host galaxy. However, the mechanism(s) for the launch and
acceleration of these outflows are currently unknown, with UV line driving
apparently strongly disfavoured as the material along the line of sight is so
highly ionised that it has no UV transitions. We revisit this issue using the
Suzaku X-ray data from PDS 456, an AGN with the most powerful UFO seen in the
local Universe. We explore conditions in the wind by developing a new 3-D
Monte-Carlo code for radiation transport. The code only handles highly ionised
ions, but the data show the ionisation state of the wind is high enough that
this is appropriate, and this restriction makes it fast enough to explore
parameter space. We reproduce the results of earlier work, confirming that the
mass loss rate in the wind is around 30% of the inferred inflow rate through
the outer disc. We show for the first time that UV line driving is likely to be
a major contribution to the wind acceleration. The mass loss rate in the wind
matches that predicted from a purely line driven system, and this UV absorption
can take place out of the line of sight. Continuum driving should also play a
role as the source is close to Eddington. This predicts that the most extreme
outflows will be produced from the highest mass accretion rate flows onto high
mass black holes, as observed.

amounts of an added immiscible fluid, are dramatically altered with the
addition of the secondary fluid. We investigate a capillary suspension to
determine how the network ages and restructures at rest and under applied
external shear deformation. The present work uses calcium carbonate suspended
in silicone oil (11 % solids) with added water as a model system. Aging of
capillary suspensions and their response to applied oscillatory shear is
distinctly different from particulate gels dominated by the van der Waals
forces. The suspensions dominated by the capillary force are very sensitive to
oscillatory flow, with the linear viscoelastic regime ending at a deformation
of only 0.1 % and demonstrating power-law aging behavior. This aging persists
for long times at low deformations or for shorter times with a sudden decrease
in the strength at higher deformations. This aging behavior suggests that the
network is able to rearrange and even rupture. This same sensitivity is not
demonstrated in shear flow where very high shear rates are required to rupture
the agglomerates returning the apparent viscosity of capillary suspensions to
the same viscosity as for the pure vdW suspension. A transitional region is
also present at intermediate water contents wherein the material response
depends very strongly on the type, strength, and duration of the external
forcing.

events of the Solar Cycle 23 (Chertok et al., 2013, Solar Phys. 282, 175)
revealed that the summarized unsigned magnetic flux in the arcades and dimming

enhances in average from Ap $\approx 50$ to a formally maximum value of 400 (in

significantly exceed 400.

absorption lines indicates that the cloud has an average motion consistent with
the velocity vector of gas impacting the heliosphere and does not behave like a
rigid body: gas within the cloud is being differentially decelerated in the
direction of motion, and the cloud is expanding in directions perpendicular to
this flow, much like the squashing of a balloon. The outer boundary of the
cloud is in average 10 pc away from us but is highly irregular, being only a
few parsecs away in some directions, with possibly a few extensions up to 20
pc. Average H I volume densities vary between 0.03 and 0.1 cm-3 over different
sight lines. Metals appear to be significantly depleted onto grains, and there
is a steady increase in this effect from the rear of the cloud to the apex of
motion. There is no evidence that changes in the ionizing radiation influence
the apparent abundances. Additional, secondary velocity components are detected
in 60 % of the sight lines. Almost all of them appear to be interior to the
volume holding the gas that we identify with the main cloud. Half of the sight
lines exhibit a secondary component moving at about - 7.2 km/s with respect to
the main component, which may be the signature of an implosive shock
propagating toward the cloud's interior.

offer the model of the quantum solid-state N-spin qubit based on the studying
of the spin structure and the spin-dynamics simulations of the 3d-metal Ni
clusters on a silicon surface. The solution of the problem of the entanglement
between a spin states in N-spin systems is becoming more interesting when
considering clusters or molecules with a spectral gap in their density of
states. For quantifying the distribution of the entanglement between the
individual spin eigenvalues (modes) in the spin structure of the N-spin system
we use the density of entanglement. We have studied the Rabi oscillations to
evaluate the N-spin qubits system as a function of the time and the magnetic
field. We have observed the stabilized Rabi oscillations and have stabilized
the quantum dynamical qubit state and Rabi driving after a fixed time. The
comparison of the energy pattern with the anisotropic exchange models
conventionally used for the analysis of this system and, with the results of
the experimental XANES spectra, shows that our complex investigations provide a
good description of the pattern of the spin levels and the spin structures of
the nanomagnetic Ni7 qubit. The results are discussed in the view of the
general problem of the solid state spin qubits and the spin structure of the Ni

spin chain Hamiltonians are analysed.
  A class of random matrix ensembles is defined which include the most general
nearest-neighbour qubit chain Hamiltonians. For these ensembles, and their
generalisations, it is seen that the long chain limiting spectral density is a
Gaussian and that this convergence holds on the level of individual
Hamiltonians. The rate of this convergence is numerically seen to be slow.
Higher eigenvalue correlation statistics are also considered, the canonical
nearest-neighbour level spacing statistics being numerically observed and
linked with ensemble symmetries. A heuristic argument is given for a
conjectured form of the full joint probability density function for the
eigenvalues of a wide class of such ensembles. This is numerically verified in
a particular case.
  For many translationally-invariant nearest-neighbour qubit Hamiltonians it is
shown that there exists a complete orthonormal set of eigenstates for which the
entanglement present in a generic member, between a fixed length block of
qubits and the rest of the chain, approaches its maximal value as the chain
length increases. Many such Hamiltonians are seen to exhibit a simple spectrum
so that their eigenstates are unique up to phase.
  The entanglement within the eigenstates contrasts the spectral density for
such Hamiltonians, which is that seen for a non-interacting chain of qubits.
For such non-interacting chains, their always exists a basis of eigenstates for
which there is no entanglement present.

the dissemination of information, they are becoming overloaded because of the
rapidly-expanding number of information feeds. We analyze the expanding
user-generated content in Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blog site in China, and
find evidence that popular messages often follow a mechanism that differs from
that found in the spread of disease, in contrast to common believe. In this
mechanism, an individual with more friends needs more repeated exposures to
spread further the information. Moreover, our data suggest that in contrast to
epidemics, for certain messages the chance of an individual to share the
message is proportional to the fraction of its neighbours who shared it with
him/her. Thus the greater the number of friends an individual has the greater
the number of repeated contacts needed to spread the message, which is a result
of competition for attention. We model this process using a fractional
susceptible infected recovered (FSIR) model, where the infection probability of
a node is proportional to its fraction of infected neighbors. Our findings have
dramatic implications for information contagion. For example, using the FSIR
model we find that real-world social networks have a finite epidemic threshold.
This is in contrast to the zero threshold that conventional wisdom derives from
disease epidemic models. This means that when individuals are overloaded with
excess information feeds, the information either reaches out the population if
it is above the critical epidemic threshold, or it would never be well
received, leading to only a handful of information contents that can be widely
spread throughout the population.

classic observations of long-range surface wave propagation originally made by
Munk et al. (1963) using a triangular array of bottom pressure measurements. In
the modern data, the direction of the incoming swell fluctuates by about $\pm
10^\circ$ on a time scale of one hour. But if the incoming direction is
averaged over the duration of an event then, in contrast with the observations
by Munk et al. (1963), the sources inferred by great-circle backtracking are
most often in good agreement with the location of large storms on weather maps
of the Southern Ocean. However there are a few puzzling failures of
great-circle backtracking e.g., in one case, the direct great-circle route is
blocked by the Tuamoto Islands and the inferred source falls on New Zealand.
Mirages like this occur more frequently in the bottom-pressure observations of
Munk et al. (1963), where several inferred sources fell on the Antarctic
continent.
  Using spherical ray tracing we investigate the hypothesis that the refraction
of waves by surface currents produces the mirages. With reconstructions of
surface currents inferred from satellite altimetry, we show that mesoscale
vorticity significantly deflects swell away from great-circle propagation so
that the source and receiver are connected by a bundle of many rays, none of
which precisely follow a great circle. The $\pm 10^\circ$ directional
fluctuations at the receiver result from the arrival of wave packets that have
travelled along the different rays within this multipath. The occasional
failure of great-circle backtracking, and the associated mirages, probably
results from partial topographic obstruction of the multipath, which biases the
directional average at the receiver.

correlated with the distribution of molecular gas along the Ridge at the
Galactic Center. Diffuse, non-thermal emission is also seen by the Fermi large
area telescope (Fermi-LAT) in the GeV range and by radio telescopes in the GHz
range. Additionally, there is a distinct, spherically symmetric excess of gamma
rays seen by Fermi-LAT in the GeV range. A cosmic ray flare, occurring in the
Galactic Center, $10^4$ years ago has been proposed to explain the TeV Ridge.
An alternative, steady-state model explaining all three data sets (TeV, GeV,
and radio) invokes purely leptonic processes. We show that the flare model from
the Galactic Center also provides an acceptable fit to the GeV and radio data,
provided the diffusion coefficient is energy independent. However, if
Kolmogorov-type turbulence is assumed for the diffusion coefficient, we find
that two flares are needed, one for the TeV data (occurring approximately $10^4
$ years ago) and an older one for the GeV data (approximately $10^5$ years
old). We find that the flare models we investigate do not fit the spherically
symmetric GeV excess as well as the usual generalized Navarro-Frenk-White
spatial profile, but are better suited to explaining the Ridge. We also show
that a range of single-zone, steady-state models are able to explain all three
spectral data sets. Large gas densities equal to the volumetric average in the
region can be accommodated by an energy independent diffusion or streaming
based steady-state model. Additionally, we investigate how the flare and

(DREG) and we worked in the time-like (TL) kinematical region in order to
ensure the validity of strict-collinear factorization. Both polarized and
unpolarized splitting functions were obtained using independent codes, which
allowed to implement a first cross-check among them. The divergent structure of
all the triple-collinear splittings was compared with the Catani's formula, and
we found a complete agreement. Moreover, in the polarized case, this comparison
imposed additional constraints in the finite part of some master integrals
(MI). The analysis of photon-started splittings led to very compact
expressions, because of gauge invariance. These contributions were identified
with the Abelian terms of the remaining splitting functions, which constitutes
another cross-check of the results.

metallicity AGB star will be presented. The model evolves from the main
sequence up to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Intermediate mass stars are
important because they contribute significantly via the slow neutron capture
nucleosynthesis. The aim of this work is to gain insight on the behaviour of
the AGB star during thermal pulsation. This investigation is based on an
extended numerical simulation of the evolutionary phases and full, consistent
AGB model calculations. In particular, the convective structure during
pulsation will be studied, giving particular emphasis to the analysis of the
stability of the Schwarzschild boundary that will eventually determine the
occurrence of Third Dredge Up (hereafter referred to as TDUP). We provide a
brief description of our updated evolutionary code and focus primarily on the
obtaining the TDUP after 14 thermal pulses. We elaborate on the non-standard
treatment of convection known as ""overshooting"" and its efficiency in achieving
the TDUP event associated with the thermal pulsations (helium shell flashes).
However, our knowledge of the physics behind the TDUP event, and the
theoretical description of the overshooting mechanism suffer from embarrassing
gaps and are, therefore, not properly treated in stellar modelling. This is not
surprising, particularly with the oversimplified descriptions of important
mixing mechanisms like convection in stellar models. However, since such event
drives the $^{13}$C nucleosynthesis of interest for the following s-process
activation, we present a full assessment of this process and its implications
as calculations will further proceed in different directions.

Drawing on techniques for reaction-diffusion systems, we then develop
didactically an operator formalism wherein these rules for crossing dynamics

introduction of composite paulionic operators. The formalism is applied to

it is a hypothesis that is not derived using general relativity. We introduce a
test of the comoving rigidity assumption by measuring the two-point
auto-correlation function on comoving scales---assuming FLRW comoving spatial
rigidity---in order to detect shifts in the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
peak location for Large Red Galaxy (LRG) pairs of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

superclusters or voids show the BAO peak. The tangential BAO peak location for
overlap with Nadathur & Hotchkiss superclusters is $4.3\pm1.6$ Mpc/h less than

spectroscopy of macroscopic ensembles cannot be applied straightforwardly to

methods in combination with distinct features of ultra-cold matter systems
allow us to monitor and analyze excitation dynamics in both the electronic and

therefore reliably probe systems where, e.g., quantum state tomography becomes

the internal static magnetic field at the copper is dominated by the
anisotropic Cu$^{2+}$ 3$d$-orbital contributions, while its weak
temperature-dependence is mainly determined by the isotropic contact hyperfine
coupling to the paramagnetic Pr$^{3+}$ spins, which also gives rise to the full

strategic variant of the generalized assignment problem (GAP). In GAP, a set of
items has to be optimally assigned to a set of bins without exceeding the
capacity of any singular bin. In the strategic variant of the problem we study,
values for assigning items to bins are the private information of bidders and
the mechanism should provide bidders with incentives to truthfully report their
values. The approximation ratio of the mechanism is a significant improvement
over the approximation ratio of the existing truthful mechanism for GAP.
  The proposed mechanism comprises a novel convex optimization program as the
allocation rule as well as an appropriate payment rule. To implement the convex
program in polynomial time, we propose a fractional local search algorithm
which approximates the optimal solution within an arbitrarily small error
leading to an approximately truthful-in-expectation mechanism. The presented
algorithm improves upon the existing optimization algorithms for GAP in terms
of simplicity and runtime while the approximation ratio closely matches the
best approximation ratio given for GAP when all inputs are publicly known.

with the Planck length, or the string length, but it could be also much longer
down to the TeV region. A simple and effective way to keep track of the effects
the minimal length in black hole geometries is to solve the Einstein equations
with an energy momentum tensor describing non point-like matter. The immediate
consequence is the absence of any curvature singularity. Where textbook
solutions of the Einstein equations loose any physical meaning because of
infinite tidal forces, we find a de Sitter vacuum core of high, but finite,
energy density and pressure. An additional improvement regards the final stage
of the black hole evaporation leading to a vanishing Hawking temperature even
in the neutral, non-rotating, case. In spite of th simplicity of this model we
are able to describe the final stage of the black hole evaporation, resulting
in a cold remnant with a degenerate, extremal, horizon of radius of the order
of the minimal length. In this chapter we shall describe only neutral,
spherically symmetric, regular black holes although charged, rotating and

process corresponds to an interferometric device with a fixed visibility and
fixed phase difference for each hyperon. Nature chooses rather low visibilities
expressing a preference to parity conserving or violating processes (except for
the decay $\Sigma^+\longrightarrow p \pi^0$). The decay process can be
considered as an open quantum channel that carries the information of the
hyperon spin to the angular distribution of the momentum of the daughter
particles. We find a simple geometrical information theoretic interpretation of
this process: two quantization axes are chosen spontaneously with probabilities
$\frac{1\pm\alpha}{2}$ where $\alpha$ is proportional to the visibility times
the real part of the phase shift. Differently stated the weak interaction
process corresponds to spin measurements with an imperfect Stern-Gerlach
apparatus. Equipped with this information theoretic insight we show how
entanglement can be measured in these systems and why Bell's nonlocality (in

consistent with the $5.3$ year average suggesting that the observed VHE

simple chain segments in the maximum current phase is studied in the framework
of the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process. The conditions for the
occurrence of this phenomenon are investigated both within the effective rates
approximation and numerically for arbitrary length of the shortcut. The problem
is interesting on its own because the conditions for coexistence of low- and
high density phases are essentially different from those for a simple chain
between two reservoirs. Our main results are: (1) For any values of the
external rates in the domain of the maximum current phase, there exists a
position of the shortcut where the shunted segment is in a phase of coexistence
with a completely delocalized domain wall; (2) The main features of the
coexistence phase and the density profiles in the whole network are well
described by the domain wall theory. Apart from the negligible inter-chain
correlations, they depend only on the current through the shortcut; (3) The
model displays an unexpected feature: the current through the longer shunted
segment is larger than the current through the shortcut; (4) From the viewpoint
of vehicular traffic, most comfortable conditions for the drivers are provided
when the shortcut is shifted downstream from the position of coexistence, when
both the shunted segment and the shortcut exhibit low-density lamellar flow.
Most unfavorable is the opposite case of upstream shifted shortcut, when both
the shunted segment and the shortcut are in a high-density phase describing
congested traffic of slowly moving cars. The above results are relevant also to
phenomena like crowding of molecular motors moving along twisted
protofilaments.

where the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom is important. The proper
multichannel treatment of the hyperfine structure is found to be crucial at
cold temperatures compared to the elastic approximation used for higher
temperatures. Both elastic and hyperfine-changing inelastic processes are
investigated using the newly developed multichannel quantum-defect theory
(MQDT) as well as the traditional coupled-channel numerical method. Cross
section results from the two methods coincide well throughout the energy range.
The MQDT with a few parameters provide an efficient and basically analytic
description of the proton-hydrogen interaction in this energy regime.

of the hydrogen atom a saddle point appears, which is called the Stark saddle
point. For energies slightly above the saddle point energy one can find
classical orbits, which are located in the vicinity of this point. We follow
those so-called quasi-Penning orbits to high energies and field strengths
observing structural changes and uncovering their bifurcation behavior. By
plotting the stability behavior of those orbits against energy and field
strength the appearance of a stability apex is reported. A cusp bifurcation,
located in the vicinity of the apex, will be investigated in detail. In this
cusp bifurcation another orbit of similar shape is found, which becomes
completely stable in the observed region of positive energy, i.e., in a region
of parameter space, where the Kepler-like orbits located around the nucleus are
already unstable. By quantum-mechanically exact calculations we prove the
existence of signatures in quantum spectra belonging to those orbits. Husimi
distributions are used to compare quantum-Poincar\'e sections with the
extension of the classical torus structure around the orbits. Since periodic
orbit theory predicts that each classical periodic orbit contributes an
oscillating term to photoabsorption spectra, we finally give an estimation for
future experiments, which could verify the existence of the stable orbits.

employed to overlap data motion with computation. After identifying a proper
set of tuning parameters, KBLAS is able to efficiently run on various GPU
architectures across different generations, avoiding the time-consuming step of
code rewriting, while still being compliant with the standard BLAS API. Another
advanced optimization technique allows to ensure coalesced memory access when
dealing with submatrices, especially in the context of high level dense linear
algebra algorithms. All four precisions KBLAS kernels have been leveraged to
multi-GPUs environment, which requires the introduction of new APIs to ease
users' experiences on these challenging systems. The KBLAS performance
outperforms existing state-of-the-art implementations on all matrix sizes,
achieves asymptotically up to 50% and 60% speedup on single GPU and multi-GPUs

detections on a nightly basis; transient detections across the electromagnetic
spectrum from other facilities such as SVOM, SKA and CTA; and the era of
`multi-messenger astronomy', wherein events are detected via
non-electromagnetic means, such as gravitational wave emission. We describe
here our plans for Liverpool Telescope 2: a new robotic telescope designed to
capitalise on this new era of time domain astronomy. LT2 will be a 4-metre
class facility co-located with the LT at the Observatorio del Roque de Los
Muchachos on the Canary island of La Palma. The telescope will be designed for
extremely rapid response: the aim is that the telescope will take data within
30 seconds of the receipt of a trigger from another facility. The motivation
for this is twofold: firstly it will make it a world-leading facility for the
study of fast fading transients and explosive phenomena discovered at early
times. Secondly, it will enable large-scale programmes of low-to-intermediate
resolution spectral classification of transients to be performed with great
efficiency. In the target-rich environment of the LSST era, minimising
acquisition overheads will be key to maximising the science gains from any
follow-up programme. The telescope will have a diverse instrument suite which
is simultaneously mounted for automatic changes, but it is envisaged that the
primary instrument will be an intermediate resolution, optical/infrared
spectrograph for scientific exploitation of transients discovered with the next
generation of synoptic survey facilities. In this paper we outline the core
science drivers for the telescope, and the requirements for the optical and
mechanical design.

using the quantum properties of Einstein Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement
available at B meson factories combined with the decay as a filtering
measurement. The method allows a clear-cut separation of different transitions
between flavor and CP eigenstates in the decay of neutral B mesons. These ideas
have been implemented for the experiment by the BaBar Collaboration at SLAC's B
factory. The results, presented in 2012, prove beyond any doubt the violation
of time-reversal invariance in the time evolution between these two states of
the neutral B meson.

collapse of pre-stellar cores of sub-solar mass embedded into a low-density
external environment. Four models with different magnitude and direction of
rotation of the external environment with respect to the central core were
studied and compared with an isolated model. We found that the infall of matter
from the external environment can significantly alter the disk properties as
compared to those seen in the isolated model. Depending on the magnitude and
direction of rotation of the external environment, a variety of disks can form
including compact (<= 200 AU) ones shrinking in size due to infall of external
matter with low angular momentum, as well as extended disks forming due to
infall of external matter with high angular momentum. The former are usually
stable against gravitational fragmentation, while the latter are prone to
fragmentation and formation of stellar systems with sub-stellar/very-low-mass
companions. In the case of counterrotating external environment, very compact
(< 5 AU) and short-lived (<= a few * 10^5 yr) disks can form when infalling
material has low angular momentum. The most interesting case is found for the
infall of counterrotating external material with high angular momentum, leading
to the formation of counterrotating inner and outer disks separated by a deep
gap at a few tens AU. The gap migrates inward due to accretion of the inner
disk onto the protostar, turns into a central hole, and finally disappears
giving way to the outer strongly gravitationally unstable disk. This model may
lead to the emergence of a transient stellar system with
sub-stellar/very-low-mass components counterrotating with respect to that of
the star.

physics is the same used in the {\sl\,PARSEC}~V1.1 version, but for the
mass-loss rate which is included by considering the most recent updates in
literature. We focus on low metallicity, $Z$=0.001 and $Z$=0.004, for which the
metal poor dwarf irregular star forming galaxies, Sextans A, WLM and NCG6822,
provide simple but powerful workbenches. The models reproduce fairly well the
observed CMDs but the stellar colour distributions indicate that the predicted
blue loop is not hot enough in models with canonical extent of overshooting. In
the framework of a mild extended mixing during central hydrogen burning, the
only way to reconcile the discrepancy is to enhance the overshooting at the
base of the convective envelope (EO) during the first dredge-UP. The mixing
scales required to reproduce the observed loops, EO=2\HP or EO=4\HP, are
definitely larger than those derived from, e.g., the observed location of the
RGB bump in low mass stars. This effect, if confirmed, would imply a strong
dependence of the mixing scale below the formal Schwarzschild border, on the
stellar mass or luminosity. Reproducing the features of the observed CMDs with
standard values of envelope overshooting would require a metallicity
significantly lower than the values measured in these galaxies. Other
quantities, such as the star formation rate and the initial mass function, are
only slightly sensitive to this effect. Future investigations will consider
other metallicities and different mixing schemes.

high-energy (TeV--PeV) neutrinos produced in distant astrophysical objects. A
search for $\gtrsim 100$~TeV neutrinos interacting inside the instrumented
volume has recently provided evidence for an isotropic flux of such neutrinos.
At lower energies, IceCube collects large numbers of neutrinos from the weak
decays of mesons in cosmic-ray air showers. Here we present the results of a
search for neutrino interactions inside IceCube's instrumented volume between
1~TeV and 1~PeV in 641 days of data taken from 2010--2012, lowering the energy
threshold for neutrinos from the southern sky below 10 TeV for the first time,
far below the threshold of the previous high-energy analysis. Astrophysical
neutrinos remain the dominant component in the southern sky down to 10 TeV.
From these data we derive new constraints on the diffuse astrophysical neutrino
spectrum, $\Phi_{\nu} = 2.06^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-18}

Taylor-Couette flow of liquid metal carrying axial electric current in a
generally helical external magnetic field. Axially symmetric disturbances are
considered in the inductionless approximation corresponding to zero magnetic
Prandtl number. Axial symmetry allows us to reveal an entirely new
electromagnetic instability. First, we show that the electric current passing
through the liquid can extend the range of helical magnetorotational
instability (HMRI) indefinitely by transforming it into a purely
electromagnetic instability. Two different electromagnetic instability
mechanisms are identified. The first is an internal pinch-type instability,
which is due to the interaction of the electric current with its own magnetic
field. Axisymmetric mode of this instability requires a free-space component of
the azimuthal magnetic field. When the azimuthal component of the magnetic
field is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of
electromagnetic instability emerges. The latter driven by the interaction of
electric current with a weak collinear magnetic field in a quiescent fluid
gives rise to a steady meridional circulation coupled with azimuthal rotation.

that hot dust with T_d ~ 450K is responsible for the high luminosities. These

suggesting these systems are beamed or lensed. We compare this WISE-selected

$\mathcal{O}(H/2\pi)$ in the axion field will result in a smaller angular
fluctuation if the PQ field is sitting at a larger radius during inflation than
in the vacuum. This changes the effective axion decay constant, $f_a$, during
inflation and dramatically reduces the production of isocurvature modes. This
mechanism opens up a new window in parameter space where an axion decay
constant in the range $10^{12}\text{ GeV}\lesssim f_a\lesssim 10^{15}\text{

obtained from the analysis of data taken during the laboratory integration and
validation phase, after the injection of synthetic planets. Since no continuous
field rotation could be performed in the laboratory, this analysis presents
results obtained using reduction techniques that do not use the angular
differential imaging (ADI) technique. To perform the simulations, we used the
instrumental point spread function (PSF) and model spectra of L and T-type
objects scaled in contrast with respect to the host star. We evaluated the
expected error in astrometry and photometry as a function of the signal to
noise of companions, after spectral differential imaging (SDI) reduction for
IRDIS and spectral deconvolution (SD) or principal component analysis (PCA)
data reductions for IFS. We deduced from our analysis, for example, that
$\beta$Picb, a 12~Myr old planet of $\sim$10~\MJ and semi-major axis of 9--10

a relative astrometric position error of 1.1~mas. With IFS, we could retrieve a
spectrum with error bars of about 0.15~mag on each channel and astrometric
relative position error of 0.6~mas. For a fainter object such as HR8799d, a
13~\MJ planet at a distance of 27~AU, IRDIS could obtain a relative astrometric

  homoclinic points","28 pages, 10 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present here the first part of a program for a classification of the
generic dynamics close to homoclinic and heteroclinic points, in the $C^r$
topologies, $r\geq 1$. This paper only contains announcements and a few
sketches of proofs; a forthcoming series of papers will present the proofs in
details.
  The two prototypical examples of non-hyperbolic dynamics are homoclinic
tangencies and heterodimensional cycles. Palis conjectured that they actually
characterize densely non-hyperbolic dynamics. It is therefore important to
understand what happens close to those bifurcations. We generalize classical
results of Newhouse, Palis and Viana, for both tangencies and cycles: close to
a homoclinic tangency or to a heterodimensional cycle there is abundance of
diffeomorphisms exhibiting infinitely many sinks or sources if and only if the
dynamics is not volume-hyperbolic. This proves in particular a conjecture of
Turaev for homoclinic tangencies.
  An important result of Bonatti, Diaz, Pujals states that if a homoclinic
class is $C^1$-robustly without dominated splitting, then nearby
diffeomorphisms exhibit $C^1$-generically infinitely many sinks or sources. We
show that this holds in higher regularities, under the further assumption that
non-dominations are obtained through so-called ""mechanisms"". This includes all
the examples of robustly non-dominated homoclinic classes one can build with
the tools known up to now. We actually have a $C^r$-equivalent of a recent
$C^1$-result of Bochi and Bonatti: we describe precisely the Lyapunov exponents
along periodic points that may appear close to a homoclinic tangency or to a
homoclinic class.
  The results of Newhouse, Palis and Viana were proven for the $C^r$
topologies, $r\geq 2$. Our results hold also in the $C^{1+\alpha}$ topologies.

quantum critical points (QCPs) in the pseudogap single-impurity Anderson model
separating a local moment phase with an unscreened spin moment from a
strong-coupling phase which slightly deviates from the screened phase of
standard Kondo problem. Using the time-dependent numerical renormalization
group (TD-NRG) approach we show that local dynamic properties always
equilibrate towards a steady-state value even for quenches across the QCP but
with systematic deviations from the thermal equilibrium depending on the
distance to the critical coupling. Local non-equilibrium properties are
presented for interaction quenches and hybridization quenches. We augment our
numerical data by an analytical calculation that becomes exact at short times
and find excellent agreement between the numerics and the analytical theory.
For interaction quenches within the screened phase we find a universal function
for the time-dependent local double occupancy. We trace back the discrepancy
between our results and the data obtained by a time-dependent Gutzwiller
variational approach to restrictions of the wave-function ansatz in the
Gutzwiller theory: while the NRG ground states properly account for the
formation of an extended spin moment which decouples from the system in the
unscreened phase, the Gutzwiller ansatz only allows the formation of the spin

investigate the effect of increasing size by injecting an input at every node

the increasing dimension. We provide theoretical justification to the intuition
that high degree nodes pose a challenge to network controllability. In
particular, the controllability Gramian for the networks with bounded maximum
degrees is shown to remain well-conditioned even as the network size goes to
infinity. In the canonical cases of star, chain and ring networks, we also
provide closed-form expressions which bound the condition number of the
controllability Gramian in terms of the network size. We next consider the
effect of the choice and number of leader nodes by actuating only a subset of
nodes and considering the least eigenvalue of the Gramian as the network size
increases. Accordingly, while a directed star topology can never be made
controllable for all sizes by injecting an input just at a fraction $f<1$ of
nodes; for path or cycle networks, the designer can actuate a non-zero fraction
of nodes and spread them throughout the network in such way that the least
eigenvalue of the Gramians remain bounded away from zero with the increasing

Older individuals are usually more cautious, work more slowly, take shorter

dynamic balance, which explains their increased falling risk. Those locomotor
characteristics might be the result of the neurological/musculoskeletal
degenerative processes typical of advanced age or of a decline that began
earlier in life. In order to help determine between the two possibilities, we
analyzed the relationship between age and gait features among 100 individuals
aged 20-69. Trunk acceleration was measured during 5-min treadmill session
using a 3D accelerometer. The following dependent variables were assessed:
preferred walking speed, walk ratio (step length normalized by step frequency),
gait instability (local dynamic stability, Lyapunov exponent method), and
acceleration variability (root mean square (RMS)). Using age as a predictor,
linear regressions were performed for each dependent variable. The results
indicated that walking speed, walk ratio and trunk acceleration variability
were not dependent on age (R2<2%). However, there was a significant quadratic
association between age and gait instability in the mediolateral direction
(R2=15%). We concluded that most of the typical gait features of older age do
not result from a slow evolution over the life course. On the other hand, gait
instability likely begins to increase at an accelerated rate as early as age
40-50. This finding support the premise that local dynamic stability is likely
a relevant early indicator of falling risk.

system are given, he demonstrated ""chaotic likelihood functions"" both of
initial conditions and of parameter values in the Logistic Map. Chaotic
likelihood functions, while ultimately smooth, have such complicated small
scale structure as to cast doubt on the possibility of identifying high
likelihood states in practice. In this paper, the challenge of chaotic
likelihoods is overcome by embedding the observations in a higher dimensional
sequence-space; this allows good state estimation with finite computational
power. An importance sampling approach is introduced, where Pseudo-orbit Data
Assimilation is employed in the sequence-space, first to identify relevant
pseudo-orbits and then relevant trajectories. Estimates are identified with
likelihoods orders of magnitude higher than those previously identified in the
examples given by Berliner. Pseudo-orbit Data Assimilation importance sampler
exploits the information both from the model dynamics and from the
observations. While sampling from the relevant prior (here, the natural
measure) will, of course, eventually yield an accountable sample, given the
realistic computational resource this traditional approach would provide no
high likelihood points at all. While one of the challenges Berliner posed is
overcome, his central conclusion is supported. ""Chaotic likelihood functions""
for parameter estimation still pose a challenge; this fact helps clarify why

  Korea",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have presented a multivariate polynomial function termed as factor
elimination function,by which, we can generate prime numbers. This function's
mapping behavior can explain the irregularities in the occurrence of prime
numbers on the number line. Generally the different categories of prime numbers
found till date, satisfy the form of this function. We present some absolute
and probabilistic conditions for the primality of the number generated by this
method. This function is capable of leading to highly efficient algorithms for
generating prime numbers.

  growth rates",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cancer cells co-cultured in vitro reveal unexpected differential growth rates
that classical exponential growth models cannot account for. Two
non-interacting cell lines were grown in the same culture, and counts of each
species were recorded at periodic times. The relative growth of population
ratios was found to depend on the initial proportion, in contradiction with the
traditional exponential growth model. The proposed explanation is the
variability of growth rates for clones inside the same cell line. This leads to
a log-quadratic growth model that provides both a theoretical explanation to
the phenomenon that was observed, and a better fit to our growth data.

they are query results, feature values, or topic assignments. This paradigm is
characterized by using annotations as multifunctional carriers and making them
portable. The testing grounds we have chosen are two significant enterprises,
one in the history of science, and one in Hebrew scholarship. The first one
(CKCC) focuses on the results of a project where a Dutch consortium of
universities, research institutes, and cultural heritage institutions
experimented for 4 years with language techniques and topic modeling methods
with the aim to analyze the emergence of scholarly debates. The data: a complex
set of about 20.000 letters. The second one (DTHB) is a multi-year effort to
express the linguistic features of the Hebrew bible in a text database, which
is still growing in detail and sophistication. Versions of this database are
packaged in commercial bible study software. We state that the results of these
forms of scholarship require new knowledge management and archive practices.
Only when researchers can build efficiently on each other's (intermediate)
results, they can achieve the aggregations of quality data by which new
questions can be answered, and hidden patterns visualized. Archives are
required to find a balance between preserving authoritative versions of sources
and supporting collaborative efforts in digital scholarship. Annotations are
promising vehicles for preserving and reusing research results. Keywords
annotation, portability, archiving, queries, features, topics, keywords,

complex ecosystem, often collaborative but sometimes combative, around
companies and individuals engaging in the use of these data. We propose that
the interactions between these agents warrants a new topic of study: Human-Data
Interaction (HDI). In this paper we discuss how HDI sits at the intersection of
various disciplines, including computer science, statistics, sociology,
psychology and behavioural economics. We expose the challenges that HDI raises,
organised into three core themes of legibility, agency and negotiability, and
we present the HDI agenda to open up a dialogue amongst interested parties in
the personal and big data ecosystems.
