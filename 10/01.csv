S coupled to an infinitely extended thermal reservoir R. Initially, the system
S is in an arbitrary state while the reservoir is in thermal equilibrium at

the joint thermal equilibrium state, we study the Full Counting Statistics
(FCS) of the energy transfers S->R and R->S in the process of return to
equilibrium. The first FCS describes the increase of the energy of the system
S. It is an atomic probability measure, denoted $P_{S,\lambda,t}$, concentrated
on the set of energy differences $\sigma(H_S)-\sigma(H_S)$ ($\sigma(H_S)$ is
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of S, $t$ is the length of the time interval
during which the measurement of the energy transfer is performed, and $\lambda$
is the strength of the interaction between S and R). The second FCS,
$P_{R,\lambda,t}$, describes the decrease of the energy of the reservoir R and
is typically a continuous probability measure whose support is the whole real
line. We study the large time limit $t\rightarrow\infty$ of these two measures
followed by the weak coupling limit $\lambda\rightarrow 0$ and prove that the
limiting measures coincide. This result strengthens the first law of
thermodynamics for open quantum systems. The proofs are based on modular theory

the deformation axis of $^{238}$U and the relative vector connecting centers of
$^{238}$U and $^{124}$Sn nuclei. We find a formation of thick neck when the
$^{238}$U collides from its tip with $^{124}$Sn. However, the neck formation is
substantially suppressed when $^{238}$U collides from its side. We have found
that a large number of protons are transferred in the tip collision. This is
caused by the breaking of the neck and subsequent absorption of nucleons in the
neck region. We thus conclude that the measured MNT processes involving about
ten protons originate from the neck breaking dynamics in the tip collisions of
a deformed $^{238}$U nucleus.

single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and flat graphene strips (FGSs) in their
natural equilibrium state, that is, the state prior to the application of
external loads. We model CNTs as discrete elastic structures, whose shape and
volume changes are governed by a Reactive Empirical Bond-Order interatomic
potential of second generation. The kinematical variables we consider are bond
lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles; to changes of each of these
variables we associate a work-conjugate nanostress. To determine the
self-stress state in a given CNT, we formulate the load-free equilibrium
problem as a minimum problem for the interatomic potential, whose solution
yields the equilibrium nanostresses; next, by exploiting the nonlinear
constitutive dependence we derive for nanostresses in terms of a list of
kinematical variables, we determine the equilibrium values of the latter;
finally, from the equilibrium values of the kinematical variables we deduce the
natural geometry and, in particular, the natural radius. In the achiral case,
when we can count on maximal intrinsic symmetries and hence the number of
independent unknowns is reduced to a minimum, the stationarity conditions
implied by energy minimization are relatively easy to derive and solve
numerically; for chiral CNTs, we prefer to solve the minimum problem directly.
We surmise that our discrete mechanical model may serve as a source of
benchmarks for MD simulation algorithms. We find that self-stress depends on
changes in both bond and dihedral angles in achiral CNTs and, in addition, on
changes in bond length in chiral CNTs. Our analysis applies also to FGSs, whose
self-stress and self-energy we evaluate; we find that, in FGSs self-stress is
associated exclusively with changes in bond angle.

which Gaussian channel inputs are known to be optimal, the input distribution
that maximizes the achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay channel has
remained unknown so far. For some special cases, e.g., for relay channels where
the optimal PDF strategy reduces to DF or P2P transmission, it could be deduced
that Gaussian inputs maximize the PDF rate. For the general case, however, the
problem has remained open until now. In this work, we solve this problem by
proving that the maximum achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay
channel is always attained by Gaussian channel inputs. Our proof relies on the
channel enhancement technique, which was originally introduced by Weingarten et
al. to derive the (private message) capacity region of the Gaussian MIMO
broadcast channel. By combining this technique with a primal decomposition
approach, we first establish that jointly Gaussian source and relay inputs
maximize the achievable PDF rate for the aligned Gaussian MIMO relay channel.

polymer rings linked together is generalized to the case of links that have a
fixed number $2s$ of maxima and minima. Such kind of links are called plats and
appear for instance in the DNA of living organisms. The topological states of
the link are distinguished using the Gauss linking number. This is a relatively
weak link invariant in the case of a general link, but its efficiency improves
when $2s-$plats are considered. It is proved that, if we restrict ourselves to
$2s-$plat conformations, the field theoretical model established here is able
to take into account also the interactions of topological origin involving
three chains simultaneously. It is shown that these three-body interactions
have nonvanishing contributions when three or more rings are entangled
together, enhancing for instance the attractive forces between monomers. The
model can be used to study the statistical mechanics of polymers in confined
geometries, for instance when $2s$ extrema of a few polymer rings are attached

$(\Sigma,\nu,\alpha)$ and $d\geq 2$. Given the low frequency observations
$(X_t)_{t=1,\ldots,n}$, the dependence structure of the jumps of $X$ is
estimated. The L\'evy measure $\nu$ describes the average jump behavior in a
time unit. Thus, the aim is to estimate the dependence structure of $\nu$ by
estimating the L\'evy copula $\mathfrak{C}$ of $\nu$, cf. Kallsen and Tankov
\cite{KalTan}.
  We use the low frequency techniques presented in a one dimensional setting in
Neumann and Rei{\ss} \cite{NeuRei} and Nickl and Rei{\ss} \cite{NicRei} to
construct a L\'evy copula estimator $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_n$ based on the
above $n$ observations. In doing so we prove $$\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_n\to
\mathfrak{C},\quad n\to\infty$$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from
zero with the convergence rate $\sqrt{\log n}$. This convergence holds under
quite general assumptions, which also include L\'evy triplets with $\Sigma\neq
0$ and $\nu$ of arbitrary Blumenthal-Getoor index $0\leq\beta\leq 2$. Note that
in a low frequency observation scheme, it is statistically difficult to
distinguish between infinitely many small jumps and a Brownian motion part.
Hence, the rather slow convergence rate $\sqrt{\log n}$ is not surprising.
  In the complementary case of a compound Poisson process (CPP), an estimator
$\widehat{C}_n$ for the copula $C$ of the jump distribution of the CPP is
constructed under the same observation scheme. This copula $C$ is the analogue
to the L\'evy copula $\mathfrak{C}$ in the finite jump activity case, i.e. the
CPP case. Here we establish $$\widehat{C}_n \to C,\quad n\to\infty$$ with the
convergence rate $\sqrt{n}$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from zero.
  Both convergence rates are optimal in the sense of Neumann and Rei{\ss}.

carried out at Villanova University to study aspects and behaviors of classical
Cepheids that are still not well-understood. In this, the first of several
planned papers on program Cepheids, we report the current results for delta
Cep, the Cepheid prototype. Ongoing photometry has been obtained to search for
changes in the pulsation period, light curve morphology and amplitude.
Combining our photometry with the times of maximum light compilation by
Berdnikov 2000 returns a small period change of dP/dt ~ -0.1006 +/- 0.0002 sec
yr^-1. There is also evidence for a gradual light amplitude increase of
~0.011-mag (V-band) and ~0.012-mag (B-band) per decade over the last ~50 years.
In addition, HST-COS UV spectrophotometry and XMM-Newton X-ray data were
carried out to investigate the high-temperature plasmas present above the
Cepheid photospheres. In total, from the five visits (eight exposures) with
XMM-Newton, delta Cep is found to be a soft X-ray source (Lx [0.3--2 keV] ~
4.5-13x10^28 erg sec^-1) with peak flux at kT = 0.6-0.9 keV. The X-ray activity
is found to vary, possibly in phase with the stellar pulsations. From
2010-2013, nine observations of delta Cep were carried out with HST-COS. The UV
emissions are also variable, and well-phased with the stellar pulsations.
Maximum UV line emissions occur near, or slightly before, maximum optical
light, varying by as much as twenty times. This variability shows that
pulsation-induced shock-heating plays a significant role in Cepheid
atmospheres, possibly in addition to a quiescent, magnetic heating. The results
of this study show Cepheid atmospheres to be rather complex and dynamic.

  Comparison","12 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key feature of the packet scheduler in LTE system is that it can allocate
resources both in the time and frequency domain. Furthermore, the scheduler is
acquainted with channel state information periodically reported by user
equipments either in an aggregate form for the whole downlink channel, or
distinguished for each available subchannel. This mechanism allows for wide
discretion in resource allocation, thus promoting the flourishing of several
scheduling algorithms, with different purposes. It is therefore of great
interest to compare the performance of such algorithms in different scenarios.
A very common simulation tool that can be used for this purpose is ns-3, which
already supports a set of well known scheduling algorithms for LTE downlink,
though it still lacks schedulers that provide throughput guarantees. In this
work we contribute to fill this gap by implementing a scheduling algorithm that
provides long-term throughput guarantees to the different users, while
opportunistically exploiting the instantaneous channel fluctuations to increase
the cell capacity. We then perform a thorough performance analysis of the
different scheduling algorithms by means of extensive ns-3 simulations, both
for saturated UDP and TCP traffic sources. The analysis makes it possible to
appreciate the difference among the scheduling algorithms, and to assess the
performance gain, both in terms of cell capacity and packet service time,
obtained by allowing the schedulers to work on the frequency domain.

large-scale dynamic processes in biology and materials science, understanding
the details of this supramolecular assembly process requires a modeling
approach that captures behavior on a wide range of length and time scales, from
those on which individual sidechains fluctuate to those on which assemblies of

approach is accurate and computationally efficient enough to do so. Our
approach uses only a minimal number of coarse-grained sites, but retains
independently fluctuating orientational degrees of freedom for each site. These
orientational degrees of freedom allow us to accurately parameterize both
bonded and nonbonded interactions, and to generate all-atom configurations with
sufficient accuracy to perform atomic scattering calculations and to interface
with all-atom simulations. We have used this approach to reproduce all

Reinforcement learning approaches are then proposed to derive reduced
computational complexity solutions to the adaptive coding and scheduling

examined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission. Our
methods offer large performance gains over competing methods that deliver the
data blocks sequentially. The experimental evaluation also shows that our novel

distances ($r_\mathrm{H}$) with space-based SOHO/STEREO spacecraft. To
understand the brightening process of mini Kreutz comets, we conducted a survey
using CFHT/MegaCam at moderate $r_\mathrm{H}$ guided by SOHO/STEREO
observations. We identify two comets that should be in our search area but are
not detected, indicating that the comets have either followed a steeper
brightening rate within the previously-reported rapid brighten stage (the
\textit{brightening~burst}), or the brightening burst starts earlier than
expected. We present a composite analysis of pre-perihelion light-curves of
five Kreutz comets that covered to $\sim 1$~AU. We observe a significant
diversity in the light-curves that can be used to grossly classify them into
two types: C/Ikeya-Seki and C/SWAN follow the canonical $r_\mathrm{H}^{-4}$
while the others follow $r_\mathrm{H}^{-7}$. In particular, C/SWAN seems to
have undergone an outburst ($\Delta m>5$~mag) or a rapid brightening
($n\gtrsim11$) between $r_\mathrm{H}=1.06$~AU to $0.52$~AU, and shows hints of
structural/compositional differences compared to other bright Kreutz comets. We
also find evidence that the Kreutz comets as a population lose their mass less
efficiently than the dynamically new comet, C/ISON, and are relatively devoid
of species that drive C/ISON's activity at large $r_\mathrm{H}$. Concurrent
observations of C/STEREO in different wavelengths also suggest that a blue-ward
species such as CN may be the main driver for brightening burst instead of
previously-thought sodium.

stiff degrees of freedom (bond lengths and angles, as well as dihedral angles
in rings) that are accurately approximated by their average values, while
retaining soft degrees of freedom (unconstrained dihedral angles) mostly
responsible for conformational variability. We demonstrate that our scheme
retains nearly atomistic resolution by mapping all experimental protein
configurations in the Protein Data Bank onto coarse-grained configurations,
then analytically backmapping those configurations back to all-atom
configurations. This roundtrip mapping throws away all information associated
with the eliminated (stiff) degrees of freedom except for their average values,
which we use to construct optimal backmapping functions. Despite the 4:1
reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, we find that heavy atoms move
only 0.051 angstroms on average during the roundtrip mapping, while hydrogens
move 0.179 angstroms on average, an unprecedented combination of efficiency and
accuracy among coarse-grained protein models. We discuss the advantages of such
a high-resolution model for parameterizing effective interactions and
accurately calculating observables through direct or multiscale simulations.

Approximation for arbitrarily strong SOC, and both in 2D and 3D systems. In
both 2D and 3D, we find that the charge plasmons are coupled to only one of the

the modes at finite but not at zero wavenumbers. In 3D, the chiral-spin modes
are strongly damped by particle-hole excitations and disappear for weak
electron-electron interaction. Landau damping of the chiral-spin modes in 3D is
directly related to the fact that, in contrast to 2D, there is no gap for
particle-hole excitations between spin-split subbands. The gapless continuum is
also responsible for Landau damping of the charge plasmon in 3D - a
qualitatively new feature of the SOC system. We also discuss the optical
conductivity of clean 2D and 3D systems and show that SOC introduces spectral
weight at finite frequency in a such way that the sum rule is satisfied. The

studying a generalization of the bounded-degree inputs considered by Buchbinder
et al.~\cite{buchbinder2007online}, graphs which we call $(k,d)-bounded$. In
such graphs the maximal degree on the online side is at most $d$ and the
minimal degree on the offline side is at least $k$. We prove that for such
graphs, these problems' natural greedy algorithms attain competitive ratio
$1-\frac{d-1}{k+d-1}$, tending to \emph{one} as $d/k$ tends to zero. We prove
this bound is tight for these algorithms.
  Next, we develop deterministic primal-dual algorithms for the above problems
achieving competitive ratio $1-(1-\frac{1}{d})^k>1-\frac{1}{e^{k/d}}$, or
\emph{exponentially} better loss as a function of $k/d$, and strictly better
than $1-\frac{1}{e}$ whenever $k\geq d$. We complement our lower bounds with
matching upper bounds for the vertex-weighted problem. Finally, we use our
deterministic algorithms to prove by dual-fitting that simple randomized
algorithms achieve the same bounds in expectation. Our algorithms and analysis
differ from previous ad allocation algorithms, which largely scale bids based
on the spent fraction of their bidder's budget, whereas we scale bids according
to the number of times the bidder could have spent as much as her current bid.
Our algorithms differ from previous online primal-dual algorithms, as they do
not maintain dual feasibility, but only primal-to-dual ratio, and only attain
dual feasibility upon termination. We believe our techniques could find
applications to other well-behaved online packing problems.

was discovered at Earth about seven days later on 2014 January 21, reaching V
maximum light around 2014 February 5. SN 2014J is the closest SN Ia in at least
four decades and probably many more. Recent HST/WFC3 imaging (2014 September 5
and 2015 February 2) of M82 around SN 2014J reveals a light echo at radii of
about 0.6 arcsec from the SN (corresponding to about 12 pc at the distance of
M82). Likely additional light echoes reside at a smaller radii of about 0.4
arcsec. The major echo signal corresponds to echoing material about 330 pc in
the foreground of SN 2014J, and tends to be bright where pre-existing nebular
structure in M82 is also bright. The second, likely echo corresponds to
foreground distances of 80 pc in front of the SN. Even one year after maximum
light, there are indications of further echo structures appearing at smalle
radii, and future observations may show how extinction in these affect detected
echo farther from the SN, which will affect interpretion of details of the
three-dimensional structure of this gas and dust. Given enough data we might
even use these considerations to constrain the near-SN material's shadowing on
distant echoing clouds, even without directly observing the foreground
structure. This is in addition to echoes in the near future might also reveal
circumstellar structure around SN 2014J's progenitor star from direct imaging

used the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these
candidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed
in front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on
correctly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light
curves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need
to explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent
systematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse
depths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented
here exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of
UCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we
achieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that
is inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic
trends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the
available data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further
validate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit
residuals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that,
when we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a
sub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris

Differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function of fluctuation strength
(""fluctuation spectroscopy"") effectively measures the spectral variation of
stars as a function of their luminosity, information that is otherwise
difficult to obtain for individual stars outside of the Local Group. We apply
this technique to the elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, using HST/ACS imaging in six
narrow-band ramp filters tuned to spectral features in the range 0.8-1.0
micron. Pixels with +- 5% broad-band variations show differential color
variations of 0.1% - 1.0% in the narrow-band filters. These variations are
primarily due to the systematic increase in TiO absorption strength with
increasing luminosity on the upper giant branch. The data are very well
reproduced by the same Conroy & van Dokkum (2012) stellar population synthesis
model that is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range
0.03% - 0.09%. Models with ages or metallicities that are significantly
different from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. We can also
rule out several modifications to the underlying model, including the presence
of a significant (>3% of the light) population of late M giants. The current
observations constitute a powerful test of the expected luminosities and
temperatures of metal-rich giants in massive early-type galaxies. Studies of

n=100 cm^{-3}, the momentum generating Sedov and pressure-driven snowplough
phases are terminated early (~ 0.01 Myr) and radiative cooling limits the
coupling to f_therm ~ 0.01, f_kin ~ 0.05, and f_P ~ 9, significantly lower than
for the case without cooling. For pre-ionised clouds these numbers are only
increased by ~ 50%, independent of the cloud structure. This only suffices to
accelerate ~ 5% of the cloud to radial velocities >30km/s. A second SN might
further enhance the coupling efficiencies if delayed past the Sedov phase of
the first explosion. Such very low coupling efficiencies cast doubts on many
galaxy-scale sub-resolution models for supernova feedback, most of which are
validated a posteriori by qualitative agreement of galaxy properties with
observations. Ionising radiation appears not to significantly enhance the
immediate coupling of SNe to the surrounding gas as it drives the ISM into
inert dense shells and cold clumps, a process which is unresolved in galaxy
scale simulations. Our results support previous conclusions that supernovae
might only drive a wind if a significant fraction explodes in low-density
environments or if they are supported by processes other than ionising

elaborate, and so we discuss possible UV completions in the context of Type IIB
orientifold compactifications with RR axions. We find that an embedding is
possible and that dangerous sinusoidal corrections can be suppressed through
the compactification geometry. Our main result is that even when additional
sources of primordial gravity waves are competitive with the inflaton, a
positive B-mode detection would still be a relatively good indicator of the
scale of inflation. This conclusion will be strengthened by future constraints

these measurements with 53 previously published M31 SNR progenitor measurements

mass distributions, we fit power laws of the form $dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$.
Our new, larger sample of M31 progenitors follows a distribution with $\alpha =
4.4\pm 0.4$, and the M33 sample follows a distribution with $\alpha =
3.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. Thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties,
and the full sample across both galaxies gives $\alpha = 4.2\pm 0.3$. Both the
individual and full distributions display a paucity of massive stars when
compared to a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), which we would expect to
observe if all massive stars exploded as SN that leave behind observable SNR.
If we instead fix $\alpha = 2.35$ and treat the maximum mass as a free
parameter, we find $M_{max} \sim 35-45M_{sun}$, indicative of a potential
maximum cutoff mass for SN production. Our results suggest that either SNR
surveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest (<10 Myr old)

wind and ionizing radiation output. The wind contribution is uncertain because
the boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe.
Mid-infrared observations (e.g., of the H II region RCW 120) show arcs of dust
emission around O stars, contained well within the H II region bubble. These
arcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted by
density gradients and/or stellar motion. We present two-dimensional,
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubbles
and H II regions around massive stars moving through a dense (n=3000 cm^{-3}),
uniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km/s. The H II region
morphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the wind
bubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocity
considered. Wind bubbles do not fill their H II regions (we find filling
factors of 10-20%), at least for a main sequence star with mass M~30 Msun.
Furthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does not
significantly trap the ionization front. X-ray emission from the wind bubble is
soft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind
bubble and the H II region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy
in X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler
photoionized gas. Comparison of the simulations with the H II region RCW 120
shows that its dynamical age is <=0.4 Myr and that stellar motion <=4 km/s is
allowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star but
more likely formed in situ. The region's youth, and apparent isolation from
other O or B stars, makes it very interesting for studies of massive star
formation and of initial mass functions.

to complete as late as $z \sim 5.5$, provided the ionization state of the

this case, significantly neutral islands may remain amongst highly ionized gas
with the ionized regions allowing some transmission through the Ly-$\alpha$
forest. This possibility has the important virtue that it is eminently testable
with existing Ly-$\alpha$ forest data. In particular, we describe three
observable signatures of significantly neutral gas in the $z \sim 5.5$ IGM. We
use mock quasar spectra produced from numerical simulations of reionization to
develop these tests. First, we quantify how the abundance and length of
absorbed regions in the forest increase with the volume-averaged neutral
fraction in our reionization model. Second, we consider stacking the
transmission profile around highly absorbed regions in the forest. If and only
if there is significantly neutral gas in the IGM, absorption in the damping
wing of the Ly-$\alpha$ line will cause the transmission to recover slowly as
one moves from absorbed to transmitted portions of the spectrum. Third, the
deuterium Ly-$\beta$ line should imprint a small but distinctive absorption
feature slightly blueward of absorbed neutral regions in the Ly-$\beta$ forest.
We show that these tests can be carried out with existing Keck HIRES spectra at
$z \sim 5.5$, with the damping wing being observable for $< x_{\text{HI}}

between stars that retain their initial lithium and those at slightly higher
masses in which Li has been depleted by nuclear reactions, the lithium
depletion boundary (LDB), has been advanced as an almost model-independent
means of establishing an age scale for young stars. Here we construct
polytropic models of contracting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) that have cool,
magnetic starspots blocking a fraction $\beta$ of their photospheric flux.
Starspots slow the descent along Hayashi tracks, leading to lower core
temperatures and less Li destruction at a given mass and age. The age,
$\tau_{\rm LDB}$, determined from the luminosity of the LDB, $L_{\rm LDB}$, is
increased by a factor $(1-\beta)^{-E}$ compared to that inferred from unspotted
models, where $E \simeq 1 + d\log \tau_{\rm LDB}/d \log L_{\rm LDB}$ and has a
value $\sim 0.5$ at ages $< 80$ Myr, decreasing to $\sim 0.3$ for older stars.
Spotted stars have virtually the same relationship between K-band bolometric
correction and colour as unspotted stars, so this relationship applies equally
to ages inferred from the absolute K magnitude of the LDB. Low-mass PMS stars
do have starspots, but the appropriate value of $\beta$ is highly uncertain
with a probable range of $0.1 < \beta < 0.4$. For the smaller $\beta$ values
our result suggests a modest systematic increase in LDB ages that is comparable
with the maximum levels of theoretical uncertainty previously claimed for the
technique. The largest $\beta$ values would however increase LDB ages by 20-30
per cent and demand a re-evaluation of other age estimation techniques

properties of galaxies living in voids are compared with those of galaxies
living in the void shells and with a control sample, representing the general
galaxy population. Void galaxies appear to form stars more efficiently than
shell galaxies and the control sample. This result can not be interpreted as a
consequence of the bias towards low masses in underdense regions, as void
galaxy subsamples with the same mass distribution as the control sample also
show statistically different specific star formation rates. This highlights the
fact that galaxy evolution in voids is slower with respect to the evolution of
the general population. Nevertheless, when only the star forming galaxies are
considered, we find that the star formation rate is insensitive to the
environment, as the main sequence is remarkably constant in the three samples
under consideration. This fact implies that environmental effects manifest
themselves as fast quenching mechanisms, while leaving the non-quenched
galaxies almost unaffected, as their star formation activity is largely
regulated by the mass of their halo. We also analyse galaxy properties as a
function of void-centric distance and find that the enhancement in the star
formation activity with respect to the control sample is observable up to a
radial distance 1.5 Rvoid. This result can be used as a suitable definition of
void shells. Finally, we find that larger voids show an enhanced star formation
activity in the shells with respect to their smaller counterparts, that could

from the active galactic nuclei (AGN) in brightest cluster galaxies. We report
on a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)
clusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the
South Pole Telescope data. Based on Chandra X-ray images, we find a total of 6
clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistent
with the picture of radio jets inflating X-ray cavities in the intracluster
medium. The majority of these detections are of relatively low significance and
require deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. Further, due to the
limitations of Chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (<10 kpc),
unresolved X-ray cavities at high (z>0.5) redshift. Despite these limitations,
our results suggest that the power generated by AGN feedback in brightest
cluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of the
Universe (>7 Gyrs at z=0.8). On average, the detected X-ray cavities have
powers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.
Integrating over 7 Gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in the
brightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9M_sun of
material to power these outflows. This level of accretion indicates that
significant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,
in the quasar era, but at late times as well. We also find that X-ray cavities
at high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 keV per particle into the
hot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.
This value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, break
self-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

  much delayed first paper in the two-part series",,,,"gr-qc hep-lat hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lattice regularization is a standard technique for the nonperturbative
definition of a quantum theory of fields. Several approaches to the
construction of a quantum theory of gravity adopt this technique either
explicitly or implicitly. A crucial complement to lattice regularization is the
process of renormalization through which a continuous description of the
quantum theory arises. I provide a comprehensive conceptual discussion of the
renormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. I begin with a
presentation of the renormalization group from the Wilsonian perspective. I
then consider the application of the renormalization group in four contexts:
quantum field theory on a continuous nondynamical spacetime, quantum field
theory on a lattice-regularized nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory of
continuous dynamical spacetime, and quantum field theory of lattice-regularized
dynamical spacetime. The first three contexts serve to identify successively
the particular issues that arise in the fourth context. These issues originate
in the inescability of establishing all scales solely on the basis of the
dynamics. While most of this discussion rehearses established knowledge, the
attention that I pay to these issues, especially the previously
underappreciated role of standard units of measure, is largely novel. I
conclude by briefly reviewing past studies of renormalization of
lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. In the second paper of this
two-part series, I illustrate the ideas presented here by proposing a
renormalization group scheme for causal dynamical triangulations.

These relations depend on the applied cellular technology (3G or 4G impacting

therefore exhibiting different evolutionary properties due to the effects of
rotationally-induced mixing and mass-loss. Proper identification of such events
requires rigorous radiation hydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations

evolution of these events. We present radiation hydrodynamics and radiation
transport calculations for 90-300 Msun rotating pair-instability supernovae
covering both the shock break-out and late light curve phases. We also
investigate cases of different initial metallicity and rotation rate to

non-rotating pair instability supernovae, we find that for a range of
progenitor masses and rotation rates these events have intrinsically red colors

spectroscopic properties of rotating pair instability supernovae are similar to
those of non-rotating events with stripped hydrogen and helium envelopes. We
find that the progenitor metallicity and rotation rate properties are erased

canonical DG algebra map \Phi_g(a) : DRep_g(a)^G -> DRep_h(a)^W, which is a
homological extension of the classical restriction homomorphism. We call
\Phi_g(a) a derived Harish-Chandra homomorphism. We conjecture that, for a
two-dimensional abelian Lie algebra a, the derived Harish-Chandra homomorphism
is a quasi-isomorphism, and provide some evidence for this conjecture. For any
complex Lie algebra g, we compute the Euler characteristic of DRep_g(a)^G in
terms of matrix integrals over G and compare it to the Euler characteristic of
DRep_h(a)^W.This yields an interesting combinatorial identity, which we prove
for gl_n and sl_n (for all n). Our identity is analogous to the classical
Macdonald identity, and our quasi-isomorphism conjecture is analogous to the
strong Macdonald conjecture proved by S.Fishel, I.Grojnowski and C.Teleman. We
explain this analogy by giving a new homological interpretation of Macdonald's

The dual immaculate function corresponding to a composition is a weighted

similarly to a semistandard Young tableau, but the shape is a composition

systems with temporal logic constraints in partially observable and dynamic
environments. With incomplete information on the dynamic environment, reactive
controller synthesis amounts to solving a two-player game with partial
observations, which has impractically computational complexity. To alleviate
the high computational burden, online replanning via sensing actions avoids
solving the strategy in the reactive system under partial observations.
Instead, we only solve for a strategy that ensures a given temporal logic
specification can be satisfied had the system have complete observations of its
environment. Such a strategy is then transformed into one which makes control
decisions based on the observed sequence of states (of the interacting system
and its environment). When the system encounters a belief---a set including all
possible hypotheses the system has for the current state---for which the
observation-based strategy is undefined, a sequence of sensing actions are
triggered, chosen by an active sensing strategy, to reduce the uncertainty in
the system's belief. We show that by alternating between the observation-based
strategy and the active sensing strategy, under a mild technical assumption of
the set of sensors in the system, the given temporal logic specification can be
satisfied with probability 1.

the Toeplitz algebras of finite higher-rank graphs. For graphs of rank one
(that is, for ordinary directed graphs), there is a natural dynamics obtained
by lifting the gauge action of the circle to an action of the real line. The
algebras of higher-rank graphs carry a gauge action of a higher-dimensional
torus, and there are many potential dynamics arising from different embeddings
of the real line in the torus. Previous results show that there is nonetheless
a ""preferred dynamics"" for which the system exhibits a particularly
satisfactory phase transition, and that the unique KMS state at the critical
inverse temperature can then be implemented by intregrating vector states
against a measure on the infinite path space of the graph. Here we obtain a
similar description of the KMS state at the critical inverse temperature for
other dynamics. Our spatial implementation is given by integrating against a
measure on a space of paths which are infinite in some directions but finite in
others. Our results are sharpest for the algebras of rank-two graphs.

been demonstrated experimentally so far using various types of entangled photon
sources both in near-infrared and telecom wavelength regions, the rate of
swapping operation has been too low to be applied to practical quantum
protocols, due to limited efficiency of entangled photon sources and photon
detectors. Here we demonstrate drastic improvement of the efficiency at telecom
wavelength by using two ultra-bright entangled photon sources and four highly
efficient superconducting nanowire single photon detectors.We have attained a
four-fold coincidence count rate of 108 counts per second, which is three
orders higher than the previous experiments at telecom wavelengths. A raw (net)
visibility in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between the two independent
entangled sources was 73.3 $\pm$ 1.0% (85.1 $\pm$ 0.8%). We performed the
teleportation and entanglement swapping, and obtained a fidelity of 76.3% in
the swapping test.Our results on the coincidence count rates are comparable
with the ones ever recorded in teleportation/swaping and multi-photon
entanglement generation experiments at around 800\,nm wavelengths. Our setup
opens the way to practical implementation of device-independent quantum key
distribution and its distance extension by the entanglement swapping as well as
multi-photon entangled state generation in telecom band infrastructures with
both space and fiber links.

large ensembles of cold, trapped alkali atoms with hyperfine spin f interacting
with optical fields. Restricting the state of each atom to a qutrit embedded in
the 2f+1 dimensional hyperfine spin enables us to efficiently model the
coherent and dissipative dynamics of the ensemble. This formalism also allows
us to explore the effects of local control on the internal hyperfine spins of
the atoms. State preparation using such control increases the entangling power
of the atom-light interface for f>1/2. Subsequent control of the internal spins
converts entanglement into metrologically relevant spin squeezing. In the case
of squeezing by quantum nondemolition measurement, we employ a numerical search
to find state preparations that maximize spin squeezing in the presence of
decoherence. Dissipative dynamics on our system include optical pumping due to
spontaneous emission. While most works ignore optical pumping or treat it
phenomenologically, we employ a master equation derived from first principles.
This work is extended to the case of an atomic ensemble interacting with a
non-homogeneous paraxial probe. The geometries of the ensemble and the probe
are optimized to maximize both spatial mode matching and spin squeezing.

evidence that these highest velocity SNe Ia explode in the inner regions of
their host galaxies, similar to the study of Wang et al. (2013), although the
trend is not as significant in our data. We show that these trends are
consistent with some SN Ia spectral models, if the host galaxy stellar mass is
interpreted as a proxy for host galaxy metallicity. We study the strength of
the high-velocity component of the Ca II near-IR absorption, and show that SNe
Ia with stronger high-velocity components relative to photospheric components
are hosted by galaxies with low stellar mass, blue colour, and a high sSFR.
Such SNe are therefore likely to arise from the youngest progenitor systems.
This argues against a pure orientation effect being responsible for
high-velocity features in SN Ia spectra and, when combined with other studies,
is consistent with a scenario where high-velocity features are related to an
interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar medium (CSM) local to the

identification in video sequences, dynamic texture clustering, brain fiber

proposed clustering algorithm constructs a data-affinity matrix by thoroughly
exploiting the intrinsic geometry and then applies spectral clustering. The
intrinsic local geometry is encoded by local sparse coding and more importantly
by directional information of local tangent spaces and geodesics. Theoretical
guarantees are established for a simplified variant of the algorithm even when
the clusters intersect. To avoid complication, these guarantees assume that the
underlying submanifolds are geodesic. Extensive validation on synthetic and

boundary conditions, which are organized into infinitely extended Kac tables
labeled by $r,s=1,2,3,...$. They are conjugate to Virasoro Kac representations
with conformal dimensions $\Delta_{r,s}$ given by the usual Kac formula. On a
finite strip of width $N$, built from a square lattice, the associated
integrable boundary conditions are constructed by acting on the vacuum $(1,1)$
boundary with an $s$-type seam of width $s-1$ columns and an $r$-type seam of
width $\rho-1$ columns. The $r$-type seam contains an arbitrary boundary field
$\xi$. The usual fusion construction of the $r$-type seam relies on the
existence of Wenzl-Jones projectors restricting its application to
$r\le\rho<p'$. This limitation was recently removed by Pearce, Rasmussen and
Villani who further conjectured that the conformal boundary conditions labeled
by $r$ are realized, in particular, for $\rho=\rho(r)=\lfloor
\frac{rp'}{p}\rfloor$. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture by performing
extensive numerics on the commuting double row transfer matrices and their
associated quantum Hamiltonian chains. Letting $[x]$ denote the fractional
part, we fix the boundary field to the specialized values $\xi=\frac{\pi}{2}$
if $[\frac{\rho}{p'}]=0$ and $\xi=[\frac{\rho p}{p'}]\frac{\pi}{2}$ otherwise.
For these boundary conditions, we obtain the Kac conformal weights
$\Delta_{r,s}$ by numerically extrapolating the finite-size corrections to the
lowest eigenvalue of the quantum Hamiltonians out to sizes $N\le 32-\rho-s$.
Additionally, by solving local inversion relations, we obtain general analytic
expressions for the boundary free energies allowing for more accurate estimates

play the role of physical coupling constants, to Eurozone crisis data shows
that before the Eurozone crisis the system was mostly in a ""stable"" regime, and
that during the crisis it transitioned into an ""unstable"" regime. The numerical
solutions produced by our model match closely the actual time-line of events of
the crisis. We also find that, while the largest holders are usually more

regards {\em labeled monomials} instead of {\em labeled polynomials} as basic
elements of the algorithm. Being different from the original GVW algorithm, for
each labeled monomial, the mo-GVW makes efforts to find the smallest signature

more reproducible. Provided similar advantages are applicable to detect
neutrons, MPGDs might contribute significantly to the development of neutron
scientific instrumentation. In order to evaluate the prospects of neutron
MPGDs, it is worth knowing the applications which would benefit from a gain in
performance, and if they offer a competitive alternative to conventional 3He
detectors. These questions have been at the focus of the workshop ""Neutron
Detection with Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors"" organized by RD51 in
collaboration with HEPTech, which took place at CERN on October 14-15, 2013.
The goal of this workshop was to help disseminating MPGD technologies beyond
High Energy Physics, and to give the possibility to academic institutions,
potential users and industry to meet together.
  This summary article starts with a short summary of the state of the art of
MPGD techniques for HEP; then specificities in the design of neutron detector
are described; the consequence of the 3He shortage are briefly discussed;
requirements for neutron scattering science at current facilities and at the

extracted from the surveillance sensors can be used to deduce age, ethnicity,
gender and actions, and further characterize human actions in unseen scenarios.
However, recovery of pose and shape of humans in such monocular videos is
inherently an ill-posed problem, marked by frequent depth and view based
ambiguities due to self-occlusion, foreshortening and misalignment. The
likelihood function often yields a highly multimodal posterior that is
difficult to propagate even using the most advanced particle filtering(PF)
algorithms. Motivated by the recent success of the discriminative approaches to
efficiently predict 3D poses directly from the 2D images, we present several
principled approaches to integrate predictive cues using learned regression
models to sustain multimodality of the posterior during tracking. Additionally,
these learned priors can be actively adapted to the test data using a
likelihood based feedback mechanism. Estimated 3D poses are then used to fit 3D
human shape model to each frame independently for inferring anthropometric
bio-signatures. The proposed system is fully automated, robust to noisy test
data and has ability to swiftly recover from tracking failures even after
confronting with significant errors. We evaluate the system on a large number

Cocoon nebula and its ionizing star, located at a distance of 800+-80 pc, have
a very similar chemical composition as the Orion nebula and other B-type stars

blocks of deep learning. Approximate maximum likelihood training of RBMs
typically necessitates sampling from these models. In many training scenarios,
computationally efficient Gibbs sampling procedures are crippled by poor
mixing. In this work we propose a novel method of sampling from Boltzmann
machines that demonstrates a computationally efficient way to promote mixing.
Our approach leverages an under-appreciated property of deep generative models
such as the Deep Belief Network (DBN), where Gibbs sampling from deeper levels
of the latent variable hierarchy results in dramatically increased ergodicity.
Our approach is thus to train an auxiliary latent hierarchical model, based on
the DBN. When used in conjunction with parallel-tempering, the method is
asymptotically guaranteed to simulate samples from the target RBM. Experimental
results confirm the effectiveness of this sampling strategy in the context of
RBM training.

applications for cosmological studies. In particular, they can be employed to
directly measure the expansion history of the Universe, similarly to SNe Ia.
The advantage of quasars is that they are numerous, cover a broad range of
redshifts, up to $z = 7$, and do not show significant evolution of metallicity
with redshift. The idea is based on the relation between the time delay of an
emission line and the continuum, and the absolute monochromatic luminosity of a
quasar. For intermediate redshift quasars, the suitable line is Mg II. Between
December 2012 and March 2014, we performed five spectroscopic observations of
the QSO CTS C30.10 ($z = 0.900$) using the South African Large Telesope (SALT),
supplemented with photometric monitoring, with the aim of determining the
variability of the line shape, changes in the total line intensity and in the
continuum. We show that the method is very promising.

for minimizing the energy cost of data transmission in the context of OFDMA
collaborative mobile cloud (CMC) with simultaneous wireless information and

collaborating MTs offers one potential solution for downlink content
distribution and for the energy consumption reduction at the terminal side.
Meanwhile, as RF signal can carry both information and energy simultaneously,
the induced SWIPT has gained much attention for energy efficiency design of
mobile nodes. Previous work on the design of CMC system mainly focused on the
cloud formulation or energy efficiency investigation, while how to allocate the
radio resource and schedule user transmission lacks attention. With the
objective to minimize the system energy consumption, an optimization problem
which jointly considers subchannel assignment, power allocation and user
scheduling for a group of SWIPT receivers has been presented. The formulated
problem is addressed through the convex optimization technique. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed user scheduling and resource allocation
algorithms can achieve significant energy saving performance.

trapping dust and forming planetary embryos. On the other hand, they are
massive blobs that can interact gravitationally with the planets in the disc.
Aims: We aim to study how a vortex interacts gravitationally with a planet
which migrates toward it or a planet which is created inside the vortex.
Methods: We performed hydrodynamical simulations of a viscous locally
isothermal disc using GFARGO and FARGO-ADSG. We set a stationary Gaussian
pressure bump in the disc in a way that RWI is triggered. After a large vortex
is established, we implanted a low mass planet in the outer disc or inside the
vortex and allowed it to migrate. We also examined the effect of vortex
strength on the planet migration and checked the validity of the final result
in the presence of self-gravity. Results: We noticed regardless of the planet's
initial position, the planet is finally locked to the vortex or its migration
is stopped in a farther orbital distance in case of a stronger vortex. For the
model with the weaker vortex, we studied the effect of different parameters
such as background viscosity, background surface density, mass of the planet
and different planet positions. In these models, while the trapping time and
locking angle of the planet vary for different parameters, the main result,
which is the planet-vortex locking, remains valid. We discovered that even a
planet with a mass less than 5 * 10^{-7} M_{\star} comes out from the vortex
and is locked to it at the same orbital distance. For a stronger vortex, both
in non-self-gravitated and self-gravitating models, the planet migration is
stopped far away from the radial position of the vortex. This effect can make
the vortices a suitable place for continual planet formation under the
condition that they save their shape during the planetary growth.

excellent agreement with previous structural, tensile, and ball-milling

parameters of the model, $T^*$ and $\nu$, are chosen to match its experimental
force-extension curve. The bead-spring Hamiltonian is approximated in the first
order by the Hessian that is quadratic in the bead positions. The eigenmodels
of the Hessian provide the longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending)
eigenmodes of the polymer, and the corresponding eigenvalues match well with
the established phenomenology of semiflexible polymers. Using the longitudinal
and transverse eigenmodes, we obtain analytical expressions of (i) the
autocorrelation function of the end-to-end vector, (ii) the autocorrelation
function of a bond (i.e., a spring, or a tangent) vector at the middle of the
chain, and (iii) the mean-square displacement of a tagged bead in the middle of
the chain, as sum over the contributions from the modes. We also perform
simulations with the full dynamics of the model. The simulations yield
numerical values of the correlation functions (i-iii) that agree very well with
the analytical expressions for the linearized dynamics. We also study the
mean-square displacement of the longitudinal component of the end-to-end vector
that showcases strong nonlinear effects in the polymer dynamics, and we
identify at least an effective $t^{7/8}$ power-law regime in its
time-dependence. Nevertheless, in comparison to the full mean-square
displacement of the end-to-end vector the nonlinear effects remain small at all
times --- it is in this sense we state that our results demonstrate that the
linearized dynamics suffices for dsDNA fragments that are shorter than or
comparable to the persistence length. Our results are consistent with those of

at center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair are analyzed and interpreted
in the frameworks of PYQUEN jet quenching model. A specific modification of
longitudinal and radial jet profiles in most central PbPb collisions as
compared with pp data is close to that obtained with PYQUEN simulations taking
into account wide-angle radiative and collisional partonic energy loss. The
contribution of radiative and collisional loss to the medium-modified intra-jet

lines are present in the spectra and that the emission lines arising in the

either suffered some deceleration or did not change in physical size. The

accurately at each centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$. In this paper results are
reported from the luminosity calibrations carried out at the LHC interaction
point 8 with the LHCb detector for $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV
(proton-proton collisions) and for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5 TeV (proton-lead
collisions). Both the ""van der Meer scan"" and ""beam-gas imaging"" luminosity
calibration methods were employed. It is observed that the beam density profile
cannot always be described by a function that is factorizable in the two
transverse coordinates. The introduction of a two-dimensional description of
the beams improves significantly the consistency of the results. For
proton-proton interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV a relative precision of the
luminosity calibration of 1.47% is obtained using van der Meer scans and 1.43%
using beam-gas imaging, resulting in a combined precision of 1.12%. Applying
the calibration to the full data set determines the luminosity with a precision
of 1.16%. This represents the most precise luminosity measurement achieved so
far at a bunched-beam hadron collider.

underdoped cuprates, as carried out lately by means of the Composite Operator
Method (COM) applied to the 2D Hubbard model, is reviewed and systematized. The
2D Hubbard model has been adopted as it has been considered the minimal model
capable to describe the most peculiar features of cuprates held responsible for
their anomalous behavior. COM is designed to endorse, since its foundations,
the systematic emergence in any SCS of new elementary excitations described by
composite operators obeying non-canonical algebras. In this case (underdoped
cuprates - 2D Hubbard model), the residual interactions - beyond a 2-pole
approximation - between the new elementary electronic excitations, dictated by
the strong local Coulomb repulsion and well described by the two Hubbard
composite operators, have been treated within the Non Crossing Approximation.
Given this recipe and exploiting the few unknowns to enforce the Pauli
principle content in the solution, it is possible to qualitatively describe
some of the anomalous features of high-Tc cuprate superconductors such as large
vs. small Fermi surface dichotomy, Fermi surface deconstruction (appearance of
Fermi arcs), nodal vs. anti-nodal physics, pseudogap(s), kinks in the
electronic dispersion. The resulting scenario envisages a smooth crossover
between an ordinary weakly-interacting metal sustaining weak, short-range
antiferromagnetic correlations in the overdoped regime to an unconventional
poor metal characterized by very strong, long-but-finite-range
antiferromagnetic correlations leading to momentum-selective non-Fermi liquid
features as well as to the opening of a pseudogap and to the striking
differences between the nodal and the anti-nodal dynamics in the underdoped
regime.

model to microscopically describe high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors. The
operatorial basis comprise the two Hubbard operators (complete fermionic local
basis) and the electronic operator dressed by the nearest-neighbor spin
fluctuations. The effectiveness of the approximate solution has been proved
through a positive comparison with different numerical methods for various
quantities. In this article, after recollecting the main analytical expressions
defining the solution and the behavior of basic local quantities (double
occupancy and chemical potential) and of the quasi-particle energy dispersions,
we resolve and analyze the momentum components of relevant quantities: filling
(i.e. the momentum distribution function), double occupancy and
nearest-neighbor spin correlation function. The analysis is extended to COM(2p)
solutions that will be used as primary reference. Thanks to this, the role
played by the third field, with respect to the two Hubbard ones, in determining
the behavior of many relevant quantities and in allowing the extremely good
comparison with numerical results is better understood giving a guideline to
further improve and, possibly, optimize the application of the COM to the
Hubbard model.

self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA). The scattering strength is
characterized by the effective fine structure constant $\alpha$, which depends
on the dielectric constant and the Fermi velocity of the linear band. We find
that the Boltzmann theory fails at the band touching point, where the
conductivity takes a nearly constant value almost independent of $\alpha$, even
though the density of states linearly increases with $\alpha$. There the
magnitude of the conductivity only depends on the impurity density. The
qualitative behavior is quite different from the case of the Gaussian

structures well, with [CI] also tracing material at lower column densities.
[CII] exhibits diverse morphologies in our sample, from compact to diffuse
structures probing the cloud environment. In at least two out of the four
regions, we find kinematic signatures strongly indicating that the dense gas
filaments have formed out of a dynamically active and turbulent
atomic/molecular cloud, potentially from converging gas flows. The
atomic-to-molecular carbon gas mass ratios are low between 7% and 12% with the
lowest values found toward the most quiescent region. In the three regions
where [CII] is detected, its mass is always higher by a factor of a few than
that of the atomic carbon. The ionized carbon emission depends as well on the
radiation field, however, we also find strong [CII] emission in a region
without significant external sources, indicating that other processes, e.g.,
energetic gas flows can contribute to the [CII] excitation as well.

which the magnetic moments of Cu$^{2+}$ ions are aligned parallel to the
applied field $H$ and their magnitudes change sinusoidally along the magnetic
chains. For higher fields, the $^{51}$V NMR spectral shape changes from the
double-horn pattern into a single Lorentzian line. For this Lorentzian line,
the internal field at the $^{51}$V nuclei stays constant for $\mu_0 H > 41.4$T,
indicating that the majority of magnetic moments in LiCuVO$_4$ are already
saturated in this field range. This result is inconsistent with the previously

rate of $^7$Li nuclei indicate an energy gap which grows with field twice as
fast as the Zeeman energy of a single spin, therefore, suggesting that the
two-magnon bound state is the lowest energy excitation. The energy gap tends to
close at $\mu_0H \approx 41$T. Our results suggest that the theoretically

The ad hoc use of these relations had been a known analytic difficulty in the

Explained in our previous work, geometry's self-regularisation is rendered by
Gel'fand's calculus of singular linear integral operators supported on the
diagonal.
  We now illustrate that analytic technique by inspecting the validity
mechanism [1312.4140] for the graded Jacobi identity which the variational
Schouten bracket does satisfy (whence $\Delta^2=0$, i.e., the BV-Laplacian is a
differential acting in the algebra of local functionals). By using one tuple of
three variational multi-vectors twice, we contrast the new logic of iterated
variations -- when the right-hand side of Jacobi's identity vanishes altogether
-- with the old method: interlacing its steps and stops, it could produce some
non-zero representative of the trivial class in the top-degree horizontal
cohomology. But we then show at once by an elementary counterexample why, in
the frames of the old approach that did not rely on Gel'fand's calculus, the

stationary states of a particle moving in a cavity with no sharp boundaries are
determined by means of the perturbation expansion in the framework of
one-dimensional bandlimited quantum mechanics. A realization of GUP resulting
in the existence of a finite ultraviolet (UV) wave-vector cutoff $K\sim
1/\ell_P$ (with the Planck length $\ell_P$) is considered. The cavity of the
size $\ell \gg \ell_P$ is represented by an infinitely deep trapezoid-well
potential with boundaries smeared out in a range $R$ satisfying the
inequalities $\ell\gg R\gtrsim \ell_P$. In order to determine the energy shifts
of the low-lying stationary states, the usual perturbation expansion is
reformulated in a manner that enables one to treat consistently order-by-order
the direct and indirect GUP effects, i.e., those due to the modification of the
Hamiltonian and the lack of the UV modes, respectively. It is shown that the
leading terms of the indirect and the direct GUP effects are of the first and
second order, respectively, in the small parameter $\ell_P/\ell$ in agreement
with our previous finding in a more naive approach [1].

gapless semiconducting behavior in CoFeMnSi Heusler alloy. Such a behavior is

  welcome (to RB)",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An experimental system has been found recently, a coagulated CaCO3 suspension
system, which shows very variable yield behaviour depending upon how it is
tested and, specifically, at what rate it is sheared. At P\'eclet numbers Pe >
1 it behaves as a simple Herschel Bulkley liquid, whereas at Pe < 1 highly
non-monotonic flow curves are seen. In controlled stress testing it shows
hysteresis and shear banding and in the usual type of stress scan, used to
measure flow curves in controlled stress mode routinely, it can show very
erratic and irreproducible behaviour. All of these features will be attributed
here to a dependence of the solid phase, or, yield stress, on the prevailing
rate of shear at the yield point. Stress growth curves obtained from step
strain-rate testing showed that this rate-dependence was a consequence of
P\'eclet number dependent strain softening. At very low Pe, yield was
cooperative and the yield strain was order-one, whereas as Pe approached unity,
the yield strain reduced to that needed to break interparticle bonds, causing
the yield stress to be greatly reduced. It is suspected that rate-dependent
yield could well be the rule rather than the exception for cohesive suspensions
more generally. If so, then the Herschel-Bulkley equation can usefully be
generalized to read (in simple shear). The proposition that rate-dependent
yield might be general for cohesive suspensions is amenable to critical
experimental testing by a range of means and along lines suggested.

catalogue (143 objects) of mass accretion rates (Macc) derived in a homogeneous
fashion and analysed how Macc correlates with M* and how it evolves in time. We
derived the accretion luminosity (Lacc) and Macc for Lup and Ser objects from
the Br_gamma line by using relevant empirical relationships from the literature
that connect HI line luminosity and Lacc. To minimise the biases and also for
self-consistency, we re-derived mass and age for each source using the same set
of evolutionary tracks. We observe a correlation MaccM*^2.2, similarly to what
has previously been observed in several star-forming clouds. The time variation
of Macc is roughly consistent with the expected evolution in viscous disks,
with an asymptotic decay that behaves as t^-1.6. However, Macc values are
characterised by a large scatter at similar ages and are on average higher than
the predictions of viscous models. Although part of the scattering may be
related to the employed empirical relationship and to uncertainties on the
single measurements, the general distribution and decay trend of the Macc
points are real. These findings might be indicative of a large variation in the
initial mass of the disks, of fairly different viscous laws among disks, of
varying accretion regimes, and of other mechanisms that add to the dissipation
of the disks, such as photo-evaporation.

some absorbing sublattice and with initial Bernoulli product measure with
density $\rho$ we prove that the probability $S_\rho(t)$ of no absorption event
up to microscopic time $t$ can be expressed in terms of the generating function
for the particle number of a SEP with particle injection and empty initial
lattice. Specifically, for the symmetric simple exclusion process on $\mathbb
Z$ conditioned on no jumps into the origin we obtain the explicit first and
second order expansion in $\rho$ of $S_\rho(t)$ and also to first order in
$\rho$ the optimal microscopic density profile under this conditioning. For the
disordered ASEP on the finite torus conditioned on a very large current we show
that the effective dynamics that optimally realizes this rare event does not
depend on the disorder, except for the time scale. For annihilating and
coalescing random walkers we obtain the generating function of the number of
annihilated particles up to time $t$, which turns out to exhibit some universal
features.

corresponding to the roots in an order ideal $I$ of the root poset on the

supersolvable root ideal arrangements is obtained. Namely, $A_I$ is
supersolvable if and only if $I$ is chain peelable, meaning that it is possible
to reach the empty poset from $I$ by in each step removing a maximal chain

under taking subideals. We identify the minimal ideals that correspond to
non-supersolvable arrangements. There are essentially two such ideals, one in

medium characteristics can be described as a binary feature. However, when
considering habitat modeling in ecology, a natural constraint comes from
nearest-neighbor correlations between the suitable/unsuitable states of the
spatial units forming the habitat. Such constraints are also relevant in the
physics of aggregation where underlying processes may lead to a form of
correlated percolation. However, in ecology, the processes leading to habitat
correlations are in general not known or very complex. As proposed by Hiebeler
[Ecology {\bf 81}, 1629 (2000)], these correlations can be captured in a
lattice model by an observable aggregation parameter $q$, supplementing the
density $p$ of suitable sites. We investigate this model as an instance of
correlated percolation. We analyze the phase diagram of the percolation
transition and compute the cluster size distribution, the pair-connectedness
function $C(r)$ and the correlation function $g(r)$. We find that while $g(r)$
displays a power-law decrease associated with long-range correlations in a wide
domain of parameter values, critical properties are compatible with the
universality class of uncorrelated percolation. We contrast the correlation
structures obtained respectively for the correlated percolation model and for
the Ising model, and show that the diversity of habitat configurations
generated by the Hiebeler model is richer than the archetypal Ising model. We
also find that emergent structural properties are peculiar to the implemented
algorithm, leading to questioning the notion of a well-defined model of
aggregated habitat. We conclude that the choice of model and algorithm have
strong consequences on what insights ecological studies can get using such
models of species habitat.

networks with multiple sources and multiple relays, communicating to a single

maximum degree of the relay-degree distribution. However, for conventional DLT
codes, the maximum degree is upper-bounded by the number of sources. An
additional constraint is that the sources are required to have the same
information block length. We introduce a $D$-bit buffer for each source-relay
link, which allows the relay to select multiple encoded bits from the same
source for the relay-encoding process; thus, the number of sources no longer
limits the maximum degree at the relay. Furthermore, the introduction of
buffers facilitates the use of different information block sizes across
sources. Based on density evolution we develop an asymptotic analytical
framework for optimization of the relay-degree distribution. We further
integrate techniques for unequal erasure protection into the optimization
framework. The proposed codes are considered for both lossless and lossy
source-relay links. Numerical examples show that there is no loss in erasure
performance for transmission over lossy source-relay links as compared to
lossless links. Additional delays, however, may occur. The design framework and
our contributions are demonstrated by a number of illustrative examples,

simultaneously trap microparticles at different points is proposed and
demonstrated through computational simulations. The device employs an
ultrasound beam produced by a circular focused transducer operating at 1 MHz in
water medium. The ultrasound beam exerts a radiation force that may tweeze
suspended microparticles in the medium. Simulations show that the acoustical
tweezer can simultaneously trap microparticles in the pre-focal zone along the
beam axis, i.e. between the transducer surface and its geometric focus. As
acoustical tweezers are fast becoming a key instrument in microparticle
handling, the development of acoustic multitrapping concept may turn into a
useful tool in engineering these devices.

of the crystal-melt interface of water is around one order of magnitude slower

approximate some of the stochastic drift terms that arise because of the

nonequilibrium concentration fluctuations in diffusively-mixing fluids. We
first study the development of giant fluctuations in recent experiments

often used to characterize the amplitude of the scalar bi-spectrum, can be
expressed completely in terms of the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ in the
squeezed limit, a relation that is referred to as the consistency condition.
This relation, while it is largely discussed in the context of slow roll
inflation, is actually expected to hold in any single field model of inflation,
irrespective of the dynamics of the underlying model, provided inflation occurs
on the attractor at late times. In this work, we explicitly examine the
validity of the consistency relation, analytically as well as numerically, away
from slow roll. Analytically, we first arrive at the relation in the simple
case of power law inflation. We also consider the non-trivial example of the
Starobinsky model involving a linear potential with a sudden change in its
slope (which leads to a brief period of fast roll), and establish the condition
completely analytically. We then numerically examine the validity of the
consistency relation in three inflationary models that lead to the following
features in the scalar power spectrum due to departures from slow roll: (i) a
sharp cut off at large scales, (ii) a burst of oscillations over an
intermediate range of scales, and (iii) small, but repeated, modulations
extending over a wide range of scales. It is important to note that it is
exactly such spectra that have been found to lead to an improved fit to the CMB
data, when compared to the more standard power law primordial spectra, by the
Planck team. We evaluate the scalar bi-spectrum for an arbitrary triangular
configuration of the wavenumbers in these inflationary models and explicitly
illustrate that, in the squeezed limit, the consistency condition is indeed
satisfied even in situations consisting of strong deviations from slow roll.

from an appropriate time-irreversible Langevin process is, from several points
of view, advantageous when compared to sampling from a time-reversible one.
Adding an appropriate irreversible drift to the overdamped Langevin equation
results in a larger large deviations rate function for the empirical measure of
the process, a smaller variance for the long time average of observables of the
process, as well as a larger spectral gap. In this work, we concentrate on
irreversible Langevin samplers with a drift of increasing intensity. The
asymptotic variance is monotonically decreasing with respect to the growth of
the drift and we characterize its limiting behavior. For a Gibbs measure whose
potential has one or more critical points, adding a large irreversible drift
results in a decomposition of the process in a slow and fast component with
fast motion along the level sets of the potential and slow motion in the
orthogonal direction. This result helps understanding the variance reduction,
which can be explained at the process level by the induced fast motion of the
process along the level sets of the potential. The limit of the asymptotic
variance as the magnitude of the irreversible perturbation grows is the
asymptotic variance associated to the limiting slow motion. The latter is a
diffusion process on a graph.

  Dimensions","22 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a fast algorithm for kernel summation problems in high-dimensions.
These problems appear in computational physics, numerical approximation,
non-parametric statistics, and machine learning. In our context, the sums
depend on a kernel function that is a pair potential defined on a dataset of
points in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. A direct evaluation of the sum
scales quadratically with the number of points. Fast kernel summation methods
can reduce this cost to linear complexity, but the constants involved do not
scale well with the dimensionality of the dataset.
  The main algorithmic components of fast kernel summation algorithms are the
separation of the kernel sum between near and far field (which is the basis for
pruning) and the efficient and accurate approximation of the far field.
  We introduce novel methods for pruning and approximating the far field. Our
far field approximation requires only kernel evaluations and does not use
analytic expansions. Pruning is not done using bounding boxes but rather
combinatorially using a sparsified nearest-neighbor graph of the input. The
time complexity of our algorithm depends linearly on the ambient dimension. The
error in the algorithm depends on the low-rank approximability of the far
field, which in turn depends on the kernel function and on the intrinsic
dimensionality of the distribution of the points. The error of the far field
approximation does not depend on the ambient dimension.
  We present the new algorithm along with experimental results that demonstrate
its performance. We report results for Gaussian kernel sums for 100 million
points in 64 dimensions, for one million points in 1000 dimensions, and for
problems in which the Gaussian kernel has a variable bandwidth. To the best of
our knowledge, all of these experiments are impossible or prohibitively
expensive with existing fast kernel summation methods.

In classical electrodynamics, nanostructured graphene is commonly modeled by
the computationally demanding problem of a three-dimensional conducting film of
atomic-scale thickness. Here, we propose an efficient alternative
two-dimensional electrostatic approach where all the calculation procedures are
restricted to the plane of the graphene sheet. To explore possible quantum
effects, we perform tight-binding calculations, adopting a random-phase
approximation. We investigate the multiple plasmon modes in triangles of
graphene, treating the optical response classically as well as quantum
mechanically in the case of both armchair and zigzag edge termination of the
underlying atomic lattice. Compared to the classical plasmonic spectrum which
is ""blind"" to the edge termination, we find that the quantum plasmon
frequencies exhibit blueshifts in the case of armchair edge termination, while
redshifts are found for zigzag edges. Furthermore, we find spectral features in
the zigzag case which are associated with electronic edge states not present
for armchair termination. Merging pairs of such triangles into dimers, the
plasmon hybridization leads to energy splitting in accordance with
plasmon-hybridization theory, with a lower energy for the antisymmetric modes
and a smaller splitting for modes with less confinement to the gap region. The
hybridization appears strongest in classical calculations while the splitting
is lower for armchair edges and even more reduced for zigzag edges. Our various
results illustrate a surprising phenomenon: Even 20 nm large graphene
structures clearly exhibit quantum plasmonic features due to atomic-scale
details in the edge termination.

network with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA
sequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis
revealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected
sub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of
seven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria
are facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other
sub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat
surprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are
mutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include
some opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between
Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes
who cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the
'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk

their infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be

  Reliability",,,,,"cs.DC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In classical network reliability analysis, the system under study is a
network with perfect nodes but imperfect link, that fail stochastically and
independently. There, the goal is to find the probability that the resulting
random graph is connected, called \emph{reliability}. Although the exact
reliability computation belongs to the class of $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard problems,
the literature offers three exact methods for exact reliability computation, to
know, Sum of Disjoint Products (SDPs), Inclusion-Exclusion and Factorization.
  Inspired in delay-sensitive applications in telecommunications, H\'ector
Cancela and Louis Petingi defined in 2001 the diameter-constrained reliability,
where terminals are required to be connected by $d$ hops or less, being $d$ a
positive integer, called diameter.
  Factorization theory in classical network reliability is a mature area.
However, an extension to the diameter-constrained context requires at least the
recognition of irrelevant links, and an extension of deletion-contraction
formula. In this paper, we fully characterize the determination of irrelevant
links. Diameter-constrained reliability invariants are presented, which,
together with the recognition of irrelevant links, represent the
building-blocks for a new factorization theory. The paper is closed with a
discussion of trends for future work.

method is implemented for the semilinear wave equation in 1(space) + 1(time)
and 2 + 1 dimensions to explore critical collapse and search for self-similar
solutions. Previous work studied this behavior by exploring the threshold of
singularity formation using time marching finite difference techniques while
this work introduces an adaptive time parallel numerical method to the problem.
The semilinear wave equation with a $p = 7$ term is examined in spherical
symmetry. The impact of mesh refinement and the time additive Schwarz
preconditioner in conjunction with Krylov Subspace Methods are examined.

Lett. 111, 147204 (2013)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.147204",,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the dipolar spin-ice model at fixed density of single excitations,
$\rho$, using a Monte Carlo algorithm where processes of creation and
annihilation of such excitations are banned. In the limit of $\rho$ going to
zero, this model coincides with the usual dipolar spin-ice model at low
temperatures, with the additional advantage that a negligible number of
monopoles allows for equilibration even at the lowest temperatures. Thus, the
transition to the ordered fundamental state found by Melko et al. in 2001 is
reached using simple local spin flip dynamics. As the density is increased, the
monopolar nature of the excitations becomes apparent: the system shows a rich
$\rho$ vs. $T$ phase diagram with ""charge"" ordering transitions analogous to
that observed for Coulomb charges in lattices. A further layer of complexity is
revealed by the existence of order both within the charges and their associated
vacuum, which can only be described in terms of spins --the true microscopic
degrees of freedom of the system.
