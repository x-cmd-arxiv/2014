those requiring smoothness with respect to similarity across areas, such as
geographic proximity or clustering by covariates; and benchmarking constraints,
requiring (weighted) means of estimates to agree across levels of aggregation.
We develop methods for constrained estimation decision-theoretically and
discuss their geometric interpretation. Our constrained estimators are the
solutions to tractable optimization problems and have closed-form solutions.
Mean squared errors of the constrained estimators are calculated via
bootstrapping. Our techniques are free of distributional assumptions and apply
whether the estimator is linear or non-linear, univariate or multivariate. We
illustrate our methods using data from the U.S. Census's Small Area Income and

very small in comparison to the number of blazars detected in other
frequencies. This situation is a handicap for population studies of blazars,
which emit about half of their luminosity in the $\gamma$-ray domain. Moreover,
VHE blazars, if distant, allow for the study of the environment that the
high-energy $\gamma$-rays traverse in their path towards the Earth, like the
extragalactic background light (EBL) and the intergalactic magnetic field
(IGMF), and hence they have a special interest for the astrophysics community.
We present the first VHE detection of 1ES\,0033+595 with a statistical
significance of 5.5\,$\sigma$. The VHE emission of this object is constant
throughout the MAGIC observations (2009 August and October), and can be
parameterized with a power law with an integral flux above 150 GeV of
$(7.1\pm1.3)\times 10^{-12} {\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}}$ and a photon index
of ($3.8\pm0.7$). We model its spectral energy distribution (SED) as the result
of inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron photons. For the study of the SED
we used simultaneous optical R-band data from the KVA telescope, archival X-ray
data by \textit{Swift} as well as \textit{INTEGRAL}, and simultaneous high
energy (HE, $300$\,MeV~--~$10$\,GeV) $\gamma$-ray data from the \textit{Fermi}
LAT observatory. Using the empirical approach of Prandini et al. (2010) and the
\textit{Fermi}-LAT and MAGIC spectra for this object, we estimate the redshift
of this source to be $0.34\pm0.08\pm0.05$. This is a relevant result because
this source is possibly one of the ten most distant VHE blazars known to date,
and with further (simultaneous) observations could play an important role in
blazar population studies, as well as future constraints on the EBL and IGMF.

diffuse blobs, one of them located at 55 arcsec from the central star along the
NE direction (PA= +71) and the other at 78 arcsec in the SW direction (PA=
-151). Therefore, these structures do not share the symmetry axes of the inner
bipolar outflows. Their radial velocities relative to the system are quite low:
+3 and -4 km/s, respectively. Spectroscopic data confirm a high [O III] to Ha
ratio, indicating that the blobs are being excited by the UV flux from the
central star. Our images convincingly show a spherical halo 60 arcsec in
diameter encircling the quadrupolar nebula. The expansion velocity of this
shell is low, 66 km/s. The software SHAPE has been used to construct a
morpho-kinematic model for the ring and the bipolar flows that implies an age
of 4,000 yrs, the expansion of the halo sets a lower limit for its age 46,000
yrs, and the very low expansion of the blobs suggests they are part of a large
structure corresponding to a mass ejection that took place 150,000 yrs ago. In
NGC 6309 we have direct evidence of a change in the geometry of mass-loss, from
spherical in the halo to axially-symmetric in the two pairs of bipolar lobes.

subject has garnered a lot of interest among philosophers and researchers in
artificial intelligence alike. One of the most debated topics in this context
regards the notion of actual causation, which concerns itself with specific -
as opposed to general - causal claims. The search for a proper formal
definition of actual causation has evolved into a controversial debate, that is
pervaded with ambiguities and confusion. The goal of our research is twofold.
First, we wish to provide a clear way to compare competing definitions. Second,
we also want to improve upon these definitions so they can be applied to a more
diverse range of instances, including non-deterministic ones. To achieve these
goals we will provide a general, abstract definition of actual causation,
formulated in the context of the expressive language of CP-logic (Causal
Probabilistic logic). We will then show that three recent definitions by Ned
Hall (originally formulated for structural models) and a definition of our own
(formulated for CP-logic directly) can be viewed and directly compared as
instantiations of this abstract definition, which allows them to deal with a
broader range of examples.

Ensemble (GUE) can instead be phrased in terms of singular values. By
discarding the signs of the eigenvalues, we gain access to a surprising
decomposition: the singular values of the GUE are distributed as the union of
the singular values of two independent ensembles of Laguerre type. This
independence is remarkable given the well known phenomenon of eigenvalue
repulsion.
  The structure of this decomposition reveals that several existing
observations about large $n$ limits of the GUE are in fact manifestations of
phenomena that are already present for finite random matrices. We relate the
semicircle law to the quarter-circle law by connecting Hermite polynomials to
generalized Laguerre polynomials with parameter $\pm$1/2. Similarly, we write
the absolute value of the determinant of the $n\times{}n$ GUE as a product n
independent random variables to gain new insight into its asymptotic
log-normality. The decomposition also provides a description of the
distribution of the smallest singular value of the GUE, which in turn permits
the study of the leading order behavior of the condition number of GUE
matrices.
  The study is motivated by questions involving the enumeration of orientable
maps, and is related to questions involving powers of complex Ginibre matrices.
The inescapable conclusion of this work is that the singular values of the GUE
play an unpredictably important role that had gone unnoticed for decades even

nature arising as an act of measurement. For a composite classical system we
have the joint entropy to quantify the randomness present in the total system

conditional entropy of the other subsystem given we know the first system. The
same analogy caries over to the quantum setting by replacing the Shannon
entropy by the Von Neumann entropy. However, if we replace the conditional von
Neumann entropy by the average conditional entropy due to measurement, we find
that it is different from the joint entropy of the system. We call this
difference Measurement Induced Randomness (MIR) and argue that this is unique
of quantum mechanical systems and there is no classical counterpart to this. In
other words the joint Von Neumann entropy gives only the total randomness that
arises because of the heterogeneity of the mixture and we show that it is not
the total randomness that can be generated in the composite system. We
generalize this quantity for N-qubit systems and show that it reduces to
quantum discord for two qubit systems. Further, we show that it is exactly
equal to the change in the cost of quantum state merging that arises because of
the measurement. We argue that for a quantum information processing tasks like
state merging the change in the cost as a result of discarding prior

This conjecture follows from the generalised Riemann hypothesis, and is known
to hold for almost all primes $p$ but remains open in general. In this paper we
show that Vinogradov's conjecture also follows from the Elliott-Halberstam
conjecture on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, thus
providing a potential ""non-multiplicative"" route to the Vinogradov conjecture.
We also give a variant of this argument that obtains bounds on short centred
character sums from ""Type II"" estimates of the type introduced recently by
Zhang and improved upon by the Polymath project, or from bounds on the level of
distribution on variants of the higher order divisor function. In particular,
we can obtain an improvement over the Burgess bound would be obtained if one
had Type II estimates with level of distribution above $2/3$ (when the
conductor is not cube-free) or $3/4$ (if the conductor is cube-free); morally,
one would also obtain such a gain if one had distributional estimates on the
third or fourth divisor functions $\tau_3, \tau_4$ at level above $2/3$ or
$3/4$ respectively. Some applications to the least primitive root are also

squeezing. We generate a polarization-squeezed beam, extract photon pairs at

present experimental evidence showing that all photons arriving within the
squeezing coherence time are entangled, that entanglement monogamy dilutes
entanglement with increasing photon density and that, counterintuitively,
increased squeezing can reduce bipartite entanglement. The results provide
direct evidence for entanglement of macroscopic numbers of particles and
introduce micro-analysis to the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena.

As a generalization of material in [2,5] a general version of the
Schwartz-Zippel was presented in [8] which from the leading monomial -- with
respect to a lexicographic ordering -- estimates the sum of zeros when counted
with multiplicity. The corresponding corollary on the number of zeros of
multiplicity at least $r$ is in general not sharp and therefore in [8] a
recursively defined function $D$ was introduced using which one can derive
improved information. The recursive function being rather complicated, the only
known closed formula consequences of it are for the case of two variables [8].
In the present paper we derive closed formula consequences for arbitrary many
variables, but for the powers in the leading monomial being not too large. Our
bound can be viewed as a generalization of the footprint bound [10,6] -- the
classical footprint bound taking not multiplicity into account.

performance metrics depending on the gap structure of a schedule. One of our
objectives is to initiate the study of such scheduling problems with gaps. We
show that such problems often lead to interesting algorithmic problems, with
connections to other areas of algorithmics. We focus on the model with unit
jobs. First we examine scheduling problems with deadlines, where we consider
variants of minimum-gap scheduling, including maximizing throughput with a
budget for gaps or minimizing the number of gaps with a throughput requirement.
We then turn to other objective functions. For example, in some scenarios, gaps
in a schedule may be actually desirable, leading to the problem of maximizing
the number of gaps. Other versions we study include minimizing maximum gap or
maximizing minimum gap. The second part of the paper examines the model without
deadlines, where we focus on the tradeoff between the number of gaps and the
total or maximum flow time. For all these problems we provide polynomial time
algorithms, with running times ranging from $O(n \log n)$ for some problems, to
$O(n^7)$ for other. The solutions involve a spectrum of algorithmic techniques,

the processes that can maintain a near surface shear layer (NSSL) as inferred
from helioseismology. Using the reduced speed of sound technique we can extend
our global convection simulation to $0.99\,R_{\odot}$ and include near the top
of our domain small-scale convection with short time scales that is only weakly
influenced by rotation. We find the formation of a NSSL preferentially in high
latitudes in the depth range $r=0.95-0.975R_\odot$. The maintenance mechanisms
are summarized as follows. Convection under weak influence of rotation leads to
Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum radially inward in all
latitudes. This leads to the formation of a strong poleward directed meridional
flow and a NSSL, which is balanced in the meridional plane by forces resulting
from the $\langle v'_r v'_\theta\rangle$ correlation of turbulent velocities.
The origin of the required correlations depends to some degree on latitude. In
high latitudes a positive correlation $\langle v'_rv'_\theta\rangle$ is induced
in the NSSL by the poleward meridional flow whose amplitude increases with the
radius, while a negative correlation is generated by the Coriolis force in bulk
of the convection zone. In low latitudes a positive correlation $\langle
v'_rv'_\theta\rangle$ results from rotationally aligned convection cells
(""banana cells""). The force caused by these Reynolds stresses is in balance
with the Coriolis force in the NSSL.

of states and whose value determines whether a state can be converted into
another. We construct a conversion witness that can be efficiently computed for
arbitrary states in systems of any size. This conversion witness is always
better than the negativity at detecting when two entangled states are not
interconvertible. Furthermore, when considering states of two-qubit systems,
this new conversion witness is sometimes better than the entanglement of
formation. This shows that the study of conversion witness is in fact useful,
and may have applications in resource theories beyond that of entanglement.

the Pseudo - Goldstone boson. We discuss examples both in condensed matter and
in relativistic field theory. In $^3$He-B the symmetry breaking gives rise to 4
Nambu-Goldstone modes and 14 Higgs modes. At lower energy one of the four NG
modes becomes the Higgs boson with small mass. This is the mode measured in
experiments with the longitudinal NMR, and the Higgs mass corresponds to the
Leggett frequency $M_{\rm H}=\hbar \Omega_L$. The formation of the Higgs mass
is the result of the violation of the hidden spin-orbit symmetry at low energy.
In this scenario the symmetry breaking energy scale $\Delta$ (the gap in the
fermionic spectrum) and the Higgs mass scale $M_{\rm H}$ are highly separated:
$M_{\rm H}\ll \Delta$. On the particle physics side we consider the model
inspired by the models of \cite{dobrescu,Yamawaki}. At high energies the
$SU(3)$ symmetry is assumed that relates the left - handed top and bottom
quarks to the additional fermion $\chi_L$. This symmetry is softly broken at
low energies. As a result the only CP - even Goldstone boson acquires a mass
and may be considered as the candidate for the role of the $125$ GeV scalar
boson. We consider the condensation pattern different from the one typical for
the top - seesaw models, where the condensate $< \bar{t}_L\chi_R >$ is off -
diagonal. In our case the condensates are mostly diagonal. Unlike
\cite{dobrescu,Yamawaki} the explicit mass terms are absent and the soft
breaking of $SU(3)$ symmetry is given solely by the four - fermion terms. This
reveals the complete analogy with $^3$He, where there is no explicit mass term
and the spin - orbit interaction has the form of the four - fermion
interaction.

important aspect of the functional properties of human brain, specifically the

Using fMRI as the main modality, the human brain activity is investigated
through a purely data-driven signal processing and dimensionality analysis
approach. Specifically, the fMRI signal is treated as a multi-dimensional data
space and its intrinsic `complexity' is studied via dataset fractal analysis
and blind-source separation (BSS) methods. One simulated and two real fMRI
datasets are used in combination with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and
fractal analysis for estimating the intrinsic (true) dimensionality, in order
to provide data-driven experimental evidence on the number of independent brain
processes that run in parallel when visual or visuo-motor tasks are performed.
Although this number is can not be defined as a strict threshold but rather as
a continuous range, when a specific activation level is defined, a
corresponding number of parallel processes or the casual equivalent of `cpu
cores' can be detected in normal human brain activity.

recently proposed general Born-Infeld type theory of gravity is studied. Four
dimensional cosmological solutions are obtained assuming the equation of state
$p=\omega \rho$. For a positive value of $\lambda $ (a parameter in the theory)
the solution is singular (of big-bang type) but may have accelerated expansion
at an early stage. For $\lambda<0$ there exists a non-zero minimum scale factor
and a finite maximum value of the energy density, but the curvature scalar
diverges. Interestingly, for $\lambda <0$, the universe may undergo an eternal
accelerated expansion with a de Sitter expansion phase at late times. We find
these features without considering any extra matter field or even negative
pressure. Fitting our model with Supernova data we find that the simplest dust
model ($p=0$), with $\lambda >0$, is able to generate acceleration and fits
well, although the resulting properties of the universe differ much from the
known, present day, accepted values. The best fit model requires (with $\lambda
> 0$) an additional component of the physical matter density, with a negative
value of the equation of state parameter, along with dust. The $\lambda < 0$
solutions do not fit well with observations. Though these models do not explain
the dark energy problem with consistency, their analysis does shed light on the
plausibility of an alternative geometrical explanation.

followed by another orthorhombic Immm phase, which is stabilized at wide

velocity dependent term of the test particle that renders an approximate
relativistic modification of Newtonian like potential. The complete orbital

background field and time dependence effects in strongly coupled field
theories.
  The first chapters (2-5) aim to provide a self-contained review of the
Sakai-Sugimoto model (SSM) as a top-down approach to holographic QCD,
introducing first the necessary background on QCD, string theory and AdS/CFT.
Chapter 7 reviews finite temperature holography, to be used in the subsequent
chapters.
  We use the non-Abelian ($N_f = 2$) SSM to study a possible magnetically
induced instability of the QCD vacuum towards a superconducting phase, as
previously discussed in phenomenological QCD models and there referred to as
""rho meson condensation"". We find that this instability can indeed be
holographically described by the SSM, and obtain increasingly higher
predictions for the necessary critical magnetic field in increasingly
complicated (i.e. less simplified) set-ups. The obtained results are presented
in chapter 6 and are based on arXiv:1105.2217 and arXiv:1309.5042. In chapter 8
we discuss the splitting of chiral transition temperatures per flavour in the
finite temperature regime of the $N_f = 2$ SSM, indicating an intermediate
phase where chiral symmetry is only partially restored. This was previously
presented in arXiv:1303.5674.
  In chapter 9, instead of a top-down approach, bottom-up models known as
""AdS-Vaidya"" models are used in the context of condensed matter applications to
study far-from-equilibrium behaviour of strongly coupled electron systems. A
notion of a time-dependent spectral function is defined and calculated in
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-AdS$_4$-Vaidya as a very first step towards extracting in
principle measurable quantities in time-resolved ARPES experiments
[arXiv:1407.5975]. Focus is put on explaining the used numerical method

Introducing a baseline of 543$\pm$7 m between radio transmitter and receiver

non-trivial Berry phase of $ \left(2n+1\right)\pi $ attributed to the topology
of the band structure. The Berry phase shows non-topological deviations from $
\left(2n+1\right)\pi $ in presence of a perturbation that destroys time
reversal symmetry and gives rise to a quantum system with massive Dirac
fermions and finite band gap. Such a band gap opening is achieved on account of
the exchange field of a ferromagnet or the intrinsic energy gap of a
superconductor that influences the topological insulator surface states by
virtue of the proximity effect. In this work Berry phase of such gapped systems
with massive Dirac fermions is considered. Additionally, it is shown that the
Berry phase for such a system also depends on the \textit{Fermi}-velocity of
the surface states which can be tuned as a function of the TI film thickness.

For this purpose a realistic low-energy model with the parameters derived from

calculated using both the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations near the
mean-field ground state and the superexchange model, which provide a consistent
description. The obtained behaviour of exchange interactions substantially
differs from the previously proposed phenomenological picture based on the
magnetic measurements and structural considerations, namely: (i) Despite
quasi-one-dimensional character of the crystal structure, consisting of the
zigzag chains of edge-sharing VO6 octahedra, the electronic structure is
essentially three-dimensional, that leads to finite interactions between the
chains; (ii) The exchange interactions along the legs of the chains appear to
dominate; and (iii) There is a substantial difference of exchange interactions
in two crystallographically inequivalent chains. The combination of these three
factors successfully reproduces the behaviour of experimental magnetic
susceptibility.

Western medicine (WM) diseases relies heavily on the proper classification of
patients into TCM syndrome types. We develop a data-driven method for solving
the classification problem, where syndrome types are identified and quantified
based on patterns detected in unlabeled symptom survey data.
  Method: Latent class analysis (LCA) has been applied in WM research to solve
a similar problem, i.e., to identify subtypes of a patient population in the
absence of a gold standard. A widely known weakness of LCA is that it makes an
unrealistically strong independence assumption. We relax the assumption by
first detecting symptom co-occurrence patterns from survey data and use those
patterns instead of the symptoms as features for LCA. Results: The result of
the investigation is a six-step method: Data collection, symptom co-occurrence
pattern discovery, pattern interpretation, syndrome identification, syndrome
type identification, and syndrome type classification. A software package
called Lantern is developed to support the application of the method. The
method is illustrated using a data set on Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment
(VMCI).
  Conclusions: A data-driven method for TCM syndrome identification and
classification is presented. The method can be used to answer the following
questions about a Western medicine disease: What TCM syndrome types are there
among the patients with the disease? What is the prevalence of each syndrome
type? What are the statistical characteristics of each syndrome type in terms
of occurrence of symptoms? How can we determine the syndrome type(s) of a
patient?

surface charges serves to attract and orient nearby water molecules, while it
tends to a constant determined by the mean surface charge density away from the
walls. We find Stern boundary layers with thickness about $5$ $\rm \AA$ and a
homogeneously polarized bulk region. The molecules in the layers more
sensitively respond to the applied field than in the bulk. As a result, the
potential drop in the layers is larger than that in the bulk unless the cell

small angles with respect to the walls in the layers even without applied

field and the local field fluctuations are very large in the bulk. If we
suppose a nanometer-size sphere around each molecule, the local field
contribution from its exterior is nearly equal to that from the continuum

sets are frequently violated. Benchmarking is the procedure used by economic
agencies to make such data sets consistent. It typically involves adjusting a
high frequency time series (e.g. quarterly data) so it becomes consistent with
a lower frequency version (e.g. annual data). Various methods have been
developed to approach this problem of inconsistency between data sets. This
paper introduces a new statistical procedure; namely wavelet benchmarking.
Wavelet properties allow high and low frequency processes to be jointly
analysed and we show that benchmarking can be formulated and approached
succinctly in the wavelet domain. Furthermore the time and frequency
localisation properties of wavelets are ideal for handling more complicated
benchmarking problems. The versatility of the procedure is demonstrated using
simulation studies where we provide evidence showing it substantially
outperforms currently used methods. Finally, we apply this novel method of
wavelet benchmarking to official Office of National Statistics (ONS) data.

tensor-scalar ratio $r$, but not $n_t$ nor $\alpha_t$. Complementary to this,
the ground-based interferometric detectors working at $\sim 10^2$Hz are able to
constrain the spectral indices that influence the spectrum sensitively at high
frequencies. In this work we give a proper normalization of the analytical
spectrum at the low frequency end, yielding a modification by a factor of $\sim
1/50$ to the previous treatment. We calculate the signal-noise ratios (SNR) for
various ($n_t,\alpha_t$) at fixed $r=0.2$ by S6 of LIGO H-L, and obtain the
observational upper limit on the running index $\alpha_t<0.02093$ (i.e, at a
detection rate $95\%$ and a false alarm rate $5\%$) at the default
$(n_t=0,r=0.2)$. This is consistent with the constraint on the energy density
obtained by LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. Extending to the four correlated
detectors currently running, the calculated SNR improves slightly. When
extending to the six correlated detectors of the second-generation in design,
the calculated SNR is $\sim 10^3$ times over the previous two cases, due to the
high sensitivities. RGW can be directly detected by the six 2nd-generation
detectors for models with $\alpha_t>0.01364$.

condensate induce eddy currents in the superconductor. The magnetic field
generated by eddy currents modifies the trapping potential such that the
center-of-mass oscillation frequency is shifted. We numerically solve the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation for this system and compare the results with
analytical approximations. We present an approximation that gives excellent
agreement with the numerical results. The eddy currents give rise to anharmonic
terms, which leads to the excitation of shape fluctuations of the condensate.
We discuss how the strength of the excitation of such modes can be increased by
exploiting resonances, and we examine the strength of the resonances as a

relationship between the in-medium reaction matrices for baryon-baryon
scattering and the baryon self-energies. We solve the coupled, Bethe-Salpeter
equations in the nuclear-matter rest frame by using the Bonn potentials. We
assume that eight kinds of nonstrange and strange mesons
($\sigma,\,\delta,\,\omega,\,\rho,\,\eta,\,\pi,\,K,\,K^{\ast}$) take part in
the interactions between two baryons. Then, we calculate the baryon
self-energies, the energy density and pressure of matter. The present

densities, which is generated by the effect of Pauli exclusion, the short-range
correlations between two baryons, etc. We finally predict the maximum

constant gap uniformly over all channel gains) exists with at most $N+1$ active

shows convincing observational evidence of age matching: red galaxies have more
concentrated dark matter (DM) halos than blue galaxies of the same stellar or
halo mass. Then, applying the MAMPOSSt technique to M87 (traced by its red and
blue globular clusters) we find that very cuspy DM is favored, unless we
release priors on DM concentration or stellar mass (leading to unconstrained
slope). For the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (traced by its metal-rich and
metal-poor stars), the inner DM slope is unconstrained, with weak evidence for
a core if the stellar mass is fixed. This highlights how priors are crucial for
DM modeling. Finally, we find that blue GCs around M87 and metal-rich stars in

horocycle flow on foliated manifolds by hyperbolic surfaces. This is motivated
by a question formulated by M. Martinez and A. Verjovsky on the minimality of
this flow assuming that the natural affine foliation is minimal too. We have
tried to offer a simple presentation, which allows us to update and shed light
on the classical theorem proved by G. A. Hedlund in 1936 on the minimality of
the horocycle flow on compact hyperbolic surfaces. Firstly, we extend this
result to the product of PSL(2,R) and a Lie group G, which places us within the
homogeneous framework investigated by M. Ratner. Since our purpose is to deal
with non-homogeneous situations, we do not use Ratner's famous Orbit-Closure
Theorem, but we give an elementary proof. We show that this special situation
arises for homogeneous Riemannian and Lie foliations, reintroducing the
foliation point of view. Examples and counter-examples take an important place
in our work, in particular, the very instructive case of the hyperbolic torus
bundles over the circle. Our aim in writing this text is to offer to the reader
an accessible introduction to a subject that was intensively studied in the
algebraic setting, although there still are unsolved geometric problems.

vertical displacement of water parcels, and therefore, phytoplankton particles

spring primary production. The underlying mechanism describes how convection
cells capture living phytoplankton cells and recurrently expose them to
sunlight. This study presents a parameterisation called `phytoconvection' which
focuses on the influence of convection on primary production. This
parameterisation was implemented into a three-dimensional
physical-biogeochemical model and applied to the Northwestern European
Continental Shelf and areas of the adjacent Northeast Atlantic. The simulation
was compared to a `conventional' parameterisation with respect to its influence
on phytoplankton concentrations during the annual cycle and its effect on the
carbon cycle. The simulation using the new parameterisation showed good
agreement with observation data recorded during winter, whereas the reference
simulation did not capture the observed phytoplankton concentrations. The new
parameterisation had a strong influence on the carbon export through the
sinking of particulate organic carbon. The carbon export during late
winter/early spring significantly exceeded the export of the reference run.
Furthermore, a non-hydrostatic convection model was used to evaluate the major
assumption of the presented parameterisation which implies the matching of the
mixed layer depth with the convective mixing depth. The applied mixed layer
depth criterion principally overestimates the actual convective mixing depth.
However, the results showed that this assumption is reasonable during late
winter, while indicating a mismatch during spring.

knowing the complete spectrum of relaxation times of stochastic processes
described by them, so our results should have many interesting applications for
the description of relaxation in complex systems. Our approach allows to
disentangle contributions to the spectral density related to extended and

under the peak and average power constraints is investigated. For the identity
channel matrix, the approach of Shamai et al. is generalized to the higher
dimension settings to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
optimal input probability density function. This approach prevents the usage of
the identity theorem of the holomorphic functions of several complex variables
which seems to fail in the multi-dimensional scenarios. It is proved that the
support of the capacity-achieving distribution is a finite set of hyper-spheres
with mutual independent phases and amplitude in the spherical domain.
Subsequently, it is shown that when the average power constraint is relaxed, if
the number of antennas is large enough, the capacity has a closed form solution
and constant amplitude signaling at the peak power achieves it. Moreover, it
will be observed that in a discrete-time memoryless Gaussian channel, the
average power constrained capacity, which results from a Gaussian input
distribution, can be closely obtained by an input where the support of its
magnitude is a discrete finite set. Finally, we investigate some upper and
lower bounds for the capacity of the non-identity channel matrix and evaluate
their performance as a function of the condition number of the channel.

repair and describes the security between different shares. Under this
optimality of the repair, we further discuss traditional information rate and
also indicate its optimality, that can describe the efficiency of secret

fallbacks far from the eruption site, observed with the Solar Dynamics
Observatory. These impacts can be taken as a template for the impact of stellar
accretion flows. Broad red-shifted UV lines have been commonly observed in
young accreting stars. Here we study the emission from the impacts in the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly's UV channels and compare the inferred velocity
distribution to stellar observations. We model the impacts with 2D hydrodynamic
simulations. We find that the localised UV 1600A emission and its timing with
respect to the EUV emission can be explained by the impact of a cloud of
fragments. The first impacts produce strong initial upflows. The following
fragments are hit and shocked by these upflows. The UV emission comes mostly
from the shocked front shell of the fragments while they are still falling, and
is therefore redshifted when observed from above. The EUV emission instead
continues from the hot surface layer that is fed by the impacts. Fragmented
accretion can therefore explain broad redshifted UV lines (e.g. C IV 1550A) to

to metal-wrapped cylindrical nanowire systems; a significant effect of the
nanowire diameter on the non-ideal Schottky barrier height was found. The
calculations were performed by solving Poisson's equation in the nanowire,
self-consistently with the constraints set by the non-ideal interface
conditions; in these calculations the barrier height is obtained from the
solution, and it is not a boundary condition for Poisson's equation. The main
finding is that thin nanowires are expected to have tens of meV higher Schottky
barriers compared to their thicker counterparts. What lies behind this effect
is the electrostatic properties of metal-wrapped nanowires; in particular,
since depletion charge is reduced with nanowire radius, the potential drop on
the interfacial layer, is reduced - leading to the increase of the barrier
height with nanowire radius reduction.

  We conjugate this tool with two families of multiple quadratic Lyapunov
functions, parameterized by an integer T >= 1, and obtain converse Lyapunov
Theorems for each.
  Lyapunov functions of the first family associate one quadratic form per state

after every T successive time steps. The second family is made of the
path-dependent Lyapunov functions of Lee and Dullerud. They are parameterized
by an amount of memory (T-1) >= 0.
  Our converse Lyapunov theorems are finite. More precisely, we give sufficient
conditions on the asymptotic growth rate of a stable system under which one can
compute an integer parameter T >= 1 for which both types of Lyapunov functions
exist.

in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks. In contrast to other materials
(e.g., silicates) water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher
specific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual
collisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have
been scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-size
region and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup
to grow aggregates composed of $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized water-ice particles, which
we used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at
different temperatures between $114 \, \mathrm{K}$ and $260 \, \mathrm{K}$. We
show with our experiments that for low temperatures (below $\sim 210 \,
\mathrm{K}$), $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold
velocity of $9.6 \, \mathrm{m \, s^{-1}}$, which is approximately ten times
higher than the sticking threshold of $\mathrm{\mu}$m-sized silica particles.
Furthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities
above $15.3 \, \mathrm{m \, s^{-1}}$. A comparison of the experimentally
derived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine
important material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy
and the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the
presence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance
the growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.

ignorability of the mediator, which may not hold in many social and scientific
studies. Motivated by a multilevel randomized treatment experiment using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this paper proposes a multilevel
causal mediation framework for data with hierarchically nested structure, and
this framework provides valid inference even if structured unmeasured
confounding for the mediator and outcome is present. For the first-level data,
we propose a linear structural equation model for a continuous mediator and a
continuous outcome, both of which may contain correlated additive errors. A
likelihood-based approach is proposed to estimate the model coefficients. The
analysis of our estimator characterizes the nonidentifiability issue due to the
correlation parameter. To address the identifiability issue and model the
variability in multilevel data, we propose to incorporate multiple first-level
mediation models across different levels in a unified multilevel mediation
framework. All the model coefficients are estimated simultaneously by our
optimization algorithms, with innovation to estimate the unknown correlation
parameter from data, instead of performing sensitivity analysis. Our asymptotic
analysis shows that the correlation parameter is identifiable, and our
estimates for the mediation effects are consistent with the parametric

frustrated lattice are examined. We analyze a spinless fermion model on a
paired triangular lattice, an electronic model for layered iron oxides, in zero
and finite temperatures by the exact diagonalization methods. We focus on the
two charge ordered (CO) phases, termed CO_1/2 and CO_1/3, which, respectively,
are realized by the inter-site Coulomb interaction and the quantum/thermal
fluctuations. The optical spectra in CO_1/3 show multiple components and their
low-energy weights are survived even below the ordering temperature (T_CO).
Changes of the dynamical charge correlation below T_CO in CO_1/3 are weakly
momentum dependent, in sharply contrast to CO_1/2. These characteristic
dynamics in CO_1/3 are attributable to the charge frustration effects, and
reproduce some aspects of the recent experimental optical and x-ray scattering
spectra.

$r$, semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF) looks for a matrix $U$
with $r$ columns and a nonnegative matrix $V$ with $r$ rows such that $UV$ is
the best possible approximation of $M$ according to some metric. In this paper,
we study the properties of semi-NMF from which we develop exact and heuristic
algorithms. Our contribution is threefold. First, we prove that the error of a
semi-NMF of rank $r$ has to be smaller than the best unconstrained
approximation of rank $r-1$. This leads us to a new initialization procedure
based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) with a guarantee on the quality
of the approximation. Second, we propose an exact algorithm (that is, an
algorithm that finds an optimal solution), also based on the SVD, for a certain
class of matrices (including nonnegative irreducible matrices) from which we
derive an initialization for matrices not belonging to that class. Numerical
experiments illustrate that this second approach performs extremely well, and
allows us to compute optimal semi-NMF decompositions in many situations.
Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of semi-NMF proving its
NP-hardness, already in the rank-one case (that is, for $r = 1$), and we show
that semi-NMF is sometimes ill-posed (that is, an optimal solution does not
exist).

been proven to be mass independent in many cases. Counterexamples were also
found in some occasions. In this paper, we first prove a theorem derived from
the first law of black hole thermodynamics and a mathematical lemma related to
the Vandermonde determinant. With these arguments, we develop some general
criterion for the mass independence of the entropy product as well as the
entropy sum. In particular, if a $d$-dimensional spacetime is spherically
symmetric and its radial metric function $f(r)$ is a Laurent series in $r$ with
the lowest power $-m$ and the highest power $n$, we find the criteria is
extremely simple: The entropy product is mass independent if and only if $m\geq
d-2$ and $n\geq4-d$. The entropy sum is mass independent if and only if $m\geq
d-2$ and $n\geq 2$. Compared to previous works, our method does not require an
exact expression of the metric.
  Our arguments turn out to be useful even for rotating black holes. By
applying our theorem and lemma to a Myers-Perry black hole with spacetime
dimension $d$, we show that the entropy product/sum is mass independent for all
$d>4$, while it is mass dependent only for $d=4$, i.e., the Kerr solution.

population in a variety of ways such as ultra-sensitivity to perturbation,
collective modes of feeding, and protection from environmental stress. While
some collective groups use a single organizing principle, others can
dynamically shift the behavior of the group by modifying the interaction rules
at the individual level. The surface-dwelling bacterium Myxococcus xanthus
forms dynamic collective groups both to feed on prey and to aggregate during
times of starvation. The latter behavior, termed fruiting-body formation,
involves a complex, coordinated series of density changes that ultimately lead
to three-dimensional aggregates comprising hundreds of thousands of cells and
spores. This multi-step developmental process most likely involves several
different single-celled behaviors as the population condenses from a loose,
two-dimensional sheet to a three-dimensional mound. Here, we use
high-resolution microscopy and computer vision software to spatiotemporally
track the motion of thousands of individuals during the initial stages of
fruiting body formation. We find that a combination of cell-contact-mediated
alignment and internal timing mechanisms drive a phase transition from
exploratory flocking, in which cell groups move rapidly and coherently over
long distances, to a reversal-mediated localization into streams, which act as
slow-spreading, quasi-one-dimensional nematic fluids. These observations lead
us to an active liquid crystal description of the myxobacterial development
cycle.

chemistry in these studies has not been quantified from an observational point
of view. In order to compare how the deuterated fractions of species formed
only in the gas and partially or uniquely on grain surfaces evolve with time,
we observed rotational transitions of CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH2DOH, CH3OD at 3 and
1.3~mm, and of NH2D at 3~mm with the IRAM-30m telescope, and the inversion
transitions (1,1) and (2,2) of NH3 with the GBT, towards most of the cores
already observed by Fontani et al.~(2011, 2014) in N2H+, N2D+, HNC, DNC. NH2D
is detected in all but two cores, regardless of the evolutionary stage.
Dfrac(NH3) is on average above 0.1, and does not change significantly from the
earliest to the most evolved phases, although the highest average value is
found in the protostellar phase (~0.3). Few lines of CH2DOH and CH3OD are
clearly detected, and only towards protostellar cores or externally heated
starless cores. This work clearly confirms an expected different evolutionary
trend of the species formed exclusively in the gas (N2D+ and N2H+) and those
formed partially (NH2D and NH3) or totally (CH2DOH and CH3OH) on grain mantles.
The study also reinforces the idea that Dfrac(N2H+) is the best tracer of
massive starless cores, while high values of Dfrac(CH3OH) seem rather good
tracers of the early protostellar phases, at which the evaporation/sputtering
of the grain mantles is most efficient.

Volume-Averaged Navier--Stokes (VANS) equations are used, which are obtained by
volume-averaging the microscopic flow field over a small volume that is larger
than the typical dimensions of the pores. In this way the porous medium has a
continuum description, and can be specified without the need of a detailed
knowledge of the pore microstructure by indipendently assigning permeability
and porosity. At the interface between the porous material and the fluid
region, momentum-transfer conditions are applied, in which an available
coefficient related to the unknown structure of the interface can be used as an
error estimate. To set up the numerical problem, the velocity-vorticity
formulation of the coupled NS and VANS equations is derived and implemented in
a pseudo-spectral DNS solver. Most of the simulations are carried out at
$Re_\tau=180$ and consider low-permeability materials; a parameter study is
used to describe the role played by permeability, porosity, thickness of the
porous material, and the coefficient of the momentum-transfer interface
conditions. Among them permeability, even when very small, is shown to play a
major role in determining the response of the channel flow to the permeable
wall. Turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow fields, in comparative form
to the flow over a smooth impermeable wall, are used to understand the main
changes introduced by the porous material. A simulations at higher Reynolds
number is used to illustrate the main scaling quantities.

value problem associated with this system, we prove a global well-posedness
result in a certain topology under appropriate regularity conditions on the

solution of the classical equations of thermoelasticity as $\tau \to 0$.
Finally, we deduce an explicit solution representation for the delay problem.

schedule periodic jobs subject to their processing frequency demands. Instances
are given as a set of jobs that have to be processed infinitely often such that
the time interval between two consecutive executions of the same job j is no
longer than the job's given period $p_j$.
  The key contribution of this work is a new interpretation of the problem
variant with exact periods, where the time interval between consecutive
executions must be strictly $p_j$. We show that this version is equivalent to a
natural combinatorial problem we call Partial Coding. Reductions in both
directions can be realized in polynomial time, so that both hardness proofs and
algorithms for Partial Coding transfer to Windows Scheduling.
  Applying this new perspective, we obtain a number of new results regarding
the computational complexity of various Windows Scheduling Problem variants. We
prove that even the case of one processor and unit-length jobs does not admit a
pseudo-polynomial time algorithm unless SAT can be solved by a randomized
method in expected quasi-polynomial time. This result also extends to the case
of inexact periods, which answers a question that has remained open for more
than two decades. Furthermore, we report an error found in a hardness proof
previously given for the multi-machine case without machine migration, and we
show that this variant reduces to the single-machine case. Finally, we prove
that even with unit-length jobs the problem is co-NP-hard when jobs are allowed
to migrate between machines.

Motivated by the efficiency of the Lasso homotopy method, we present RepLasso,

of the nonconvex problem. Moreover, even if it does not recover global minima,
we prove that in relevant cases it will still do no worse than the Lasso in

it. We show empirically that the strategy can also be used to improve over
other Lasso-style algorithms. Finally, a GWAS of ankylosing spondylitis

Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by
Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013), complemented by additional cosmological

second-order Taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum. BOSS
  Ly$\alpha$ data alone provide better bounds than previous Ly$\alpha$ results,
but are still poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses
$\sum m_\nu$, for which we obtain an upper bound of 1.1~eV (95\% CL), including
systematics for both data and simulations. Ly$\alpha$ constraints on
$\Lambda$CDM parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with CMB bounds from
the Planck collaboration. Interestingly, the combination of Ly$\alpha$ with CMB
data reduces the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directions
of degeneracy in parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological bound
to date on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu < 0.15$~eV at 95\% CL (with a
best-fit in zero). Adding recent BAO results further tightens this constraint
to $\sum m_\nu < 0.14$~eV at 95\% CL. This bound is nearly independent of the
statistical approach used, and of the different combinations of CMB and BAO
data sets considered in this paper in addition to Ly$\alpha$. Given the
measured values of the two squared mass differences $\Delta m^2$, this result
tends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchy
scenario for the masses of the active neutrino species.

surface chemistry and biology, and serve as ultra-fine lithographic resists.
Due to their small thickness of only a few nanometers, the analysis of
patterned monolayer surfaces using conventional methods requires thorough
point-by-point scanning using complicated equipment. In the work reported
herein, patterned monolayers are simply and directly observed using a
bright-field optical microscope. The monolayers modify the spectral
reflectivity pattern of a silica-on-silicon thin film, and introduce a contrast
between bare and monolayer-coated regions of the substrate. The method can also
distinguish between regions of single-layer and bi-layer coatings. The
observations are supported by calculations, and by control experiments using
atomic force microscopy, scanning Raman spectrometry and scanning reflection
spectrometry. The results are useful for electro-optic devices, selective
wafer-bonding protocols and lab-on-a-chip test systems. We show here that
chemical reactions leading to the formation of a bi-layer of SAMs correspond to
an optical contrast visible to the naked eye, enabling such detection to
provide a simple, yet effective differentiation between monolayers and adsorbed
analytes with possible applications for chemical and/or biological sensing.

this paper, we focus on the multifrontal factorization of sparse matrices,
whose task graph is structured as a tree of parallel tasks. Among the existing
models for parallel tasks, the concept of malleable tasks is especially
powerful as it allows each task to be processed on a time-varying number of
processors. Following the model advocated by Prasanna and Musicus for matrix
computations, we consider malleable tasks whose speedup is $p^\alpha$, where
$p$ is the fractional share of processors on which a task executes, and
$\alpha$ ($0 < \alpha \leq 1$) is a parameter which does not depend on the
task. We first motivate the relevance of this model for our application with
actual experiments on multicore platforms. Then, we study the optimal
allocation proposed by Prasanna and Musicus for makespan minimization using
optimal control theory. We largely simplify their proofs by resorting only to
pure scheduling arguments. Building on the insight gained thanks to these new
proofs, we extend the study to distributed multicore platforms. There, a task
cannot be distributed among several distributed nodes. In such a distributed
setting (homogeneous or heterogeneous), we prove the NP-completeness of the
corresponding scheduling problem, and propose some approximation algorithms. We
finally assess the relevance of our approach by simulations on realistic trees.
We show that the average performance gain of our allocations with respect to
existing solutions (that are thus unaware of the actual speedup functions) is
up to 16% for $\alpha=0.9$ (the value observed in the real experiments).

relevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the opinions
of multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content
source to prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided,
and resolving divergent state amongst the nodes of a distributed system.
Previous works assume a fully synchronous system, where one can make strong
assumptions such as negligible message delivery delays and/or detection of
absent messages. However, practical, real-world systems are mostly
asynchronous, i.e., they exhibit only some periods of synchrony during which
message delivery is timely, thus requiring a different approach. In this paper,
we present a thorough study on practical interactive consistency. We leverage
the vast prior work on broadcast and byzantine consensus algorithms to design,
implement and evaluate a set of algorithms, with varying timing assumptions and
message complexity, that can be used to achieve interactive consistency in
real-world distributed systems. We provide a complete, open-source
implementation of each proposed interactive consistency algorithm by building a
multi-layered stack of protocols that include several broadcast protocols, as
well as a binary and a multi-valued consensus protocol. Most of these protocols
have never been implemented and evaluated in a real system before. We analyze
the performance of our suite of algorithms experimentally by engaging in both
single instance and multiple parallel instances of each alternative.

of stars. We compute several models of chemical evolution using the metallicity
distribution of dwarf stars as an observational constraint for the bulge of
M31. Then, by means of the model which best reproduces the metallicity
distribution function, we predict the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations for several
chemical elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, C, N). Our best model for the bulge of M31 is
obtained by means of a robust statistical method and assumes a Salpeter initial
mass function, a Schmidt-Kennicutt law for star formation with an exponent
k=1.5, an efficiency of star formation of $\sim 15\pm 0.27\, Gyr^{-1}$, and an
infall timescale of $\sim 0.10\pm 0.03$Gyr. Our results suggest that the bulge
of M31 formed very quickly by means of an intense star formation rate and an
initial mass function flatter than in the solar vicinity but similar to that
inferred for the Milky Way bulge. The [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios in the stars of the
bulge of M31 should be high for most of the [Fe/H] range, as is observed in the
Milky Way bulge. These predictions await future data to be proven.

emotions in the process can lead to a complex social graph exhibiting
multilayered structure and mesoscopic communities. Using simplicial complexes
representation of graphs, we investigate in-depth topology of online social
network which is based on MySpace dialogs. The network exhibits original
community structure. In addition, we simulate emotion spreading in this network
that enables to identify two emotion-propagating layers. The analysis resulting
in three structure vectors quantifies the graph's architecture at different
topology levels. Notably, structures emerging through shared links, triangles
and tetrahedral faces, frequently occur and range from tree-like to maximal
5-cliques and their respective complexes. On the other hand, the structures
which spread only negative or only positive emotion messages appear to have
much simpler topology consisting of links and triangles. Furthermore, we
introduce the node's structure vector which represents the number of simplices
at each topology level in which the node resides. The total number of such
simplices determines what we define as the node's topological dimension. The
presented results suggest that the node's topological dimension provides a
suitable measure of the social capital which measures the agent's ability to
act as a broker in compact communities, the so called Simmelian brokerage. We
also generalize the results to a wider class of computer-generated networks.
Investigating components of the node's vector over network layers reveals that
same nodes develop different socio-emotional relations and that the influential
nodes build social capital by combining their connections in different layers.

embedded in a given social network. The goal is to maximize the revenue of the
seller. We assume impatient consumers who buy the product as soon as the seller
posts a price not greater than their values of the product. The product's value
for a consumer is determined by two factors: a fixed consumer-specified
intrinsic value and a variable externality that is exerted from the consumer's
neighbors in a linear way. We study the scenario of negative externalities,
which captures many interesting situations, but is much less understood in
comparison with its positive externality counterpart. We assume complete
information about the network, consumers' intrinsic values, and the negative
externalities. The maximum revenue is in general achieved by iterative pricing,
which offers impatient consumers a sequence of prices over time.
  We prove that it is NP-hard to find an optimal iterative pricing, even for
unweighted tree networks with uniform intrinsic values. Complementary to the
hardness result, we design a 2-approximation algorithm for finding iterative
pricing in general weighted networks with (possibly) nonuniform intrinsic

connection from the plethora of connections available. In such a setting, given
the transmission powers differ significantly between downlink (DL) and uplink

infrastructure in a way that it receives the downlink (DL) traffic from one BS
and sends uplink (UL) traffic through another BS. This situation is referred to
as Downlink and Uplink Decoupling (DUDe). In this paper, the capacity and
throughput gains brought by decoupling are rigorously derived using stochastic
geometry. Theoretical findings are then corroborated by means of simulation
results. A further constituent of this paper is the verification of the
theoretically derived results by means of a real-world system simulation
platform. Despite theoretical assumptions differing from the very complete
system simulator, the trends in the association probabilities and capacity
gains are similar. Based on the promising results, we then outline
architectural changes needed to facilitate the decoupling of DL and UL.

the formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on of the

viscosity solutions of path-dependent semilinear PDEs. We consider the notion
of viscosity solutions introduced in \cite{EKTZ} which considers as test
functions all those smooth processes which are tangent in mean. When restricted
to the Markovian case, this definition induces a larger set of test functions,
and reduces to the notion of stochastic viscosity solutions analyzed in
\cite{BayraktarSirbu1,BayraktarSirbu2}. Our main result takes advantage of this
enlargement of the test functions, and provides an easier proof of comparison.
This is most remarkable in the context of the linear path-dependent heat
equation. As a key ingredient for our methodology, we introduce a notion of
punctual differentiation, similar to the corresponding concept in the standard
viscosity solutions \cite{CaffarelliCabre}, and we prove that semimartingales
are almost everywhere punctually differentiable. This smoothness result can be
viewed as the counterpart of the Aleksandroff smoothness result for convex
functions. A similar comparison result was established earlier in \cite{EKTZ}.
The result of this paper is more general and, more importantly, the arguments
that we develop do not rely on any representation of the solution.

Many ecological explanations have been proposed for TL but it is also commonly
observed outside ecology. We propose that TL arises from the constraining
influence of two primary variables: the number of individuals and the number of
censuses or sites. We show that most possible configurations of individuals
among censuses or sites produce the power-law form of TL with exponents between
1 and 2. This feasible set approach suggests that TL is a statistical pattern
driven by two constraints, providing an a priori explanation for this
ubiquitous pattern. However, the exact form of any specific mean-variance

job of predicting variation in the exponent, suggesting that TL may still
contain ecological information.

phenomenology. The Ginzburg-Landau formalism can then be used to justify the

detect collimated, narrowband pulses of electromagnetic radiation. These pulses
may either consist of signals intentionally directed at the Earth, or signals
between two star systems with a vector that unintentionally intersects the
Solar System, allowing Earth to intercept the communication. But should we
expect to be able to intercept these unintentional signals? And what
constraints can we place upon the frequency of intelligent civilisations if we
do?
  We carry out Monte Carlo Realisation simulations of interstellar
communications between civilisations in the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) using
collimated beams. We measure the frequency with which beams between two stars
are intercepted by a third. The interception rate increases linearly with the
fraction of communicating civilisations, and as the cube of the beam opening
angle, which is somewhat stronger than theoretical expectations, which we argue
is due to the geometry of the GHZ. We find that for an annular GHZ containing
10,000 civilisations, intersections are unlikely unless the beams are
relatively uncollimated.
  These results indicate that optical SETI is more likely to find signals
deliberately directed at the Earth than accidentally intercepting collimated
communications. Equally, civilisations wishing to establish a network of
communicating species may use weakly collimated beams to build up the network
through interception, if they are willing to pay a cost penalty that is lower
than that meted by fully isotropic beacons. Future SETI searches should
consider the possibility that communicating civilisations will attempt to
strike a balance between optimising costs and encouraging contact between
civilisations, and look for weakly collimated pulses as well as narrow-beam
pulses directed deliberately at the Earth.

sphere on pedagogical example. We use a parabolic support rotating around it
axis to study the static equilibrium positions of a single sphere. Due to the
particular choice of the shape of support, some easy analytical calculations
allow theoretical predictions. (i) In the frictionless case, there is an eigen
frequency of rotation where the gravity balances the centrifugal force. All
positions on the parabola are therefore in static equilibrium. At others rates
of rotation, the sphere can go to the center or escape to infinity. It depends
only on the sign of the detuning with the eigenfrequency. (ii) In contrast, we
show that the static friction imposes a range of equilibrium positions at all
rotating rates. These predictions can be compared to the maximum equilibrium
radius measured on the experimental device. A reasonable estimate of the static
friction between the support and spheres made of different materials can be
extracted from this maximum equilibrium radius. To go further in understanding
of the experimental results, we perform a stability analysis also in the case
with friction. This analysis involves the rolling friction. We show that this

we explore some of their fundamental properties on the digital plane that have
a strong bearing on the unsupervised detection of circles and circular arcs in
a digital image. We show that although the chord-and-sagitta properties of a
real circle do not readily migrate to the digital plane, they can indeed be
used for the analysis in the discrete domain based on certain bounds on their
deviations, which are derived from the real domain. In particular, we derive an
upper bound on the circumferential angular deviation of a point in the context
of chord property, and an upper bound on the relative error in radius
estimation with regard to the sagitta property. Using these two bounds, we
design a novel algorithm for the detection and parameterization of circles and
circular arcs, which does not require any heuristic initialization or manual
tuning. The chord property is deployed for the detection of circular arcs,
whereas the sagitta property is used to estimate their centers and radii.
Finally, to improve the accuracy of estimation, the notion of restricted Hough

robustness of the proposed methodology compared to existing techniques.
