temperature quantum turbulence in $^4$He, paying particular attention to the
role of quantized vortex reconnections. Through the use of the vortex filament
model, we produce three experimentally relevant types of vortex tangles in
steady-state conditions, and examine through statistical analysis, how local
properties of the tangle influence the mutual friction force. Finally, by
monitoring reconnection events, we present evidence to indicate that vortex
reconnections are the dominant mechanism for producing areas of high curvature
and velocity leading to regions of high mutual friction, particularly for
homogeneous and isotropic vortex tangles.

Based on the blow-up-a-point construction, elastic material tensors for a
perfect cloak are derived and shown to possess singularities. In order to avoid
the singular structure, we propose to regularize the blow-up-a-point
construction to be the blow-up-a-small-region construction. However, it is
shown that without incorporating a suitable lossy layer, the regularized
construction would fail due to resonant inclusions. In order to defeat the
failure of the lossless construction, a properly designed lossy layer is
introduced into the regularized cloaking construction . We derive sharp
asymptotic estimates in assessing the cloaking performance. The proposed
cloaking scheme is capable of nearly cloaking an arbitrary content with a high

addresses these problems within a unified Bayesian framework for joint

filtering approaches for state estimation from cameras is problematic, an
alternative parametrisation is exploited, called disparity space. The disparity
space-based approach for triangulation and object tracking is shown to be more

for non-rectified cameras. The approach for feature correspondence is based on
the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, and hence inherits the ability
to update without explicit measurement association, to initiate new targets,
and to discriminate between target and clutter. The PHD filtering approach then
forms the basis of a camera calibration method from static or moving objects.

the specific heat at the magnetic transitions $T_1=68$ K and $T_2=360$ K. Both

ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states. Resistivity measurements
reveal metallic transport with a sharp anomaly associated with the transition
at $T_2$. The Hall effect is dominated by the anomalous contribution which
rivals that of magnetic semiconductors in magnitude ($-5 \mu \Omega$ cm at 2 T
and 350 K) and undergoes a change of sign upon cooling into the low temperature
FM state. The temperature and field dependence of the Hall effect indicate that
the magnetism is likely to be highly itinerant in character and that a
significant change in the electronic structure accompanies the magnetic
transitions. We observe a contribution from the topological Hall effect in the
AFM phase suggesting a non-coplanar contribution to the magnetism. Electronic
structure calculations predict an AFM ground state with a wavevector parallel
to the crystallographic $c$-axis preferred over the experimentally measured FM
state by $\approx$ 50 meV per unit cell. However, supercell calculations with a
small density of Fe-antisite defects introduced tend to stabilize the FM over
the AFM state indicating that antisite defects may be the cause of the
sensitivity to sample synthesis conditions.

from the joint posterior distribution for a multi-component model of the sky

be exactly marginalised to estimate properties of the secondary anisotropies,
fully taking into account degeneracies with the other signals in the CMB map.

also discuss how other types of secondary anisotropy can be accommodated within

whose links distributions approaches a power law, using a model that defines
banks balance sheets from information of network connectivity. By varying the
parameters for the creation of the network, several interbank networks are
built, in which the concentrations of debts and credits are obtained from links
distributions during the creation networks process. Three main types of
interbank network are analyzed for their resilience to contagion: i)
concentration of debts is greater than concentration of credits, ii)
concentration of credits is greater than concentration of debts and iii)
concentrations of debts and credits are similar. We also tested the effect of a
variation in connectivity in conjunction with variation in concentration of
links. The results suggest that more connected networks with high concentration
of credits (featuring nodes that are large creditors of the system) present
greater resilience to contagion when compared with the others networks
analyzed. Evaluating some topological indices of systemic risk suggested by the
literature we have verified the ability of these indices to explain the impact
on the system caused by the failure of a node. There is a clear positive
correlation between the topological indices and the magnitude of losses in the
case of networks with high concentration of debts. This correlation is smaller

However the main parts of behavioral finance, prospect theory included,
understand financial markets through individual investment behavior. Behavioral
finance thereby ignores any interaction between participants. We introduce a
socio-financial model that studies the impact of communication on the pricing
in financial markets. Considering the simplest possible case where each market
participant has either a positive (bullish) or negative (bearish) sentiment
with respect to the market, we model the evolution of the sentiment in the
population due to communication in subgroups of different sizes. Nonlinear
feedback effects between the market performance and changes in sentiments are
taking into account by assuming that the market performance is dependent on
changes in sentiments (e.g. a large sudden positive change in bullishness would
lead to more buying). The market performance in turn has an impact on the
sentiment through the transition probabilities to change an opinion in a group
of a given size. The idea is that if for example the market has observed a
recent downturn, it will be easier for even a bearish minority to convince a
bullish majority to change opinion compared to the case where the meeting takes
place in a bullish upturn of the market. Within the framework of our proposed
model, financial markets stylized facts such as volatility clustering and
extreme events may be perceived as arising due to abrupt sentiment changes via
ongoing communication of the market participants. The model introduces a new
volatility measure which is apt of capturing volatility clustering and from
maximum likelihood analysis we are able to apply the model to real data and
give additional long term insight into where a market is heading.

  Thermodynamic Perspective",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present study investigates how global thermodynamic properties of the
climate system are affected by the changes in the intensity of the imposed
oceanic heat transport in an atmospheric general circulation model in
aqua-planet configuration. Increasing the poleward oceanic heat transport
results in an overall increase in the surface temperature and a decrease in the
equator-to-pole surface temperature difference as a result of the ice-albedo
feedback. Following the classical ansatz by Stone, the atmospheric heat
transport changes in such a way that the total poleward heat transport remains
almost unchanged. We also find that the efficiency of the climate machine, the
intensity of the Lorenz energy cycle and the material entropy production of the
system decline with increased oceanic heat transport which suggests that the
climate system becomes less efficient and turns into a state of reduced entropy
production, as the enhanced oceanic transport performs a stronger large-scale
mixing between geophysical fluids with different temperature, thus reducing the
availability in the climate system and bringing it closer to a state of thermal
equilibrium.

challenges in the research of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here,
we report a chloride molecular doping technique which greatly reduces the
contact resistance (Rc) in the few-layer WS2 and MoS2. After doping, the Rc of
WS2 and MoS2 have been decreased to 0.7 kohm*um and 0.5 kohm*um, respectively.
The significant reduction of the Rc is attributed to the achieved high electron
doping density thus significant reduction of Schottky barrier width. As a
proof-ofconcept, high-performance few-layer WS2 field-effect transistors (FETs)
are demonstrated, exhibiting a high drain current of 380 uA/um, an on/off ratio
of 4*106, and a peak field-effect mobility of 60 cm2/V*s. This doping technique
provides a highly viable route to diminish the Rc in TMDs, paving the way for
high-performance 2D nano-electronic devices.

Rev. E 49, 2941 (1994)] is a popular mesoscopic model for simulating multiphase
flows and interfacial dynamics. In this model, the contact angle is usually
realized by a fluid-solid interaction. Two widely used fluid-solid
interactions: the density-based interaction and the pseudopotential-based
interaction, as well as a modified pseudopotential-based interaction formulated
in the present paper, are numerically investigated and compared in terms of the
achievable contact angles, the maximum and the minimum densities, and the
spurious currents. It is found that the pseudopotential-based interaction works
well for simulating small static (liquid) contact angles, however, is unable to
reproduce static contact angles close to 180 degrees. Meanwhile, it is found
that the proposed modified pseudopotential-based interaction performs better in
light of the maximum and the minimum densities and is overall more suitable for
simulating large contact angles as compared with the other two types of
fluid-solid interactions. Furthermore, the spurious currents are found to be
enlarged when the fluid-solid interaction force is introduced. Increasing the
kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases is shown to be
capable of reducing the spurious currents caused by the fluid-solid
interactions.

a financial system in distress. Given a one-period borrower-lender network in
which all debts are due at the same time and have the same seniority, we
address the problem of allocating a fixed amount of cash among the nodes to
minimize the weighted sum of unpaid liabilities. Assuming all the loan amounts
and asset values are fixed and that there are no bankruptcy costs, we show that
this problem is equivalent to a linear program. We develop a duality-based
distributed algorithm to solve it which is useful for applications where it is
desirable to avoid centralized data gathering and computation. We also consider
the problem of minimizing the expectation of the weighted sum of unpaid
liabilities under the assumption that the net external asset holdings of all
institutions are stochastic. We show that this problem is a two-stage
stochastic linear program. To solve it, we develop two algorithms based on:
Benders decomposition algorithm and projected stochastic gradient descent. We
show that if the defaulting nodes never pay anything, the deterministic optimal
cash injection allocation problem is an NP-hard mixed-integer linear program.
However, modern optimization software enables the computation of very accurate
solutions to this problem on a personal computer in a few seconds for network
sizes comparable with the size of the US banking system. In addition, we
address the problem of allocating the cash injection amount so as to minimize
the number of nodes in default. For this problem, we develop two heuristic
algorithms: a reweighted l1 minimization algorithm and a greedy algorithm. We
illustrate these two algorithms using three synthetic network structures for
which the optimal solution can be calculated exactly. We also compare these two
algorithms on three types random networks which are more complex.

the large-scale structure we observe today. It provides an indirect probe of
inflation or other structure-formation mechanisms. In this letter, we recover
the primordial power spectrum from the Planck PR1 dataset, using our recently
published algorithm PRISM. PRISM is a sparsity-based inversion method, that
aims at recovering features in the primordial power spectrum from the empirical
power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This ill-posed inverse
problem is regularised using a sparsity prior on features in the primordial
power spectrum in a wavelet dictionary. Although this non-parametric method
does not assume a strong prior on the shape of the primordial power spectrum,
it is able to recover both its general shape and localised features. As a
results, this approach presents a reliable way of detecting deviations from the
currently favoured scale-invariant spectrum. We applied PRISM to 100 simulated
Planck data to investigate its performance on Planck-like data. We also tested
the algorithm's ability to recover a small localised feature at $k \sim 0.125$
Mpc$^{-1}$, which caused a large dip at $\ell \sim 1800$ in the angular power
spectrum. We then applied PRISM to the Planck PR1 power spectrum to recover the
primordial power spectrum. We find no significant departures from the fiducial
Planck PR1 near scale-invariant primordial power spectrum with
$A_s=2.215\times10^{-9}$ and $n_s = 0.9624$.

a multifold analogue of the now classical (two-fold) symplectic sum
construction; we thus establish an old suggestion of Gromov in a strong~form.

Potassium-40 atoms in a two-dimensional optical lattice at finite temperatures
with the Fulde-Ferrell order parameter has been formulated. It is assumed that
the two-species interacting Fermi gas is described by the one-band Hubbard
Hamiltonian with an attractive on-site interaction. The discussion is
restricted to the BCS side of the Feshbach resonance where the Fermi atoms
exhibit superfluidity. The quartic on-site interaction is decoupled via a
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation by introducing a four-component boson field
which mediates the Hubbard interaction. A functional integral technique and a
Legendre transform are used to give a systematic derivation of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations for the generalized single-particle Green's function
and the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-particle Green's function and the
associated collective modes. The numerical solution of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation in the generalized random phase approximation shows that there exist
two distinct sound velocities in the long-wavelength limit. In addition to the
long-wavelength mode (Goldstone mode), the two-species Fermi gas has a
superfluid phase revealed by two rotonlike minima in the asymmetric
collective-mode energy.

relevant questions in quantum gravity theory. Already at the semiclassical
level, when gravity is a classical background for quantum matter fields, the
action of gravity should include fourth derivative terms to provide
renormalizability in the vacuum sector. The same situation holds in the quantum
theory of metric. At the same time, including the fourth derivative terms means
the presence of massive ghosts, which are gauge-independent massive states with
negative kinetic energy. At both classical and quantum level such ghosts
violate stability and hence the theory becomes inconsistent. Several approaches
to solve this contradiction were invented and we are proposing one more, which
looks simpler than those what were considered before. We explore the dynamics
of the gravitational waves on the background of classical solutions and give
certain arguments that massive ghosts produce instability only when they are
present as physical particles. At least on the cosmological background one can
observe that if the initial frequency of the metric perturbations is much
smaller than the mass of the ghost, no instabilities are present.

complete description of experimental data both above (up to 200 MeV) and below
the Fermi energy in $^{40}$Ca, we demonstrate that elastic nucleon-nucleus
scattering data constrain the spectral strength in the continuum of orbits that
are nominally bound in the independent-particle model. In the energy domain
between 0 and 200 MeV, the integrated strength or depletion number is highly
sensitive to the separation of the IPM orbit to the scattering continuum. This
sensitivity is determined by the influence of the surface-absorption properties
of the DOM self-energy. For an ab initio calculation employing the self-energy
of the charge-dependent Bonn (CDBonn) interaction which only includes the
effect of short-range correlations, no such sensitivity is obtained and a
depletion of 4% is predicted between 0 and 200 MeV irrespective of the orbit.
The ab initio spectral strength generated with the CDBonn interaction
approaches the empirical DOM spectral strength at 200 MeV. Both spectral
distributions allow for an additional 3-5% of the strength at even higher
energies which is associated with the influence of short-range correlations. We
suggest that the non-local form of the DOM allows for an analysis of
elastic-nucleon-scattering data that directly determines the depletion of bound
orbits. While obviously relevant for the analysis of elastic nucleon scattering
on stable targets, this conclusion holds equally well for experiments involving
rare isotopes in inverse kinematics as well as experiments with electrons on
atoms or molecules.

coverage and inclusion probabilities. Most interesting is the stationary case
where the asymptotic properties of the cells are strongly related to the
ergodic properties of the non-singular flow generating the max-stable process.
For example, we show that: i) the cells are bounded almost surely if and only

first order derivative vanishes and the second order one is positive) are local
minima for smooth perturbations; as we are in an infinite dimensional

Milky Way characterized by a large mass-to-light ratio and are not expected to
be the site of non-thermal high-energy gamma-ray emission or intense star
formation. Therefore they are amongst the most promising candidates for
indirect dark matter searches. During the last years the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
observed five of these dwarf galaxies for more than 140 hours in total,
searching for TeV gamma-ray emission from annihilation of dark matter
particles. The new results of the deep exposure of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, the first observations of the Coma Berenices and Fornax
dwarves and the re-analysis of two more dwarf spheroidal galaxies already
published by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, Carina and Sculptor, are presented. In
the absence of a significant signal new constraints on the annihilation
cross-section applicable to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are
derived by combining the observations of the five dwarf galaxies. The combined
exclusion limit depends on the WIMP mass and the best constraint is reached at
1-2 TeV masses with a cross-section upper bound of ~3.9x10-24 cm^3 s-1 at a 95%
confidence level.

  in Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we examine cognitive radio systems that evolve dynamically
over time due to changing user and environmental conditions. To combine the
advantages of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, we consider a MIMO-OFDM
cognitive radio network where wireless users with multiple antennas communicate
over several non-interfering frequency bands. As the network's primary users
(PUs) come and go in the system, the communication environment changes
constantly (and, in many cases, randomly). Accordingly, the network's
unlicensed, secondary users (SUs) must adapt their transmit profiles ""on the
fly"" in order to maximize their data rate in a rapidly evolving environment
over which they have no control. In this dynamic setting, static solution
concepts (such as Nash equilibrium) are no longer relevant, so we focus on
dynamic transmit policies that lead to no regret: specifically, we consider
policies that perform at least as well as (and typically outperform) even the
best fixed transmit profile in hindsight. Drawing on the method of matrix
exponential learning and online mirror descent techniques, we derive a
no-regret transmit policy for the system's SUs which relies only on local
channel state information (CSI). Using this method, the system's SUs are able
to track their individually evolving optimum transmit profiles remarkably well,
even under rapidly (and randomly) changing conditions. Importantly, the
proposed augmented exponential learning (AXL) policy leads to no regret even if
the SUs' channel measurements are subject to arbitrarily large observation
errors (the imperfect CSI case), thus ensuring the method's robustness in the
presence of uncertainties.

downward near the origin and the inflaton trajectory is a gradual downward
spiral, ending at a point where the trench becomes unstable. There, the fields
begin falling rapidly towards the minimum of the potential and inflation
terminates as in a hybrid model. We find parameter choices that reproduce

symmetry-protected topological phases (SPT) protected by time-reversal and

proposed and classified by the group cohomology theory which suggests two
distinct root states, each carrying a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. Soon after, surface
anomalous topological orders were proposed to identify different root states of
BTI, which even leads to a new BTI root state beyond the group cohomology

\textit{vortex-line condensation} {from} a 3d superfluid to achieve all {three}
root states. It naturally produces bulk topological quantum field theory (TQFT)
description for each root state. Topologically ordered states on the surface
are \textit{rigorously} derived by placing TQFT on an open manifold, which
allows us to explicitly demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence. Finally,
we generalize the mechanism to $Z_N$ symmetries and discuss potential SPT

differently by different players, we here study evolutionary multigames in
structured populations. While the core game is the weak prisoner's dilemma, a
fraction of the population adopts either a positive or a negative value of the
sucker's payoff, thus playing either the traditional prisoner's dilemma or the
snowdrift game. We show that the higher the fraction of the population adopting
a different payoff matrix, the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted.
The microscopic mechanism responsible for this outcome is unique to structured
populations, and it is due to the payoff heterogeneity, which spontaneously
introduces strong cooperative leaders that give rise to an asymmetric strategy
imitation flow in favor of cooperation. We demonstrate that the reported
evolutionary outcomes are robust against variations of the interaction network,
and they also remain valid if players are allowed to vary which game they play
over time. These results corroborate existing evidence in favor of
heterogeneity-enhanced network reciprocity, and they reveal how different
perceptions of social dilemmas may contribute to their resolution.

objects. These corrections enter at the third and a half and fourth
post-Newtonian orders, respectively, for rapidly rotating compact objects.
Hence, we complete the leading order finite size effects with spin up to the
fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. We arrive at this by augmenting the point
particle effective action with new higher dimensional nonminimal coupling
worldline operators, involving higher-order derivatives of the gravitational
field, and introducing new Wilson coefficients, corresponding to constants,
which describe the octupole and hexadecapole deformations of the object due to
spin. These Wilson coefficients are fixed to unity in the black hole case. The
nonminimal coupling worldline operators enter the action with the electric and
magnetic components of the Weyl tensor of even and odd parity, coupled to even
and odd worldline spin tensors, respectively. Moreover, the non relativistic
gravitational field decomposition, which we employ, demonstrates a coupling
hierarchy of the gravito-magnetic vector and the Newtonian scalar, to the odd
and even in spin operators, respectively, which extends that of minimal
coupling. This observation is useful for the construction of the Feynman

deduce that observed eccentric warm Jupiters with eccentric giant companions

The near-orthogonality of periapse directions is effected by the outer

three point function of scalar perturbations produced during inflation to the
scalar four point function, in a particular limit. The derivation assumes
approximate conformal invariance, and the conditions for the slow roll
approximation, but is otherwise model independent. The Ward identities allow us
to deduce that the three point function must be suppressed in general, being of
the same order of magnitude as in the slow roll model. They also fix the three
point function in terms of the four point function, upto one constant which we
argue is generically suppressed. Our approach is based on analyzing the wave
function of the universe, and the Ward identities arise by imposing the
requirements of spatial and time reparametrization invariance on it.

several days, we observe an increase of over 200% in volume due to the
condensation of moisture from air. We find that long term exposure to ambient
conditions results in a layer-by-layer etching process of BP flakes.
Interestingly, flakes can be etched down to single layer (phosphorene)
thicknesses. BP's strong affinity for water greatly modifies the performance of
fabricated field-effect transistors (FETs) measured in ambient conditions. Upon
exposure to air, we differentiate between two timescales for doping of BP FET
transfer characterisitcs: a short timescale (minutes) in which a shift in the
threshold voltage occurs due to physisorbed oxygen and nitrogen, and a long
timescale (hours) in which p-type doping occurs from water absorption.
Continuous measurements of BP FETs in air reveal eventual degradation and
break-down of the channel material after several days due to the layer-by-layer
etching process.

network activity and is important for its computations. However, its presence
in the neocortex of higher mammals is not well established. We investigated the
dynamics of excitation and inhibition using dense multielectrode recordings in
humans and monkeys. We found that in all states of the wake-sleep cycle,
excitatory and inhibitory ensembles are well balanced, and co-fluctuate with
slight instantaneous deviations from perfect balance, mostly in slow-wave
sleep. Remarkably, these correlated fluctuations are seen for many different
temporal scales. The similarity of these computational features with a network
model of self-generated balanced states suggests that such balanced activity is
essentially generated by recurrent activity in the local network and is not due
to external inputs. Finally, we find that this balance breaks down during
seizures, where the temporal correlation of excitatory and inhibitory
populations is disrupted. These results show that balanced activity is a
feature of normal brain activity, and break down of the balance could be an
important factor to define pathological states.

  This paper describes the requirements that the evaluation scenario was

eliminate the ambiguities. Indeed, for the first HMM, the unvowelized Arabic
words are the observed states and the vowelized words are the hidden states.
The observed states of the second HMM are identical to those of the first, but

opportunities for long-range transmission of high-power laser radiation and
standoff detection. With the critical power of self-focusing scaling as the
laser wavelength squared, the quest for longer-wavelength drivers, which would
radically increase the peak power and, hence, the laser energy in a single
filament, has been ongoing over two decades, during which time the available
laser sources limited filamentation experiments in the atmosphere to the
near-infrared and visible ranges. Here, we demonstrate filamentation of
ultrashort mid-infrared pulses in the atmosphere for the first time. We show
that, with the spectrum of a femtosecond laser driver centered at 3.9 um, right
at the edge of the atmospheric transmission window, radiation energies above 20
mJ and peak powers in excess of 200 GW can be transmitted through the
atmosphere in a single filament. Our studies reveal unique properties of
mid-infrared filaments, where the generation of powerful mid-infrared
supercontinuum is accompanied by unusual scenarios of optical harmonic
generation, giving rise to remarkably broad radiation spectra, stretching from
the visible to the mid-infrared.

resonances (MMRs). Among these, the pairs of Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion
are special. They are located much deeper in resonance than the others and
their critical arguments librate with much greater amplitudes. These
characteristics are traced to the insignificant damping, over $\Gyr$
timescales, of Mimas's orbital inclination and Hyperion's orbital eccentricity.
Absent that, these resonances would not survive. Instead their librations would
be overstable and escape from resonance would occur on the relevant damping
time. Unlike the aforementioned MMRs, those involving Enceladus-Dione,
Io-Europa, and Europa-Ganymede are limited by eccentricity damping. They must
either remain at the shallow depths they currently occupy, or, if they venture
deeper, retreat after a limited time. The latter seems almost certain for
Enceladus-Dione and quite likely for the others, We examine the MMRs involving
Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion under the assumption that they formed as a
result of convergent migration. Capture probabilities are $\sim 6\%$ for the
former and $100\%$ for the latter. The possibility of collisional excitation of
their large librations is investigated but largely discounted.

different biological functions, we show that genuinely non--linear phenomena
are responsible for energy transport between the different machine sites
involved in the biological functions. The energy transfer turns out to be
extremely efficient from an energetic point of view: by changing the energy
initially provided to the model device, we identify a well defined range of
energies where the time for the energy transport to occur is minimal and the
amount of transferred energy is maximum. Furthermore, by introducing an
implicit solvent, we show that the energy is localized on the internal residues
of the protein structure, thus minimizing the dissipation.

how many of the benchmark types various election systems are vulnerable to,

  However, although the longstanding benchmark models of addition and deletion

quite distant from those they seek to capture.
  In this paper, we introduce--and for some important cases analyze the
complexity of--new partition models that seek to better capture many real-world
partition settings. In particular, in many partition settings one wants the two
parts of the partition to be of (almost) equal size, or is partitioning into
more than two parts, or has groups of actors who must be placed in the same
part of the partition. Our hope is that having these new partition types will
allow studies of control attacks to include such models that more realistically
capture many settings.

  Optimization",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Operator splitting schemes are a class of powerful algorithms that solve
complicated monotone inclusion and convex optimization problems that are built
from many simpler pieces. They give rise to algorithms in which all simple
pieces of the decomposition are processed individually. This leads to easily
implementable and highly parallelizable or distributed algorithms, which often
obtain nearly state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence rate of the forward-Douglas-Rachford splitting (FDRS) algorithm,
which is a generalization of the forward-backward splitting (FBS) and
Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) algorithms. Under general convexity
assumptions, we derive the ergodic and nonergodic convergence rates of the FDRS
algorithm, and show that these rates are the best possible. Under Lipschitz
differentiability assumptions, we show that the best iterate of FDRS converges
as quickly as the last iterate of the FBS algorithm. Under strong convexity
assumptions, we derive convergence rates for a sequence that strongly converges
to a minimizer. Under strong convexity and Lipschitz differentiability
assumptions, we show that FDRS converges linearly. We also provide examples
where the objective is strongly convex, yet FDRS converges arbitrarily slowly.
Finally, we relate the FDRS algorithm to a primal-dual forward-backward
splitting scheme and clarify its place among existing splitting methods. Our
results show that the FDRS algorithm automatically adapts to the regularity of
the objective functions and achieves rates that improve upon the sharp worst
case rates that hold in the absence of smoothness and strong convexity.

all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum, and at an energy of the order of $10^{17}$ eV
for protons. Such a high energy for Galactic protons appears difficult to
reconcile with the general view that GCRs are accelerated by the standard
diffusive shock acceleration process at the forward shock of individual
supernova remnants (SNRs). We also review various difficulties of the standard
SNR-GCR connection, related to the evolution of the light element abundances
and to significant isotopic anomalies. We point out that most of the power
injected by the supernovae in the Galaxy is actually released inside
superbubbles, which may thus play an important role in the origin of
cosmic-rays, and could solve some persistent problems of the standard SNR-GCR

steganography of finite memoryless sources with a passive warden is provided,
which is then extended to contemplate a distortion constraint. The solution
rests on the fact that Slepian's Variant I permutation coding implements
first-order perfect universal steganography of finite host signals with optimum
embedding rate. The duality between perfect universal steganography with
asymptotically optimum embedding rate and lossless universal source coding with
asymptotically optimum compression rate is evinced in practice by showing that
permutation coding can be implemented by means of adaptive arithmetic coding.
Next, a distortion constraint between the host signal and the
information-carrying signal is considered. Such a constraint is essential
whenever real-world host signals with memory (e.g., images, audio, or video)
are decorrelated to conform to the memoryless assumption. The constrained
version of the problem requires trading off embedding rate and distortion.
Partitioned permutation coding is shown to be a practical way to implement this
trade-off, performing close to an unattainable upper bound on the
rate-distortion function of the problem.

the capability of delivering large content over a WiFi infrastructure to
vehicles. The throughput achieved over WiFi channels can be highly variable and
also rapidly degrades as the distance from the access point increases. While
this behavior is well understood at the data link layer, the interactions
across the various protocol layers (data link and up through the transport
layer) and the effect of mobility may reduce the amount of content transferred
to the vehicle, as it travels along the roadway.
  This paper examines the throughput achieved at the TCP layer over a carefully
designed outdoor WiFi environment and the interactions across the layers that
impact the performance achieved, as a function of the receiver mobility. The
experimental studies conducted reveal that impairments over the WiFi link
(frame loss, ARQ and increased delay) and the residual loss seen by TCP causes
a cascade of duplicate ACKs to be generated. This triggers large congestion
window reductions at the sender, leading to a drastic degradation of throughput
to the vehicular client. To ensure outdoor WiFi infrastructures have the
potential to sustain reasonable downlink throughput for drive-by vehicles, we
speculate that there is a need to adapt how WiFi and TCP (as well as mobility
protocols) function for such vehicular applications.

intermediate-mass stars, to estimate the lower limit of the fraction of binary
systems having short periods. The estimate is based on a sample of very
metal-poor stars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and observed at
high spectral resolution in a previous study by Aoki et al. That survey
reported three double-lined spectroscopic binaries and 11 CEMP stars, which we
consider along with a sample of EMP stars from the literature compiled in the
SAGA database. We have conducted measurements of the velocity components for
stacked absorption features of different spectral lines for each double-lined
spectroscopic binary. Our estimate indicates that the fraction of binary stars
having orbital periods shorter than 1000 days is at least 10 %, and possibly as
high as 20 %, if the majority of CEMP stars are formed in such short-period
binaries. This result suggests that the period distribution of EMP binary
systems is biased toward short periods, unless the binary fraction of low-mass
EMP stars is significantly higher than that of other nearby stars.

In EFMs-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) experimentally determined external

to enumerate all EFMs for complex networks, since the number of EFMs increases
rapidly with network complexity. In this work we present an optimization-based

to the optimal solution of the EFMs-based MFA problem. The usefulness of our
method was examined in a case-study using data from a Chinese hamster ovary

the EFMs-based MFA problem could be solved at a low computational cost, even

quantum gravity in dimensions larger than two. Among them, the canonical tensor
model is formulated as a totally constrained system with first-class
constraints, the algebra of which resembles the Dirac algebra of general
relativity. When quantized, the physical states are defined to be vanished by
the quantized constraints. In explicit representations, the constraint
equations are a set of partial differential equations for the physical
wave-functions, which do not seem straightforward to be solved due to their
non-linear character. In this paper, after providing some explicit solutions
for $N=2,3$, we show that certain scale-free integration of partition functions
of statistical systems on random networks (or random tensor networks more
generally) provides a series of solutions for general $N$. Then, by
generalizing this form, we also obtain various solutions for general $N$.
Moreover, we show that the solutions for the cases with a cosmological constant
can be obtained from those with no cosmological constant for increased $N$.
This would imply the interesting possibility that a cosmological constant can
always be absorbed into the dynamics and is not an input parameter in the
canonical tensor model. We also observe the possibility of symmetry enhancement

measuring the shift of the critical temperature, we can constrain the

sufficiently high densities, quantum gravitational effects tend to make BEC
unstable. Using the numerical methods, the stable-unstable transition

integer-valued random walks conditioned to stay non-negative. More
specifically, we take pinning potentials of the form $\sum_{j\geq 0}\epsilon_j
N_j$, where $N_j$ is the number of visits to the state $j$ and $\{\epsilon_j\}$
is a non-negative sequence. Partly motivated by similar problems for
low-temperature contour models in statistical physics, we aim at finding a
sharp characterization of the threshold of the wetting transition, especially
in the regime where the variance $\sigma^2$ of the single step of the random
walk is small. Our main result says that, for natural choices of the pinning
sequence $\{\epsilon_j\}$, localization (respectively delocalization) occurs if
$\sigma^{-2}\sum_{ j\geq0}(j+1)\epsilon_j\geq\delta^{-1}$ (respectively $\le
\delta$), for some universal $\delta <1$. Our finding is reminiscent of the
classical Bargmann-Jost-Pais criteria for the absence of bound states for the
radial Schr\""odinger equation. The core of the proof is a recursive argument to
bound the free energy of the model. Our approach is rather robust, which allows
us to obtain similar results in the case where the random walk trajectory is
replaced by a self-avoiding path $\gamma$ in $\mathbb Z^2$ with weight
$\exp(-\beta |\gamma|)$, $|\gamma|$ being the length of the path and $\beta>0$
a large enough parameter. This generalization is directly relevant for
applications to the above mentioned contour models.

semantically defined by providing the workflow of D-TMs and the mathematical
formulation following the SemAP notation. Source layers to derive base

protoplanetary disks around young stars in the CepOB2 clusters Tr37 and NGC7160
and to trace the small-scale cloud structure. We detect 95 protoplanetary disks
at 70$\mu$m, 41 at 160$\mu$m, and obtain upper limits for over 130 objects. The
detection fraction at 70$\mu$m depends on the spectral type (88% for K4 or
earlier, 17% for M3 or later stars) and on the disk type ($\sim$50% for full
and pre-transitional disks, $\sim$35% for transitional disks, no
low-excess/depleted disks detected). Non-accreting disks are consistent with
significantly lower masses. Accreting transition and pre-transition disks have
higher 70$\mu$m excesses than full disks, suggestive of more massive, flared
and/or thicker disks. Herschel data also reveal several mini-clusters in Tr37,
small, compact structures containing a few young stars surrounded by
nebulosity. Far-IR data are an excellent probe of the evolution of disks that
are too faint for submillimetre observations. We find a strong link between
far-IR emission and accretion, and between the inner and outer disk structure.
Herschel confirms the dichotomy between accreting and non-accreting transition
disks. Substantial mass depletion and global evolution need to occur to shut
down accretion in a protoplanetary disk, even if the disk has inner holes.
Disks likely follow different evolutionary paths: Low disk masses do not imply
opening inner holes, and having inner holes does not require low disk masses.
The mini-clusters reveal multi-episodic star formation in Tr37. The long
survival of mini-clusters suggest that they formed from the fragmentation of
the same core. Their various morphologies favour different formation/triggering
mechanisms acting within the same cluster. Herschel also unveils what could be
the first heavy mass loss episode of the O6.5 star HD206267.

quite special conditions: low luminosity and preferentially low peak frequency
of the beamed synchrotron emission from the jet; high torus luminosity, close
to that of the accretion disc. This implies that the inferred ratios of torus
to disc luminosity are biased high. The median value, considering upper limits
as detections, is $L_{\rm torus}/L_{\rm disc}\sim 1$ while studies of radio
quiet quasars yield average ratios $\langle L_{\rm torus}/L_{\rm disc}\rangle

sources detected in FIRST and of these 1737 sources also have NVSS

${\rm (S_{\rm int}/S_{\rm peak})^{1/2}}$) as a parameter to infer the presence
of extended radio emission we show that $\geq$ 30$\%$ of FIRST detected sources
possess extended radio structures on scales larger than 1.0 kpc. The use of
low-resolution NVSS observations help us to recover faint extended KSRs that
are resolved out in FIRST observations and results in $\geq$ 42.5$\%$ KSR
sources in FIRST-NVSS subsample. This fraction is only a lower limit owing to
the combination of projection, resolution and sensitivity effects. Our study
demonstrates that KSRs may be more common than previously thought and are found
across all redshifts, luminosities and radio-loudness. The extranuclear radio
luminosity of KSR sources is found to be positively correlated with the core
radio luminosity as well as the [O~III] $\lambda$5007{\AA} line luminosity and
this can be interpreted as KSRs being powered by AGN rather than
star-formation. The distributions of the FIR-to-radio ratios and mid-IR colors
of KSR sources are also consistent with their AGN origin. However, contribution
from star-formation cannot be ruled out particularly in sources with low radio

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in particular, is the magnetization of the outflow.
Here we consider the photospheric emission of Poynting flux dominated outflows,
when the dynamics is mediated by magnetic reconnection. We show that thermal
three-particle processes, responsible for the thermalization of the plasma,
become inefficient at a radius $r_{\rm sup} \sim 10^{9.5}$~cm, far below the
photosphere, at $\sim 10^{11.5}$~cm. Conservation of the total photon number
above $r_{\rm sup}$ combined with Compton scattering below the photosphere
enforces kinetic equilibrium between electrons and photons. This, in turn,
leads to an increase in the observed photon temperature, which reaches $\gtrsim
8$~MeV (observed energy) when decoupling the plasma at the photosphere. This
result is weakly dependent on the free model parameters. We show that in this
case, the expected thermal luminosity is a few \% of the total luminosity, and
could therefore be detected. The predicted peak energy is more than an order of
magnitude higher than the observed peak energy of most GRBs, which puts strong
constraints on the magnetization of these outflows.

time. Based on the Fe-K line strength, X-ray variability, and X-ray power-law
photon indices, and using additional information on the [O III] line emission,
we argue for a jet origin of the observed X-ray emission in these three
sources. We also analyzed five years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) GeV
gamma-ray data on PKS0625-354 and 3C78 to understand these sources within the
blazar picture. We found significant gamma-ray variability in the former
object. Overall, we note that the Suzaku spectra for both PKS0625-354 and 3C78
are rather soft, while the LAT spectra are unusually hard when compared with
other gamma-ray detected low-power (FR I) radio galaxies. We demonstrate that
the constructed broad-band spectral energy distributions of PKS0625-354 and
3C78 are well described by a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-Compton
model. The results of the modeling indicate lower bulk Lorentz factors compared
to those typically found in other BL Lac objects, but consistent with the
values inferred from modeling other LAT-detected FR\,I radio galaxies.
Interestingly, the modeling also implies very high peak ($\sim 10^{16}$ Hz)
synchrotron frequencies in the two analyzed sources, contrary to
previously-suggested scenarios for FR I/BL Lac unification. We discuss the
implications of our findings in the context of the FR I/BL Lac unification
schemes.

to make a negligible contribution to energy dissipation, even allowing for the

{\gamma}-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the
presence of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be
young evolving AGN, they offer a unique opportunity to study the production of
relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Our aim is to estimate by which
processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to
study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties.
We have compiled the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources.
This allowed us to explore correlations between different wavebands and source
properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations and principal
component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet
sources. Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host
relativistic jets that are the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray
emission. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources
do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and infrared
emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical
and X-ray emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that
the black hole mass correlates significantly with radio loudness, which
suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes are more likely to be
able to launch powerful relativistic jets.

experimental results for ITER are not available yet, it is not known beforehand
which Alfv\'en eigenmodes will interact more intensively with the
alpha-particle population. Therefore, the number of modes that need to be
considered in stability assessments becomes quite large and care must be
exercised when choosing the numerical tools to work with, which must be fast
and efficient. In the presented approach, all possible eigenmodes are first
found after intensively scanning a suitable frequency range. Each solution
found is then tested to find if its discretization over the radial grid in use
is adequate. Finally, the interaction between the identified eigenmodes and the
alpha-particle population is evaluated with the drift-kinetic code CASTOR-K, in
order to assess their growth rates and hence their linear stability. The
described approach enables one to single out the most unstable eigenmodes in a
given scenario, which can then be handled with more specialized tools. This
selection capability eases the task of evaluating alpha-particle interactions
with Alfv\'en eigenmodes, either for ITER scenarios or for any other kind of
scenario planning.

views of curved space, it focuses on mainstream cosmology from the expanding
universe about 1930 to the emergence of the standard big bang model in the
1960s. This development includes theories we would not today consider
""mainstream,"" such as the steady state model of the universe. The last section
outlines what might be called the prehistory of the concept of dark energy,
that is, ideas that were discussed before dark energy was actually inferred
from supernovae observations in the late 1990s.

multiple-access networks where physical-layer network coding (PNC) is employed.
In NCMA, a user encodes and spreads its message into multiple packets. Time is
slotted and multiple users transmit packets (one packet each) simultaneously in
each timeslot. A sink node aims to decode the messages of all the users from
the sequence of receptions over successive timeslots. For each timeslot, the
NCMA receiver recovers multiple linear combinations of the packets transmitted
in that timeslot, forming a system of linear equations. Different systems of
linear equations are recovered in different timeslots. A message decoder then
recovers the original messages of all the users by jointly solving multiple
systems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots. We propose a
low-complexity digital fountain approach for this coding problem, where each
source node encodes its message into a sequence of packets using a fountain
code. The aforementioned systems of linear equations recovered by the NCMA
receiver effectively couple these fountain codes together. We refer to the
coupling of the fountain codes as a linearly-coupled (LC) fountain code. The
ordinary belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm for conventional fountain
codes is not optimal for LC fountain codes. We propose a batched BP decoding
algorithm and analyze the convergence of the algorithm for general LC fountain
codes. We demonstrate how to optimize the degree distributions and show by
numerical results that the achievable rate region is nearly optimal. Our
approach significantly reduces the decoding complexity compared with the
previous NCMA schemes based on Reed-Solomon codes and random linear codes, and
hence has the potential to increase throughput and decrease delay in
computation-limited NCMA systems.

microscopic calculations of electronuclear response functions is reviewed. In
the quasielastic peak region the calculations agree with experiment at momentum
transfers up to about 0.4 GeV/c while at higher momentum transfers, in the
region about 0.4 - 1 GeV/c, a disagreement is seen. In view of this, to
calculate the response functions a reference frame was introduced where
dynamics relativistic corrections are small, and the results pertaining to it
were transformed exactly to the laboratory reference frame. This proved to
remove the major part of the disagreement with experiment. All leading order
relativistic corrections to the transition charge operator and to the one--body
part of the transition current operator were taken into account in the
calculations. Furthermore, a particular model to determine the kinematics
inputs of the non-relativistic calculations was suggested. This model provides
the correct relativistic relationship between the reaction final-state energy
and the momenta of the knocked-out nucleon and the residual system. The above
mentioned choice of a reference frame in conjunction with this model has led to
an even better agreement with experiment.

closest to the Arches cluster have similar spectra, ages and masses to known

decrypt their evolution. While these groups of states are stable across many
decades, a sudden reorganization occurs in the last part of the twentieth
century. We think that this kind of quantitative analysis can be possibly
extended to other cultural traits: although databases covering more than one

and other spiral galaxies. The energy source for this turbulence has been much
debated with many possible origins proposed. The universality of turbulence,
its reported large-scale driving, and that it occurs also in starless molecular
clouds, challenges models invoking any stellar source. A more general process
is needed to explain the observations. In this work we study the role of
galactic spiral arms. This is accomplished by means of three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations which follow the dynamical evolution of interstellar
diffuse clouds (100cm-3) interacting with the gravitational potential field of
the spiral pattern. We find that the tidal effects of the arm's potential on
the cloud result in internal vorticity, fragmentation and hydrodynamical
instabilities. The triggered turbulence result in large-scale driving, on sizes
of the ISM inhomogeneities, i.e. as large as 100pc, and efficiencies in
converting potential energy into turbulence in the range 10 to 25 percent per
arm crossing. This efficiency is much higher than those found in previous
models. The statistics of the turbulence in our simulations are strikingly
similar to the observed power spectrum and Larson scaling relations of
molecular clouds and the general ISM. The dependency found from different
models indicate that the ISM turbulence is mainly related to local spiral arm
properties, such as its mass density and width. This correlation seems in
agreement with recent high angular resolution observations of spiral galaxies,
e.g. M51 and M33.

reveal several aspects that are still unclear: the observed X-ray luminosity in
accretion shocks is below the predicted value, and the density versus
temperature structure of the shocked plasma, with increasing densities at
higher temperature, deduced from the observations, is at odds with that
proposed in the current picture of accretion shocks. To address these open
issues we investigate whether a correct treatment of the local absorption by
the surrounding medium is crucial to explain the observations. To this end, we
describe the impact of an accretion stream on a CTTS by considering a
magnetohydrodynamic model. From the model results we synthesize the X-ray
emission from the accretion shock by producing maps and spectra. We perform
density and temperature diagnostics on the synthetic spectra, and we directly
compare the results with the observations. Our model shows that the X-ray
fluxes inferred from the emerging spectra are lower than expected because of
the complex local absorption by the optically thick material of the
chromosphere and of the unperturbed stream. Moreover, our model including the
effects of local absorption explains in a natural way the apparently puzzling
pattern of density versus temperature observed in the X-ray emission from
accretion shocks.

correlation lengths, are believed to cause the large synchrotron emission at
the afterglow phase of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Despite of the recent
theoretical efforts, models have failed to fully explain the amplification of
the magnetic field, particularly in a matter dominated scenario. We revisit the
problem by considering the synchrotron emission to occur at the expanding shock
front of a weakly magnetized relativistic jet over a magnetized surrounding
medium. Analytical estimates and a number of high resolution 2D relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations are provided. Jet opening angles of
$\theta = 0^{\circ} - 20^{\circ}$, and ambient to jet density ratios of
$10^{-4} - 10^2$ were considered. We found that most of the amplification is
due to compression of the ambient magnetic field at the contact discontinuity
between the reverse and forward shocks at the jet head, with substantial
pile-up of the magnetic field lines as the jet propagates sweeping the ambient
field lines. The pile-up is maximum for $\theta \rightarrow 0$, decreasing with
$\theta$, but larger than in the spherical blast problem. Values obtained for
certain models are able to explain the observed intensities. The maximum
correlation lengths found for such strong fields is of $l_{\rm corr} \leq
10^{14}$ cm, $2 - 6$ orders of magnitude larger than the found in previous
works.

Factorization (NMF): choose a suitable rank of the factorization and provide a

two problems using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). At first we extract the
number of main components as the rank, actually this method is inspired from
[1, 2]. Second, we use the singular value and its vectors to initialize NMF
algorithm. In 2008, Boutsidis and Gollopoulos [3] provided the method titled
NNDSVD to enhance initialization of NMF algorithms. They extracted the positive
section and respective singular triplet information of the unit matrices
{C(j)}k j=1 which were obtained from singular vector pairs. This strategy aims
to use positive section to cope with negative elements of the singular vectors,
but in experiments we found that even replacing negative elements by their
absolute values could get better results than NNDSVD. Hence, we give another
method based SVD to fulfil initialization for NMF algorithms (SVD-NMF).

for solving the time dependent nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (NPB) equation for
the electrostatic analysis of solvated biomolecules. In a pseudo-transient
continuation solution of the NPB equation, a long time integration is needed to
reach the steady state. This calls for time stepping schemes that are stable
and accurate for large time increments. The existing alternating direction
implicit (ADI) methods for the NPB equation are known to be conditionally
stable, although being fully implicit. To overcome this difficulty, we propose
several new operator splitting schemes, in both multiplicative and additive
styles, including locally one-dimensional (LOD) schemes and additive operator
splitting (AOS) schemes. The proposed schemes become much more stable than the
ADI methods, and some of them are indeed unconditionally stable in dealing with
solvated proteins with source singularities and non-smooth solutions.
Numerically, the orders of convergence in both space and time are found to be
one. Nevertheless, the precision in calculating the electrostatic free energy
is low, unless a small time increment is used. Further accuracy improvements
are thus considered. After acceleration, the optimized LOD method can produce a
reliable energy estimate by integrating for a small and fixed number of time
steps. Since one only needs to solve a tridiagonal linear system in each
independent one dimensional process, the overall computation is very efficient.
The unconditionally stable LOD method scales linearly with respect to the
number of atoms in the protein studies, and is over 20 times faster than the
conditionally stable ADI methods.

from a pair of close-by jets formed with the anti-$k_t$ jet clustering
algorithm, with radius parameter $R=0.4$. Given the kinematic properties of the
produced Higgs bosons, this Higgs reconstruction approach appears to be more
suitable than the use of large-radius jets that was previously proposed in the

  The highly anticipated transition from next generation sequencing (NGS) to
third generation sequencing (3GS) has been difficult primarily due to high
error rates and excessive sequencing cost. The high error rates make the
assembly of long erroneous reads of large genomes challenging because existing
software solutions are often overwhelmed by error correction tasks. Here we
report a hybrid assembly approach that simultaneously utilizes NGS and 3GS data
to address both issues. We gain advantages from three general and basic design
principles: (i) Compact representation of the long reads lead to efficient
alignments. (ii) Base-level errors can be skipped; structural errors need to be
detected and corrected. (iii) Structurally correct 3GS reads are assembled and
polished. In our implementation, preassembled NGS contigs are used to derive
the compact representation of the long reads, which established an algorithmic
conversion from a de Bruijn graph to an overlap graph, the two major assembly
paradigms. Moreover, since NGS and 3GS data can compensate each other, our
hybrid assembly approach reduces both of their sequencing requirements.
Experiments show that our software is able to assemble mammalian-sized genomes
orders of magnitude more efficiently in time than existing methods, while
saving about half of the sequencing cost.

short-lived ones. Transition disks with an expanding inner cavity can
circularize orbits at larger distances than disks that experience a global
(homologous) decay in surface density. Thus, orbits of remote planets may
reveal the evolutionary history of their primordial gas disks. A remote planet
with an orbital distance ~100 AU from the Sun is plausible and might explain
correlations in the orbital parameters of several distant trans-Neptunian
objects.

transport equations able to advect smooth and discontinuous fields with
high-order accuracy. The numerical scheme is composed of an integration of the
transport equations along the trajectory of material elements in a moving grid
and a reconstruction of the fields in a reference regular mesh using a
non-linear mapping and adaptive moment-preserving interpolations. The
non-linear mapping allows for the arbitrary deformation of material elements.
Additionally, interpolations can represent discontinuous fields using
adaptive-order interpolation near jumps detected with a slope-limiter function.
Due to the large number of operations during the interpolations, a serial
implementation of this scheme is computationally expensive. The scheme has been
accelerated in many-core parallel architectures using a thread per grid node
and parallel data gathers. We present a series of tests that prove the scheme
to be an attractive option for simulating advection equations in

other places but also for interacting with surrounding environment. While
walking on the streets, pedestrians can be aware of attractions like shopping
windows. They can be influenced by the attractions and some of them might shift
their attention towards the attractions, namely switching behavior. As a first
step to incorporate the switching behavior, this study investigates collective
effects of switching behavior for an attraction by developing a behavioral
model. Numerical simulations exhibit different patterns of pedestrian behavior
depending on the strength of the social influence and the average length of
stay. When the social influence is strong along with a long length of stay, a
saturated phase can be defined at which all the pedestrians have visited the
attraction. If the social influence is not strong enough, an unsaturated phase
appears where one can observe that some pedestrians head for the attraction
while others walk in their desired direction. These collective patterns of
pedestrian behavior are summarized in a phase diagram by comparing the number
of pedestrians who visited the attraction to the number of passersby near the
attraction. Measuring the marginal benefits with respect to the strength of the
social influence and the average length of stay enables us to identify under
what conditions enhancing these variables would be more effective. The findings
from this study can be understood in the context of the pedestrian facility
management, for instance, for retail stores.

extreme large, and the black hole horizons disappear, opening a topological
defect of spacetime -- the Kerr singular ring of the Compton size, which may be
interpreted as a closed fundamental string to the low energy string theory. The
singular and twosheeted structure of the corresponding Kerr space has to be
regularized, and we consider the old problem of regular source of the KN
solution. As a development of the earlier Keres-Israel-Hamity-L\'opez model, we
describe the model of smooth and regular source forming a gravitating and
relativistically rotating soliton based on the chiral field model and the Higgs
mechanism of broken symmetry. The model reveals some new remarkable properties:
1) the soliton forms a relativistically rotating bubble of the Compton radius,
which is filled by the oscillating Higgs field in pseudo-vacuum state, 2)
boundary of the bubble forms a domain wall which interpolates between the
internal flat background and the external exact Kerr-Newman (KN) solution, 3)
phase transition is provided by a system of the chiral fields, 4) vector
potential of the external the KN solution forms a closed Wilson loop which is
quantized, giving rise to quantum spin of the soliton. 5) soliton is bordered

we show that the overall tax income data for all these years is in excellent

underground and illegal nature of economic activities of mafia which
significantly contribute to tax evasion. Some hypothesis for the found
conformity is presented.

which in two-dimensional system is equivalent to forces of Hirsch and
Chudnovsky besides constant factors 3 and 3/2 respectively, is a part of
classic Anandan force, and that the spin Hall effect is an anomalous Hall
effect. Furthermore, we develop the method of AC phase to derive the formula
for the spin force, and find that the most basic spin Hall effect originates
from the AC phase and is therefore an intrinsic quantum mechanical property of
spin. This method differs from approach of Berry phase in the study of
anomalous Hall effect, which is the intrinsic property of the perfect crystal.
On the other hand, we use an elegant skill to show that the Chudnovsky-Drude
model is reasonable, and further have improved the theoretical values of spin
Hall conductivity of Chudnovsky. Compared to the theoretical values of spin
Hall conductivity in the Chudnovsky-Drude model, ours are in better agreement

eventually to support software optimizations for energy efficiency. To that
end, we have performed several physical and software-based measurements of
