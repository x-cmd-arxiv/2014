stellar clusters can be developed essentially along the same lines as the
Newtonian theory. We prove that the distribution function can be derived from
any isotropic momentum moment and that every higher-order moment of the
distribution can be written as an integral over a zeroth-order moment.
  We propose a mathematically simple expression for the distribution function
of a family of isotropic general relativistic cluster models and investigate
their dynamical properties. In the Newtonian limit, these models obtain a
distribution function of the form F(E) ~ (E-E_0)^alpha, with E binding energy
and E_0 a constant that determines the model's outer radius. The slope alpha
sets the steepness of the distribution function and the corresponding radial
density and pressure profiles. We show that the field equations only yield
solutions with finite mass for alpha<3.5. Moreover, in the limit alpha->3.5,
only Newtonian models exist. In other words: within the context of this family
of models, no general relativistic version of the Plummer model exists. The
most strongly bound model within the family is characterized by alpha=2.75 and
a central redshift z_c~0.55.

of ohmically heated L-mode plasma discharges is investigated with line-averaged
plasma density ranging from n_e/n_G = 0.15 to 0.42, where n_G is the Greenwald

  All ion saturation current time series that are sampled in the far scrape-off

skewness and excess kurtosis of the time series obey a quadratic relationship
and their histograms coincide partially upon proper normalization. Histograms
of the ion saturation current time series are found to agree well with a
prediction of a stochastic model for the particle density fluctuations in

  The distribution of the waiting times between successive large-amplitude
burst events and of the burst amplitudes are approximately described by
exponential distributions. The average waiting time and burst amplitude are
found to vary weakly with the line-averaged plasma density.
  Conditional averaging reveals that the radial blob velocity, estimated from
floating potential measurements, increases with the normalized burst amplitude
in the outboard mid-plane scrape-off layer. For low density discharges, the
conditionally averaged waveform of the floating potential associated with large
amplitude bursts at the divertor probes has a dipolar shape. In detached
divertor conditions the average waveform is random, indicating electrical
disconnection of blobs from the sheaths at the divertor targets.

The key new idea is that vapor interfaces speed up barrier hopping in two
distinct, but coupled, ways by reducing near surface local caging constraints

velocity distribution function is a long-time puzzle. In this letter based on
the current knowledge of nanoflares we show that the nanoflare-accelerated
electron beams are likely to trigger a strong electron two-stream instability
that generates kinetic Alfv\'en wave and whistler wave turbulence, as we
demonstrated in a previous paper. We further show that the core-halo feature
produced during the origin of kinetic turbulence is likely to originate in the
inner corona and can be preserved as the solar wind escapes to space along open
field lines. We formulate a set of equations to describe the heating processes
observed in the simulation and show that the core-halo temperature ratio of the
solar wind is insensitive to the initial conditions in the corona and is
related to the core-halo density ratio of the solar wind and to the
quasi-saturation property of the two-stream instability at the time when the
exponential decay ends. This relation can be extended to the more general
core-halo-strahl feature in the solar wind. The temperature ratio between the
core and hot components is nearly independent of the heliospheric distance to
the sun. We show that the core-halo relative drift previously reported is a
relic of the fully saturated two stream instability. Our theoretical results
are consistent with the observations while new tests for this model are

established. With the analyzed data, we do not find significant time
variability in any of these sources. The derived spectral index of $\ge 0.1$
for Her~36 SE, the marginal offset of the radio emission with the previous IR
detection and the associated X-ray emission previously reported suggest the
presence of an unresolved interaction region between the strong winds of Her~36

global wind emission of Her~36 flattening its spectral index. On the other
hand, the emission of G5.97-1.17 can be also explained by a mixture of thermal
and non-thermal emission components, with different relative contribution of
both emission mechanisms along the proplyd. We argue that the shock created by
the photo-evaporation flow of the proplyd with the collimated stellar wind of
Her~36 accelerates charged particles in G5.97-1.17 producing considerable
synchrotron emission. On the contrary, an electron density enhancement at the
southwest of G5.97-1.17 makes the thermal emission dominant over this region.

cancelation to remove a successfully decoded PU message in the subsequent PU

systems, yet the extent to which algorithms can benefit from running more
rounds is not well understood. This paper answers this question for a spectrum

Specifically, given any query $Q$ with width $\w$, {\em intersection width}
$\iw$, input size $\mathrm{IN}$, output size $\mathrm{OUT}$, and a cluster of
machines with $M$ memory available per machine, we show that:
  (1) $Q$ can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds with $O(n\frac{(\mathrm{IN}^{\w} +

  (2) $Q$ can be computed in $O(\log(n))$ rounds with
$O(n\frac{(\mathrm{IN}^{\max(\w, 3\iw)} + \mathrm{OUT})^2}{M})$ communication
cost. \end{itemize} Intersection width is a new notion of queries and
generalized hypertree decompositions (GHDs) of queries we introduce to capture
how connected the adjacent cyclic components of the GHDs are.
  We achieve our first result by introducing a distributed and generalized
version of Yannakakis's algorithm, called GYM. GYM takes as input any GHD of
$Q$ with width $\w$ and depth $d$, and computes $Q$ in $O(d + \log(n))$ rounds
and $O(n\frac{(\mathrm{IN}^{\w} + \mathrm{OUT})^2}{M})$ communication cost. We
achieve our second result by showing how to construct GHDs of $Q$ with width

construct GHDs with longer widths and shorter depths, demonstrating a spectrum
of tradeoffs one can make between communication and the number of rounds.

arbitrary time-harmonic wave on a set of N spheres suspended in an inviscid
fluid are theoretically analyzed. In so doing, we utilize the partial-wave
expansion method to solve the related multiple scattering problem. The acoustic
interaction force and torque are computed for a sphere using the farfield
radiation force and torque formulas. To exemplify the method, we calculate the
interaction forces exerted by an external traveling and standing plane wave on
an arrangement of two and three olive-oil droplets in water. The droplets radii
are comparable to the wavelength (i.e. Mie scattering regime). The results show
that the radiation force may considerably deviates from that exerted solely by
the external incident wave. In addition, we find that acoustic interaction
torques arise on the droplets when a nonsymmetric effective incident wave
interacts with the droplets.

spheroidal satellites in the context of finite temperature scalar field dark
mater. In this model the finite temperature allows the scalar field to be in
configurations that possess excited states, a feature that has proved to be
necessary in order to explain the asymptotic rotational velocities found in low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. In this work we show that excited states are
not only important in large galaxies but also have visible effects in dwarf
spheroidals. Additionally, we stress that contrary to previous works where the
scalar field dark matter haloes are consider to be purely Bose-Einstein
condensates, the inclusion of excited states in these halo configurations
provides a consistent framework capable of describing LSBs and dwarf galaxies
of different sizes without arriving to contradictions within the scalar field
dark matter model. Using this new framework we find that the addition of
excited states accounts very well for the raise in the velocity dispersion in
Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies improving the fit compared to the one
obtained assuming all the DM to be in the form of a Bose Einstein Condensate.

by the initial offset of the centre of the ring from the axis of the vortex. We
find that a strong asymmetry exists in the scattering of a ring as a function

summation to find the dispersion relation of guided plasmonic and bianisotropic
modes in metasurfaces composed of 2D periodic lattices of arbitrarily strongly
scattering magneto-electric dipole scatterers. This method takes into account
all retarded electrodynamic interactions as well as radiation damping
selfconsistently. As illustration we analyze the dispersion of plasmon nanorod
lattices, and of 2D split ring resonator lattices. Plasmon nanorod lattices
support transverse and longitudinal in-plane electric modes. Scatterers that
have an in-plane electric and out-of-plane magnetic polarizability, but without
intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling, result in two bands that are mixtures of
the bands of electric-only and magnetic-only lattices. Thereby bianisotropy
through mutual coupling, in absence of building-block bianisotropy, is evident.
Once strong bi-anisotropy is included in each building block, the Bloch modes
become even more strongly magnetoelectric. Our results are important to
understand spatial dispersion and bianisotropy of metasurface and metamaterial
designs.

the level of two or three atoms. This model system enables a microscopic and

changes can propagate among coupled systems. Examples include the
synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems,
markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in
confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A
number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria
separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behavior in its normal
form as fast--slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system
consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or
patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such
as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node
bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g., trade
couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves
the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which
sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they
can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades.
For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the
model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data
to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to
estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to
spread locally, they also seem to ""hop"" over countries, like in the stylized
model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal
network datasets.

established that the average number of interatomic bonds destroyed within one

low-cycle fatigue is characterized by $\sigma >\sigma_{0.2}$ and $\sigma_{1cs}>
1$, high-cycle fatigue -- by $\sigma = \sigma_{0.2}$ and $\nabla_{1cs} = 1$,
and giga-cycle fatigue -- by $\sigma < \sigma_{0.2}$ and $\nabla_{1cs} < 1$. An
individual interatomic bond cannot be destroyed part by part but as a single
unit. The latter means that in giga-cycle fatigue a single interatomic bond is
destroyed within several cycles rather than within a single cycle. The factors
$F$ (collapsibility) and $R$ (resistibility) were proposed and mentioned as
essential material physical constants. The introduced notion $\nabla_{1cs}$ and
the established linear nature of $\nabla_{1cs}$ relationship allow to: a)
clarify the fatigue crack growth physical nature in low-, high- and giga-cycle

the air gap increases, as the value of the resistor increases. It is also
determined that the peak voltage value of the fully charged air gap decreases

inclinations of 2.0 +4.0-2.0 degrees. This range includes the Solar System in
its coplanarity and multiplicity. However, similar to studies of Kepler
exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of
singly-transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a
single population of multi-planet systems: a finding that cannot be attributed
to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we
adopt a mixture model and find that 55 +23-12% of planetary systems are either

find that the so-called ""Kepler dichotomy"" holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs

new three-dimensional hydrodynamics code that harnesses the power of graphics

the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques,
including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) algorithm, a variety of
exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction
techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla
evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can
update over ten million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann
solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively-parallel architecture of
GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with
physically interesting grid resolutions (> 256^3) can easily be computed on a
single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend
calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond
64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our
modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to
simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar
medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its
density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud
with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the
existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the
system in terms of its median gas density.

migrate inwards, vortices are very effective in collecting them. When dust
density becomes comparable to gas density within the vortex, a dynamical
instability is excited and it alters the coherent vorticity pattern and
destroys the vortex. This dust feedback effect is stronger with higher initial
dust/gas density ratio and larger dust grain. Consequently, we found that the
disk vortex lifetime can be reduced up to a factor of 10. We discuss the

black hole is accreting material, is nowadays accepted to be rather ubiquitous
and most probably a phase of every galaxy's evolution. It has been suggested
that galactic mergers and interactions may be the culprits behind the
triggering of nuclear activity. We use near-infrared data from the new Infrared
Medium-Deep Survey (IMS) and the Deep eXtragalactic Survey (DXS) of the
VIMOS-SA22 field and radio data at 1.4 GHz from the FIRST survey and a deep VLA
survey to study the environments of radio-AGN over an area of ~25 sq. degrees
and down to a radio flux limit of 0.1 mJy and a J-band magnitude of 23 mag AB.
Radio-AGN are predominantly found in environments similar to those of control
galaxies at similar redshift, J-band magnitude, and U-R rest-frame absolute
color. However, a sub-population of radio-AGN is found in environments up to
100 times denser than their control sources. We thus preclude merging as the
dominant triggering mechanism of radio-AGN. Through the fitting of the
broadband spectral energy distribution of radio-AGN in the least and most dense
environments, we find that those in the least dense environments show higher
radio-loudness, higher star formation efficiencies, and higher accretion rates,
typical of the so-called high-excitation radio-AGN. These differences tend to
disappear at z>1. We interpret our results in terms of a different triggering
mechanism for these sources that is driven by mass-loss through winds of young
stars created during the observed ongoing star formation.

appear at a strongly interacting surface of a three-dimensional electronic
topological insulator. Composite Dirac liquids exhibit a gap to all charge
excitations but nevertheless feature a single massless Dirac cone built from
emergent electrically neutral fermions. These states thus comprise electrical
insulators that, interestingly, retain thermal properties similar to those of
the non-interacting topological insulator surface. A variety of novel fully
gapped phases naturally descend from composite Dirac liquids. Most remarkably,
we show that gapping the neutral fermions via Cooper pairing---which crucially
does not violate charge conservation---yields symmetric non-Abelian
topologically ordered surface phases captured in several recent works. Other
(Abelian) topological orders emerge upon alternatively gapping the neutral
Dirac cone with magnetism. We establish a hierarchical relationship between
these descendant phases and expose an appealing connection to paired states of
composite Fermi liquids arising in the half-filled Landau level of
two-dimensional electron gases. To controllably access these states we exploit
a quasi-1D deformation of the original electronic Dirac cone that enables us to
analytically address the fate of the strongly interacting surface. The
algorithm we develop applies quite broadly and further allows the construction
of symmetric surface topological orders for recently introduced bosonic
topological insulators.

technical sophistication and advancement, previous work showed that black-box
scanners miss a non-negligible portion of vulnerabilities, and report
non-existing, non-exploitable or uninteresting vulnerabilities. Unfortunately,
these results hold true even for XSS vulnerabilities, which are relatively
simple to trigger if compared, for instance, to logic flaws.
  Black-box scanners have not been studied in depth on this vertical: knowing
precisely how scanners try to detect XSS can provide useful insights to
understand their limitations, to design better detection methods. In this
paper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on
6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted
in coordination with the respective vendors. To this end, we developed an
automated tool to (1) extract the payloads used by each scanner, (2) distill

to quality indicators, and (4) perform a cross-scanner analysis. Unlike
previous work, our testbed application, which contains a large set of XSS
vulnerabilities, including DOM XSS, was gradually retrofitted to accomodate for
the payloads that triggered no vulnerabilities.
  Our analysis reveals a highly fragmented scenario. Scanners exhibit a wide
variety of distinct payloads, a non-uniform approach to fuzzing and mutating
the payloads, and a very diverse detection effectiveness.

for simultaneously discovering group and within-group sparse patterns by using
a combination of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms. However, in large-scale
applications, the complexity of the regularizers entails great computational
challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Layer Feature REduction
method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The
two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the
inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the
sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing
feature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one
sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one
that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers.
Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with
any existing solvers. We also develop a screening method---called DPC
(DecomPosition of Convex set)---for the nonnegative Lasso problem. Experiments
on both synthetic and real data sets show that TLFre and DPC improve the
efficiency of SGL and nonnegative Lasso by several orders of magnitude.

the effective field theory reproduces the known three symmetries: time
reversal, bond-centered inversion, and dihedral group of spin rotations. It
also predicts that there exists another symmetry: site-centered inversion

the phase transitions among VBS phases in microscopic models and an extension
of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to non-translational-invariant systems.

heating the solar chromosphere and corona as well as in accelerating the solar

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for processes where there are energetic, nearly

SCET has found many applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, especially
in recent years the physics of hadronic jets in $e^+e^-$, lepton-hadron,
hadron-hadron, and heavy-ion collisions. SCET can be used to factorize
multi-scale cross sections in these processes into single-scale hard,
collinear, and soft functions, and to evolve these through the renormalization
group to resum large logarithms of ratios of the scales that appear in the QCD
perturbative expansion, as well as to study properties of nonperturbative

(EH) devices to enable long-term, autonomous operation, thus requiring
intelligent energy management to limit the adverse impact of energy outages.
This work considers a network of EH wireless sensors, which report packets with
a random utility value to a fusion center (FC) over a shared wireless channel.
Decentralized access schemes are designed, where each node performs a local
decision to transmit/discard a packet, based on an estimate of the packet's
utility, its own energy level, and the scenario state of the EH process, with
the objective to maximize the average long-term aggregate utility of the
packets received at the FC. Due to the non-convex structure of the problem, an
approximate optimization is developed by resorting to a mathematical artifice
based on a game theoretic formulation of the multiaccess scheme, where the
nodes do not behave strategically, but rather attempt to maximize a
\emph{common} network utility with respect to their own policy. The symmetric
Nash equilibrium (SNE) is characterized, where all nodes employ the same
policy; its uniqueness is proved, and it is shown to be a local maximum of the
original problem. An algorithm to compute the SNE is presented, and a heuristic
scheme is proposed, which is optimal for large battery capacity. It is shown
numerically that the SNE typically achieves near-optimal performance, within 3%
of the optimal policy, at a fraction of the complexity, and two operational
regimes of EH-networks are identified and analyzed: an energy-limited scenario,
where energy is scarce and the channel is under-utilized, and a network-limited
scenario, where energy is abundant and the shared wireless channel represents
the bottleneck of the system.

that formal numerical convergence is possible in SPH only in the joint limit $N

$N$ is the total number of particles, $h$ is the smoothing length, and $N_{nb}$
is the number of neighbor particles within the smoothing volume used to compute
smoothed estimates. Previous work has generally assumed that the conditions $N
\rightarrow \infty$ and $h \rightarrow 0$ are sufficient to achieve
convergence, while holding $N_{nb}$ fixed. We demonstrate that if $N_{nb}$ is
held fixed as the resolution is increased, there will be a residual source of
error that does not vanish as $N \rightarrow \infty$ and $h \rightarrow 0$.
Formal numerical convergence in SPH is possible only if $N_{nb}$ is increased
systematically as the resolution is improved. Using analytic arguments, we
derive an optimal compromise scaling for $N_{nb}$ by requiring that this source
of error balance that present in the smoothing procedure. For typical choices
of the smoothing kernel, we find $N_{nb} \propto N^{1/2}$. This means that if
SPH is to be used as a numerically convergent method, the required
computational cost does not scale with particle number as $O(N)$, but rather as
$O(N^{1+\delta})$, where $\delta \approx 1/2$, with a weak dependence on the
form of the smoothing kernel.

deriving pure spin models when molecules are pinned in a deep optical lattice,

convergence to zero at a speed faster than any polynomial but not exponentially

individual bus optimization variables are iteratively updated through simple
local computations and information is exchanged with neighboring entities. In
particular, the update for a specific bus consists of a term which takes into
account the coupling between the neighboring Lagrange multiplier variables and
a local innovation term that enforces the demand/supply balance. The buses
exchange information on the current update of their multipliers and the bus
angle with their neighboring buses. An analytical proof is given that the
proposed method converges to the optimal solution of the DC-OPF. Also, the
performance is evaluated using the IEEE Reliability Test System as a test case.

pattern could arise from a connection between stellar rotation rate and radius
inflation on the pre-MS. We demonstrate that pre-MS radius inflation can
efficiently suppress lithium destruction by rotationally induced mixing in
evolutionary models, and that the net effect of inflation and rotational mixing
is a pattern where rotation correlates with lithium abundance for $M_{*} < {\rm
M}_{\odot}$, and anti-correlates with lithium abundance for $M_{*} > {\rm

different prescriptions for the dependence of inflation on rotation, and
compare their predictions to the Pleiades lithium/rotation pattern. We find
that if a connection between rotation and radius inflation exists, then the
important qualitative features of this pattern naturally and generically emerge
in our models. This is the first consistent physical model to date that
explains the Li--rotation correlation in the Pleiades. We discuss plausible

capacity of the binary symmetric channel (for sufficiently large dv and dc)
under exponential time decoding. However, polynomial time algorithms are only
known to correct a much smaller fraction of errors. One of the most powerful
polynomial-time algorithms with a formal analysis is the LP decoding algorithm
of Feldman et al. which is known to correct an Omega(1/dc) fraction of errors.
In this work, we show that fairly powerful extensions of LP decoding, based on
the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies, fail to correct much more errors
than the basic LP-decoder. In particular, we show that:
  1) For any values of dv and dc, a linear number of rounds of the
Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy cannot correct more than an O(1/dc) fraction of
errors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code.
  2) For any value of dv and infinitely many values of dc, a linear number of
rounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy cannot correct more than an O(1/dc)
fraction of errors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code.
  Our proofs use a new stretching and collapsing technique that allows us to
leverage recent progress in the study of the limitations of LP/SDP hierarchies
for Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Max-CSPs). The problem then
reduces to the construction of special balanced pairwise independent
distributions for Sherali-Adams and special cosets of balanced pairwise
independent subgroups for Lasserre.
  Some of our techniques are more generally applicable to a large class of
Boolean CSPs called Min-Ones. In particular, for k-Hypergraph Vertex Cover, we
obtain an improved integrality gap of $k-1-\epsilon$ that holds after a
\emph{linear} number of rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy, for any k = q+1 with
q an arbitrary prime power. The best previous gap for a linear number of rounds
was equal to $2-\epsilon$ and due to Schoenebeck.

clinically relevant summary measure. With observational data, there may be
imbalances in confounding variables between the two groups. One approach to
account for such imbalances is to estimate a covariate-adjusted restricted mean
difference by modeling the covariate-adjusted survival distribution and then
marginalizing over the covariate distribution. We demonstrate that the
mean-squared error of the restricted mean difference is bounded by the
mean-squared error of the covariate-adjusted survival distribution estimators.
This implies that a better estimator of the covariate-adjusted survival
distributions is associated with a better estimator of the restricted mean
difference. Thus, this paper proposes estimating restricted mean differences
with stacked survival models. Stacked survival models estimate a weighted
average of several survival models by minimizing predicted error. By including
a range of parametric and semi-parametric models, stacked survival models can
effectively estimate a covariate-adjusted survival distribution and, therefore,
the restricted mean treatment effect in a wide range of scenarios. We
demonstrate through a simulation study that the new estimator can perform
nearly as well as Cox regression when the proportional hazards assumption is
satisfied and significantly better when proportional hazards is violated. The
proposed estimator is also illustrated with data from the United Network for
Organ Sharing to evaluate post-lung transplant survival between large and

system between tiny devices is still an open problem. At the same time, despite
the prevalence of radio communication, there are still areas where traditional
electromagnetic waves find it difficult or expensive to reach. Points of
interest in industry, cities, and medical applications often lie in embedded

conventional radio waves and microwaves, or they are located in such a way that
directional high frequency systems are ineffective. Inspired by nature, one
solution to these problems is molecular communication (MC), where chemical
signals are used to transfer information. Although biologists have studied MC
for decades, it has only been researched for roughly 10 year from a
communication engineering lens. Significant number of papers have been
published to date, but owing to the need for interdisciplinary work, much of
the results are preliminary. In this paper, the recent advancements in the

the radiative transport problem into a raytracing step and a diffusion step.
The raytracer captures the first absorption event, as stars irradiate their

accuracy of our method through a variety of benchmark tests including the
irradiation of a static disk, subcritical and supercritical radiative shocks,

of reconnection of the braids, making a microflare or larger subflare. In
contrast to this internal triggering of subflares, we observe external
triggering of subflares in a braided coronal magnetic field observed by the
{\it High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C)}. We track the development of these
subflares using 12 s cadence images acquired by {\it SDO}/AIA in 1600, 193, 94
\AA, and registered magnetograms of {\it SDO}/HMI, over four hours centered on
the {\it Hi-C} observing time. These data show numerous recurring small-scale
brightenings in transition-region emission happening on polarity inversion
lines where flux cancellation is occurring. We present in detail an example of
an apparent burst of reconnection of two loops in the transition region under
the braided coronal field, appropriate for releasing a short reconnected loop
downward and a longer reconnected loop upward. The short loop presumably
submerges into the photosphere, participating in observed flux cancellation. A
subflare in the overlying braided magnetic field is apparently triggered by the
disturbance of the braided field by the reconnection-released upward loop. At
least 10 subflares observed in this braided structure appear to be triggered
this way. How common this external trigger mechanism for coronal subflares is
in other active regions, and how important it is for coronal heating in
general, remain to be seen.

physical properties of closely orbiting planets with the potential for severe
mass loss. In particular, the Lyman-alpha emission line at 1216 Angstroms,
which dominates the far-ultraviolet spectrum, is a major source of
photodissociation of important atmospheric molecules such as water and methane.
The intrinsic flux of Lyman-alpha, however, cannot be directly measured due to
the absorption of neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium and contamination
by geocoronal emission. To date, reconstruction of the intrinsic Lyman-alpha
line based on Hubble Space Telescope spectra has been accomplished for 46 FGKM
nearby stars, 28 of which have also been observed by the Galaxy Evolution
Explorer (GALEX). Our investigation provides a correlation between published
intrinsic Lyman-alpha and GALEX far- and near-ultraviolet chromospheric fluxes
for K and M stars. The negative correlations between the ratio of the
Lyman-alpha to the GALEX fluxes reveal how the relative strength of Lyman-alpha
compared to the broadband fluxes weakens as the FUV and NUV excess flux
increase. We also correlate GALEX fluxes with the strong near-ultraviolet Mg II
h+k spectral emission lines formed at lower chromospheric temperatures than
Lyman-alpha. The reported correlations provide estimates of intrinsic
Lyman-alpha and Mg II fluxes for the thousands of K and M stars in the archived
GALEX all-sky surveys. These will constrain new stellar upper-atmosphere models
for cool stars and provide realistic inputs to models describing exoplanetary
photochemistry and atmospheric evolution in the absence of ultraviolet

technique in reducing near-duplicates in Web page and image search results, and
has also proven useful in file system synchronization, compression and learning
applications.
  Min-wise sampling can be used to derive an unbiased estimator for Jaccard
similarity and taking a few hundred independent consistent samples leads to
compact sketches which provide good estimates of pairwise-similarity.
Subsequent works extended this technique to weighted sets and show how to
produce samples with only a constant number of hash evaluations for any
element, independent of its weight. Another improvement by Li et al. shows how
to speedup sketch computations by computing many (near-)independent samples in
one shot. Unfortunately this latter improvement works only for the unweighted
case.
  In this paper we give a simple, fast and accurate procedure which reduces
weighted sets to unweighted sets with small impact on the Jaccard similarity.
This leads to compact sketches consisting of many (near-)independent weighted
samples which can be computed with just a small constant number of hash
function evaluations per weighted element. The size of the produced unweighted
set is furthermore a tunable parameter which enables us to run the unweighted
scheme of Li et al. in the regime where it is most efficient. Even when the
sets involved are unweighted, our approach gives a simple solution to the
densification problem that other works attempted to address.
  Unlike previously known schemes, ours does not result in an unbiased
estimator. However, we prove that the bias introduced by our reduction is
negligible and that the standard deviation is comparable to the unweighted
case. We also empirically evaluate our scheme and show that it gives
significant gains in computational efficiency, without any measurable loss in
accuracy.

strength and by the external magnetic field. To validate the theory,
spectrally-resolved electroluminescence experiments on BPhen/m-MTDATA devices
are analyzed. With increasing emission wavelength, the width of the magnetic
field modulation curve of the electroluminescence increases while its depth
decreases. These observations are consistent with the model. Finally, the
analytical theory is extended to account for an additional low-field structure
due to the exchange interaction in the weakly bound polaron-pair states.

collapse of cold uniform spherical system. The central interest is on how the
deviation from spherical symmetry depends on particle number $N$. By revisit of
the spherical collapse model, we hypothesize that the departure from spherical
symmetry is regulated by the finite-$N$ density fluctuation. Following this
assumption, the estimate of the flattening of relaxed structures is derived to
be $N^{-1/3}$. In numerical part, we find that the virialized states can be
characterized by the core-halo structures and the flattenings of the cores fit
reasonably well with the prediction. Moreover the results from large $N$
systems suggest the divergence of relaxation time to the final shapes with
$N$.We also find that the intrinsic shapes of the cores are considerably
diverse as they vary from nearly spherical, prolate, oblate or completely
triaxial in each realization. When $N$ increases, this variation is suppressed
as the final shapes do not differ much from initial symmetry. In addition, we
observe the stable rotation of the virialized states. Further investigation
reveals that the origin of this rotation is related in some way to the initial
density fluctuation.

Based on the idea of sphere decoding, we propose a highly efficient algorithm

to transform the original quadratic form optimization problem into a shortest
vector problem (SVP) using the Cholesky factorization. Instead of computing the
Cholesky factor explicitly, the proposed algorithm realizes the Cholesky
factorization with only $\bigO(n)$ flops by taking advantage of the structure
of the Gram matrix in the quadratic form. Then, we propose some conditions that
can be checked with $\bigO(n)$ flops, under which a unit vector is the optimal
coefficient vector. Finally, by taking into account some useful properties of
the optimal coefficient vector, we modify the Schnorr-Euchner search algorithm
to solve the SVP. We show that the estimated average complexity of our new
algorithm is $\bigO(n^{1.5}P^{0.5})$ flops for i.i.d. Gaussian channel entries
with SNR $P$ based on the Gaussian heuristic. Simulations show that our
algorithm is not only much more efficient than the existing ones that give the
optimal solution, but also faster than some best known suboptimal methods.
Besides, we show that our algorithm can be readily adapted to output a list of
$L$ best candidate vectors for use in the compute-and-forward design. The

$\bigO\left(n^{1.5}P^{0.5}\log L + nL\right)$ flops for i.i.d. Gaussian channel

arise from the statistical analysis of scientific data. To detect components
with different values between two mean vectors, a well-known procedure is to
apply the Benjamini and Hochberg (B-H) method and two-sample {\em Student}'s
$t$ statistics to control the false discovery rate (FDR). In many applications,
mean vectors are expected to be sparse or asymptotically sparse. When dealing
with such type of data, {\em can we gain more power than the standard procedure
such as the B-H method with Student's $t$ statistics while keeping the FDR
under control?} The answer is positive. By exploiting the possible sparsity
information in mean vectors, we present an uncorrelated screening-based (US)
FDR control procedure, which is shown to be more powerful than the B-H method.
The US testing procedure depends on a novel construction of screening
statistics, which are asymptotically uncorrelated with two-sample {\em
Student}'s $t$ statistics. The US testing procedure is different from some
existing {\em testing following screening} methods (Reiner, et al., 2007;
Yekutieli, 2008) in which independence between screening and testing is crucial
to control the FDR, while the independence often requires additional data or
splitting of samples. An inappropriate splitting of samples may result in a
loss rather than an improvement of statistical power. Instead, the uncorrelated
screening US is based on the original data and does not need to split the
samples. Theoretical results show that the US testing procedure controls the
desired FDR asymptotically.
  Numerical studies are conducted and indicate that the proposed procedure
works quite well.

changes in brightness (1-2%) and occasional flare bursts (4-8%) with a 0.8%
duty cycle, and order-of-magnitude variations in H$\alpha$ line strength.
Combined, these observations reveal WISE J0720-0846 to be an old, very low-mass
binary whose components straddle the hydrogen burning minimum mass, and whose
primary is a relatively rapid rotator and magnetically active. It is one of
only two known binaries among late M dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun, both
harboring a mid T-type brown dwarf companion. While this specific configuration
is rare (1.4% probability), roughly 25% of binary companions to late-type M
dwarfs in the local population are likely low-temperature T or Y brown dwarfs.

on the effect of additional paths. The problem is akin to that in traffic
networks where an extra route, surprisingly, can increase the overall travel

of such a paradox in suitably chosen reaction networks, where extra reaction
step(s) can inflate the total concentration, denoted as `load', at steady

qualitatively similar pattern in networks of varying complexities. We then
explore how such extra routes affect the load in a biochemical scheme of uric

class is hyperbolic. Regarding the notion of structural stability, there is a
subtle difference between the case of a whole system and the case of an

difficulties. In this paper we prove a result of this type for the later case,

diffeomorphism of a closed manifold $M$ and $p$ be a hyperbolic periodic point

structurally stable then it is hyperbolic. Since the chain class of $p$ is not

in this paper to a curvilinear coordinate system, which reflects the shape of
the DPF current sheath. Locally-unidirectional shock propagation in this
coordinate system enables construction of a system of 7 one-dimensional
hyperbolic conservation law equations with geometric source terms, taking into
account all the components of magnetic field and flow velocity.
Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for this system lead to expressions for the
axial magnetic field and three components of fluid velocity having high ion
kinetic energy.

qubit polarization due to dynamics of the nuclear spin bath induced by complex

determined by three rather than two basic stages. The additional stage
corresponds to the effect of coherent dephasing processes that occur in the

avoid the need for conducting quantum non-demolition measurement otherwise

of certain level of communication service almost 100 % of the time. Example URC
applications include reliable cloud connectivity, critical connections for
industrial automation and reliable wireless coordination among vehicles. This
paper puts forward a systematic view on URC in 5G wireless systems. It starts
by analyzing the fundamental mechanisms that constitute a wireless connection
and concludes that one of the key steps towards enabling URC is revision of the
methods for encoding control information (metadata) and data. It introduces the
key concept of Reliable Service Composition, where a service is designed to
adapt its requirements to the level of reliability that can be attained. The
problem of URC is analyzed across two different dimensions. The first dimension
is the type of URC problem that is defined based on the time frame used to
measure the reliability of the packet transmission. Two types of URC problems
are identified: long-term URC (URC-L) and short-term URC (URC-S). The second
dimension is represented by the type of reliability impairment that can affect
the communication reliability in a given scenario. The main objective of this
paper is to create the context for defining and solving the new engineering
problems posed by URC in 5G.

into a disc, we study the formation and properties of nuclear discs. Gas,
driven to the centre by a bar, settles into a rotating star-forming nuclear
disc (ND). This ND is thinner, younger, kinematically cooler, and more
metal-rich than the surrounding bar. The ND is elliptical and orthogonal to the
bar. The complex kinematics in the region of the ND are a result of the
superposition of older stars streaming along the bar and younger stars
circulating within the ND. The signature of the ND is therefore subtle in the
kinematics. Instead the ND stands out clearly in metallicity and age maps. We
compare the model to the density and kinematics of real galaxies with NDs
finding qualitative similarities. Our results suggest that gas dissipation is
very important for forming nuclear structures.

in progress. We carefully examine and discuss all sources of bias (saturation,
confusion, different sensitivities, extinction). NGC6357 hosts three large
young stellar clusters, of which Pismis24 is the most prominent. We found that
Pismis24 is a very young (~1-3 Myr) OC with a Salpeter-like IMF and a few
thousand members. A comparison between optical and IR photometry indicates that
the fraction of members with a NIR excess (i. e., with a circumstellar disk) is
in the range 0.3-0.6, consistent with its photometrically derived age. We also
find that Pismis24 is likely subdivided into a few different sub-clusters, one
of which contains almost all the massive members. There are indications of
current star formation triggered by these massive stars, but clear age trends
could not be derived (although the fraction of stars with a NIR excess does
increase towards the HII region associated with the cluster). The gas out of
which Pismis24 formed must have been distributed in dense clumps within a cloud
of less dense gas ~1 pc in radius. Our findings provide some new insight into
how young stellar populations and massive stars emerge, and evolve in the first
few Myr after birth, from a giant molecular cloud complex.

in a large number of characters making the task of classification difficult.
Character segmentation plays a significant role in reducing the number of
classes. Explicit segmentation techniques suffer when overlapping shapes are
present, which is common in the case of handwritten text. We use HMMs to take
advantage of the agglutinative nature of Kannada script, which allows us to
perform implicit segmentation of characters along with recognition. All the
experiments are performed on the Chars74k dataset that consists of 657
handwritten characters collected across multiple users. Gradient-based features
are extracted from individual characters and are used to train character HMMs.
The use of implicit segmentation technique at the character level resulted in
an improvement of around 10%. This system also outperformed an existing system

showed that increasing the training data could result in better accuracy.
Accordingly, we collected additional data and obtained an improvement of 4%

source is a point source, which applies when the star is very far away from the

consider the alignment in circumstellar medium, binary systems, disc, and Local
Interstellar Medium (LISM). For the radiation fields with unidentified pumping
sources, we apply the method of multipole expansion and discuss the GSA induced

adequate to consider the contribution from dipole and quadrupole radiation

coincides with the projection of magnetic field in the 2D sky with 90 degree
degeneracy. We conclude that the GSA is a unique tool to detect the direction
of weak magnetic field, and it can be applied to diffuse media in any radiation

sequences which addresses the challenge of detecting and contextualizing
anomalies in labelled, streaming graph data. We introduce a generalization of
the BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility to community
structure, and use this model to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection.
Specifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built by
aggregating probabilities at finer levels, and these closely related
hierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations from expectation. This
technique provides insight into a graph's structure and internal context that
may shed light on a detected event. Additionally, this multi-scale analysis
facilitates intuitive visualizations by allowing users to narrow focus from an
anomalous graph to particular subgraphs or nodes causing the anomaly.
  For evaluation, two hierarchical anomaly detectors are tested against a
baseline Gaussian method on a series of sampled graphs. We demonstrate that our
graph statistics-based approach outperforms both a distribution-based detector
and the baseline in a labeled setting with community structure, and it
accurately detects anomalies in synthetic and real-world datasets at the node,
subgraph, and graph levels. To illustrate the accessibility of information made
possible via this technique, the anomaly detector and an associated interactive
visualization tool are tested on NCAA football data, where teams and
conferences that moved within the league are identified with perfect recall,
and precision greater than 0.786.

regularized by the CSM, many-body resonances can be obtained by solving an
eigenvalue problem with the $L^2$ basis functions. Applying this method to a
system consisting of a core and valence nucleons, we investigate many-body
resonant states in weakly bound nuclei very far from the stability lines.

Particle tracing simulations are performed to investigate the effects of
disorder-induced heating after ionization in a large electric field. They lead
to a constraint on this electric field strength which is used as input for an
analytical model which predicts the minimum attainable spot size as a function
of amongst others the flux density of the atomic beam, the temperature of this
beam and the total current. At low currents (I<10 pA) the spot size will be
limited by a combination of spherical aberration and brightness, while at
higher currents this is a combination of chromatic aberration and brightness.
It is expected that a nanometer size spot is possible at a current of 1 pA. The
analytical model was verified with particle tracing simulations of a complete
focused ion beam setup. A genetic algorithm was used to find the optimum
acceleration electric field as a function of the current. At low currents the
result agrees well with the analytical model while at higher currents the spot
sizes found are even lower due to effects that are not taken into account in
the analytical model.

local---in each round, a node only considers its role and that of its neighbors
in the tree, with no further information propagation (in particular, no wave
mechanisms). Second, whatever the rate and scale of the changes, the algorithm
guarantees that, by the end of every round, the network is covered by a forest
of spanning trees in which 1) no cycle occur, 2) every node belongs to exactly
one tree, and 3) every tree contains exactly one root (or token). We primarily
focus on the correctness of this algorithm, which is established rigorously.
While performance is not the main focus, we suggest new complexity metrics for
such problems, and report on preliminary experimentation results validating our
algorithm in a practical scenario.

  Pulsation Cycle","Accepted for publication on MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2044",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stellar parameters of RR Lyrae stars vary considerably over a pulsation
cycle, and their determination is crucial for stellar modelling. We present a
detailed spectroscopic analysis of the pulsating star RR Lyr, the prototype of
its class, over a complete pulsation cycle, based on high-resolution spectra
collected at the 2.7-m telescope of McDonald Observatory. We used simultaneous
photometry to determine the accurate pulsation phase of each spectrum and
determined the effective temperature, the shape of the depth-dependent
microturbulent velocity, and the abundance of several elements, for each phase.
The surface gravity was fixed to 2.4. Element abundances resulting from our
analysis are stable over the pulsation cycle. However, a variation in
ionisation equilibrium is observed around minimum radius. We attribute this
mostly to a dynamical acceleration contributing to the surface gravity.
Variable turbulent convection on time scales longer than the pulsation cycle
has been proposed as a cause for the Blazhko effect. We test this hypothesis to
some extent by using the derived variable depth-dependent microturbulent
velocity profiles to estimate their effect on the stellar magnitude. These
effects turn out to be wavelength-dependent and much smaller than the observed
light variations over the Blazhko cycle: if variations in the turbulent motions
are entirely responsible for the Blazhko effect, they must surpass the scales
covered by the microturbulent velocity. This work demonstrates the possibility
of a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis over an entire pulsation cycle
using static atmosphere models, provided one takes into account certain
features of a rapidly pulsating atmosphere.

data and asks how, given a risk measurement procedure, we can tell whether the
answers it produces are `correct'. We draw the distinction between `external'
and `internal' risk measures and concentrate on the latter, where we observe
data in real time, make predictions and observe outcomes. It is argued that
evaluation of such procedures is best addressed from the point of view of
probability forecasting or Dawid's theory of `prequential statistics' [Dawid,
JRSS(A)1984]. We introduce a concept of `calibration' of a risk measure in a
dynamic setting, following the precepts of Dawid's weak and strong prequential
principles, and examine its application to quantile forecasting (VaR -- value
at risk) and to mean estimation (applicable to CVaR -- expected shortfall). The
relationship between these ideas and `elicitability' [Gneiting, JASA 2011] is
examined. We show in particular that VaR has special properties not shared by
any other risk measure. Turning to CVaR we argue that its main deficiency is
the unquantifiable tail dependence of estimators. In a final section we show
that a simple data-driven feedback algorithm can produce VaR estimates on
financial data that easily pass both the consistency test and a further
newly-introduced statistical test for independence of a binary sequence.

two-levels systems the crossover temperature shows a smooth decrease with an
applied magnetic field characterized by an external flux $\Phi$. Beyond that we
predict a narrow peak in the dependence of $T_{cr}(\Phi)$ occurring in the
intermediate range of $\Phi$. The effect becomes more pronounced as the
junction size increases. We explain this effect quantitatively by a strong
resonant suppression of a potential barrier for the Josephson phase escape that
is due to the coherent quantum Rabi oscillations in two-level systems present

measures correlation between a set of ranked lists. Multivariate Spearman's
\rho is defined using copulas, and we show that the geometric mean of
normalised ranks maximises multivariate correlation. Motivated by this, we
propose a weighted geometric mean approach for learning to rank which has a
closed form least squares solution. When only the best or worst elements of a

and Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them
produces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on
their inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the
maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to
share an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs.
  The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of
$G$ where Alice and Bob receive all the inputs at the same time and must
produce all the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each
instance of $G$. Recently, there has been a series of works showing parallel
repetition with exponential decay for projection games [DSV13], games on the
uniform distribution [CS14] and for free games, i.e. games on a product
distribution [JPY13].
  This article is meant to be a follow up of [CS14], where we improve and
simplify several parts of our previous paper. Our main result is that for any
free game $G$ with value $\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n)
\le (1 - \varepsilon^2)^{\Omega(\frac{n}{\log(l)})}$ where $l$ is the size of
the output set of the game. This result improves on both the results in [JPY13]
and [CS14]. The framework we use can also be extended to free projection games.
We show that for a free projection game $G$ with value
$\omega^*(G)=1-\varepsilon$, we have $\omega^*(G^n) \le (1 -
\varepsilon)^{\Omega(n)}$.

model from given macroscopic information. The macroscopic variables need to be
mapped to the distribution functions, mesoscopic variables of the Boltzmann

is the Constrained Runs algorithm. This algorithm is used in literature for the
initialization of lattice Boltzmann models, special discretizations of the
Boltzmann equation. It is based on the attraction of the dynamics toward the
slow manifold and uses lattice Boltzmann steps to converge to the desired
dynamics on the slow manifold. We focus on applying the Constrained Runs
algorithm to map density, average flow velocity, and temperature, the
macroscopic variables, to distribution functions. Furthermore, we do not
consider only lattice Boltzmann models. We want to perform the algorithm for
different discretizations of the Boltzmann equation and consider a standard

We propose a novel method to identify inertial, friction and motor parameters

of the DC motors and a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted inside the kinematic
chain. The partial least-square (PLS) method is used to perform the regression.
We identified the inertial, friction and motor parameters of the right arm of
the iCub humanoid robot. We verified that the identified model can accurately
predict the force/torque sensor measurements and the motor voltages. Moreover,
we compared the identified parameters against the CAD parameters, in the
prediction of the force/torque sensor measurements. Finally, we showed that the
estimated model can effectively detect external contacts, comparing it against
a tactile-based contact detection. The presented approach offers some
advantages with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, because of its
completeness (i.e. it identifies inertial, friction and motor parameters) and
simplicity (only one data collection, with no particular requirements).

Prioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and

formulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control
policy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict
priorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to
weighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the
respect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning

observations were carried out with the APEX telescope in the frequency range
283.4--287.4~GHz. Based on the APEX observations, we report tentative
detections of the $^{13}$C-methyl formate isotopologue HCOO$^{13}$CH$_{3}$
towards the following four massive star-forming regions: Sgr~B2(N-LMH),
NGC~6334~IRS~1, W51 e2 and G19.61-0.23. In addition, we have used the 1~mm ALMA
science verification observations of Orion-KL and confirm the detection of the
$^{13}$C-methyl formate species in Orion-KL and image its spatial distribution.
Our analysis shows that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratio in methyl formate
toward Orion-KL Compact Ridge and Hot Core-SW components (68.4$\pm$10.1 and
71.4$\pm$7.8, respectively) are, for both the $^{13}$C-methyl formate
isotopologues, commensurate with the average $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of CO
derived toward Orion-KL. Likewise, regarding the other sources, our results are
consistent with the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in CO. We also report the spectroscopic
characterization, which includes a complete partition function, of the complex
H$^{13}$COOCH$_{3}$ and HCOO$^{13}$CH$_{3}$ species. New spectroscopic data for
both isotopomers H$^{13}$COOCH$_{3}$ and HCOO$^{13}$CH$_{3}$, presented in this

coefficients and can not be used for time-irreversible systems, such as Burgers
equations, due to the time-irreversibility of the Laplacian operator.
Therefore, the splitting methods with complex coefficients and extrapolation
methods with real and positive coefficients have been employed. If we consider
the system as the perturbation of an exactly solvable problem(or can be easily
approximated numerically), it is possible to employ highly efficient methods to
approximate Burgers' equation. The numerical results show that the methods with
complex time steps having one set of coefficients real and positive, say

extend this study to analyse the effect of these ionisation profiles on
velocity structures, kinematics, and synthetic spectra. Clump regions are found
to occur at the convergence of two flows with a low velocity region and
velocity direction transition occurring at the junction. Models with evident
substructure show that core formation occurs on the periphery of these velocity
valleys. Analysis of synthetic spectra reveals the presence of large
non-thermal components within low-density gas, especially for models with the
step-like ionisation profile. All cores show small, sub-thermal relative
motions compared to background gas. Large deviations within this analysis are
due to the line of sight intersecting low- and high-density regions across the
velocity switch transition. Positive deviations correspond to a foreground core
moving away from the observer while negative deviations correspond to a
background core moving toward the observer. Comparison of velocities resulting
from different ionisation profiles suggest that high ionisation fractions yield
supersonic velocities, up to two times the sound speed, while regions with low
ionisation fractions tend to be subsonic or mildly supersonic. This suggests
that the transition to coherence within cores could be a transition between
high and low ionisation fractions within the gas.

realistic case, where the angle template has uncertainties, a small residual
bias remains, but that is shown to be much smaller that the one left by other
classical estimators. We also test our method with more realistic data, using
the noise properties of the three lower frequency maps of WMAP. In this case,
the known-angle estimator also produces better results than methods that do not

pp and p-Pb serve as a baseline for disentangling hot and cold nuclear matter

from filamentary structures with well-ordered magnetic fields. Some of these
structures have been known for decades in radio continuum maps. Their origin is
not clear and there are many filaments that are visible for the first time. We
have identified and studied 11 filaments. The polarisation fraction of some of
them can be as high as 40\%, which is a signature of a well ordered magnetic
field. The polarisation spectral indices, averaged over 18 regions in the sky
is $\beta = -3.06 \pm 0.02$, consistent with synchrotron radiation. There are
significant variations in $\beta$ over the sky ($\Delta\beta\approx0.2$).
  We explore the link between the large-scale filaments and the local ISM,
using the model of an expanding shell in the solar vicinity. We compared
observed polarisation angles with the predictions from the model and found good
agreement. This strongly suggests that many large scale filaments and loops are
nearby structures. This is important in the context of the Galactic magnetic
field as these structures are normally included in global models, neglecting
the fact that they might be local. We also studied the level of contamination
added by the diffuse filaments to the CMB polarisation power spectra. We
conclude that, even though these filaments present low radio brightness, a
careful removal will be necessary for future all-sky CMB polarisation analysis.

zone. These one-dimensional Dirac line degeneracies are topologically protected
by a symmetry that we refer to as in-plane time-reversal invariance. We show
how this invariance leads to Dirac lines in the surface spectrum of stacked
Kane-Mele systems and more general models for weak three-dimensional
topological insulators.

or visual CAPTCHAs are very common. Actually visual CAPTCHA is an image
containing a sequence of characters. So far most of visual CAPTCHAs, in order
to resist against OCR programs, use some common implementations such as
wrapping the characters, random placement and rotations of characters, etc. In
this paper we applied Gaussian Blur filter, which is an image transformation,
to visual CAPTCHAs to reduce their readability by OCR programs. We concluded
that this technique made CAPTCHAs almost unreadable for OCR programs but, their

consists of a quarter-filled Hubbard model for two orbitals that are split by a
weak crystal field. Peculiarities of this model are: (1) a Mott insulator whose
gap corresponds to transferring an electron from the occupied lower orbital to
the empty upper one, rather than from the lower to the upper Hubbard sub-bands;
(2) a Mott transition generically of first order even at zero temperature. We
simulate by means of time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation the evolution
within the insulating phase of an initial state endowed by a non-equilibrium
population of electrons in the upper orbital and holes in the lower one. We
find that the excess population may lead, above a threshold, to a gap-collapse
and drive the insulator into the metastable metallic phase within the
coexistence region around the Mott transition. This result foresees a
non-thermal pathway to revert a Mott insulator into a metal. Even though this
physical scenario is uncovered in a very specific toy-model, we argue it might
apply to other Mott insulating materials that share similar features.

focus on null models that reproduce lower order characteristics of the

properties of the English PN are exceedingly rare: this leads to the hypothesis
that the word repertoire might have been assembled over time by preferentially
introducing new words which are small modifications of old words. Our null
models are able to explain the ""power-law-like"" part of the degree
distributions and generally retrieve qualitative features of the PN such as
high clustering, high assortativity coefficient, and small-world

additional constraints in word assembly. Key constraints we identify are the
avoidance of large degrees, the avoidance of triadic closure, and the avoidance
of large non-percolating clusters.

in data that arises due to lack of observations for a variety of reasons. Such
inadvertent gaps are usually smoothed over using interpolation techniques.
However the smoothing techniques can introduce artificial effects, especially
when non-linear analysis is undertaken. We investigate how gaps can affect the
computed values of correlation dimension of the system, without using any
interpolation. For this we introduce gaps artificially in synthetic data
derived from standard chaotic systems, like the R{\""o}ssler and Lorenz, with
frequency of occurrence and size of missing data drawn from two Gaussian
distributions. Then we study the changes in correlation dimension with change
in the distributions of position and size of gaps. We find that for a
considerable range of mean gap frequency and size, the value of correlation
dimension is not significantly affected, indicating that in such specific
cases, the calculated values can still be reliable and acceptable. Thus our
study introduces a method of checking the reliability of computed correlation
dimension values by calculating the distribution of gaps with respect to its
size and position. This is illustrated for the data from light curves of three
variable stars, R Scuti, U Monocerotis and SU Tauri. We also demonstrate how a
cubic spline interpolation can cause a time series of Gaussian noise with
missing data to be misinterpreted as being chaotic in origin. This is
demonstrated for the non chaotic light curve of variable star SS Cygni, which
gives a saturated D$_{2}$ value, when interpolated using a cubic spline. In
addition we also find that a careful choice of binning, in addition to reducing
noise, can help in shifting the gap distribution to the reliable range for
D$_2$ values.

disordered proteins (IDPs) in the development of human diseases. The main
argument is that IDPs are differentially more present in groups of
disease-related proteins. In this note we compare the frequency of disorder in
human proteins, both disease-related and not. The frequency of disorder is
comparable in the two sub-groups of proteins. Disorder is widespread in human
proteins, but it is not a specific pre-requisite of proteins involved in the
development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurodegenerative

exist in non-convex day-ahead electricity auctions. We consider the case of the

complex and block orders. Extending previous results, we propose a new
primal-dual framework for these auctions, which has applications in both
economic analysis and algorithm design. The contribution here is threefold.
First, from the algorithmic point of view, we give a non-trivial exact (i.e.
not approximate) linearization of a non-convex 'minimum income condition' that
must hold for complex orders arising from the Spanish market, avoiding the
introduction of any auxiliary variables, and allowing us to solve market
clearing instances involving most of the bidding products proposed in PCR using
off-the-shelf MIP solvers. Second, from the economic analysis point of view, we
give the first MILP formulations of optimization problems such as the
maximization of the traded volume, or the minimization of opportunity costs of
paradoxically rejected block bids. We first show on a toy example that these
two objectives are distinct from maximizing welfare. We also recover directly a
previously noted property of an alternative market model. Third, we provide
numerical experiments on realistic large-scale instances. They illustrate the
efficiency of the approach, as well as the economics trade-offs that may occur
in practice.

review most reproduction numbers defined in the literature for these models,

of this, for which we provide a simpler, more elegant derivation. Extending
previous work, we provide a complete overview of the inequalities among these

the exponential-growth-associated reproduction number $R_r$, which is loosely

insufficient to prevent large epidemics. In addition, we provide significantly

their validation is documented. Based on the asteroid ephemeris, the tool
calculates the impact location probability distribution on the surface of the
Earth (in the literature, occasionally referred to as risk corridor). NASA's
Near Earth Object (NEO) risk list served as the source for asteroid
ephemerides. The Line of Variation (LOV) method was employed to find virtual
impactors. While offering a simple and fast way of identifying virtual
impactors, the method provides a low impactor identification rate. This is
because the search space is tightly constricted to the LOV and thus excludes
virtual impactors located elsewhere in the asteroid position uncertainty
region. The method's performance was evaluated and suggestions for improvements
are provided. Application of the tool showed that the asteroid threat is global
in nature: impact locations were distributed widely over the Earth's surface.
The global asteroid risk was estimated by combining the impact location
probability distribution with Earth population data. The identification of high
risk regions lead to a discussion about the dynamics of the risk associated
with asteroids. The future response to an asteroid threat will depend on the
risk that the asteroid poses to the population. The potential applicability of
ARMOR as a decision-support tool for responding to the asteroid threat is
outlined.

large range of internal velocity dispersions (10 to 80 km/s), and a large

a framework for studying the sequence of star cluster formation and evolution,
from diffuse SGMCs, to proto, embedded, emerging, young, and intermediate/old

explains several physical aspects of the early Universe including inflation. In
this model we study a coupling between the FRW space-time, in the form of the
derivative of the Ricci scalar, and the $B-L$ current, $J^{\mu} _{B-L}$, which
leads to a different chemical potential between baryons and anti-baryons
resulting in an excess of baryons over anti-baryons with the right order of
magnitude. In this model the generation of baryon asymmetry, in principle,
occurs over the entire history of the Universe starting from the beginning of
the radiation phase. However, in practice, almost the entire contribution to
the baryon asymmetry only comes from the very beginning of the Universe and is
negligible thereafter. There is a free parameter in our model which can be
interpreted as defining the boundary between the unknown quantum gravity regime
and the inflation/baryogenesis regime covered by our model. When this parameter
is adjusted to give the observed value of baryon asymmetry we get a higher than
usual energy scale for our inflation model which however may be in line with
the GUT scale for inflation in view of the BICEP2 and Planck results. In
addition our model provides the correct temperature for the CMB photons at the
time of decoupling.

roto-translations computed by the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. The
problem is relevant for localization of mobile robots and vehicles equipped
with depth-sensing cameras (e.g., Kinect) or Lidar (e.g., Velodyne). The
closed-form formulas for covariance proposed in previous literature generally
build upon the fact that the solution to ICP is obtained by minimizing a linear
least-squares problem. In this paper, we show this approach needs caution
because the rematching step of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for,
and applying it to the point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely
erroneous covariances. We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the
approach is valid in the point-to-plane version of ICP, which validates the
intuition and experimental results of practitioners.

two solvents quantifies differences in solute-solvent interactions $-$ if the
transfer takes place at constant molarity of the solute. Yet, many calculation
formulae and measuring instructions that are commonly used to quantify
solute-solvent interactions correspond to transfer processes in which not the
molarity of the solute but its concentration measured in another concentration
scale is constant. Here, we demonstrate that in this case, not only the change
in solute-solvent interactions is quantified but also the entropic effect of a
volume change during the transfer. Consequently, the ""phenomenon"" which is
known as ""concentration-scale dependence"" of transfer free energies is simply
explained by a volume-entropy effect. Our explanations are of high importance
for the study of cosolvent effects on protein stability.

important role in the construction sector. Nevertheless, its hygroscopic
character basically affects all related mechanical properties leading to
degradation of material stiffness and strength over the service life.
Accordingly, to attain reliable design of the timber structures, the influence
of moisture evolution and the role of time- and moisture-dependent behaviors
have to be taken into account. For this purpose, in the current study a 3D
orthotropic elasto-plastic, visco-elastic, mechano-sorptive constitutive model
for wood, with all material constants being defined as a function of moisture
content, is presented. The corresponding numerical integration approach, with
additive decomposition of the total strain is developed and implemented within
the framework of the finite element method (FEM). Moreover to preserve a
quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence the consistent tangent operator for
the whole model is derived.
  Functionality and capability of the presented material model are evaluated by
performing several numerical verification simulations of wood components under
different combinations of mechanical loading and moisture variation.
Additionally, the flexibility and universality of the introduced model to
predict the mechanical behavior of different species are demonstrated by the
analysis of a hybrid wood element. Furthermore, the proposed numerical approach
is validated by comparisons of computational evaluations with experimental
results.

computing an average of phylogenetic trees, which is equivalently characterized
as the minimizer of the Fr\'echet function. The Fr\'echet mean can be used for
statistical inference and exploratory data analysis: for example it can be
leveraged as a test statistic to compare groups via permutation tests, or to
find trends in data over time via kernel smoothing. By analyzing the
differential properties of the Fr\'echet function along geodesics in treespace
we obtained a theorem describing a decomposition of the derivative along a
geodesic. This decomposition theorem is used to formulate optimality conditions
which are used as a logical basis for an algorithm to verify relative
optimality at points where the Fr\'echet function gradient does not exist.

over time-slots, the random assignment problem (also called the house
allocation problem) is considered on a uniform preference domain. For the
subdomain in which preferences are strict except possibly for the class of
unacceptable objects, Bogomolnaia and Moulin characterized the probabilistic
serial mechanism as the only mechanism satisfying equal treatment of equals,
strategyproofness, and ordinal efficiency. The main result in this paper is
that the natural extension of the probabilistic serial mechanism to the domain
of weak, but uniform, preferences fails strategyproofness, but so does every
other mechanism that is ordinally efficient and treats equals equally. If
envy-free assignments are required, then any (probabilistic or deterministic)
mechanism that guarantees an ex post efficient outcome must fail even a weak
form of strategyproofness.

Mesoscopic simulations partition the environment into subvolumes, track when

computationally efficient. In this paper, we present the foundation of a
multi-scale stochastic simulator from the perspective of molecular
communication, for both mesoscopic and hybrid models, where we emphasize
simulation accuracy at the receiver and efficiency in regions that are far from

results compare the accuracy and efficiency of traditional approaches with that
