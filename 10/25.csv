research that is currently attracting a lot of attention. In this context, we
study the following problem of barrier coverage by stationary wireless sensors
that are assisted by a mobile robot with the capacity to move sensors. Assume
that $n$ sensors are initially arbitrarily distributed on a line segment
barrier. Each sensor is said to cover the portion of the barrier that
intersects with its sensing area. Owing to incorrect initial position, or the
death of some of the sensors, the barrier is not completely covered by the
sensors. We employ a mobile robot to move the sensors to final positions on the
barrier such that barrier coverage is guaranteed. We seek algorithms that
minimize the length of the robot's trajectory, since this allows the
restoration of barrier coverage as soon as possible. We give an optimal
linear-time offline algorithm that gives a minimum-length trajectory for a
robot that starts at one end of the barrier and achieves the restoration of
barrier coverage. We also study two different online models: one in which the
online robot does not know the length of the barrier in advance, and the other
in which the online robot knows the length of the barrier. For the case when
the online robot does not know the length of the barrier, we prove a tight
bound of $3/2$ on the competitive ratio, and we give a tight lower bound of
$5/4$ on the competitive ratio in the other case. Thus for each case we give an
optimal online algorithm.

use of groups of high-repetition-rate pulses, or bursts. Here, we report a
novel fiber laser and demonstrate ultrafast burst-mode ablation of brain tissue

Sheffield, Scene15 and Caltech256 databases verify our hypothesis. Similar to
graph learning, several representative hyperedge weighting schemes can be
concluded by our experimental studies. Moreover, the experiments also
demonstrate that the combinations of such weighting schemes and conventional
hypergraph models can get very promising classification and clustering
performances in comparison with some recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

resolve the nucleation and growth of many bubbles per run in simple direct
micro-canonical (NVE) simulations while the ambient pressure and temperature
remain almost perfectly constant. We find bubble nucleation rates which are
lower than in most of the previous, smaller simulations. It is widely believed
that classical nucleation theory (CNT) generally underestimates bubble
nucleation rates by very large factors. However, our measured rates are within
two orders of magnitude of CNT predictions - only at very low temperatures does
CNT underestimate the nucleation rate significantly. Introducing a small,
positive Tolman length leads to very good agreement at all temperatures, as
found in our recent vapor-to-liquid nucleation simulations. The critical
bubbles sizes derived with the nucleation theorem agree well with the CNT
predictions at all temperatures. Local hot spots reported in the literature are

we obtained $\sim$37$\%$ spin polarization of tunneling electrons at 11 K due

presentation order, determines the outcomes of peer recommendation, i.e., item
popularity. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we experimentally measure the effects
of social signals in peer recommendation. Specifically, after controlling for
variation due to item content and its position, we find that social signals
affect item popularity about half as much as position and content do. These
effects are somewhat correlated, so social signals exacerbate the ""rich get
richer"" phenomenon, which results in a wider variance of popularity. Further,
social signals change individual preferences, creating a ""herding"" effect that
biases people's judgments about the content. Despite this, we find that social
signals improve the efficiency of peer recommendation by reducing the effort
devoted to evaluating content while maintaining recommendation quality.

studies of the crossover from 3D to 2D in ground-state density-functional
theory showed that local and semilocal exchange-correlation functionals which
are based on the 3D electron gas are appropriate for wide quantum wells, but
eventually break down as the 2D limit is approached. We now consider the
dynamical case and study the performance of various linear-response exchange
kernels in time-dependent density-functional theory. We compare approximate
local, semilocal and orbital-dependent exchange kernels, and analyze their
performance for inter- and intrasubband plasmons as the quantum wells approach
the 2D limit. 3D (semi)local exchange functionals are found to fail for quantum
well widths comparable to the 2D Wigner-Seitz radius, which implies in practice
that 3D local exchange remains valid in the quasi-2D dynamical regime for
typical quantum well parameters, except for very low densities.

features of [CoII], [CoIII], and [FeII] throughout the $0.8-1.8$\mu m region.
As the spectrum ages, the cobalt features fade as would be expected from the
decay of $^{56}$Co to $^{56}$Fe. We show that the strong and isolated [FeII]
emission line at $1.644$\mu m provides a unique tool to analyze near-infrared
spectra of Type Ia supernovae. Normalization of spectra to this line allows
separation of features produced by stable versus unstable isotopes of iron
group elements. We develop a new method of determining the initial central
density, $\rho_c$, and the magnetic field, $B$, of the white dwarf using the
width of the $1.644$\mu m line. The line width is sensitive because of electron
capture in the early stages of burning, which increases as a function of
density. The sensitivity of the line width to $B$ increase with time and the
effects of the magnetic field shift towards later times with decreasing
$\rho_c$. The initial central density for SN 2005df is measured as
$\rho_c=0.9(\pm0.2)$ (in $10^9$g/cm$^3$), which corresponds to a white dwarf
close to the Chandrasekhar mass ($\rm M_{Ch}$) with $\rm
M_{WD}=1.313(\pm0.034)$M$_{\odot}$ and systematic error less than
$0.04$M$_{\odot}$. Within $\rm M_{Ch}$ explosions, however, the central density
found for SN 2005df is very low for a H-accretor, possibly suggesting a helium
star companion or a tidally-disrupted white dwarf companion. As an alternative,
we suggest mixing of the central region. We find some support for high initial
magnetic fields of strength $10^6$G for SN 2005df, however, $0$G cannot be
ruled out because of noise in the spectra combined with low $\rho_c$.

holographic superconductor on ionic lattices, the presence of Q-lattices will
suppress the condensate of the scalar field and lower the critical temperature.
In particular, when the Q-lattice background is dual to a deep insulating
phase, the condensation would never occur for some small charges. Furthermore,
we numerically compute the optical conductivity in the superconducting regime.
It turns out that the presence of Q-lattice does not remove the pole in the
imaginary part of the conductivity, ensuring the appearance of a delta function
in the real part. We also evaluate the gap which in general depends on the
charge of the scalar field as well as the Q-lattice parameters. Nevertheless,
when the charge of the scalar field is relatively large and approaches the
probe limit, the gap becomes universal with $\omega_g \simeq 9T_c$ which is

analysis. In this work we initiate a study of online learning techniques for
such non-decomposable loss functions with an aim to enable incremental learning
as well as design scalable solvers for batch problems. To this end, we propose
an online learning framework for such loss functions. Our model enjoys several
nice properties, chief amongst them being the existence of efficient online
learning algorithms with sublinear regret and online to batch conversion
bounds. Our model is a provable extension of existing online learning models
for point loss functions. We instantiate two popular losses, prec@k and pAUC,
in our model and prove sublinear regret bounds for both of them. Our proofs
require a novel structural lemma over ranked lists which may be of independent
interest. We then develop scalable stochastic gradient descent solvers for
non-decomposable loss functions. We show that for a large family of loss
functions satisfying a certain uniform convergence property (that includes
prec@k, pAUC, and F-measure), our methods provably converge to the empirical
risk minimizer. Such uniform convergence results were not known for these
losses and we establish these using novel proof techniques. We then use
extensive experimentation on real life and benchmark datasets to establish that
our method can be orders of magnitude faster than a recently proposed cutting

ordered state characterized by staggered stripes of parallel spins. With
ordering vectors $(\pi,0)$ or $(0,\pi)$, this magnetic state breaks the
high-temperature tetragonal symmetry of the system, which is manifested by a
splitting of the lattice Bragg peaks. Remarkably, recent experiments in
hole-doped iron arsenides reported an ordered state that displays magnetic
Bragg peaks at $(\pi,0)$ and $(0,\pi)$ but remains tetragonal. Despite being
inconsistent with a magnetic stripe configuration, this unusual magnetic phase
can be described in terms of a double-$\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic structure
consisting of an equal-weight superposition of the ordering vectors $(\pi,0)$
and $(0,\pi)$. Here we show that a non-collinear double-$\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic
configuration, dubbed \emph{orthomagnetic}, arises naturally within an
itinerant three-band microscopic model for the iron pnictides. In particular,
we find that strong deviations from perfect nesting and residual interactions
between the electron pockets favor the orthomagnetic over the stripe magnetic
state. Using an effective low-energy model, we also calculate the spin-wave
spectrum of the orthomagnetic state. In contrast to the stripe state, there are
three Goldstone modes, manifested in all diagonal and one off-diagonal
component of the spin-spin correlation function. The total magnetic structure
factor displays two anisotropic spin-wave branches emerging from both $(\pi,0)$
and $(0,\pi)$ momenta, in contrast to the case of domains of stripe order,
where only one spin-wave branch emerges from each momentum. We propose that
these unique features of the orthomagnetic state can be used to unambiguously
distinguish it from the stripe state via neutron scattering experiments, and
discuss the implications of its existence to the nature of the magnetism of the
iron arsenides.

  Our goals are to determine the physical characteristics of WISE0720, its
kinematic properties, and to address the question if it is a binary object, as
suggested in the discovery paper.
  Optical and infrared spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope
and Magellan, respectively, and spectral energy distribution fitting were used
to determine the spectral type of WISE0720. The measured radial velocity,
proper motion and parallax yielded its Galactic velocities. We also
investigated if WISE0720 may show X-ray activity based on archival data.
  Our spectra are consistent with spectral type L0+/-1. We find no evidence for
binarity, apart for a minor 2-sigma level difference in the radial velocities
taken at two different epochs. The spatial velocity of WISE0720 does not
connect it to any known moving group, instead it places the object with high
probability in the old thin disk or in the thick disk. The spectral energy
distribution fit hints at excess in the 12 and 22 micron WISE bands which may
be due to a redder companion, but the same excess is visible in other late type
objects, and it more likely implies a shortcoming of the models (e.g., issues
with the effective wavelengths of the filters for these extremely cool objects,
etc.) rather than a disk or redder companion. The optical spectrum shows some
Halpha emission, indicative of stellar activity. Archival X-ray observations
yield no detection.

represented by vertices at the ""center"" of the graph are often more important
than those associated with vertices on the ""fringes"". For example, central
nodes tend to be more critical in the spread of information or disease and play
an important role in clustering/community formation. Identifying such ""core""
vertices has recently received additional attention in the context of {\em
network experiments}, which analyze the response when a random subset of
vertices are exposed to a treatment (e.g. inoculation, free product samples,
etc). Specifically, the likelihood of having many central vertices in any
exposure subset can have a significant impact on the experiment.
  We focus on using $k$-cores and core numbers to measure the extent to which a
vertex is central in a graph. Existing algorithms for computing the core number
of a vertex require the entire graph as input, an unrealistic scenario in many
real world applications. Moreover, in the context of network experiments, the
subgraph induced by the treated vertices is only known in a probabilistic
sense. We introduce a new method for estimating the core number based only on
the properties of the graph within a region of radius $\delta$ around the
vertex, and prove an asymptotic error bound of our estimator on random graphs.
Further, we empirically validate the accuracy of our estimator for small values
of $\delta$ on a representative corpus of real data sets. Finally, we evaluate
the impact of improved local estimation on an open problem in network
experimentation posed by Ugander et al.

XMM-Newton/Reflection Grating Spectrometer observations of the Seyfert 2 galaxy

reveals a myriad of soft-Xray emission lines, including those from H- and
He-like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, and M- and L-shell iron. As noted
in the earlier analysis, based on the narrowness of the radiative recombination
continua, the electron temperatures in the emission-line gas are consistent
with photoionization, rather than collisional ionization. The strengths of the
carbon and nitrogen emission lines, relative to those of oxygen, suggest
unusual elemental abundances, which we attribute to star-formation history of
the host galaxy. Overall, the emission-lines are blue-shifted with respect to
systemic, with radial velocities ~ 160 km/s, similar to that of [O III] 5007,
and thus consistent with the kinematics and orientation of the optical
emission-line gas and, hence, likely part of an AGN-driven outflow. We were
able to achieve an acceptable fit to most of the strong emission-lines with a
two-component photoionization model, generated with Cloudy. The two components
have ionization parameters and column densities of logU = -0.05 and 1.22, and
logN(H) = 20.85 and 21.2, and covering factors of 0.35 and 0.84, respectively.
The total mass of the X-ray gas is roughly of an order of magnitude greater
than the mass of ionized gas determined from optical and near-IR spectroscopy,
which indicates that it may be the dominant component of the narrow line
region. Furthermore, we suggest that the medium which produces the
scattered/polarized optical emission in NGC~1068 possesses similar physical
characteristics to those of the more highly-ionized of the X-ray model
components.

massive neutrino cosmologies. We discuss all the ingredients necessary to model
the non-linear matter and cold dark matter power spectra and compare with the
results of N-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos. Our neutrino
halo model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of matter clustering with
a $\sim 20\%$ accuracy up to very non-linear scales of $k=10~h/$Mpc (which
would be affected by baryon physics). The largest discrepancies arise in the
range $k=0.5-1~h/$Mpc where the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are comparable and are
present also in a massless neutrino cosmology. However, at scales $k<0.2~h/$Mpc
our neutrino halo model agrees with the results of N-body simulations at the
level of 8\% for total neutrino masses of $<0.3$ eV. We also model the neutrino
non-linear density field as a sum of a linear and clustered component and
predict the neutrino power spectrum and the cold dark matter-neutrino
cross-power spectrum up to $k=1~h/$Mpc with $\sim$ 30\% accuracy. For masses
below 0.15 eV the neutrino halo model captures the neutrino induced
suppression, casted in terms of matter power ratios between massive and
massless scenarios, with a 2\% agreement with the results of N-body/neutrino
simulations. Finally, we provide a simple application of the halo model: the
computation of the clustering of galaxies, in massless and massive neutrinos
cosmologies, using a simple Halo Occupation Distribution scheme and our halo

propose that their diverse structure is caused by giant impacts of embryos and
super-Earths or mergers with other gas giants during the formation and
evolution of these hot Jupiters. Through a series of numerical simulations, we
show that typical head-on collisions generally lead to total coalescence of
impinging gas giants. Although extremely energetic collisions can disintegrate
the envelope of gas giants, these events seldom occur. During oblique and
moderately energetic collisions, the merger products retain higher fraction of
the colliders' cores than their envelopes. They can also deposit considerable
amount of spin angular momentum to the gas giants and desynchronize their spins
from their orbital mean motion. We find that the oblateness of gas giants can
be used to infer the impact history. Subsequent dissipation of stellar tide
inside the planets' envelope can lead to runaway inflation and potentially a
substantial loss of gas through Roche-lobe overflow. The impact of super-Earths
on parabolic orbits can also enlarge gas giant planets' envelope and elevates
their tidal dissipation rate over $\sim $ 100 Myr time scale. Since giant
impacts occur stochastically with a range of impactor sizes and energies, their
diverse outcomes may account for the dispersion in the mass-radius relationship
of hot Jupiters.

cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group-sized halo and its environment. It
adopts the same high resolution ($\sim10^4$ M$_\odot$, $\sim100$ pc) and
sub-grid physical model that was used in the Eris simulation but probes a
sub-volume almost ten times bigger with as many as 45 million gas and star
particles in the zoom-in region. Argo follows the early assembly of galaxies
with a broad range of stellar masses ($\log M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\sim8-11$
at $z\simeq3$), while resolving properly their structural properties. We
recover a diversity of morphologies, including late-type/irregular disc
galaxies with flat rotation curves, spheroid dominated early-type discs, and a
massive elliptical galaxy, already established at $z\sim3$. We identify major
mergers as the main trigger for the formation of bulges and the steepening of
the circular velocity curves. Minor mergers and non-axisymmetric perturbations
(stellar bars) drive the bulge growth in some cases. The specific angular
momenta of the simulated disc components fairly match the values inferred from
nearby galaxies of similar $M_{\star}$ once the expected redshift evolution of
disc sizes is accounted for. We conclude that morphological transformations of
high redshift galaxies of intermediate mass are likely triggered by processes
similar to those at low redshift and result in an early build-up of the Hubble
sequence.

us to compare our model to the dark-matter-only case. Our basic assumptions are
tested against the hydrodynamical simulations of Martizzi et. al. (2014), with
which a remarkable agreement is found. Our baryonic model has only one free
parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$, the critical halo mass that marks the transition
between feedback-dominated halos, mostly devoid of gas, and gas rich halos, in
which AGN feedback effects become weaker. We explore the entire cosmological
parameter space, using the angular power spectrum in three redshift bins as the
observable, assuming a Euclid-like survey. We derive the corresponding
constraints on the cosmological parameters, as well as the possible bias
introduced by neglecting the effects of baryonic physics. We find that, up to
$\ell_{max}$=4000, baryonic physics plays very little role in the cosmological
parameters estimation. However, if one goes up to $\ell_{max}$=8000, the
marginalized errors on the cosmological parameters can be significantly
reduced, but neglecting baryonic physics can lead to bias in the recovered
cosmological parameters up to 10$\sigma$. These biases are removed if one takes
into account the main baryonic parameter, $M_{\rm crit}$, which can also be

Gaussian Processes to make inference on Poisson Point Processes without
resorting to gridding the domain or to introducing latent thinning points.
Unlike competing models that scale cubically and have a squared memory
requirement in the number of data points, our model has a linear complexity and
memory requirement. We propose an MCMC sampler and show that our model is
faster, more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing
models on both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model
easily handles data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches.

contains only finitely many algebraically primitive Teichmueller curves. For
the stratum consisting of holomorphic one-forms in genus three with a single
zero, our approach to finiteness uses the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of the
Hodge bundle over a Teichmueller curve to obtain new information on the
locations of the zeros of eigenforms. By passing to the boundary of moduli
space, this gives explicit constraints on the cusps of Teichmueller curves in
terms of cross-ratios of six points on a projective line. These constraints are
akin to those that appear in Zilber and Pink's conjectures on unlikely
intersections in diophantine geometry. However, in our case one is lead
naturally to the intersection of a surface with a family of codimension two
algebraic subgroups of $G_m^n \times G_a^n$ (rather than the more standard
$G_m^n$). The ambient algebraic group lies outside the scope of Zilber's
Conjecture but we are nonetheless able to prove a sufficiently strong height
bound. For the generic stratum in genus three, we obtain global torsion order
bounds through a computer search for subtori of a codimension-two subvariety of
$G_m^9$. These torsion bounds together with new bounds for the moduli of
horizontal cylinders in terms of torsion orders yields finiteness in this
stratum. The intermediate strata are handled with a mix of these techniques.

  Interdependency",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power
and communication systems, will have important implications for the reliability
and security of these systems. To understand the effects of power-communication
coupling, several have studied interdependent network models and reported that
increased coupling can increase system vulnerability. However, these results
come from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading,
relative to those found in actual power and communication networks. This paper
reports on two sets of experiments that compare the network vulnerability
implications resulting from simple topological models and models that more
accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we
compare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in
power systems and find that the power grid shows a much higher level of
vulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a model of
topological cascades in coupled networks to three different physics-based
models of power grids coupled to communication networks. Again, the more
accurate models suggest very different conclusions. In all but the most extreme
case, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased
power-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from
what one would conclude from the coupled topological model, in which zero
coupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case in which communication failures
immediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are poorly designed,
increased coupling can be harmful. Together these results suggest design
strategies for reducing the risk of cascades in interdependent infrastructure
systems.

attracting the attention of scientists from different disciplines. Dynamic
demand response management involves a set of operations aiming at
decentralizing the control of loads in large and complex power networks. Each
single appliance if fully responsive and readjusts its energy demand to the
overall network load. A main issue is related to mains frequency oscillations
resulting from an unbalance between supply and demand. In a nutshell, this
paper contributes to the topic by equipping each signal consumer with strategic
insight. In particular, we highlight three main contributions and a few other
minor contributions. First, we design a mean-field game for the TCLs
application, study the mean-field equilibrium for the deterministic mean-field
game and investigate on asymptotic stability for the microscopic dynamics.
Second, we extend the analysis and design to imperfect models which involve
both stochastic or deterministic disturbances. This leads to robust mean-field
equilibrium strategies guaranteeing stochastic and worst-case stability,
respectively. Minor contributions involve the use of stochastic control
strategies rather than deterministic, and some numerical studies illustrating
the efficacy of the proposed strategies.

inheritance from the parent molecular cloud and isotopic exchange in the disc.
A possibly widespread feature of disc evolution, ignored in previous studies,
is accretion bursts (or FU Orionis outbursts), which may thermally process a
large fraction of the water. One proposed underlying mechanism for FU Orionis
outbursts relies on the presence of a magnetically dead zone. Here we examine
the evolution of (D/H)$_{\rm water}$ in 1D simulations of a disc's evolution
that include dead zones and infall from an envelope with given D/H ratio in the
infalling water ($\sim 10^{-3}$), and compare the results with similar
calculations without dead zones. We find that the accretion bursts result in a
significantly lower (D/H)$_{\rm water}$ ratio and a more extended region
(radius up to $\sim 1-3$ AU) where water is equilibrated with hydrogen gas
(D/H=$2\times 10^{-5}$), when compared to burst-free models. Solar system
constraints suggest that our solar nebula either experienced no accretion
bursts and had a Schmidt number $\lesssim 0.2$ or had a Schmidt number closer
to ""nominal"" values ($\sim 1$) and experienced several accretion bursts.
Finally, future observations of (D/H)$_{\rm water}$ in protoplanetary discs
will allow inferences about angular momentum properties of the disc during disc
building and the role of accretion bursts.

the lack of systematic mechanisms for monitoring the extent to which allocated

electron systems aiming at a better description of its spatial fluctuations at
all length scales. Taking the nonlocal coupling as a perturbation to the local
degrees of freedom, we show that the nonlocality in the self-energy function
can be efficiently constructed from the coupling between local fluctuations. It
can provide one unified framework to incorporate nonlocality to both ordered
and disordered correlated many-body fermion systems. In this application, we
prove that the dual-fermion approach can be understood as a special case of
this nonlocal expansion scheme. The scheme presented in this work is
constructed without introducing any dual variable, in which the interacting
nature and the correlated behaviors of the lattice fermions have a clear
physics correspondence. Thus, in this special case, the equivalence of the
dual-fermion approach to the nonlocal expansion scheme beautifully reveals the
physics origin of the dual variables. We show that the noninteracting
dual-fermion Green's function corresponds exactly to a nonlocal coupling of the
lattice fermion renormalized by the local single-particle charge fluctuations,
and the dual-fermion self-energy behaves as the one-particle fully irreducible
components of the lattice Green's function. Not only limited to this specific
example, the nonlocal expansion scheme presented in this work can also be
applied to other problems depending on the choice of the local degrees of
freedom.

at most $k$ operations from $S$. We prove that
  1. if $S=\{ea\}$ or $S=\{ea,ed\}$, then CDPE($S$) can be solved in polynomial

as a spatial integral along the normal direction of a sum of gradient square

arises naturally from the dependence of those profiles on the angles between
the principal reciprocal lattice vectors $\vec K_i$ and $\hat n$. Values of the

simulation studies of crystallization kinetics for a classical model of Fe.
Additional MD simulations are carried out here to compute the relaxation time
of density waves in the liquid in order to make this comparison free of fit
parameter. The GL theory predicts a similar expression for $\mu$ as the MC
theory but yields a better agreement with MD simulations for both its magnitude
and anisotropy due to a fully nonlinear description of density wave profiles
across the solid-liquid interface. GL theory is also used to derive an inverse
relation between $\mu$ and the solid-liquid interfacial free-energy. The
general methodology used here to derive an expression for $\mu(\hat n)$ also

finding an element in a fixed-point set such that its image under a bounded
linear operator belongs to another fixed-point set. Recently Censor and Segal
proposed an efficient algorithm for solving such a problem. However, to employ
their algorithm, one needs to know a prior information on the norm of the

the white-light-cavity (WLC) effect using a compound cavity for signal
recycling (CC-SR). Here, we first use an idealized model for the negative
dispersion medium (NDM) and use the so-called Caves model for a
phase-insensitive linear amplifier to account for the quantum noise (QN)
contributed by the NDM, in order to determine the upper bound of the
enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth product. We calculate the quantum
noise limited sensitivity curves for the CC-SR design, and find that the
broadening of sensitivity predicted by the classical analysis is also present
in these curves, but is somewhat reduced. Furthermore, we find that the curves
always stay above the standard quantum limit. To circumvent this limitation, we
modify the dispersion to compensate the non-linear phase variation produced by
the optomechanical resonance effects. We find that the upper bound of the
factor by which the sensitivity-bandwidth product is increased, compared to the
highest-sensitivity result predicted by Bunanno and Chen [Phys. Rev. D 64,
042006 (2001)], is ~14. We also present a simpler scheme (WLC-SR) where a
dispersion medium is inserted into the SR cavity. For this scheme, we found the
upper bound of the enhancement factor to be ~18. We then consider an explicit
system for realizing the NDM, which makes use of five energy levels in
M-configuration to produce gain, accompanied by electromagnetically induced
transparency (the GEIT system). For this explicit system, we employ the
rigorous approach based on Master Equation to compute the QN contributed by the
NDM, thus enabling us to determine the enhancement in the sensitivity-bandwidth
product definitively rather than the upper bound thereof. Specifically, we
identify a set of parameters for which the sensitivity-bandwidth product is
enhanced by a factor of 17.66.

second test), one has to optimize a number of parameters involved in the
experiment (angles of polarization beam splitters and quantum state

combination of a starlight component, a powerlaw from the central AGN and the
emission from the FeII complex. After the subtraction of the modeled continuum,
each emission/absorption line is profiled by a sum of multi Gaussian functions.
All the line shifts are determined with respect to the modeled starlight
component. By using the host starlight as a reference for the local system,
both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ show AGN's absorptions with a blueshift of
$\sim300\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. We identify a strong anti-correlation between the
inferred velocity shifts and ionization potential for various narrow emission
lines, which suggests a stratified NLR kinematics. A de-accelerated outflow is
implied for the inner NLR gas, while an accelerated inflow for the outer NLR
gas. This complicated NLR kinematics additionally implies that AGN's narrow
emission lines, even for the low-ionized lines, might not be a reliable

block TT decompositions. The very large-scale optimization problem is reduced
to sequential small-scale optimization problems, and each core tensor of the
block TT decompositions can be updated by applying any standard optimization
methods. The optimal ranks of the block TT decompositions are determined
adaptively during iteration process, so that we can achieve high approximation
accuracy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted for several types of

lan- guage is the large size of the character set, larger similarity between
different characters in the script and the huge variation in writing style. In
this paper we propose a framework for on-line handwitten script recognition
taking cues from speech signal processing literature. The framework is based on
identify- ing strokes, which in turn lead to recognition of handwritten on-line
characters rather that the conventional character identification. Though the
framework is described for Devanagari script, the framework is general and can
be applied to any language.
  The proposed platform consists of pre-processing, feature extraction, recog-
nition and post processing like the conventional character recognition but ap-
plied to strokes. The on-line Devanagari character recognition reduces to one
of recognizing one of 69 primitives and recognition of a character is performed
by recognizing a sequence of such primitives. We further show the impact of
noise removal on on-line raw data which is usually noisy. The use of Fuzzy

crucial and demanding tasks is the identification of similarity patterns with a
very high temporal resolution and across different spatial scales. To address
this task, in recent years three time-resolved measures of spike train
synchrony have been proposed, the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance, and event
synchronization. The Matlab source codes for calculating and visualizing these
measures have been made publicly available. However, due to the many different
possible representations of the results the use of these codes is rather
complicated and their application requires some basic knowledge of Matlab. Thus
it became desirable to provide a more user-friendly and interactive interface.

to both simulated and real data. SPIKY includes implementations of the
ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and SPIKE-synchronization (an improved and
simplified extension of event synchronization) which have been optimized with
respect to computation speed and memory demand. It also comprises a spike train
generator and an event detector which makes it capable of analyzing continuous

Moreover, we prove robustness of recovery under perturbation of the
measurements by noise. The result for approximate $4$-designs generalizes and
improves a recent bound on phase retrieval due to Gross, Kueng and Krahmer. In

hardly, if at all, be recognized as human. If we had to go back along the
evolutionary tree to identify a creature 1000 times less intelligent than the
average contemporary human, we will have to go really far back. Would it be a
kind of a lizard? An insect perhaps? Considering this, how can we possibly
aspire to have a grasp of something a thousand times more intelligent than us?
When it comes to intelligence, even the very attempt to quantify it is highly
misleading. Now if we attend to a seemingly adjacent question, what would a
machine with such capacity for intelligence be like? Just coming up with an
approximate metaphor requires a huge stretch of the imagination, meaning that
almost anything goes... What would a society of such super intelligent agents,
be they human, machines or an amalgam of both, be like? Well, here we are
transported into the realm of pure speculation. Technological Singularity is
referred to as the event of artificial intelligence surpassing the intelligence
of humans and shortly after augmenting itself far beyond that. It is no wonder
that the mathematical concept of singularity has become the symbol of an event
so disruptive and so far reaching that it is impossible to conceptually or even

from generation of highly non-classical states to implementation of quantum
logic operations. The process fidelity that can be achieved in a realistic
implementation depends on a number of system parameters. Here we experimentally
examine Fock-state filtration, a canonical example of a broad class of
conditional quantum operations acting on a single optical field mode. This
operation is based upon interference of the mode to be manipulated with an
auxiliary single-photon state at a beam splitter, resulting in the entanglement
of the two output modes. A conditional projective measurement onto a single
photon at one output mode heralds the success of the process. This operation,
which implements a measurement-induced nonlinearity, is capable of suppressing
particular photon-number probability amplitudes of an arbitrary quantum state.
We employ coherent-state process tomography to determine the precise operation
realized in our experiment. To identify the key sources of experimental
imperfection, we develop a model of the process and identify three main
contributions that significantly hamper its efficacy. The reconstructed tensor
is compared with a model of the process taking into account sources of
experimental imperfection with fidelity better than 0.95. This enables us to
identify three key challenges to overcome in realizing a filter with high
fidelity - namely the single-photon nature of the auxiliary state, high-mode
overlap, and the need for number resolving detection when heralding. The
results show that the filter does indeed exhibit a nonlinear response as a
function of input photon number and preserves the phase relation between Fock
layers of the output state, providing promise for future applications.

of the quadratic variation of financial prices, taking into account the impact
of microstructure noise and jumps. However, none has considered direct modeling
and forecasting of the Realized Range conditional quantiles. This study carries
out a quantile regression analysis to fill this gap. The proposed model takes
into account as quantile predictors both the lagged values of the estimated
volatility and some key macroeconomic and financial variables, which provide
important information about the overall market trend and risk. In this way, and
without distributional assumptions on the realized range innovations, it is
possible to assess the entire conditional distribution of the estimated
volatility. This issue is a critical one for financial decision-makers in terms
of pricing, asset allocation, and risk management. The quantile regression
approach allows how the links among the involved variables change across the
quantiles levels to be analyzed. In addition, a rolling analysis is performed
in order to determine how the relationships that characterize the proposed
model evolve over time. The analysis is applied to sixteen stocks issued by
companies that operate in differing economic sectors of the U.S. market, and
the forecast accuracy is validated by means of suitable tests. The results show
evidence of the selected variables' relevant impacts and, particularly during
periods of market stress, highlights heterogeneous effects across quantiles.

civil engineers, an important fact: the possible lack of wave protection of
transformational elastic cloaks. To do so, we propose spherical cloaks
described by a non-singular asymmetric elasticity tensor depending upon a small
parameter $\eta,$ that defines the softness of a region one would like to
conceal from elastodynamic waves. By varying $\eta$, we generate a class of
soft spheres dressed by elastodynamic cloaks, which are shown to considerably
reduce the soft spheres' scattering. Importantly, such cloaks also provide some
wave protection except for a countable set of frequencies, for which some large
elastic field enhancement (resonance peaks) can be observed within the cloaked
soft spheres, hence entailing a possible lack of wave protection. We further
present an investigation of trapped modes in elasticity via which we supply a
good approximation of such Mie-type resonances by some transcendental equation.
Next, after a detailed presentation of spherical elastodynamic PML of Cosserat
type, we introduce a novel generation of cloaks, the mixed cloaks, as a
solution to the lack of wave protection in elastodynamic cloaking. Indeed,
mixed cloaks achieve both invisibility cloaking and protection throughout a
large range of frequencies. We think, mixed cloaks will soon be generalized to
other areas of physics and engineering and will in particular foster studies in
experiments.

skymap S(n) from which N random, independent events are observed. Its exact
variance, which is due to the finite statistics, depends only on S(n) and N; we
also derive an unbiased estimator of the variance from the data. First-order
effects agree with previous analytic estimates. Importantly, heretofore
unidentified higher-order effects are found to contribute to the variance and
may cause the uncertainty to be significantly larger than previous analytic
estimates---potentially orders of magnitude larger. Neglect of these
higher-order terms, when significant, may result in a spurious detection of the
power spectrum. On the other hand, this would indicate the presence of
higher-order spatial correlations, such as a large bispectrum, providing new
clues about the sources. Numerical simulations are shown to support these
conclusions. Applying the formalism to an ensemble of Gaussian-distributed
skymaps, the noise-dominated part of the power spectrum uncertainty is
significantly increased at high multipoles by the new, higher-order effects.
This work is important for harmonic analyses of the distributions of diffuse
high-energy gamma-rays, neutrinos, and charged cosmic rays, as well as for
populations of sparse point sources such as active galactic nuclei.
