calculable from first principles using various theoretical approaches and of
interest for the understanding of a wide range of questions in many body
physics. Unfortunately, the pair correlation function $g(r)$ inferred from
neutron scattering measurements of the differential cross section $d\sigma
\over d\Omega$ from different measurements reported in the literature are
inconsistent. We have measured the energy dependence of the total cross section
and the scattering cross section for slow neutrons with energies between
0.43~meV and 16.1~meV on liquid hydrogen at 15.6~K (which is dominated by the
parahydrogen component) using neutron transmission measurements on the hydrogen
target of the NPDGamma collaboration at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory. The relationship between the neutron transmission
measurement we perform and the total cross section is unambiguous, and the
energy range accesses length scales where the pair correlation function is
rapidly varying. At 1~meV our measurement is a factor of 3 below the data from
previous work. We present evidence that these previous measurements of the
hydrogen cross section, which assumed that the equilibrium value for the ratio
of orthohydrogen and parahydrogen has been reached in the target liquid, were
in fact contaminated with an extra non-equilibrium component of orthohydrogen.
Liquid parahydrogen is also a widely-used neutron moderator medium, and an
accurate knowledge of its slow neutron cross section is essential for the
design and optimization of intense slow neutron sources. We describe our
measurements and compare them with previous work.

eclipsing contact binaries have prominently asymmetric eclipses and O Connell
effect (O Connell 1951) which increases with the decrease of the orbital
periods. This suggests that the O Connell effect is probably related to the
evolution of the orbital period in short period eclipsing binary systems.

one based on the Master or Fokker-Planck equation. Glansdorff and Prigogine
were the first to introduce a notion of excess entropy production rate
$\delta^2$EP and they suggested as sufficient stability criterion for a
nonequilibrium macroscopic condition that $\delta^2$EP be positive. We find for
nonlinear diffusions that their excess entropy production rate is itself the
time-derivative of a local free energy which is the close-to-equilibrium
functional governing macroscopic fluctuations. The positivity of the excess
$\delta^2$EP, for which we state a simple sufficient condition, is therefore
equivalent with the monotonicity in time of that functional in the relaxation
to steady nonequilibrium. There also appears a relation with recent extensions
of the Clausius heat theorem close-to-equilibrium. The positivity of
$\delta^2$EP immediately implies a Clausius (in)equality for the excess heat. A
final and related question concerns the operational meaning of fluctuation
functionals, nonequilibrium free energies, and how they make their entr\'ee in

this star, based on twenty-two NiI lines ([Ni/Fe]=-0.21$\pm$0.02); the
measurement is significantly below the mean found for most metal-poor stars.
Differences of up to 0.5 dex in [Ni/Fe] ratios were determined by different
authors for the same type of stars in the literature, which means that it is
not yet possible to conclude that there is a real intrinsic scatter in the
[Ni/Fe] ratios. For the other elements for which we obtained estimates, the
abundance patterns in these two stars match the Galactic trends defined by
giant and turnoff stars well. This confirms the value of horizontal-branch
stars as tracers of the chemical properties of stellar populations in the

previously published measurements by more than the expected statistical errors.

representing the soil voids, containing the same SOM functional groups. To
examine the effect of the hydrophobicity on the interaction, the organic
pollutants hexachlorobenzene (HCB, non-polar) and sulfanilamide (SAA, polar)

major points regarding sorption of SAA and HCB on soil. 1. The interaction
depends on the SOM chemical composition more than the SOM content. 2. The
interaction causes a site-specific adsorption on the soil surfaces. 3. Sorption
hysteresis occurs, which can be explained by inclusion of these pollutants
inside soil voids. 4. It was observed that the hydrophobic HCB is adsorbed on
soil stronger than the hydrophilic SAA. Moreover, the theoretical results
showed that HCB forms stable complexes with all SOM models in the aqueous
solution while most of SAA complexes are accompanied by dissociation. The

3$ vertices remains Hamiltonian even if we allow an adversary to remove
$\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ edges touching each vertex. In 1960 Ghouila-Houri obtained
an analogue statement for digraphs by showing that every directed graph on
$n\geq 3$ vertices with minimum in- and out-degree at least $n/2$ contains a
directed Hamilton cycle. Both statements quantify the robustness of complete
graphs (digraphs) with respect to the property of containing a Hamilton cycle.
  A natural way to generalize such results to arbitrary graphs (digraphs) is
using the notion of \emph{local resilience}. The local resilience of a graph
(digraph) $G$ with respect to a property $\mathcal{P}$ is the maximum number
$r$ such that $G$ has the property $\mathcal{P}$ even if we allow an adversary
to remove an $r$-fraction of (in- and out-going) edges touching each vertex.
The theorems of Dirac and Ghouila-Houri state that the local resilience of the
complete graph and digraph with respect to Hamiltonicity is $1/2$. Recently,
this statements have been generalized to random settings. Lee and Sudakov
(2012) proved that the local resilience of a random graph with edge probability
$p=\omega(\log n /n)$ with respect to Hamiltonicity is $1/2\pm o(1)$. For
random directed graphs, Hefetz, Steger and Sudakov (2014+) proved an analogue
statement, but only for edge probability $p=\omega(\log n/\sqrt{n})$. In this
paper we significantly improve their result to $p=\omega(\log^8 n/ n)$, which
is optimal up to the polylogarithmic factor.

full variational principle for the entropy. Finally, we introduce the notion of
strong uniform expansivity that generalizes the classical notion of positive
expansivity, and we prove time-dependent analogues of some well-known results.

to a mechanically induced Gaussian white noise. Power spectra of the surface

decreases with their mass, but increases with its shear modulus. The principal
resonant frequencies of the spheroidal modes of the gel of shear moduli ranging
from 55 Pa to 290 Pa were closest to the lowest Rayleigh mode of vibration of a
drop of pure water. These observations coupled with the fact that the resonance
frequency varies inversely as the square root of the mass in all cases suggest
that they primarily correspond to the capillary (or a pseudo-capillary) mode of

modulus of the gel. When the resonance frequencies are corrected for the
wetting angles, and plotted against the fundamental frequency scale
(gamma/mu)^0.5, all the data collapse nicely on a single plot provided that the

The vertex paradigm is a method for dealing non-perturbatively with the
Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) of asymptotically-free (AF) gauge theories such
as QCD, even in the face of necessary approximations. It provides a useful
truncation for the infinitely-many SDE of the gauge- and renormalization-group
invariant Pinch Technique (PT-RGI). We implement the vertex paradigm by
successive approximations at the one-dressed-loop level, postulating input
tree-level gluon and ghost propagators and a 3-gluon vertex that are
well-behaved in the infrared and also satisfy several crucial PT-RGI Ward
identities that are QED-like and ghost-free. Good IR behavior is assured by
including a (non-running) gauge-invariant dynamical gluon and ghost mass as
part of the input. The non-trivial part of the vertex paradigm is that, with
our inputs, the one-loop output vertex then satisfies the correct Ward identity
from which we can construct the output gluon propagator, by taking account of
Nambu-Goldstone-like massless scalars and related technical problems that arise
whenever there is dynamical gluon mass generation. The one-loop outputs show a
number of desirable features: They are PT-RGI; free of any reference to a
coupling (dimensional transmutation); satisfy the ghost-free Ward identities
connecting them; give exactly the known one-loop UV behavior; and are free of
IR singularities. We give a much simpler illustration of the main principles of
the vertex paradigm in a modified $\phi^3_6$ model that is AF. Our
successive-approximation scheme is not designed to estimate the gluon dynamical
mass, but it shows that there is a lower limit to the mass below which the AF
theory breaks down.

described that does not require pre-fabrication of a surface energy gradient.
The method relies upon the preparation of alternate hydrophilic/hydrophobic
stripes on a surface. When one side of this surface is exposed to steam, with
its other surface convectively cooled with cold water, steam condenses as a
continuous film on the hydrophilic stripes but as droplets on the hydrophobic
stripes. Coalescence leads to a random motion of the center of mass of the
fused drops on the surface, which are readily removed as they reach near the
boundary of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones thus resulting in a net
diffusive flux of the coalesced drops from the hydrophobic to the hydrophilic
stripes of the surface. Although an in-situ produced thermal gradient due to
differential heat transfer coefficients of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
stripes could provide additional driving force for such a motion, it is,
however, not a necessary condition for motion to occur. This method of creating
directed motion of drops does not require a pre-existing wettability gradient
and may have useful applications in thermal management devices.

We attempt to answer two questions. First, what fraction of the top-cited
articles are published in non-elite journals and how has this changed over
time. Second, what fraction of the total citations are to non-elite journals
and how has this changed over time.
  We studied citations to articles published in 1995-2013. We computed the 10
most-cited journals and the 1000 most-cited articles each year for all 261
subject categories in Scholar Metrics. We marked the 10 most-cited journals in
a category as the elite journals for the category and the rest as non-elite.
  There are two conclusions from our study. First, the fraction of top-cited
articles published in non-elite journals increased steadily over 1995-2013.
While the elite journals still publish a substantial fraction of high-impact
articles, many more authors of well-regarded papers in diverse research fields
are choosing other venues.
  The number of top-1000 papers published in non-elite journals for the
representative subject category went from 149 in 1995 to 245 in 2013, a growth
of 64%. Looking at broad research areas, 4 out of 9 areas saw at least
one-third of the top-cited articles published in non-elite journals in 2013.
For 6 out of 9 areas, the fraction of top-cited papers published in non-elite
journals for the representative subject category grew by 45% or more.
  Second, now that finding and reading relevant articles in non-elite journals
is about as easy as finding and reading articles in elite journals, researchers
are increasingly building on and citing work published everywhere. Considering
citations to all articles, the percentage of citations to articles in non-elite
journals went from 27% in 1995 to 47% in 2013. Six out of nine broad areas had
at least 50% of citations going to articles published in non-elite journals in

stars as a function of the metallicity in the Galaxy, using data from the
literature with available high-resolution spectroscopy. Our analysis excludes
stars exhibiting clear over-abundances of neutron-capture elements, and takes
into account the expected depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs due
to CN processing on the upper red-giant branch. This allows for the recovery of
the initial carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurate
assessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. The correction
procedure we develope is based on stellar-evolution models, and depends on the
surface gravity, log g, of a given star. Our analysis indicates that, for stars
with [Fe/H]<=-2.0, 20% exhibit [C/Fe]>=+0.7. This fraction increases to 43% for
[Fe/H]<=-3.0 and 81% for [Fe/H]<=-4.0, which is higher than have been
previously inferred without taking the carbon-abundance correction into
account. These CEMP-star frequencies provide important inputs for Galactic and
stellar chemical-evolution models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon at
early times and the possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We also
have developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections using our
procedure can be easily obtained.

media have been recently demonstrated to be governed by a hidden landscape that
is the solution of a Dirichlet problem expressed with the wave operator. In
this theory, the strength of Anderson localization confinement is determined by
this landscape, and continuously decreases as the energy increases. However,
this picture has to be changed in discrete lattices in which the eigenmodes
close to the edge of the first Brillouin zone are as localized as the low
energy ones. Here we show that in a 1D discrete lattice, the localization of
low and high energy modes is governed by two different landscapes, the high
energy landscape being the solution of a dual Dirichlet problem deduced from
the low energy one using the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate this
feature using the one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian with random on-site
potentials as a prototype model. Moreover we show that, besides unveiling the
subregions of Anderson localization, these dual landscapes also provide an
accurate overal estimate of the localization length over the energy spectrum,

efficient algorithms for constructing a minimum forcing set of a Miura-ori map,

provide tight bounds on the size of a forcing set, establishing that the
standard mountain-valley assignment for the Miura-ori is the one that requires
the most creases in its forcing sets. Additionally, given a partial
mountain/valley assignment to a subset of creases of a Miura-ori map, we
determine whether the assignment domain can be extended to a locally

properties, the distribution of dark matter in the dwarfs, and the detector
response. The method performs maximally powerful frequentist searches and
produces confidence limits on particle physics parameters. Probability
distributions of test statistics under various hypotheses are constructed

phase-space distribution of the Galactic halo. Such substructure can be
manifest in the spatial and/or velocity distributions of the stars in the halo.
This paper focuses on a class of substructure that is purely kinematic in
nature, with no accompanying spatial features. To study its properties, we use
a simulated stellar halo created by dynamically populating the Via Lactea II
high-resolution N-body simulation with stars. A significant fraction of the
stars in the inner halo of Via Lactea share a common speed and metallicity,
despite the fact that they are spatially diffuse. We argue that this kinematic
substructure is a generic feature of tidal debris from older mergers and may
explain the detection of radial-velocity substructure in the inner halo made by
the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. The GAIA
satellite, which will provide the proper motions of an unprecedented number of
stars, should further characterize the kinematic substructure in the inner
halo. Our study of the Via Lactea simulation suggests that the stellar halo can
be used to map the speed distribution of the local dark-matter halo, which has
important consequences for dark-matter direct-detection experiments.

in general mildly positive at $z=0$ ($\langle \nabla Age_{\mathrm{stars}}
\rangle= 0.04$ dex/dex) with significant differences between the models at
higher redshift. We demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion is
steepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0.2 dex by the
present day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-type
galaxies at large radii. Colour and metallicity gradients are significantly
steeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxies
with major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results.
This study highlights the importance of stellar accretion for stellar
population properties of massive galaxies at large radii, which can provide
important constraints for formation models.

fidelity with minimal tuning requirements. Our strategy combines gap protection
from the adiabatic theorem with dynamical decoupling in a complementary manner.
To avoid degenerate states and maximize the benefit of the gap protection, the
scheme is best suited when there are two different kinds of qubits (not
mutually resonant). Furthermore, we require a robust operating point in control
space where the qubits interact with little sensitivity to noise. This allows
us to circumvent a No-Go theorem that prevents block-box dynamically corrected
gates [Phys. Rev. A 80, 032314 (2009)]. We show how to apply our strategy to an
architecture in Si with P donors where we assume we can shuttle electrons
between different donors. Electron spins act as mobile ancillary qubits and P
nuclear spins act as long-lived data qubits. This system can have a very robust
operating point where the electron spin is bound to a donor in the quadratic
Stark shift regime. High fidelity single qubit gates may be performed using
well-established global magnetic resonance pulse sequences. Single electron
spin preparation and measurement has also been demonstrated. Putting this all
together, we present a robust universal gate set for quantum computation.

consistent with an universal initial binary fraction near unity and the binary
orbital parameter distributions of Kroupa (1995). With the exception of a few
possible outliers, we find that the data are to first-order consistent with the
universality hypothesis. Specifically, the present-day binary fractions inside
the half-mass radius r$_{\rm h}$ can be reproduced assuming either high initial
binary fractions near unity with a dominant soft binary component as in the
Kroupa distribution combined with high initial densities (10$^4$-10$^6$
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$), or low initial binary fractions ($\sim$ 5-10%) with a
dominant hard binary component combined with moderate initial densities near
their present-day values (10$^2$-10$^3$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$). This apparent
degeneracy can be broken using the binary fractions outside r$_{\rm h}$- only
high initial binary fractions with a significant soft component combined with
high initial densities can contribute to reproducing the observed
anti-correlation between the binary fractions outside r$_{\rm h}$ and the total
cluster mass. We further illustrate using the simulated present-day binary
orbital parameter distributions and the technique introduced in Leigh et al.
(2012) that the relative fractions of hard and soft binaries can be used to
further constrain the initial cluster density and mass-density relation. Our
results favour an initial mass-density relation of the form r$_{\rm h} \propto$

sources and absorbers of ionizing radiation in the post-reionization universe.
Previous studies show that the ionization rate should be very sensitive to
changes in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink in
size, increasing the ionizing mean free path and, hence, the ionizing
background. By contrast, observations of the ionizing background find a very
flat evolution from z~2-5, before falling precipitously at z~6. We resolve this
puzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~2-5, optically thick absorbers
are associated with the same collapsed halos that host ionizing sources. Thus,
an increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding
increase in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the
ionizing background. However, by z~5-6, gas outside of halos dominates the
absorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and the
ionizing background evolves rapidly. Our halo based model reproduces
observations of the ionizing background, its flatness and sudden decline, as
well as the redshift evolution of the ionizing mean free path. Our work
suggests that, through much of their history, both star formation and
photoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.

intergalactic medium prior to and during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The
method utilizes the Larmor precession of spin-polarized neutral hydrogen in the
triplet state of the hyperfine transition. This precession leads to a
systematic change in the brightness temperature fluctuations of the 21-cm line
from the high-redshift universe, and thus the statistics of these fluctuations
encode information about the magnetic field the atoms are immersed in. The
method is most suited to probing fields that are coherent on large scales; in
this paper, we consider a homogenous magnetic field over the scale of the 21-cm
fluctuations. Due to the long lifetime of the triplet state of the 21-cm
transition, this technique is naturally sensitive to extremely weak field
strengths, of order $10^{-19}$ G at a reference redshift of $\sim 20$ (or
$10^{-21}$ G if scaled to the present day). Therefore, this might open up the
possibility of probing primordial magnetic fields just prior to reionization.
If the magnetic fields are much stronger, it is still possible to use this
method to infer their direction, and place a lower limit on their strength. In
this paper (Paper I in a series on this effect), we perform detailed
calculations of the microphysics behind this effect, and take into account all
the processes that affect the hyperfine transition, including radiative decays,
collisions, and optical pumping by Lyman-$\alpha$ photons. We conclude with an
analytic formula for the brightness temperature of linear-regime fluctuations
in the presence of a magnetic field, and discuss its limiting behavior for weak
and strong fields.

no evidence of a similar CO in their electron-doped (n-type) counterparts. Here
we report resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) measurements which demonstrate the
presence of charge ordering in the n-type cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4 near optimal

periodicity, and along the same direction, as the CO in p-type cuprates.
However, in contrast to the latter, the CO onset in Nd2-xCexCuO4 is higher than
the pseudogap temperature, and is actually in the same temperature range where
antiferromagnetic fluctuations are first detected -- thereby showing that CO
and antiferromagnetic fluctuations are likely coupled in n-type cuprates.
Overall our discovery uncovers a missing piece of the cuprate phase diagram and
opens a parallel path to the study of CO and its relationship to other

Dynamics (MOND) limit. The MDA data emerging in cold/warm dark matter (C/WDM)
cosmological simulations disagree significantly with the tight MDA correlation

SID predicts a baryonic to apparent virial halo (dark matter) mass relation
which agrees well with the correlation deduced observationally assuming
Newtonian dynamics to be valid, while the baryonic to halo mass relation

dark-matter halo masses to baryonic masses may be empirical evidence for the
external field effect, which is predicted in SID as a consequence of the forces
acting between two galaxies depending on the position and mass of a third

crystals, hypothetical systems for which the lowest energy state performs a
periodic motion. We first discuss some general properties shared by time

their fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations fall into categories
analogous to acoustic and optical phonons, encountered in conventional
crystals. The acoustic phonons correspond to gapless Goldstone boson modes
parametrizing the broken time translation invariance of the crystal, whereas
the optical phonons are identified with modes perpendicular to the broken

large flow resistance in these porous layers, the permeability increases very
slowly or even remains at a small value although the porosity increases by a
large amount. Besides, due to the heterogeneous characteristic of the
dissolution, the chemical, mechanical and hydraulic apertures are very
different from each other. Further, simulations in complex porous structures
demonstrate that the existence of the porous layers of the nonreactive mineral
suppresses the wormholing phenomena observed in the dissolution of

pattern in both the dust polarization and molecular outflow. These data
dramatically illustrate the interplay between a high infall rate onto IRS1 and
a powerful outflow disrupting the dense, clumpy medium surrounding the star.
The images of the dust polarization and the CO outflow presented here provide
observational evidence for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between
the infall and the outflow. The spiral dust pattern, which rotates through over
180 degrees from IRS1, may be a clumpy filament wound up by conservation of
angular momentum in the infalling material. The redshifted CO emission ridge
traces the dust spiral closely through the MM dust cores, several of which may

have not been addressed so far due to known difficulties concerning
backreaction in semiclassical gravity. It seems reasonable to believe, however,
that the quantum fluctuations will ""classicalize"" when they become large
enough, after which backreaction can be treated in the general-relativistic

quantum field evolution during the unstable phase. By studying the appearance
of classical correlations and loss of quantum coherence, we show that by the
time backreaction becomes important the system already behaves classically.
Consequently, the gravity-induced instability leads naturally to initial

results give support to previous analyses which treat classically the

broad, with the bulk of BSSs spinning at less than ~40 km/s (in agreement with
the majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tail
reaching ~200 km/s. About 40% of the sample has vsini >40 km/s and about 20%

sources. The strong dependence of surface brightness dimming on redshift z
suggests the presence of a selection bias when searching for high-redshift
galaxies, i.e. we tend to detect only those galaxies with a high surface
brightness (SB). However, unresolved knots of emission are not affected by SB
dimming, thus providing a way to test the clumpiness of high-z galaxies. Our
strategy relies on the comparison of the total flux detected for the same
source in surveys characterized by different depth. For all galaxies, deeper
images permit the better investigation of low-SB features. Cosmological SB
dimming makes these low-SB features hard to detect when going to higher and
higher redshifts. We used the GOODS and HUDF Hubble Space Telescope legacy
datasets to study the effect of SB dimming on low-SB features of high-redshift
galaxies and compare it to the prediction for smooth sources. We selected a
sample of Lyman-break galaxies at z~4 (i.e. B-band dropouts) detected in all of
the datasets and found no significant trend when comparing the total magnitudes
measured from images with different depth. Through Monte Carlo simulations we
derived the expected trend for galaxies with different SB profiles. The
comparison to the datahints at a compact distribution for most of the
rest-frame ultraviolet light emitted from high-z galaxies.

Markov process X that drives the economy in discrete time. Many authors
extended his model to a continuous-time setting with a Markov diffusion process
X with state space R. Unfortunately, the continuous-time model fails to recover
an objective measure from a risk-neutral measure. We determine under which
information recovery is possible in the continuous-time model. It was proven

In this article, when X is transient under the objective measure, we
investigate what information is sufficient to recover.

concepts from agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the Bayes factors for

series. This facilitates crime series clustering, crime series identification,
and suspect prioritization. The ability of our models to make correct linkages

large number of solved and unsolved breaking and entering crimes. For example,
a na\""ive Bayes model for pairwise case linkage can identify 82\% of actual

77\%-89\% of the additional crimes in a crime series can be identified from a

Carlo simulations, mean-field arguments, and low-temperature effective field
theories. Our analysis reveals that the ground states of SU(4) edge- and SU(8)
face-sharing cubic lattice simplex solid models are long range ordered for
sufficiently large values of the discrete parameter, whereas the ground states
of the SU(3) models on the kagome (2D) and hyperkagome (3D) lattices are always
quantum disordered. The kagome simplex solid exhibits strong local order absent

rationalize with arguments similar to those leading to `order by disorder'.

the core of this group, which is spatially correlated with the central galaxy,
suggesting a connection between the two. The analysis of the optical spectrum
of the central galaxy showed no contribution by any recent AGN activity. Using
the star formation history as input to chemical evolution models, we predicted
the iron and oxygen mass released by supernovae (SNe) winds in the central
galaxy up to the present time. Comparing the predicted amount of mass released
by the NGC4325 galaxy to the ones derived through X-ray analysis we conclude
that the winds from the central galaxy alone play a minor role in the IGM metal
enrichment of this group inside r2500. The SNe winds are responsible for no
more than 3% of it and of the iron mass and 21% of the oxygen mass enclosed
within r2500. Our results suggest that oxygen has been produced in the early
stages of the group formation, becoming well mixed and leading to an almost
flat profile. Instead, the iron distribution is centrally peaked, indicating
that this element is still being added to the IGM specifically in the core by
the SNIa. A possible scenario to explain the elongated iron-rich structure in

numerical methods for solving low Mach number fluctuating hydrodynamic
equations appropriate for modeling diffusive mixing in isothermal mixtures of
fluids with different densities and transport coefficients. We treat viscous
dissipation implicitly using a recently-developed variable-coefficient Stokes
solver [ArXiv:1308.4605]. This allows us to increase the time step size
significantly compared to the earlier explicit temporal integrator. For
viscous-dominated flows, such as flows at small scales, we develop a scheme for
integrating the overdamped limit of the low Mach equations, in which inertia
vanishes and the fluid motion can be described by a steady Stokes equation. We
also describe how to incorporate advanced higher-order Godunov advection
schemes in the numerical method, allowing for the treatment of fluids with high
Schmidt number including the vanishing mass diffusion coefficient limit. We
incorporate thermal fluctuations in the description in both the inertial and
overdamped regimes. We apply our algorithms to model the development of giant
concentration fluctuations during the diffusive mixing of water and glycerol,
and compare numerical results with experimental measurements. We find good
agreement between the two, and observe propagative (non-diffusive) modes at
small wavenumbers (large spatial scales), not reported in published
experimental measurements of concentration fluctuations in fluid mixtures. Our
work forms the foundation for developing low Mach number fluctuating
hydrodynamics methods for miscible multi-species mixtures of chemically
reacting fluids.

have non-negligible interactions with the environment, and this generally
degrades the power of quantum protocols as it introduces noise. Counteracting
this by appropriately measuring the environment (and therefore projecting its
state) would require access all the necessary degrees of freedom, which in
practice can be far too hard to achieve. To better understand one's
limitations, we calculate the upper bound of optimal quantum erasure (i.e. the
highest recoverable visibility, or ""coherence""), when erasure is realistically
limited to an accessible subspace of the whole environment. In the particular
case of a two-dimensional accessible environment, the bound is given by the
sub-fidelity of two particular states of the \emph{inaccessible} environment,
which opens a new window into understanding the connection between correlated
systems. We also provide an analytical solution for a three-dimensional
accessible environment. This result provides also an interesting operational
interpretation of sub-fidelity. We end with a statistical analysis of the
expected visibility of an optimally erased random state and we find that 1) if
one picks a random pure state of 2 qubits, there is an optimal measurement that
allows one to distill a 1-qubit state with almost 90\% visibility and 2) if one
picks a random pure state of 2 qubits in an inaccessible environment, there is
an optimal measurement that allows one to distill a 1-qubit state with almost
twice its initial visibility.

decompose the far field scattered by subwavelength resonators in terms of
multipolar field components, providing explicit expressions for the multipolar
far fields. We apply this formulation to confirm that an isolated
high-permittivity cube resonator possesses frequency separated electric and
magnetic dipole resonances, as well as a magnetic quadrupole resonance in close
proximity to the electric dipole resonance. We then introduce multiple
dielectric gaps to the resonator geometry in a manner suggested by perturbation
theory, and demonstrate the ability to overlap the electric and magnetic dipole
resonances, thereby enabling directional scattering by satisfying the first
Kerker condition. We further demonstrate the ability to push the quadrupole
resonance away from the degenerate dipole resonances to achieve local behavior.
These properties are confirmed through the multipolar expansion and show that
the use of geometries suggested by perturbation theory is a viable route to
achieve purely dipole resonances for metamaterial applications such as
wave-front manipulation with Huygens' metasurfaces. Our results are fully

problem which has generated much recent interest. However, to date there are no
implementations of these algorithms for curves on surfaces with provable

similarity measure for any two cycles that are homologous, where we calculate
the minimum area of any homology (or connected bounding chain) between the two
cycles. The minimum area homology exists for broader classes of cycles than
previous measures which are based on homotopy. It is also much easier to
compute than previously defined measures, yielding an efficient implementation
that is based on linear algebra tools. We demonstrate our algorithm on a range
of inputs, showing examples which highlight the feasibility of this similarity

vector time series in the sense that we seek for a contemporaneous linear
transformation for a $p$-variate time series such that the transformed series
is segmented into several lower-dimensional subseries, and those subseries are
uncorrelated with each other both contemporaneously and serially. Therefore
those lower-dimensional series can be analysed separately as far as the linear
dynamic structure is concerned. Technically it boils down to an eigenanalysis
for a positive definite matrix. When $p$ is large, an additional step is
required to perform a permutation in terms of either maximum cross-correlations
or FDR based on multiple tests. The asymptotic theory is established for both
fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity.
Numerical experiments with both simulated and real data sets indicate that the
proposed method is an effective initial step in analysing multiple time series
data, which leads to substantial dimension reduction in modelling and
forecasting high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. Unlike PCA for
independent data, there is no guarantee that the required linear transformation
exists. When it does not, the proposed method provides an approximate
segmentation which leads to the advantages in, for example, forecasting for
future values. The method can also be adapted to segment multiple volatility
processes.

galaxy Mrk 335 in the low-flux state obtained with Suzaku. The data are
compared to a 2006 high-flux Suzaku observation when the source was ~10-times
brighter. Describing the two flux levels self-consistently with partial
covering models would require extreme circumstances, as the source would be
subject to negligible absorption during the bright state and ninety-five per
cent covering with near Compton-thick material when dim. Blurred reflection
from an accretion disc around a nearly maximum spinning black hole (a>0.91,
with preference for a spin parameter as high as ~ 0.995) appears more likely
and is consistent with the long-term and rapid variability. Measurements of the
emissivity profile and spectral modelling indicate the high-flux Suzaku
observation of Mrk 335 is consistent with continuum-dominated, jet-like
emission (i.e. beamed away from the disc). It can be argued that the ejecta
must be confined to within ~25 rg if it does not escape the system. During the
low-flux state the corona becomes compact and only extends to about 5 rg from
the black hole, and the spectrum becomes reflection-dominated. The
low-frequency lags measured at both epochs are comparable indicating that the
accretion mechanism is not changing between the two flux levels. Various
techniques to study the spectral variability (e.g. principal component
analysis, fractional variability, difference spectra, and hardness ratio
analysis) indicate that the low-state variability is dominated by changes in
the power law flux and photon index, but that changes in the ionisation state
of the reflector are also required. Most notably, the ionisation parameter
becomes inversely correlated with the reflected flux after a long-duration
flare-like event during the observation.

Reprogramming is a non-equilibrium process involving a collaboration at levels
separated by orders of magnitude in time scale, namely transcription factor
binding/unbinding, protein synthesis/degradation, and epigenetic histone
modification. We propose a model of reprogramming by integrating these
temporally separated processes and show that stable states on the epigenetic
landscape should be viewed as a superposition of basin minima generated in the
fixed histone states. Slow histone modification is responsible for the narrow
valleys connecting the pluripotent and differentiated states on the epigenetic
landscape, and the pathways which largely overlap with these valleys explain
the observed heterogeneity of latencies in reprogramming. We show that histone
dynamics also creates an intermediary state observed in experiments. A change

for these galaxies, as well as its evolution. The amplitude of this relation
reflects the typical compactness of dark halos at the time when most of the
stars are formed. This link between size and star formation epoch is propagated
in galaxy mergers. Mergers of high or moderate mass ratio (less than 1:3)
become increasingly important with increasing present day stellar mass for
galaxies more massive than $10^{11.4}M_{\odot}$. At lower masses, low mass
ratio mergers play a more important role. In situ star formation contribute
more to the size growth than it does to stellar mass growth. We also find that,
for ETGs identified at $z=2$, minor mergers dominate subsequent growth both for
stellar mass and in size, consistent with earlier theoretical results.

relative entropies are studied. These relative entropies, which we term
relative $\alpha$-entropies (denoted $\mathscr{I}_{\alpha}$), arise as
redundancies under mismatched compression when cumulants of compressed lengths
are considered instead of expected compressed lengths. These parametric
relative entropies are a generalization of the usual relative entropy
(Kullback-Leibler divergence). Just like relative entropy, these relative
$\alpha$-entropies behave like squared Euclidean distance and satisfy the
Pythagorean property. Minimizers of these relative $\alpha$-entropies on closed
and convex sets are shown to exist. Such minimizations generalize the maximum
R\'{e}nyi or Tsallis entropy principle. The minimizing probability distribution
(termed forward $\mathscr{I}_{\alpha}$-projection) for a linear family is shown
to obey a power-law. Other results in connection with statistical inference,
namely subspace transitivity and iterated projections, are also established. In
a companion paper, a related minimization problem of interest in robust
statistics that leads to a reverse $\mathscr{I}_{\alpha}$-projection is
studied.

experience that a hot cup of coffee cools down to room temperature and it never
automatically becomes hot (unless we put that in a microwave for heating or on
stove etc) and there are numerous examples. This ""one sidedness"" of physical
processes (like cooling of hot cup) is in apparent contradiction with the time
reversibility of the dynamical equations of motion (classical or quantum). The
process of automatic heating of a cold cup etc is perfectly possible from the
dynamical equations perspective. Ludwig Boltzmann explained this ""one
sidedness"" of physical processes starting from dynamical equations (his
H-theorem). A criticism was raised by Boltzmann's contemporaries. The origin of
this criticism lies in the very philosophy of ""mechanism"" that was very
prevalent in the 19th century. Everyone wanted to understand physical phenomena
through Newtonian mechanics (even J. C. Maxwell devised a mechanical mechanism
using gears to explain the electromagnetic field!). The central issue was how
can one obtain this ""one sidedness"" (time irreversiblility) if the underlying
dynamical laws are time reversible. Number of articles exist in literature on
the issue. But those are mathematically oriented and a simple presentation from
practical point of view is seriously lacking. This article is an attempt to
de-mystify this ""paradox"" from simple and practical point of view.

of the injection current through the SFIFS junction on the maximum Josephson

amplification properties when the operating point was chosen in the sub-gap
region of the acceptor CVC. By applying an AC signal (in the kHz range) while
biasing the injector (SFIFS) junction with a constant DC current, we observed a

also generalize well-known tools from pseudoline arrangements such as sweeps or

  -3/2 rule","A draft manuscript",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the research scope of forest stand self-thinning, the analysis reveals a
broad picture in which the -3/2 rule takes a definite and special place. The
application of the simple geometrical model to the Douglas-fir and Scots pine
data suggests that the slope of the self-thinning curve will not remain
constant during the course of growth and self-thinning of a single forest
stand. Most probable, at the initial stages of stand growth the slope will be
less than -3/2 and at old ages of the stand the slope will be higher than -3/2.
Inevitably, a time will come when the slope is exactly equals -3/2. In other
words, the slope -3/2 is an obligatory state in the course of self-thinning of
a forest stand. At the very time of -3/2 slope two particular features coincide
with it. One is that the total bole surface area remains constant. The length
of the constancy stage would probably vary with species, initial stand
densities, their spatial arrangements, conditions of growth, and other specific
factors. Another feature of the time is that a geometric similarity in the
growth of the forest stand takes place, which is not in a contradiction with
the -3/2 rule as it had been formulated by its authors. To put it shortly, the
slope -3/2: i) is a very specific and obligatory state in the process of forest
stand growth and ii) is not an asymptote but rather a transitional point (span)
in the time of growth. These two assertions may be called a transitional status
of the -3/2 rule. The geometric model of a forest stand (Gavrikov, 2014) has
proved to be rather helpful at analyzing of real forest stand structure and
dynamics. Despite of its extreme simplicity (it uses cones as representations
of trees) the model looks like having enough similarity with real even-aged
forests since the model's predictions are often reasonably close to measured
values of power exponents.

found that 15 month after the incident concentrations of radiocesium in the
Japan and Okhotsk seas were at background or slightly increased level, while
they had increased values in the subarctic front area east of Japan. The
highest concentrations of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs up to 13.5 ${\pm}$ 0.9 and
22.7 ${\pm}$ 1.5 Bq m$^{-3}$ have been found to exceed ten times the background
levels before the accident. Maximal content of radiocesium was observed within
subsurface and intermediate water layers inside the cores of anticyclonic
eddies (100 - 500 m). Even slightly increased content of radiocesium was found
at some eddies at depth of 1000 m. It is expected that convergence and
subduction of surface water inside eddies are main mechanisms of downward
transport of radionuclides. In situ observations are compared with the results
of simulated advection of these radioisotopes by the AVISO altimetric velocity
field. Different Lagrangian diagnostics are used to reconstruct the history and
origin of synthetic tracers imitating measured seawater samples collected in
each of those eddies. The results of observations are consistent with the
simulated results. It is shown that the tracers, simulating water samples with
increased radioactivity to be measured in the cruise, really visited the areas
with presumably high level of contamination. Fast water advection between
anticyclonic eddies and convergence of surface water inside eddies make them
responsible for spreading, accumulation and downward transport of cesium rich
water to the intermediate depth in the frontal zone.

been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible
logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available
because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing
feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits
have been reported in the literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed
the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate
suitable for sequential building block i.e. T flip-flop and hence designing low
cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the
circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose
designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization
parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available
in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible
circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been
reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM.Because of
non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our
results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the
sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits,
handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in
reverse direction by reversing the original output.

subset Pi of the symmetric group S_3. An instance of such a problem consists of
a set of variables V and a set of constraints C, where each constraint is an
ordered triple of distinct elements from V. The goal is to construct a linear
order alpha on V such that, for each constraint (a,b,c) in C, the ordering of
a,b,c induced by alpha is in Pi. Excluding symmetries and trivial cases there
are 11 such problems, and their complexity is well known. Here we consider the
variant of the problem, denoted 2-Pi, where we are allowed to construct two
linear orders alpha and beta and each constraint needs to be satisfied by at
least one of the two. We give a full complexity classification of all 11 2-Pi
problems, observing that in the switch from one to two linear orders the
complexity landscape changes quite abruptly and that hardness proofs become
rather intricate. We then focus on one of the 11 problems in particular, which
is closely related to the '2-Caterpillar Compatibility' problem in the
phylogenetics literature. We show that this particular CSP remains hard on
three linear orders, and also in the biologically relevant case when we swap
three linear orders for three phylogenetic trees, yielding the '3-Tree
Compatibility' problem. Due to the biological relevance of this problem we also
give extremal results concerning the minimum number of trees required, in the
worst case, to satisfy a set of rooted triplet constraints on n leaf labels.

power and speed requirements of future computing devices. In reversible
computing logic gates used are such that input can be generated by reversing
the operation from output. A number of reversible combinational circuits have
been developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not significant due to
feedback and fanout was not allowed. However, allowing feedback in space, a
very few sequential logic blocks i.e. flip-flops have been reported in
literature. In order to develop sequential circuits, flip-flops are used in
conventional circuits. Also good circuit design methods, optimized and fault
tolerant designs are also needed to build large, complex and reliable circuits
in conventional computing. Reversible flip-flops are the basic memory elements
that will be the building block of memory for reversible computing and quantum
computing devices. In this dissertation we plan to address above issues. First
we have proposed a Pareek gate suitable for low-cost flip-flops design and then
design methodology to develop flip-flops are illustrated. Further almost all
flip-flops and some example circuit have been developed and finally these
circuits have been converted into fault tolerant circuits by preserving their

users. This paper analyzes users' rights into ten broad principles, as a basis
for assessing what users regard as important and for comparing different
multi-issue Internet policy proposals. Stability of the principles is
demonstrated in an experimental survey, which also shows that freedoms of users
to participate in the design and coding of platforms appear to be viewed as
inessential relative to other rights. An analysis of users' rights frameworks
that have emerged over the past twenty years similarly shows that such
proposals tend to leave out freedoms related to software platforms, as opposed
to user data or public networks. Evaluating policy frameworks in a comparative
analysis based on prior principles may help people to see what is missing and
what is important as the future of the Internet continues to be debated.

HD 189733b and HD 209458b as an exoplanet with a large array of observational
constraints on its atmospheric properties. Because WASP-43b receives a similar
stellar flux as HD 209458b but has a rotation rate 4 times faster and a much
higher gravity, studying WASP-43b serves as a test of the effect of rotation
rate and gravity on the circulation when stellar irradiation is held
approximately constant. Here we present 3D atmospheric circulation models of
WASP-43b using the SPARC/MITgcm, a coupled radiation and circulation model,
exploring the effects of composition, metallicity, and frictional drag. We find
that the circulation regime of WASP-43b is not unlike other hot Jupiters, with
equatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and large
day-night temperature variations (~600 K at photospheric pressures). We then
compare our model results to observations from Stevenson et al. which utilize
HST/WFC3 to collect spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of WASP-43b
from 1.12-1.65 microns. Our results show the 5x solar model lightcurve provides
a good match to the data, with a phase offset of peak flux and planet/star flux
ratio that is similar to observations; however, the model nightside appears to
be brighter. Nevertheless, our 5x solar model provides an excellent match to
the WFC3 dayside emission spectrum. This is a major success, as the result is a
natural outcome of the 3D dynamics with no model tuning, and differs
significantly from 1D models that can generally only match observations when
appropriately tuned. In sum, these results demonstrate that 3D circulation
models can provide important insights in interpreting exoplanet atmospheric
observations, even at high spectral resolution, and highlight the potential for
future observations with HST, JWST and other next-generation telescopes.

J=17.5-20.8 and K=16.1-18.5 mag. Spectra were acquired for six objects with the
LIRIS and NIRSPEC instruments mounted on the 4.2-m WHT and the 10-m Keck II

ACAM/WHT. The new data confirm the low temperatures of all seven Pleiades
candidates. From the imaging observations, we find extremely red Z-J and Z-K
colors that suggest that the faintest target, Calar Pleiades 25, has a Galactic
rather than extragalactic nature. We tentatively classify the spectroscopic
targets from early-L to ~T0 and suggest that the L/T transition, which accounts
for the onset of methane absorption at 2.1 micron, may take place at J,K ~
20.3, 17.8 mag in the Pleiades (absolute values of M_J ~ 14.7 and M_K ~ 12.2

of triangular-shape H-band fluxes and the high flux ratio K/H (compatible with
red H-K colors) of Calar Pleiades 20, 21, and 22, which is a feature also seen
in field low-gravity dwarfs. Weak KI absorption lines at around 1.25 micron are
probably seen in two targets. These observations add support to the cluster
membership of all seven objects in the Pleiades. The trend delineated by the
spectroscopic sequence of Pleiades late-M and L dwarfs resembles that of the
field. With masses estimated at 0.012-0.015 Msol (solar metallicity and 120
Myr), Calar Pleiades 20 (L6 +/- 1), 21 (L7 +/- 1), and 22 (L/T) may become the
coolest and least massive Pleiades members that are corroborated with

statistical mechanical model it can be thought of as a dimer model or as a
certain random surface. We consider the Aztec diamond with a two-periodic
weighting which exhibits all three possible phases that occur in these types of
models, often referred to as solid, liquid and gas. To analyze this model, we
use entries of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix which give the probability of any
configuration of dominoes. A formula for these entries, for this particular
model, was derived by Chhita and Young (2014). In this paper, we find a major
simplification of this formula expressing entries of the inverse Kasteleyn
matrix by double contour integrals which makes it possible to investigate their
asymptotics. In a part of the Aztec diamond, where the asymptotic analysis is
simpler, we use this formula to show that the entries of the inverse Kasteleyn
matrix converge to the known entries of the full-plane inverse Kasteleyn
matrices for the different phases. We also study the detailed asymptotics of
the inverse Kasteleyn matrix at both the ""liquid-solid"" and ""liquid-gas""
boundaries, and find the extended Airy kernel in the next order asymptotics.
Finally we provide a potential candidate for a combinatorial description of the
liquid-gas boundary.

of both missing data and outliers. The objective is to explicitly infer the
underlying low-CP-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse
tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus
providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The
low-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple
latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical
prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-$t$
distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element
independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient closed-form
variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively
prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast
to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically
and implicitly without need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can
discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity
inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between
the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in
the sense of maximum model evidence. The extensive experiments and comparisons
with many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiorities of our method from several perspectives.

distributions and transition densities of nuclei. This tool will soon be
available for short-lived neutron-rich nuclei. [Purpose] Beyond mean-field
methods have been successfully applied to the study of excitation spectra of
nuclei in the whole nuclear chart. These methods permit to determine energies
and transition probabilities starting from an effective in-medium
nucleon-nucleon interaction but without other phenomenological ingredients.
Such a method has recently been extended to calculate the charge density of
nuclei deformed at the mean-field level of approximation [J. M. Yao et al.,
Phys. Rev. C86, 014310 (2012)]. The aim of this work is to further extend the
method to the determination of transition densities between low-lying excited
states. [Method] The starting point of our method is a set of
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov wave functions generated with a constraint on the axial
quadrupole moment and using a Skyrme energy density functional. Correlations
beyond the mean field are introduced by projecting mean-field wave functions on
angular-momentum and particle number and by mixing the symmetry restored wave
functions.[Results] We give in this paper detailed formulae derived for the
calculation of densities and form factors. These formulae are rather easy to
obtain when both initial and final states are $0^+$ states but are far from
being trivial when one of the states has a finite $J$-value. Illustrative
applications to $^{24}$Mg and to the even-mass $^{58-68}$Ni have permitted to
analyse the main features of our method, in particular the effect of
deformation on densities and form factors. An illustration calculation of both
elastic and inelastic scattering form factors is presented....

existing achievability results for the AWGN channel, our result implies that
the presence of feedback does not improve the second- and third-order

quasi-NGM generated by a coupling of one conventional ZMand one quasi-ZM, which
is originated from the enhanced symmetry, or two quasi-ZMs. We find that,
depending on the moduli, some NGMs can change to quasi-NGMs and vice versa with
preserving the total number of gapless modes. The dispersion relations are
systematically calculated by a perturbation theory. The general result is

the analytic continuation to the complex pole using Pad\'e approximants.
Precise theoretical parameterizations of pion-pion scattering phase shifts
based on once-- and twice-- subtracted dispersion relations are used as input,
whose functional form allows us to show the benefit and accuracy of the method.
In particular, we extract from these parametrization the pole positions of the
$f_0(500)$ at $\sqrt{s}=(453\pm 15) - i(297 \pm 15)$ MeV, the $\rho(770)$ at
$\sqrt{s}=(761.4\pm 1.2)-i(71.8 \pm 1.0)$ MeV, and the pole of the $f_2(1270)$,
located at $\sqrt{s}=(1267.3\pm 1.7)-i(95.0\pm 2.3)$ MeV. The couplings of the
resonances to two pions are also determined with high precision, obtaining
respectively, $3.8\pm 0.4$ GeV, $5.92\pm 0.15$ and $4.41\pm 0.23$ GeV$^{-1}$.
Special attention is dedicated to the systematic treatment of the theoretical
and statistical uncertainties, together with their comparison with previous
determinations.

taking into account the anharmonicity of the tether between the motor and cargo

a bidirectional mechanochemical coupling. For realistic parameters, the maximal
thermodynamic efficiency can be transiently about 50% as observed for kinesins,
and even larger, surprisingly also in a novel strongly anomalous (sub)transport
regime, where the motor enzymatic turnovers become also anomalously slow and

optimization problem for maximizing the secondary user throughput while
guaranteeing the stability of the primary user queue. We consider a general
cooperation policy where the packet admission and queue selection
probabilities, at the secondary user, are both dependent on the state (length)
of the finite relaying buffer. Despite the sheer complexity of the optimization
problem, attributed to its non-convexity, we transform it to a linear program.
Our numerical results reveal a number of valuable insights, e.g., it is always
mutually beneficial to cooperate in delivering the primary packets in terms of
expanding the stable throughput region. In addition, the stable throughput
region of the system, compared to the case of infinite relaying queue capacity,
marginally shrinks for limited relaying queue capacity.

supernovae (CCSNe) are luminous blue variables (LBVs), perhaps including some
`superluminous supernovae' (SLSNe). We examine models in which massive stars
gain mass soon after the end of core hydrogen burning. These are mainly
intended to represent mergers following a brief contact phase during early Case
B mass transfer, but may also represent stars which gain mass in the
Hertzsprung Gap or extremely late during the main-sequence phase for other
reasons. The post-accretion stars spend their core helium-burning phase as blue
supergiants (BSGs), and many examples are consistent with being LBVs at the
time of core collapse. Other examples are yellow supergiants at explosion. We
also investigate whether such post-accretion stars may explode successfully
after core collapse. The final core properties of post-accretion models are
broadly similar to those of single stars with the same initial mass as the
pre-merger primary star. More surprisingly, when early Case B accretion does
affect the final core properties, the effect appears likely to favour a
successful SN explosion, i.e., to make the core properties more like those of a
lower-mass single star. However, the detailed structures of these cores
sometimes display qualitative differences to any single-star model we have
calculated. The rate of appropriate binary mergers may match the rate of SNe
with immediate LBV progenitors; for moderately optimistic assumptions we
estimate that the progenitor birthrate is ~1% of the CCSN rate.

defined in terms of the surfactant concentration at the contact line and the
equilibrium contact angle $(\theta_e^0)$ of the clean surface using the
nonlinear equation of state for surface tension. Further, the surface forces
are included in the model as the surface divergence of the surface stress

surface gradient of the surfactant concentration on the free surface. In
addition to a mesh convergence study and validation of the numerical results

can be selectively and coherently manipulated by multiphoton transitions using
the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [Yusa et al., Nature

providing statistical information about the accuracy generally achieved by the
softwares for automatic surface photometry of galaxies. Results. For each
galaxy and for each photometric band the GASPHOT catalogs provide the
parameters of the Sersic law best-fitting the luminosity profiles. They are:
the sky coordinates of the galaxy center (R:A:; DEC:), the total magnitude (m),
the semi-major axis of the effective isophote (Re), the Sersic index (n), the
axis ratio (b=a) and a flag parameter (QFLAG) giving a global indication of the
fit quality. The WINGS-GASPHOT database includes 41,463 galaxies in the B-band,
42,275 in the V-band, and 71,687 in the K-band. We find that the bright
early-type galaxies have larger Sersic indices and effective radii, as well as
redder colors in their center. In general the effective radii increase
systematically from the K- to the V- and B-band. Conclusions. The GASPHOT
photometry turns out to be in fairly good agreement with the surface photometry
obtained by GALFIT and GIM2D, as well as with the aperture photometry provided
by SExtractor. The main advantages of GASPHOT with respect to other tools are:
(i) the automatic finding of the local PSF; (ii) the short CPU time of
execution; (iii) the remarkable stability against the choice of the initial
guess parameters. All these characteristics make GASPHOT an ideal tool for
blind surface photometry of large galaxy samples in wide-field CCD mosaics.

qualitative spatial relations between regions, such as adjacency, overlap and
parthood, can be expressed. While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most
current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or
three-dimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly
interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean
spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented
using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction
to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations.
First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be
restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in
respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the
relation 'partially overlaps' is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8
networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation
'part of' are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly
realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8
network with 2n+1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the
n-dimensional Euclidean space.

various notions of process equivalence, ranging, on the so-called

strong bisimilarity to coarse-grained ones such as trace equivalence. The
theory of concurrent systems at large has benefited from developments in

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, where $T$ is the teleparallel
torsion scalar. We show that vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor
$\mathcal{T}^{\mu \nu}$ of matter does not imply vanishing of the teleparallel
torsion scalar, in contrast to general relativity, where the Ricci scalar
vanishes. The theory provides an exponential (inflationary) scale factor
independent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained
$f(T)$ acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model.
Nevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open
universe provides a decaying pattern of the $f(T)$ contributing directly to
solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant. The equation of
state (EoS) of the torsion vacuum fluid has been studied in positive and
negative Hubble regimes. We study the case when the torsion is made of a scalar
field (tlaplon) which acts as torsion potential. This treatment enables to
induce a tlaplon field sensitive to the symmetry of the spacetime in addition
to the reconstruction of its effective potential from the $f(T)$ theory. The
theory provides six different versions of inflationary models. The real

application in computer science ranging from compressed sensing, learning
theory, numerical linear algebra, to privacy. This paper explores the
properties and applications of a distribution of random matrices. Our
distribution satisfies {\sf JLP} with desirable properties like fast
matrix-vector multiplication, sparsity, and optimal subspace embedding. We can
sample a random matrix from this distribution using exactly $2n+n \log n$
random bits. We show that a random matrix picked from this distribution
preserves differential privacy under the condition that the input private
matrix satisfies certain spectral property. This improves the run-time of
various differentially private mechanisms like Blocki {\it et al.} (FOCS 2012)
and Upadhyay (ASIACRYPT 13). Our final construction has a bounded column
sparsity. Therefore, this answers an open problem stated in Blocki {\it et al.}
(FOCS 2012). Using the results of Baranuik {\it et al.} (Constructive
Approximation: 28(3)), our result implies a randomness efficient matrices that
satisfies the Restricted-Isometry Property of optimal order for small sparsity
with exactly linear random bits.
  We also show that other known distributions of sparse random matrices with
the {\sf JLP} does not preserves differential privacy; thereby, answering one
of the open problem posed by Blocki {\it et al.} (FOCS 2012). Extending on the
works of Kane and Nelson (JACM: 61(1)), we also give unified analysis of some
of the known Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform. We also present a self-contained
simplified proof of an inequality on quadratic form of Gaussian variables that

detected previously due to X-ray variability. Twelve sources show significant
long-term variability, with no correlated spectral changes. Seven sources are
transient candidates. One ULX coincides with an extremely blue star cluster
(B-V = -0.7). We confirm that the global relation between the number and
luminosity of ULXs and the integrated star formation rate (SFR) of the host
galaxy also holds on local scales. We investigate the effects of dust
extinction and/or age on the X-ray binary (XRB) population on sub-galactic
scales. The distributions of Nx and Lx are peaked at L(IR)/L(NUV)~1, which may
be associated with an age of ~10 Myr for the underlying stellar population. We
find that ~1/3 of the XRBs are located in close proximity to young star
complexes. The luminosity function of the X-ray binaries is consistent with
that typical for high-mass X-ray binaries, and appears unaffected by
variability. We disentangle and compare the X-ray diffuse spectrum with that of
the bright XRBs. The hot interstellar medium dominates the diffuse X-ray
emission at E<1 keV, has a temperature kT=0.28 (+0.05/-0.04) keV and intrinsic

energy. In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, tens to
hundreds of tidal turbines need to be placed within an array. The layout of
these turbines can have a significant impact on the power extracted and hence
on the viability of the site. Funke et al. formulated the question of the best
turbine layout as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water
equations and solved it using a local, gradient-based optimisation algorithm.
Given the local nature of this approach, the question arises of how optimal the
layouts actually are. This becomes particularly important for scenarios with
complex bathymetry and layout constraints, both of which typically introduce
locally optimal layouts. Optimisation algorithms which find the global optima
generally require orders of magnitude more iterations than local optimisation
algorithms and are thus infeasible in combination with an expensive flow model.
This paper presents an analytical wake model to act as an efficient proxy to
the shallow water model. Based upon this, a hybrid global-local two-stage
optimisation approach is presented in which turbine layouts are first optimised
with the analytical wake model via a global optimisation algorithm, and further
optimised with the shallow water model via a local gradient-based optimisation
algorithm. This procedure is applied to a number of idealised cases and a more
realistic case with complex bathymetry in the Pentland Firth, Scotland. It is
shown that in cases where bathymetry is considered, the two-stage optimisation
procedure is able to improve the power extracted from the array by as much as
25% compared to local optimisation for idealised scenarios and by as much as
12% for the more realistic Pentland Firth scenario whilst in many cases
reducing the overall computation time by approximately 35%.

subinterval of the unit interval. Any such power time change in the extremal
process for $0<\beta<1$ produces a process with stationary max-increments. This
deceptively simple time change hides the much more delicate structure of the
resulting process as a self-affine random sup measure. We uncover this
structure and show that in a certain range of the parameters this random
measure arises as a limit of the partial maxima of the same long memory stable
sequence, but in a different space. These results open a way to construct a
whole new class of self-similar Fr\'echet processes with stationary
max-increments.

energy of the projectile. This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy
shot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR)
electromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate
for future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile
(several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While
the primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of
targets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter
airplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large
initial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this
study we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation
delivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a
contemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun
outperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first
draft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path
of the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and
the aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed
within the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the
feasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of
the limits of the technology. It is envisioned that this baseline design can be
used as a helpful starting point for discussions of a possible electrical
weaponization of future European warships.

accurate understanding of the r-process nucleosynthesis mechanism. Using
microscopic density functional theory with a representative set of

80 K in Teff , 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in mass
and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and random
errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise and
accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their mean
values and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however,
systematic underlying trends with Teff and log g. Our effective temperature
scale is between 0-200 K cooler than that expected from the Infrared Flux
Method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for a
lower value on average than that inferred for the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC).
We find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric KIC and
spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in KIC
metallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in Teff

recover the sparse signals, we propose a new method called multiple orthogonal
least squares (MOLS), which extends the well-known orthogonal least squares
(OLS) algorithm by allowing multiple $L$ indices to be chosen per iteration.
Owing to inclusion of multiple support indices in each selection, the MOLS
algorithm converges in much fewer iterations and improves the computational
efficiency over the conventional OLS algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that
MOLS ($L > 1$) performs exact recovery of all $K$-sparse signals within $K$
iterations if the measurement matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property
(RIP) with isometry constant $\delta_{LK} < \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{K} + 2
\sqrt{L}}.$ The recovery performance of MOLS in the noisy scenario is also
studied. It is shown that stable recovery of sparse signals can be achieved
with the MOLS algorithm when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scales linearly

of non-epistatic landscapes, and so it stands to reason that there exist
dynamical phenomena that can only be realized in the presence of epistasis.
Here, we compare evolutionary dynamics on all finite epistatic landscapes
versus all finite non-epistatic landscapes, under weak mutation. We first
analyze the mean fitness trajectory - that is, the time course of the expected
fitness of a population. We show that for any epistatic fitness landscape and
starting genotype, there always exists a non-epistatic fitness landscape and
starting genotype that produces the exact same mean fitness trajectory. Thus,
surprisingly, the space of mean fitness trajectories that can be realized by
epistatic landscapes is no more diverse than the space of mean fitness
trajectories that can be realized by non-epistatic landscapes. On the other
hand, we show that epistatic fitness landscapes can produce dynamics in the
time-evolution of the variance in fitness across replicate populations and in
the time-evolution of the expected number of substitutions that cannot be
produced by any non-epistatic landscape. These results on identifiability have
implications for efforts to infer epistasis from the types of data often
measured in experimental populations.

neutron star models adopting realistic equations of state for the neutron
star's core and crust. For scalar-tensor theories that allow for spontaneous
scalarization, the crust thickness can be significantly smaller than in general
relativity. We derive the perturbation equation describing torsional
oscillations in scalar-tensor theory, and we solve the corresponding eigenvalue
problem to find the oscillation frequencies. The fundamental mode (overtone)
frequencies become smaller (larger) than in general relativity for scalarized
stellar models. Torsional oscillation frequencies may yield information on the
crust microphysics if microphysics effects are not degenerate with
strong-gravity effects, such as those due to scalarization. To address this
issue, we consider two different models for the equation of state of the crust
and we look at the effects of electron screening. The effect of scalarization
on torsional oscillation frequencies turns out to be smaller than uncertainties
in the microphysics for all spontaneous scalarization models allowed by binary
pulsar observations. Our study shows that the observation of quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) following giant flares can be used to constrain the
microphysics of neutron star crusts, whether spontaneous scalarization occurs

star clusters located in crowded stellar fields in nearby galaxies is needed
for homogeneous processing of archival frames.
  Aims. We have developed a program that automatically derives the structural
parameters of star clusters and estimates errors by accounting for individual
stars and variable sky background.
  Methods. Models of observed frames consist of the cluster's surface
brightness distribution, convolved with a point spread function; the stars,
represented by the same point spread function; and a smoothly variable sky
background. The cluster's model is fitted within a large radius by using the
Levenberg-Marquardt and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to derive
structural parameters, the flux of the cluster, and individual fluxes of all
well-resolved stars.
  Results. FitClust, a program to derive structural parameters of semi-resolved
clusters in crowded stellar fields, was developed and is available for free
use. The program was tested on simulated cluster frames, and was used to
measure clusters of the M31 galaxy in Subaru Suprime-Cam frames.
  Conclusions. Accounting for bright resolved stars and variable sky background
significantly improves the accuracy of derived structural parameters of star
clusters. However, their uncertainty remains dominated by the stochastic noise
of unresolved stars.

report on HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code), a recently
developed and evolving cosmology N-body code framework, designed to run
efficiently on diverse computing architectures and to scale to millions of
cores and beyond. HACC can run on all current supercomputer architectures and
supports a variety of programming models and algorithms. It has been
demonstrated at scale on Cell- and GPU-accelerated systems, standard multi-core
node clusters, and Blue Gene systems. HACC's design allows for ease of
portability, and at the same time, high levels of sustained performance on the
fastest supercomputers available. We present a description of the design

when using machine learning to optimize their mechanisms (e.g., auction) since
self-interested agents in these applications may change their behaviors (and
thus the data distribution) in response to the mechanisms. To tackle this
problem, a framework called game-theoretic machine learning (GTML) was recently
proposed, which first learns a Markov behavior model to characterize agents'
behaviors, and then learns the optimal mechanism by simulating agents' behavior
changes in response to the mechanism. While GTML has demonstrated practical
success, its generalization analysis is challenging because the behavior data
are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the mechanism. To address this challenge,
first, we decompose the generalization error for GTML into the behavior
learning error and the mechanism learning error; second, for the behavior
learning error, we obtain novel non-asymptotic error bounds for both parametric
and non-parametric behavior learning methods; third, for the mechanism learning
error, we derive a uniform convergence bound based on a new concept called
nested covering number of the mechanism space and the generalization analysis
techniques developed for mixing sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work on the generalization analysis of GTML, and we believe it has
general implications to the theoretical analysis of other complicated machine
learning problems.

SiIV while CII, SiII and NV change substantially. The CIV components exhibit
strong clustering but no clustering is detected for systems on scales from 150

peculiar velocities of gas present in the circumgalactic media of galaxies.
Using specific combinations of ionic ratios we compare our observations with
model ionization predictions for absorbers exposed to the metagalactic ionizing
radiation background augmented by proximity radiation from their associated
galaxies and find the generally accepted means of radiative escape by
transparent channels from the internal star-forming sites is spectrally not
viable for our stronger absorbers. We develop an active scenario based on
runaway stars with resulting changes in the efflux of radiation that naturally
enable the needed spectral convergence and in turn provide empirical indicators
of morphological evolution in the associated galaxies. Together with a
coexisting population of relatively compact galaxies indicated by the weaker
absorbers in our sample the collective escape of radiation is sufficient to
maintain the IGM ionized over the full range 1.9 < z < 4.4.

the interpretation of the scalar part of quaternions as wavelength of

noncommutativity and fundamental spinor representation, probably also are

  However, we show that for the diagram variety of a permutation diagram, Liu's
conjectured cohomology class $\sigma$ is at least an upper bound on the actual
class $\tau$, in the sense that $\sigma - \tau$ is a nonnegative linear
combination of Schubert classes. To do this, we exhibit the appropriate diagram
variety as a component in a degeneration of one of Knutson's interval positroid
varieties (up to Grassmann duality). A priori, the cohomology classes of these
interval positroid varieties are represented by affine Stanley symmetric
functions. We give a different formula for these classes as ordinary Stanley
symmetric functions, one with the advantage of being Schur-positive and
