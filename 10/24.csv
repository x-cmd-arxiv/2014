information about the quantum error syndrome while not destroying the quantum
information encoded in the system. Stabilizer codes are attractive solutions to
this problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple and
easily computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. In
these codes, syndrome extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizer
measurements, which are bit and phase parity checks up to local operations.
Previously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions, and
superconducting qubits. However these implementations lack the ability to
perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction which continues to be a challenge
for all physical quantum computing systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate
a key step towards this problem by using a two-by-two lattice of
superconducting qubits to perform syndrome extraction and arbitrary error
detection via simultaneous quantum non-demolition stabilizer measurements. This
lattice represents a primitive tile for the surface code, which is a promising
stabilizer code for scalable quantum computing. Furthermore, we successfully
show the preservation of an entangled state in the presence of an arbitrary
applied error through high-fidelity syndrome measurement. Our results bolster
the promise of employing lattices of superconducting qubits for larger-scale

depending on their density profiles and temperature. A usual two dimensional
electron system is assumed to have a $\delta$ like density distribution along
the crystal growth direction. However, once the confining quantum well is
sufficiently large, this situation is changed and the density can no longer be
assumed as a $\delta$ function. In addition, it is known that the density
profile is not a single peaked function, instead can present more than one
maxima, depending on the well width. In this work, the electron density
distributions in the growth direction considering a variety of wide quantum
wells are investigated as function of temperature. We show that, the double
peak in the density profile varies from symmetric (similar peak height) to
asymmetric while changing the temperature for particular growth parameters. The
alternation from symmetric to asymmetric density profiles is known to exhibit
intriguing phase transitions and is decisive in defining the properties of the
ground state wavefunction in the presence of an external magnetic field, i.e
from insulating phases to even denominator fractional quantum Hall states.

as the highest intermediate breaking step, we obtain g_R / g_L ~ 0.6 between
the right- and left-handed gauge couplings at the TeV scale. This leads to a
suppression of beyond the Standard Model phenomena induced by the right-handed
gauge coupling. Here we focus specifically on the consequences for neutrinoless
double beta decay, low energy lepton flavour violation and LHC signatures due
to the suppressed right handed currents. Interestingly, the reduced g_R allows
us to interpret an excess of events observed recently in the range of 1.9 TeV
to 2.4 TeV by the CMS group at the LHC as the signature of a right handed gauge
boson in LRSMs with spontaneous D parity breaking. Moreover, the reduced
right-handed gauge coupling also strongly suppresses the non-standard
contribution of heavy states to the neutrinoless double beta decay rate as well
as the amplitude of low energy lepton flavour violating processes. In a
dominant type-II Seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation, we find that
both sets of observables provide stringent and complimentary bounds which make
it challenging to observe the scenario at the LHC.

their origin to be influenced by an H II region expanding into the surrounding

possible that the true DM particle in the universe joins gravitational
interactions only, but nothing else. Such a Gravitational DM (GDM) acts as a
weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is conceptually simple and
attractive. In this work, we explore this direction by constructing the
simplest scalar GDM particle $\chi_s$. It is a $Z_2$ odd singlet under the
standard model (SM) gauge group, and naturally joins the unique dimension-4
interaction with Ricci curvature, $\xi_s \chi_s^2 R$, where $\xi_s$ is the
dimensionless nonminimal coupling. We demonstrate that this gravitational
interaction $\xi_s \chi_s^2 R$, together with Higgs-curvature nonminimal
coupling term $\xi_h H^\dag H R$, induces effective couplings between
$\chi_s^2$ and SM fields which can account for the observed DM thermal relic
abundance. We analyze the annihilation cross sections of GDM particles and
derive the viable parameter space for realizing the DM thermal relic density.
We further study the direct/indirect detections and the collider signatures of
such a scalar GDM. These turn out to be highly predictive and testable.

near 40 deg. C, perhaps due to electric charge carriers trapping in the

Gaussian background with a power law spectrum. However, when the number of
sources is limited, the background might be non-Gaussian or the spectrum might
not be a power law. Correspondingly previous analysis may not work effectively.
Here we use a method --- Bayesian Nonparametric Analysis --- to try to detect a
generic gravitational wave background, which directly sets constraints on the
feasible shapes of the pulsar timing signals induced by a gravitational wave
background and allows more flexible forms of the background. Our Bayesian
nonparametric analysis will infer if a gravitational wave background is present
in the data, and also estimate the parameters that characterize the background.
This method will be much more effective than the conventional one assuming the
background spectrum follows a power law in general cases. While the context of
our discussion focuses on pulsar timing arrays, the analysis itself is directly
applicable to detect and characterize any signals that arise from the
superposition of a large number of astrophysical events.

The analysis of this problem plays an important role in collision avoidance,
motion planning and aircraft control, among other applications. Previous
methods for computing the guaranteed winning initial conditions and strategies
for each player have either required augmenting the state vector to include
time, or have been limited to problems with either no state constraints or
entirely static targets, constraints and dynamics. To incorporate time-varying

propose a modified Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation in the form of a

its viscosity solution characterizes the capture basin for the target under the
state constraints. Through this formulation, our method can compute the capture
basin and winning strategies for time-varying games at no additional
computational cost with respect to the time-invariant case. We provide an

black hole by means of particle collisions in the ergosphere (i.e., the

largely on particles with critical values of angular momentum falling into an
extremal Kerr black hole from infinity and colliding just outside the horizon.
While these collisions are able to reach arbitrarily high center-of-mass
energies, it is very difficult for the reaction products to escape back to
infinity, effectively limiting the peak efficiency of such a process to roughly
$130\%$. When we allow one of the initial particles to have impact parameter $b
> 2M$, and thus not get captured by the horizon, it is able to collide along
outgoing trajectories, greatly increasing the chance that the products can
escape. For equal-mass particles annihilating to photons, we find a greatly
increased peak energy of $E_{\rm out} \approx 6\times E_{\rm in}$. For Compton
scattering, the efficiency can go even higher, with $E_{\rm out} \approx
14\times E_{\rm in}$, and for repeated scattering events, photons can both be

the projected scores are nearly all positive, and hence maximizing the score of
a region results in localizing nearly the entire images as objects, which is
meaningless.
  In this paper, we observe that the large scores are mainly concentrated on or
around objects. Based on this observation, we propose a method, named level set
maximum-weight connected subgraph (LS-MWCS), which localizes objects with
arbitrary shapes by searching regions with the densest score rather than the
maximal score. The region density can be controlled by a parameter flexibly.
And we prove an important property of the proposed LS-MWCS, which guarantees
that the region with the densest score can be searched. Moreover, the LS-MWCS
can be efficiently optimized by belief propagation. The method is evaluated on
the problem of weakly-supervised object localization, and the quantitative
results demonstrate the superiorities of our LS-MWCS compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

during the partonic stages of an ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision. The
model combines a weakly-coupled hard sector, involving gluon modes with energy
and momenta of the order of the saturation momentum and relatively large
occupation numbers, with a strongly-coupled soft sector, which physically
represents the soft gluons radiated by the hard partons. The hard sector is
described by perturbative QCD, more precisely, by its semi-classical
approximation (the classical Yang-Mills equations) which becomes appropriate
when the occupation numbers are large. The soft sector is described by a
marginally deformed conformal field theory, which in turn admits a holographic
description in terms of classical Einstein's equations in $AdS_5$ with a
minimally coupled massless `dilaton'. The model involve two free parameters
which characterize the gauge-invariant couplings between the hard and soft
sectors. Via these couplings, the hard modes provide dynamical sources for the
gravitational equations at the boundary of $AdS_5$ and feel the feedback of the
latter as additional soft sources in the classical Yang-Mills equations.
Importantly, the initial conditions for this coupled dynamics are fully
determined by the hard sector alone, i.e. by perturbative QCD, and are
conveniently given by the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. We
also develop a new semi-holographic picture of jets in the QGP by attaching a
non-Abelian charge to the endpoint of the trailing string in $AdS_5$
representing a heavy quark. This leads to modified Nambu-Goto equations for the
string which govern the (collisional and radiative) energy loss by the heavy
quark towards both hard and soft modes.

The abundance of detections of gamma-ray millisecond pulsars by Fermi Large

copious pair production in their magnetospheres, motivated us to investigate
this old pulsar population as a source of Galactic electrons and positrons and
their contribution to the enhancement in cosmic-ray positron flux at GeV
energies. We use a population synthesis code to predict the source properties
(number, position, and power) of the present-day Galactic millisecond pulsars,
taking into account the latest Fermi and radio observations to calibrate the
model output. Next, we simulate pair cascade spectra from these pulsars using a
model that invokes an offset-dipole magnetic field. We assume free escape of
the pairs from the pulsar environment. We then compute the cumulative spectrum
of transported electrons and positrons at Earth, following their diffusion and
energy losses as they propagate through the Galaxy. Our results indicate that
the predicted particle flux increases for non-zero offsets of the magnetic
polar caps. Comparing our predicted spectrum and positron fraction to
measurements by AMS-02, PAMELA, and Fermi, we find that millisecond pulsars are
only modest contributors at a few tens of GeV, after which this leptonic
spectral component cuts off. The positron fraction is therefore only slightly
enhanced above 10 GeV relative to a background flux model. This implies that
alternative sources such as young, nearby pulsars and supernova remnants should
contribute additional primary positrons within the astrophysical scenario.

as the best Bell-type inequality to detect genuine (three way) nonlocality of
pure tripartite genuine entangled states. In the present work, we have
considered another Bell-type inequality (which has been reported as the $99$-th
facet of $NS_2$ local polytope in (J.-D. Bancal, et.al.,Phys. Rev.A

generalized GHZ(Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) class and a subclass of extended
GHZ class states(\cite{ACN}) thereby proving the conjecture given by Bancal,
et.al.\cite{BAL} for the GGHZ class and the subclass of extended GHZ states. We
compare the violation of this inequality with Svetlichny inequality which
reveals the efficiency of the former inequality over the latter to demonstrate
genuine nonlocality using the above classes of quantum states. Even in some
cases discord monogamy score can be used as a better measure of quantum
correlation over Svetlichny inequality for those classes of pure states.
Besides, the $99$-th facet inequality is found efficient not only for revealing
genuine nonlocal behavior of correlations emerging in systems using pure
entangled states but also in some cases of mixed entangled states over
Svetlichny inequality and some well known measures of entanglement .

bubbles and filaments, some of the gas being expelled to 100 pc or higher above

closer to the central dark mass. Part of the gas raining down is being
accreted, forming a 10~pc polar disc-like structure around the black hole,

signs of an ongoing or recent transformation of their star formation activity

star-forming early types. Color fractions depend on mass and only for
M_*<10^(10.7)M_sun on environment. The incidence of red galaxies increases with
increasing mass, and, for M_*<10^(10.7)M_sun, decreases toward the group
outskirts and in binary and single galaxies. The relative abundance of green
and blue galaxies is independent of environment, and increases monotonically
with galaxy mass. We also inspect galaxy structural parameters, star-formation
properties, histories and ages and propose an evolutionary scenario for the
different subpopulations. Color transformations are due to a reduction and
suppression of SFR in both bulges and disks which does not noticeably affect
galaxy structure. Morphological transitions are linked to an enhanced
bulge-to-disk ratio due to the removal of the disk, not to an increase of the
bulge. Our modeling suggests that green colors might be due to star formation
histories declining with long timescales, as an alternative scenario to the
classical ""quenching"" processes. Our results suggest that galaxy
transformations in star formation activity and morphology depend neither on

constituent of clusters of galaxies. In the cores of many clusters, radiative
energy losses from the ICM occur on timescales significantly shorter than the
age of the system. Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations
of cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.
Various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses have
been proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes
in the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.
Regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is
transferred to the ICM has remained open. Here we present a plausible solution
to this question based on deep Chandra X-ray observatory data and a new
data-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate
due to the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is
sufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally
at each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gas
cooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of X-ray

  In order to study the building block, as a physical system in itself, we have
developed a perturbative method based on Born series. This method is valid only
in the ballistic regime, when the length of the system L is smaller than the

find, analytically, the behavior of quantities of interest that we have not

equation method, which takes into account approximately the contribution of
closed channels, this method takes them explicitly. In earlier works numerical
evidence was found that the expectation values of some interesting quantities
are insensitive to the number of closed channels that were used on the
calculations; with this method, we could show that closed channels are relevant

the Barolo Palace in Buenos Aires. While references to Dante Alighieri and his
poetry are scattered in streets, buildings and monuments around the Western
world, in the city of Buenos Aires, the only street carrying Dante's name is
less than three blocks long and, appropriately, is a continuation of Virgilio
street. A couple of Italian immigrants -a wealthy businessman, Luis Barolo, and
an imaginative architect, Mario Palanti- foresaw this situation nearly a
century ago, and did not save any efforts or money with the aim of getting
Dante and his cosmology an appropriate monumental recognition, in reinforced
concrete. The Barolo Palace is a unique combination of both astronomy and the
worldview displayed in the Divine Comedy, Dante's poetic masterpiece. It is
known that the Palace's design was inspired by the great poet, but the details
are not recorded; this paper relies on Dante's text to consider whether it may
add to our understanding of the building. Although the links of the Palace's
main architectural structure with the three realms of the Comedy have been
studied in the past, its unique astronomical flavor has not been sufficiently
emphasized. The word of God, as interpreted by the Fathers of the Church in
Sacred Scripture, Aristotle's physics and Ptolemy's astronomy, all beautifully
converge in Dante's verses, and the Barolo Palace reflects this.

exploit the power of tensor-based numerical methods to evaluate the partition
function of these models and hence to extract the key thermodynamic properties

insight into the phase transitions and ordered states of each system. Our
calculations reveal a range of phenomena related to partial ordering, including
different types of entropy-driven phase transition, the role of lattice
irregularity, very large values of the critical $q_c$, and double phase

translations and rotations in the Lagrangian of a classical system. The
procedure implies the addition of compensating terms to the kinetic energy, in
such a way that the resulting equations of motion are valid in any frame. The
compensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum P,
intrinsic angular momentum J and intrinsic inertia tensor I. Therefore, the
privileged frames where Newton's equations are valid (Newtonian frames) are
completely determined by the matter distribution of the universe
(Machianization). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first
class constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once
the absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical
mechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances
between particles. It is also Machian, since the rotation of the rest of the
universe produces centrifugal effects. It then provides a new perspective to
consider the foundational ideas of general relativity, like Mach's principle
and the weak equivalence principle. With regard to the concept of time, the
absence of an absolute time is known to be a characteristic of parametrized
systems. Furthermore, the scale invariance of those parametrized systems whose
potentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances can be also
gauged by introducing another compensating term associated with the intrinsic

existence of a preferred time direction at every space-time point. This
scenario can arise in the context of quantum gravity and its description at low
energies contains a unit time-like vector field which parameterizes the
preferred direction. The particle physics tests of Lorentz invariance preclude
a direct coupling of this vector to the fields of the Standard Model, but do
not bear implications for dark matter. We discuss how the presence of this
vector and its possible coupling to dark matter affect the evolution of the
Universe. At the level of homogeneous cosmology the only effect of Lorentz
invariance violation is a rescaling of the expansion rate. The physics is
richer at the level of perturbations. We identify three effects crucial for
observations: the rescaling of the matter contribution to the Poisson equation,
the appearance of an extra contribution to the anisotropic stress and the
scale-dependent enhancement of dark matter clustering. These effects result in
distinctive features in the power spectra of the CMB and density fluctuations.
Making use of the data from Planck and WiggleZ we obtain the most stringent
cosmological constraints to date on departures from Lorentz symmetry. Our
analysis provides the first direct bounds on deviations from Lorentz invariance

mixing in red giants. In low and intermediate mass stars this mechanism first
activates at the position of the bump in the luminosity function, and has been
identified as a likely candidate for driving the slow mixing inferred to occur
in these stars. One particularly important consequence of this process, which
is driven by a molecular weight inversion, is the destruction of lithium. We
show that the degree of lithium destruction, or in some cases production, is
extremely sensitive to the numerical details of the stellar models. Within the
standard 1D diffusion approximation to thermohaline mixing, we find that
dfferent evolution codes, with their default numerical schemes, can produce
lithium abundances that differ from one another by many orders of magnitude.
This disagreement is worse for faster mixing. We perform experiments with four
independent stellar evolution codes, and derive conditions for the spatial and
temporal resolution required for a converged numerical solution. The results
are extremely sensitive to the timesteps used. We find that predicted lithium
abundances published in the literature until now should be treated with
caution.

possible changes in the energy power spectrum in fully developed turbulent
regimes, using numerical simulations of the two-fluid equations in

scaling laws in different spectral ranges, as it has been observed in the solar
wind for the magnetic energy spectrum. At the smallest wavenumbers where plain
MHD is valid, we obtain an inertial range following a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$

\lambda_{e}^{-1}$, the spectrum is modified to a $k^{-7/3}$ power-law, as has
also been obtained for Hall-MHD (HMHD) neglecting electron inertia terms. When
electron inertia is retained, a new spectral region given by $k >

is given by a $k^{-11/3}$ power law. Finally, when the terms of electron
inertia are retained, we study the self-consistent electric field. Our results

described by unitary transformations, the observer cannot make any choices and
so measurement is impossible. From the perspective of computability theory, a

it is argued that the consideration of information and observation requires an

relaxation method is employed to model the field evolution towards the final
near-singular state. Our starting point is an exact force-free solution of the
governing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations which is sufficiently general to
allow for topological features like magnetic nulls to be inside or outside the
computational domain, depending on a simple set of parameters. Quasi-separatrix
layers (QSLs) are present in these structures and together with the magnetic
nulls, they significantly influence the accumulation of current. It is shown
that perturbations affecting the lateral boundaries of the configuration lead
not only to collapse around the magnetic null, but also to significant QSL
currents. Our results show that once a magnetic null is present, the developing
currents are always attracted to that specific location and show a much
stronger scaling with resolution than the currents which form along the QSL. In
particular, the null point scalings can be consistent with models of ""fast""
reconnection. The QSL currents also appear to be unbounded but give rise to
weaker singularities, independent of the perturbation amplitude.

processes achieved in a global-scale stellar convection simulation for a model
solar-mass star rotating at three times the solar rate. The dynamo generated
magnetic fields possesses many time scales, with a prominent polarity cycle
occurring roughly every 6.2 years. The magnetic field forms large-scale
toroidal wreaths, whose formation is tied to the low Rossby number of the
convection in this simulation. The polarity reversals are linked to the
weakened differential rotation and a resistive collapse of the large-scale
magnetic field. An equatorial migration of the magnetic field is seen, which is
due to the strong modulation of the differential rotation rather than a dynamo
wave. A poleward migration of magnetic flux from the equator eventually leads
to the reversal of the polarity of the high-latitude magnetic field. This
simulation also enters an interval with reduced magnetic energy at low
latitudes lasting roughly 16 years (about 2.5 polarity cycles), during which
the polarity cycles are disrupted and after which the dynamo recovers its
regular polarity cycles. An analysis of this grand minimum reveals that it
likely arises through the interplay of symmetric and antisymmetric dynamo
families. This intermittent dynamo state potentially results from the
simulations relatively low magnetic Prandtl number. A mean-field-based analysis
of this dynamo simulation demonstrates that it is of the $\alpha$-$\Omega$
type. The time scales that appear to be relevant to the magnetic polarity
reversal are also identified.

driven outflows in these galaxies by combining kinematic and ionization
diagnostic information. We use non-parametric methods (e.g. W80, the width
containing 80% of the line flux) to assess the line widths in the central
regions of our targets. The maximum values of W80 in each galaxy are in the
range 400 - 1600 km/s, with a mean of 790 +- 90 km/s. Such high velocities are
strongly suggestive that these AGN are driving ionized outflows. Multi-Gaussian
fitting is used to decompose the velocity structure in our galaxies. 14/17 of
our targets require 3 separate kinematic components in the ionized gas in their
central regions. The broadest components of these fits have FWHM = 530 - 2520
km/s, with a mean value of 920 +- 50 km/s. By simultaneously fitting both the
H{\beta}/[O III] and H{\alpha}/[N II] complexes we construct ionization
diagnostic diagrams for each component. 13/17 of our galaxies show a
significant (> 95 %) correlation between the [N II]/H{\alpha} ratio and the

it is simple to implement and fast to compute, and it possesses many other
desirable properties from both theoretical and numerical viewpoints. We
establish rigorous selection consistency results when either EBIC or BIC is
used as the stopping criterion, under some mild regularity conditions. Notably,
unlike existing methods, an extra screening step is not required to ensure
selection consistency. Even if the regularity conditions fail to hold, our
procedure is still useful as an effective screening procedure in a less
restrictive setup. We carried out simulation and empirical studies to show the
efficacy and usefulness of our procedure.

model polymer coils as effective penetrable ellipsoids, whose shapes fluctuate
according to the probability distributions of the eigenvalues of the gyration
tensor. Accounting for the entropic cost of a nanoparticle penetrating a larger
polymer coil, we compute the crowding-induced shift in the shape distributions,
radius of gyration, and asphericity of ideal polymers in a theta solvent. With
increased nanoparticle crowding, we find that polymers become more compact
(smaller, more spherical), in agreement with predictions of free-volume theory.
Our approach can be easily extended to nonideal polymers in good solvents and
used to model conformations of biopolymers in crowded environments.

superfluids, and superconductors are of great importance in foundations and
applications of quantum mechanics. In particular, quantum superposition of a
large number of spins in solids is highly desirable for both quantum
information processing and ultrasensitive magnetometry. Spin ensembles in
solids, however, have rather short collective coherence time (typically less
than microseconds). Here we demonstrate that under realistic conditions it is
possible to maintain macroscopic quantum superposition of a large spin ensemble
(such as about ~10^{14} nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins in diamond) with
an extremely long coherence time ~10^8 sec under readily accessible conditions.
The scheme, following the mechanism of superradiant lasers, is based on
superradiant masing due to coherent coupling between collective spin
excitations (magnons) and microwave cavity photons. The coherence time of the
macroscopic quantum superposition is the sum of the magnon life time and the
cavity lifetime, further elongated by the total number of coherent magnons and
photons, which have macroscopic values when masing occurs. The macroscopic
quantum coherence of spin ensembles can be exploited for magnetometry with
sensitivity ~10 fT/(Hz)^{1/2}. The long-living collective states of spin
ensembles in solids will provide a new platform for studying macroscopic
quantum phenomena and are useful for quantum technologies.

maintained irrespective of the EoS parameterizations: there is a good match
between the universally explored CPL model and other formulations of cosmic

conclusions obtained with ADD and LD are almost the same. Finally, statistical
analysis of generalized dark energy equation of state performed on four classes

detecting ""core--periphery structure"" in networks. Core--periphery structure is
a type of mesoscale structure that includes densely-connected core vertices and
sparsely-connected peripheral vertices. Core vertices tend to be well-connected
both among themselves and to peripheral vertices, which tend not to be
well-connected to other vertices. Our first method, which is based on
transportation in networks, aggregates information from many geodesic paths in
a network and yields a score for each vertex that reflects the likelihood that
a vertex is a core vertex. Our second method is based on a low-rank
approximation of a network's adjacency matrix, which can often be expressed as
a tensor-product matrix. Our third approach uses the bottom eigenvector of the
random-walk Laplacian to infer a coreness score and a classification into core
and peripheral vertices. We also design an objective function to (1) help
classify vertices into core or peripheral vertices and (2) provide a
goodness-of-fit criterion for classifications into core versus peripheral
vertices. To examine the performance of our methods, we apply our algorithms to
both synthetically-generated networks and a variety of networks constructed
from real-world data sets.

known to have high performance and better stability. This paper reports the
dynamical behavior of an indirect field oriented control (IFOC) induction motor
drive in the light of bifurcation theory. The speed of high performance
induction motor drive is controlled by IFOC method. The knowledge of
qualitative change of the behavior of the motor such as equilibrium points,
limit cycles and chaos with the change of motor parameters and load torque are
essential for proper control of the motor. This paper provides a numerical
approach to understand better the dynamical behavior of an indirect field
oriented control of a current-fed induction motor. The focus is on bifurcation
analysis of the IFOC motor, with a particular emphasis on the change that
affects the dynamics and stability under small variations of Proportional
Integral controller (PI) parameters, load torque and k, the ratio of the rotor
time constant and its estimate etc. Bifurcation diagrams are computed. This
paper also attempts to discuss various types of the transition to chaos in the
induction motor. The results of the obtained bifurcation simulations give
useful guidelines for adjusting both motor model and PI controller parameters.
It is also important to ensure desired operation of the motor when the motor
shows chaotic behavior. Infinite numbers of unstable periodic orbits are
embedded in a chaotic attractor. Any unstable periodic orbit can be stabilized
by proper control algorithm. The delayed feedback control method to control
chaos has been implemented in this system.

regions of mass-period space are ruled out for the companion. For circular
orbits the companion period is constrained to the range 3.5-13.8 yr (a ~

a ring structure in transition. Further, we demonstrate that the radial

The optimal policy is Markovian and can be solved by dynamical programming.

introduce several optimizations to further expedite the search process. We
implement a prototype of PIC including both cloud side and client side. The
cloud side is a cluster of computers with distributed file system (Hadoop HDFS)
and MapReduce architecture (Hadoop MapReduce). The client side is built for
both Windows OS laptops and Android phones. We evaluate the prototype system
with large sets of real-life photos. Our security analysis and evaluation

and spectroscopic data of a bright lensed galaxy at $z$=1.0334 in the lensing
cluster Abell~2667. Using this high-resolution imaging we present an updated
lens model that allows us to fully understand the lensing geometry and
reconstruct the lensed galaxy in the source plane. This giant arc gives a
unique opportunity to peer into the structure of a high-redshift disk galaxy.
We find that the lensed galaxy of Abell 2667 is a typical spiral galaxy with
morphology similar to the structure of its counterparts at higher redshift
$z\sim 2$. The surface brightness of the reconstructed source galaxy in the
z$_{850}$ band reveals the central surface brightness $I(0)=20.28\pm0.22$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ and the characteristic radius $r_s=2.01\pm0.16$ kpc at redshift
$z \sim 1$. The morphological reconstruction in different bands shows obvious
negative radial color gradients for this galaxy. Moreover, the redder central
bulge tends to contain a metal-rich stellar population, rather than being
heavily reddened by dust due to high and patchy obscuration. We analyze the
VIMOS/IFU spectroscopic data and find that, in the given wavelength range
($\sim 1800-3200$ \AA), the combined arc spectrum of the source galaxy is
characterized by a strong continuum emission with strong UV absorption lines
(FeII and MgII) and shows the features of a typical starburst Wolf-Rayet galaxy
NGC5253. More specifically, we have measured the EWs of FeII and MgII lines in
the Abell 2667 spectrum, and obtained similar values for the same wavelength
interval of the NGC5253 spectrum. Marginal evidence for CIII] 1909 emission at
the edge of the grism range further confirms our expectation.

voids within the SDSS at distances of ~100 Mpc, and pursued deep UV, optical,
Halpha, IR, and HI imaging to study in detail the morphology and kinematics of

examine the global statistical properties of void galaxies, but also to explore
the details of the dynamical properties. We present an overview of the VGS, and

In general, we find that the void galaxies are gas rich, low luminosity, blue
disk galaxies, with optical and HI properties that are not unusual for their
luminosity and morphology. We see evidence of both ongoing assembly, through
the gas dynamics between interacting systems, and significant gas accretion,
seen in extended gas disks and kinematic misalignments. The VGS establishes a

for the Prandtl number range $0.01\le Pr \le 150$ and for fixed Rayleigh number

production and a flux term. We discuss profiles of all terms and find that the
different contributions to the energy balance can be spatially separated into
regions where kinetic energy is produced and where kinetic energy is
dissipated. Analysing the Prandtl number dependence of the kinetic energy
balance, we show that the height-dependence of the mean viscous dissipation is
closely related to the flux of kinetic energy. We show that the flux of kinetic
energy can be divided into four additive contributions, each representing a
different elementary physical process (advection, buoyancy, normal viscous
stresses and viscous shear stresses). The behaviour of these individual flux
contributions is found to be surprisingly rich and exhibits a pronounced
Prandtl number dependence. Different flux contributions dominate the kinetic
energy transport at different depth, such that a comprehensive discussion
requires a decomposition of the domain into a considerable number of
sub-layers. On a less detailed level, our results reveal that advective kinetic
energy fluxes play a key role in balancing the near-wall dissipation at low
Prandtl number, whereas normal viscous stresses are particularly important at
high Prandtl number. Finally, our work reveals that classical velocity boundary
layers are deeply connected to the kinetic energy transport, but fail to
correctly represent regions of enhanced viscous dissipation.

rod-like ones with $\kappa_1>21.34$ exhibit reentrant uniaxial and biaxial

biaxial-rod-like, the region of biaxiality is reduced, eventually ending in a
critical-end point. For $\kappa_1>60$, a density gap opens up in which the
biaxial nematic phase is stable for any particle biaxiality. Regions of the

broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The combined influence
of gravity of the central object and the non-isotropic radiation of the central
source are taking into account. While most of the previous studies assume that
the pressure of the intercloud gaseous component is proportional to a power-law
function of the radial coordinate, we generalize it to a case where the
external pressure depends on both the radial distance and the latitudinal
angle. Our prescribed pressure profile determines the radius and the column
density of BLR clouds as a function of their location. We also discuss about
stability of the orbits and a condition for the existence of bound orbits is
obtained. We found that BLR clouds tend to populate the equatorial regions more
than other parts simply because of the stability considerations. Although this
finding is obtained for a particular pressure profile, we think, this result is
valid as long as the pressure distribution of the intercloud medium decreases
from the equator to the pole.

increase in popularity since they provide a method to probe the non-Fermi
liquid behaviour of fractionally charged excitations occupying the edge states
of a quantum Hall system. When considering tunnelling one must resort to an
effective theory and typically a phenomenological tunnelling Hamiltonian is
used analogous to that used for a conventional Luttinger liquid. It is the form
of this tunnelling Hamiltonian that is investigated in this work by making a
comparison to an exact microscopic calculation of the zero mode tunnelling
matrix elements. The computation is performed using Monte Carlo and results
were obtained for various system sizes for the $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state. Here
we also present a solution to overcome the phase problem experienced in Monte
Carlo calculations using Laughlin-type wavefunctions. Comparing the system size
dependence of the microscopic and phenomenological calculations for the
tunnelling matrix elements, it was found that only for a particular type of
operator ordering in the tunnelling Hamiltonian was it possible to make a good
match to the numerical calculations. From the Monte Carlo data it is also clear
that for any system size the electron tunnelling is always less relevant than
the quasiparticle tunnelling process, supporting the idea that when considering
tunnelling at a weak barrier, the electron tunnelling process can be neglected.

complete integrability of a vector sub-bundle of the tangent bundle by a zero

about the curvature tensor of the natural lift of the vector sub-bundle to a
manifold of maps with values in the base of that sub-bundle. Another is a
localization property for a Lie algebra of vector fields over this manifold of

linear parallel transport on a supplementary vector sub-bundle along any

generalization of a linear connection parallel transport on a vector bundle

directors on their board. This requirement allows the existence of directors
who sit on the board of two or more corporations at the same time, generating
what is commonly known as interlocking directorates. While research has shown
that networks of interlocking directorates facilitate the transmission of
information between corporations, little is known about the extent to which
such interlocking networks can explain the fluctuations of stock price returns.
Yet, this is a special concern since the risk of amplifying stock fluctuations
is latent. To answer this question, here we analyze the board composition,
traders' perception, and stock performance of more than 1500 US traded
corporations from 2007-2011. First, we find that the fewer degrees of
separation between two corporations in the interlocking network, the stronger
the temporal correlation between their stock price returns. Second, we find
that the centrality of traded corporations in the interlocking network
correlates with the frequency at which financial traders talk about such
corporations, and this frequency is in turn proportional to the corresponding
traded volume. Third, we show that the centrality of corporations was
negatively associated with their stock performance in 2008, the year of the big
financial crash. These results suggest that the strategic decisions made by
interlocking directorates are strongly followed by stock analysts and have the
potential to correlate and amplify the movement of stock prices during
financial crashes. These results may have relevant implications for scholars,
investors, and regulators.

effect of precession and nutation in the estimation of PA is found to be
significant. Using ATCA/Parkes data, most of the H I gas in the LMC is found to
be located in the disk. We detected 12.1% of the data points as kinematic
outliers. We identified the well-known Arm E, Arm S, Arm W, Arm B and a new
stream, Outer Arm, as part of outlier components. The GASS data analysis brings
out the velocity details of the Magellanic Bridge (MB) and its connection to
the LMC disk. We find that the Arm B and the Outer Arm are connected to the MB.
We detect high velocity gas in the western disk of the LMC and the south-west
and southern parts of the MB. We proposed two models (in plane and out of
plane) to explain the outlier gas. We suggest that the Arm B could be an infall
feature, originating from the inner MB. The Arm E could be an outflow feature.
We suggest possible outflows from the western LMC disk and south and south
western MB, which could be due to ram pressure. The velocity pattern observed
in the MB suggests that it is being sheared. We suggest that the various
outliers identified in this study may be caused by a combination of tidal
effects and hydrodynamical effect due to the motion of the LMC in the Milky Way

galaxies, which, if the coupling is sufficient, can affect the interstellar
medium (ISM). We use a high-resolution simulation ($\sim6$ pc) of a z $\sim2$
star-forming galaxy hosting an AGN, to study this not yet well-understood
coupling. In addition to the often considered small-scale thermal energy
deposition by the AGN, which is implemented in the simulation, we model
long-range photo-ionizing AGN radiation in post-processing, and quantify the
impact of AGN feedback on the ability of the gas to form stars. Surprisingly,
even though the AGN generates powerful outflows, the impact of AGN heating and
photo-ionization on instantaneous star formation is weak: the star formation
rate decreases by a few percent at most, even in a quasar regime
($L_{bol}=10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, the reservoirs of atomic gas
that are expected to form stars on a 100 - 200 Myrs time scale are also
marginally affected. Therefore, while the AGN-driven outflows can remove
substantial amounts of gas in the long term, the impact of AGN feedback on the
star formation efficiency in the ISM of high-redshift galaxies is marginal,
even when long-range radiative effects are taken into account.

physical conditions and chemical abundances and is the cornerstone of nebular
astrophysics. Although the physical problem is conceptually simple, its
practical complexity can be overwhelming since the amount of data to be
analyzed steadily increases; furthermore, results depend crucially on the input
atomic data, whose determination also improves each year. To address these
challenges we created PyNeb, an innovative code for analyzing emission lines.
PyNeb computes physical conditions and ionic and elemental abundances, and
produces both theoretical and observational diagnostic plots. It is designed to
be portable, modular, and largely customizable in aspects such as the atomic
data used, the format of the observational data to be analyzed, and the
graphical output. It gives full access to the intermediate quantities of the
calculation, making it possible to write scripts tailored to the specific type
of analysis one wants to carry out. In the case of collisionally excited lines,
PyNeb works by solving the equilibrium equations for an n-level atom; in the
case of recombination lines, it works by interpolation in emissivity tables.
The code offers a choice of extinction laws and ionization correction factors,
which can be complemented by user-provided recipes. It is entirely written in
the python programming language and uses standard python libraries. It is fully
vectorized, making it apt for analyzing huge amounts of data. The code is
stable and has been benchmarked against IRAF/NEBULAR. It is public, fully
documented, and has already been satisfactorily used in a number of published
papers.

originates from the parity violation in the $eN$ interaction entering the

the magnetic helicity which accounts for the $eN$ interaction. By solving this
system, we show that a sizable chiral imbalance arising in a neutron protostar

technologies are increasingly allowing high resolution measurements of DNA
methylation, statistical modelling of such data is still challenging. In
particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions
across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for
spatial correlations within the statistical testing procedure.
  We propose a non-parametric, kernel-based method, M3D, to detect higher-order
changes in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre-defined regions. The
test statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between
samples, thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis
of methylation data. Empirical tests on real and simulated data sets show an
increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable
robustness with respect to coverage and replication levels.
  Code is implemented in R, and is freely available via Bioconductor package
M3D.

spacetime, and find that the test khronon field can be solved explicitly when
its velocity becomes infinitely large, at which point the universal horizon
coincides with the sound horizon of the khronon. Choosing the timelike
coordinate aligned with the khronon, the static metric takes a simple form,
from which it can be seen clearly that the metric is free of singularity at the
Killing horizon, but becomes singular at the universal horizon. Applying such
developed formulas to three well-known black hole solutions, the Schwarzschild,
Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter, and Reissner-Nordstr\""om, we find that in all
these solutions universal horizons exist and are always inside the Killing
horizons. In particular, in the Eddington-Finkelstein and Painleve-Gullstrand
coordinates, in which the metrics are not singular when crossing both of the
Killing and universal horizons, the peeling-off behavior of the khronon is
found only at the universal horizons, whereby we show that the values of
surface gravity of the universal horizons calculated from the peeling-off
behavior of the khronon match with those obtained from the covariant definition
given recently by Cropp, Liberati, Mohd and Visser.

luminosities of 5.0 inverse femtobarns at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and
19.7 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV for the muon search, and of 19.7 inverse
femtobarns at 8 TeV for the electron search. Upper limits on the production
cross section times branching fraction at the 95% confidence level are reported
for Higgs boson masses in the range from 120 to 150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with
a mass of 125 GeV decaying to muons, the observed (expected) upper limit on the
production rate is found to be 7.4 (6.5 +2.8 -1.9) times the standard model
value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching fraction of 0.0016.
Similarly, for electrons, an upper limit of 0.0019 is placed on the branching
fraction, which is about 3.7 E5 times the standard model value. These results,
together with recent evidence of the 125 GeV boson coupling to tau-leptons with
a larger branching fraction consistent with the standard model, confirm that
the leptonic couplings of the new boson are not flavour-universal.

internal chemical composition, and water ice structure of the nucleus, and
physical assumptions on comets. To do this, we have developed a quasi 3D model
of a cometary nucleus which takes into account all phase changes and water ice
structures (amorphous, crystalline, clathrate, and a mixture of them); we have
applied this model to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the target of the
Rosetta mission. We find that the outgassing profile of volatile molecules is a
strong indicator of the physical and thermal properties (water ice structure,
thermal inertia, abundances, distribution, physical differentiation) of the
solid nucleus. Day/night variations of the rate of production of species helps
to distinguish the clathrate structure from other water ice structures in
nuclei, implying different thermodynamic conditions of cometary ice formation
in the protoplanetary disc. The relative abundance (to H2O) of volatile
molecules released from the nucleus interior varies by some orders of magnitude
as a function of the distance to the sun, the volatility of species, their
abundance and distribution between the trapped and condensed states, the
structure of water ice, and the thermal inertia and other physical assumptions

shrinks the region of the pion condensation (Aoki phase) in the parameter space

colloidal particles) has often been modelled by using a force and a torque
entering into the overdamped equations for the Brownian motion of passive
particles. This seemingly contradicts the fact that a swimmer is force-free and
torque-free, i.e., that the net force and torque on the particle vanish. Using
different models for mechanical and diffusiophoretic self-propulsion, we
demonstrate here that the equations of motion of microswimmers can be mapped
onto those of passive particles with the shape-dependent grand resistance
matrix and formally external effective forces and torques. This is consistent
with experimental findings on the circular motion of artificial asymmetric
microswimmers driven by self-diffusiophoresis. The concept of effective
self-propulsion forces and torques significantly facilitates the understanding
of the swimming paths, e.g., for a microswimmer under gravity. However, this
concept has its limitations when the self-propulsion mechanism of a swimmer is
disturbed either by another particle in its close vicinity or by interactions
with obstacles, such as a wall.

system has three associated conservation laws which describe the conservation

system features a fourth conservation law which is the main focus of this note.
It is shown how this fourth conservation law can be interpreted in terms of a
concrete kinematic quantity connected to the evolution of the tangent velocity
at the free surface. The equation for the tangent velocity is first derived for
the full Euler equations in both two and three dimensional flows, and in both
cases, it gives rise to an approximate balance law in the Green-Naghdi theory

effects in microscopic structures in neurons of the human brain. The challenge
is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet and
noisy environment of the brain which forbids long life coherence for brain
processing. Despite these critical discussions, there are only a few number of
published papers about numerical aspects of decoherence in neurons. Perhaps the
most important issue is offered by Max Tegmark who has calculated decoherence
times for the systems of ""ions"" and ""microtubules"" in neurons of the brain. In
fact, Tegmark did not consider ion channels which are responsible for ions
displacement through the membrane and are the building blocks of electrical
membrane signals in the nervous system. Here, we would like to re-investigate
decoherence times for ionic superposition states by using the data obtained via
molecular dynamics simulations. Our main approach is according to what Tegmark
has used before. In fact, Tegmark didn't consider the ion channel structure and
his estimates are only simple approximations. In this paper, we focus on the
small nano-scale part of KcsA ion channels which is called ""selectivity filter""
and has a key role in the operation of an ion channel. Our results for
superposition states of potassium ions indicate that decoherence times are in
the order of picoseconds which are 10-100 million times bigger than the order
calculated by Tegmark. This decoherence time is still not enough for cognitive
processing in the brain, however it can be adequate for quantum states of
cooled ions in the filter to leave their quantum traces on the filter and
action potentials.

among bacteria in the formation of micro-colonies. micro-colonies represent the
first social step towards the formation of structured multicellular communities
known as bacterial biofilms, which protect the bacteria against antimicrobials.
In our model, bacteria can form links in the form of intercellular adhesins
(such as polysaccharides) to collaborate in the production of resources that
are fundamental to protect them against antimicrobials. Since maintaining a
link can be costly, we assume that each bacterium forms and maintains a link
only if the benefit received from the link is larger than the cost, and we
formalize the interaction among bacteria as a dynamic network formation game.
We rigorously characterize some of the key properties of the network evolution
depending on the parameters of the system. In particular, we derive the
parameters under which it is guaranteed that all bacteria will join
micro-colonies and the parameters under which it is guaranteed that some
bacteria will not join micro-colonies. Importantly, our study does not only
characterize the properties of networks emerging in equilibrium, but it also
provides important insights on how the network dynamically evolves and on how
the formation history impacts the emerging networks in equilibrium. This
analysis can be used to develop methods to influence on- the-fly the evolution
of the network, and such methods can be useful to treat or prevent
biofilm-related diseases.

  analysis using mixtures",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next-generation sequencing technologies now constitute a method of choice to
measure gene expression. Data to analyze are read counts, commonly modeled
using Negative Binomial distributions. A relevant issue associated with this
probabilistic framework is the reliable estimation of the overdispersion
parameter, reinforced by the limited number of replicates generally observable
for each gene. Many strategies have been proposed to estimate this parameter,
but when differential analysis is the purpose, they often result in procedures
based on plug-in estimates, and we show here that this discrepancy between the
estimation framework and the testing framework can lead to uncontrolled type-I
errors. Instead we propose a mixture model that allows each gene to share
information with other genes that exhibit similar variability. Three consistent
statistical tests are developed for differential expression analysis. We show
that the proposed method improves the sensitivity of detecting differentially
expressed genes with respect to the common procedures, since it is the best one
in reaching the nominal value for the first-type error, while keeping elevate
power. The method is finally illustrated on prostate cancer RNA-seq data.
