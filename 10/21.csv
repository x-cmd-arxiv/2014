exoplanets. Studies have been performed to quantify its impact on infrared
interferometry, but not in the visible domain, which however allows reaching
better angular resolution and is also the one mostly used for spectroscopic and
photometric measurements.
  We use a standard case to completely analyse the impact of an exoplanet and a
spot on interferometric observables and relate it to current instrument
capabilities, taking into account realistic achievable precisions.
  We built a numerical code called COMETS using analytical formulae to perform
a simple comparison of exoplanet and spot signals. We explore instrumental
specificities needed to detect them, like the baseline length required, the
accuracy and S/N. We also discuss the impact of exoplanet and spot parameters
on squared visibility and phase.
  We find that the main improvement to bring is the sensitivity of instruments.
The accuracy on squared visibilities has to be improved by a factor 10 to
detect an exoplanet of 0.1 mas, leading to $<0.5%$ precision, along with phase
measurements of ~$5^{\deg}$ accuracy beyond the first null of visibility. For a
0.05 mas exoplanet, accuracies of ~$0.1%$ and ~$1^{\deg}$ from the first null
are required on squared visibilities and phases, respectively. Magnetic spots
can mimic these signals, leading to false exoplanet characterization. Phases
measurements from the 3rd lobe is needed to distinguish between a spot and an
exoplanet if they have the same radius.
  Increasing interferometer sensitivity, more objects will become common
between interferometric targets and photometric ones. Furthermore, new missions
like PLATO, CHEOPS or TESS will provide bright exoplanet host stars.
Measurements will thus overlap and provide a better characterization of stellar
activity and exoplanet.

maximizes the law of the running maximum of an uniformly integrable martingale
with given terminal value distribution. Recently this optimality property has
been generalized to expectations of certain bivariate cost functions depending
on the terminal value and the running maximum.
  In this paper we give an extension of this result to another class of
functions. In particular, we study a class of cost functions with the property
that the corresponding optimal embeddings are not Azema-Yor. The suggested
approach is quite straightforward modulo basic facts of the Monge-Kantorovich
mass transportation theory. Loosely speaking, the joint distribution of the
running maximum and the terminal value in the Azema-Yor embedding is
concentrated on the graph of a monotone function, and we show that this fact
follows from the cyclical monotonicity criterion for solutions to the
Monge-Kantorovich problem.

constant density, but it also works well for conventional copper (or gilding
metal) jacketed lead bullets because the density of copper and lead are
sufficiently close. However, the original Miller twist rule significantly
underestimates the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped bullets, because the
density of plastic is much lower than the density of copper and lead. Here, a
new amended formula is developed for the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped
bullets by substituting the length of just the metal portion for the total
length in the $(1 + L^2)$ term of the original Miller twist rule. Part 2
describes experimental testing of this new formula on three plastic-tipped
bullets. The new formula is relatively accurate for plastic-tipped bullets
whose metal portion has nearly uniform density, but underestimates the
gyroscopic stability of bullets whose core is significantly less dense than the
jacket.

constitute a formidable challenge to solid state theory due to the interaction
of magnetic disorder, vibrations, and structural relaxations. CrN is a material
where these effects are particularly large due to a strong magneto-lattice
coupling and a tendency for deviations from the nominal 1:1 stoichiometry. In
this work we present a first-principles study of nitrogen vacancies and
nitrogen interstitals in CrN at elevated temperature. We report on formation
energetics, the geometry of interstital nitrogen dimers, and impact on the
electronic structure caused by the defects. We find a vacancy formation energy
of 2.28 eV with a small effect of temperature, a formation energy for N
interstitial in the form of a $\big<111\big>$ oriented split-bond of 3.77 eV
with an increase to 3.97 at 1000 K. Vacancies are found to add three electrons
while split bond interstitial adds one electron to the conduction band. The
band gap of defect-free CrN is smeared out due to vibrations, though it is
difficult to draw conclusion about the exact temperature at which the band gap
closes from our calculations. However, it is clear that at 900 K there is a
non-zero density of electronic states at the Fermi level. At 300 K our results
indicate a boarder case were the band-gap is about to close.

validity of our classification, (2) the profiles of limb faculae are limbward
skewed on average, while near disk center they exhibit both centerward and
limbward skewnesses due to the distribution of orientations of the faculae, (3)
the relation between the peak contrasts of BPs and faculae and their apparent
area discloses a trend reminiscent of magnetogram studies. The skewness of
facular profiles provides a novel constraint for 3D MHD models of faculae. As
suggested by the asymmetry and orientation of their contrast profiles, faculae
near disk center could be induced by inclined fields, while apparent BPs near
the limb seem to be in fact small faculae misidentified. The apparent area of
BPs and faculae could be possibly exploited for proxy magnetometry.

distributed computing. In its simplest variant, the broadcasting problem, a
message has to be spread among all nodes of a graph. A prominent communication
protocol for this problem is based on the random phone call model (Karp et al.,
FOCS 2000). In each step, every node opens a communication channel to a
randomly chosen neighbor for bi-directional communication.
  Motivated by replicated databases and peer-to-peer networks, Berenbrink et
al., ICALP 2010, considered the gossiping problem in the random phone call
model. There, each node starts with its own message and all messages have to be
disseminated to all nodes in the network. They showed that any $O(\log n)$-time
algorithm in complete graphs requires $\Omega(\log n)$ message transmissions
per node to complete gossiping, w.h.p, while for broadcasting the average
number of transmissions per node is $O(\log\log n)$.
  It is known that the $O(n\log\log n)$ bound on the number of transmissions
required for randomized broadcasting in complete graphs cannot be achieved in
sparse graphs even if they have best expansion and connectivity properties. In
this paper, we analyze whether a similar influence of the graph density also
holds w.r.t. the performance of gossiping. We study analytically and
empirically the communication overhead generated by randomized gossiping in
random graphs and consider simple modifications of the random phone call model
in these graphs. Our results indicate that, unlike in broadcasting, there is no
significant difference between the performance of randomized gossiping in
complete graphs and sparse random graphs. Furthermore, our simulations indicate
that by tuning the parameters of our algorithms, we can significantly reduce
the communication overhead compared to the traditional push-pull approach in
the graphs we consider.

of a giant star while both the orbital separation and the giant radius shrink
simultaneously, and a close binary system is formed. The binary system might be
viewed as evolving in a constant state of `just entering a common envelope (CE)

CE evolution where the secondary star is immerses in the giant's envelope. The
grazing envelope evolution (GEE) is made possible only if the companion manages
to accrete mass at a high rate and launch jets that remove the outskirts of the
giant envelope, hence preventing the formation of a CE . The high accretion
rate is made possible by the accretion disk that launches jets that efficiently
carry the excess angular momentum and energy from the accreted mass. The
orbital decay itself is caused by the gravitational interaction of the
secondary star with the envelope inward to its orbit, i.e., dynamical friction
(gravitational tide). Mass loss through the second Lagrangian point can carry
additional angular momentum and envelope mass. The GEE lasts for tens to
hundreds of years. The high accretion rate with peaks lasting months to years

focus on translationally invariant situations in which the single-particle

We develop a general formalism for the scattering of these Floquet-Bloch waves.
An important role is played by the conservation of Floquet quasi-energy, which
is defined only up to the addition of integer multiples of $\hbar\omega$ for a
Hamiltonian with period $T=2\pi/\omega$. We discuss the consequences of this
for the interpretation of ""elastic"" and ""inelastic"" scattering in cases of
physical interest. We illustrate our general results with applications to: the
scattering of a single particle in a Floquet-Bloch state from a static
potential; and, the scattering of two particles in Floquet-Bloch states through
their interparticle interaction. We analyse examples of these scattering
processes that are closely related to the schemes used to general artifical
gauge fields in cold-atom experiments, through optical dressing of internal
states, or through time-periodic modulations of tight-binding lattices. We show
that the effects of scattering cannot, in general, be understood by an
effective time-independent Hamiltonian, even in the limit $\omega \to \infty$
of rapid modulation. We discuss the relative sizes of the elastic scattering
(required to stablize many-body phases) and of the inelastic scattering

inelastic processes that can cause significant heating in current experimental

which are poster child nodal superconductors have not shown any such anomalous
scaling of PD, despite growing evidence of quantum critical points. Then it is
natural to ask when and how can quantum critical fluctuations cause anomalous
scaling of PD? Carrying out the renormalization group calculation for the

quantum critical fluctuations associated with point group symmetry reduction
result in non-universal logarithmic corrections to the $T$-dependence of the

proximity of this GRB, it is exceptional due to the extremely long-lived
high-energy (100 MeV to 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission, which was detected by the
Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for ~70 ks after
the initial burst. The persistent, hard-spectrum, high-energy emission suggests
that the highest-energy gamma rays may have been produced via synchrotron
self-Compton processes though there is also evidence that the high-energy
emission may instead be an extension of the synchrotron spectrum. VERITAS, a
ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array, began follow-up
observations of GRB 130427A ~71 ks (~20 hr) after the onset of the burst. The
GRB was not detected with VERITAS; however, the high elevation of the

positivity conjecture holds for cluster algebras of infinite rank. Furthermore,
we give a sufficient and necessary condition for a ring homomorphism between
cluster algebras to give rise to a rooted cluster morphism without
specializations. Assem, Dupont and Schiffler proposed the problem of a
classification of ideal rooted cluster morphisms. We provide a partial solution
by showing that every rooted cluster morphism without specializations is ideal,
but in general rooted cluster morphisms are not ideal.

presence of highly relativistic protons within the jet extends the simple
synchrotron self-Compton case not only in the very high energy radiation of

emitting region of the model by photon-meson production and emerging electron

parameter space for inclinations from 0 to 180 deg with 5deg increments
totalling nearly 6x10^5 numerical simulations. Thirty resonances internal and
external to the planet's location are monitored. We find that retrograde
resonances are unexpectedly more efficient at capture than prograde resonances
and that resonance order is not necessarily a good indicator of capture
efficiency at arbitrary inclination. Capture probability drops significantly at
moderate sample eccentricity for initial inclinations in the range
[10deg,110deg]. Orbit inversion is possible for initially circular orbits with
inclinations in the range [60deg,130deg]. Capture in the 1:1 coorbital
resonance occurs with great likelihood at large retrograde inclinations. The
planet's orbital eccentricity, if larger than 0.1, reduces the capture
probabilities through the action of the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. A
capture asymmetry appears between inner and outer resonances as prograde orbits
are preferentially trapped in inner resonances. The relative capture efficiency
of retrograde resonance suggests that the dynamical lifetimes of Damocloids and
Centaurs on retrograde orbits must be significantly larger than those on

of canonical changes of variables, we reduce the dimension and simplify the

periodic orbits known as guiding centers, we find that the dynamics is
essentially that of a pendulum coupled to a linear oscillator, leading to
stochastic reversals in the overall direction of rotation of the dipole. Near
the separatrix orbit in the isotropic system, we find other families of

We show that the converse is true: namely, $h$ is measurably determined by
$\mu_h$. More generally, given a random closed fractal subset $\mathcal A$
endowed with a Frostman measure $\sigma$ whose support is $\mathcal A$

that it determines its harmonic extension off $\mathcal A$. Our condition is
satisfied by the occupation measures of planar Brownian motion and SLE curves

  Epidemic",,,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ${\bf Background:}$ The early growth dynamics of the West African Ebola virus
epidemic has been qualitatively different for Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
However, it is important to understand these disparate dynamics as trends of a
single epidemic spread over regions with similar geographic and cultural
aspects, with likely common parameters for transmission rates and the
reproduction number $R_0$. ${\bf Methods:}$ We combine a discrete, stochastic
SEIR model with a two-scale community network model to demonstrate that the
different regional trends may be explained by different community mixing rates.
Heuristically, the effect of different community mixing rates may be understood
as the observation that two individuals infected by the same chain of
transmission are more likely to know one another in a less-mixed community.
Saturation effects occur as the contacts of an infected individual are more
likely to already be exposed by the same chain of transmission. ${\bf
Results:}$ The effects of community mixing, together with the effects of
stochasticity, can explain the qualitative difference in the growth of Ebola
virus cases in each country, and why the probability of large outbreaks may
have recently increased. An increase in the rate of Ebola cases in Guinea in
late August, and a local fitting of the transient dynamics of the Ebola cases
in Liberia, suggests that the epidemic in Liberia has been more severe, and the
epidemic in Guinea is worsening, due to discrete seeding events as the epidemic
spreads into new communities. ${\bf Conclusions:}$ A relatively simple network
model provides insight on the role of local effects such as saturation that
would be difficult to otherwise quantify. Our results predict that exponential
growth of an epidemic is driven by the exposure of new communities,
underscoring the importance of control measures that limit this spread.

trapped, Bose-Einstein condensate of microcavity polaritons. An efficient
numerical method (toolbox) to solve the complex Gross-Pitaevskii equation is
developed. Using this method, we investigate how the behavior of the number of
vortices formed inside the condensate changes as the various system parameters
are varied. In contrast to the atomic condensates, we show, there exists an
(experimentally realizable) range of parameter values in which all the vortices
can be made to vanish even when there is a high rotation. We further explore
how this region can be tuned through other free parameters and also discuss how
this study can help to realize the synthetic magnetic field for polaritons and
hence paving the way for the realization of the quantum Hall physics and many
other exotic phenomena.

in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments performed on chains of
magnetic atoms on a superconductor, we show, by generalizing earlier work, that
a multichannel ferromagnetic wire deposited on a spin-orbit coupled
superconducting substrate can realize a non-trivial chiral topological
superconducting state with Majorana bound states localized at the wire ends.
The non-trivial topological state occurs for generic parameters requiring no
fine tuning, at least for very large exchange spin splitting in the wire. We
theoretically obtain the signatures which appear in the presence of an
arbitrary number of Majorana modes in multi-wire systems incorporating the role
of finite temperature, finite potential barrier at the STM tip, and finite wire
length. These signatures are presented in terms of spatial profiles of STM
differential conductance which clearly reveal zero energy Majorana end modes
and the prediction of a multiple Majorana based fractional Josephson effect. A
substantial part of this work is devoted to a detailed critical comparison
between our theory and the recent STM experiment claiming the observation of
Majorana fermions. The conclusion of this detailed comparison is that although
the experimental observations are not manifestly inconsistent with our
theoretical findings, the very small topological superconducting gap and the
very high temperature of the experiment make it impossible to decisively verify
the existence of a localized Majorana zero mode, as the spectral weight of the
Majorana mode is necessarily spread over a very broad energy regime exceeding
the size of the gap. Thus, although the experimental findings are indeed
consistent with a highly broadened and weakened Majorana zero bias peak, much
lower experimental temperatures are necessary for any definitive conclusion.

applicable to a k-d tree. Hence, in order to build a balanced k-d tree, it is
necessary to find the median of the data for each recursive subdivision of

subdivision strongly influences the computational complexity of building a k-d

tree by presorting the data in each of k dimensions prior to building the tree.
It then preserves the order of these k sorts during tree construction and
thereby avoids the requirement for any further sorting. Moreover, this
algorithm is amenable to parallel execution via multiple threads. Compared to
an algorithm that finds the median for each recursive subdivision, this
presorting algorithm has equivalent performance for four dimensions and better
performance for three or fewer dimensions.

envelope of its giant-branch companion during a common envelope (CE) episode.
These CE episodes are necessary to produce close pairs of NSs that can inspiral
and merge due to gravitational wave losses in less than a Hubble time. Because
cooling by neutrinos can be very efficient, NSs have been predicted to
accumulate significant mass during CE events, perhaps enough to lead them to
collapse to black holes. We revisit this conclusion with the additional
consideration of CE structure, particularly density gradients across the
embedded NS's accretion radius. This work is informed by our recent numerical
simulations that find that the presence of a density gradient strongly limits
accretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the NS. Our
calculations suggest that NSs should survive CE encounters. They accrete only
modest amounts of envelope material, $\lesssim 0.1M_\odot$, which is broadly
consistent with mass determinations of double NS binaries. With less mass gain,
NSs must spiral deeper to eject their CE, leading to a potential increase in
mergers. The survival of NSs in CE events has implications for the formation
mechanism of observed double NS binaries, as well as for predicted rates of NS
binary gravitational wave inspirals and their electromagnetic counterparts.

multi-gravity, we reconsider the problem of constructing a ghost-free theory of
an interacting spin-2 field charged under a U(1) gauge symmetry. Our starting
point is the theory originally proposed by Federbush, which is essentially
Fierz-Pauli generalized to include a minimal coupling to a U(1) gauge field. We
show the Federbush theory with a dynamical U(1) field is in fact ghost-free and
can be treated as a healthy effective field theory to describe a massive
charged spin-2 particle. It can even potentially have healthy dynamics above
its strong-coupling scale. We then construct candidate gravitational extensions
to the Federbush theory both by using Dimensional Deconstruction, and by
constructing a general non-linear completion. However, we find that the U(1)
symmetry forces us to modify the form of the Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term. By
performing a constraint analysis directly in the first-order form, we show that
these modified kinetic terms inevitably reintroduce the Boulware-Deser ghost.
As a by-product of our analysis, we present a new proof for ghost-freedom of
bi-gravity in 2+1 dimensions (also known as Zwei-Dreibein gravity). We also
give a complementary algebraic argument that the Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term
is incompatible with a U(1) symmetry, for a finite number of gravitons.

weakly nonlinear convection. In addition to simulating the two thermal
conduction models with the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations, we also
study their effects in the reduced, ""sound-proof"" anelastic and

project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback
from supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material
contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the
intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as
well as the net, inflow of this ""smooth mode"" gas at all redshifts, regardless
of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the
temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2.
However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir
decreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates
of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this

accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of
two across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold
temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z<1. (d) The
amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy --

the mass range for the occurrence of hybrid CO(Ne) white dwarfs. We predict
electron-capture supernova (EC-SN) rates for lower metallicities which are
significantly lower than existing values from parametric studies in the
literature. We conclude the EC-SN channel (for single stars and with the
critical assumption being the choice of mass-loss rate) is very narrow in
initial mass, at most approximately 0.2 Msun. This implies that between ~ 2-5
per cent of all gravitational collapse supernova are EC-SNe in the metallicity
range Z=0.02 to 0.0001. With our choice for mass-loss prescription and computed
core growth rates we find, within our metallicity range, that CO cores cannot
grow sufficiently massive to undergo a Type 1.5 SN explosion.

the strongly first-order phase transition can occur at a high temperature

the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated via the lepton number

electroweak baryogenesis scenario can be realized at arbitrary scales and we
call this scenario as a scale free electroweak baryogenesis. This soft SUSY
breaking scale is determined by other requirements. If the soft SUSY breaking

the flavor experiments. Furthermore, the singlino can be a good candidate of

clusters (GCs) of their intra-cluster medium (ICM). This solves the problem of
the missing ICM in clusters, which is otherwise expected to build up to easily
observable quantities. To show this, we recreate the ionizing flux in 47 Tuc,
following randomly generated stars through their AGB, post-AGB and white dwarf
evolution. Each white dwarf can ionize all the material injected into the
cluster by stellar winds for ~3 Myr of its evolution: ~40 such white dwarfs
exist at any point. Every GC's ICM should be ionized. The neutral cloud in M15
should be caused by a temporary overdensity. A pressure-supported ICM will
expand over the cluster's tidal radius, where it will be truncated, allowing
Jeans escape. The modelled Jeans mass-loss rate approximates the total stellar
mass-loss rate, allowing efficient clearing of ICM. Any cluster's ICM mass
should equal the mass injected by its stars over the sound-travel time between
the cluster core and tidal radius. We predict ~11.3 solar masses of ICM within
47 Tuc, cleared over ~4 Myr, compared to a dynamical timescale of 4.3 Myr. We
present a new mass hierarchy, discussing the transition between globular

several hours, provide the best opportunity to study these processes and to
probe accretion physics. Using detailed models of ionized reflection, we
perform time resolved spectroscopy of the superburst observed from 4U 1636-536

evolution of the reflection fraction indicates that the initial reflection
occurs from a part of the disk at larger radius, subsequently transitioning to
reflection from an inner region of the disk. Even though this superburst did
not reach the Eddington limit, we find that a strong local absorber develops

momenta of the stellar and gas components, $\alpha_{\rm G,S}$, in early-type
galaxies (ETGs). We use the GALFORM model of galaxy formation, set in the
$\Lambda$ cold dark matter framework, and coupled it with a Monte-Carlo
simulation to follow the angular momenta flips driven by matter accretion onto
haloes and galaxies. We consider a gas disk to be misaligned with respect to
the stellar body if $\alpha_{\rm G,S}>30$~degrees. By assuming that the only
sources of misaligments in galaxies are galaxy mergers, we place a lower limit
of $2-5$ per cent on the fraction of ETGs with misaligned gas/stellar
components. These low fractions are inconsistent with the observed value of
$\approx 42\pm 6$ per cent in ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$. In the more general case, in
which smooth gas accretion in addition to galaxy mergers can drive
misalignments, our calculation predicts that $\approx 46$ per cent of ETGs have
$\alpha_{\rm G,S}>30$~degrees. In this calculation, we find correlations
between $\alpha_{\rm G,S}$ and stellar mass, cold gas fraction and star
formation rate, such that ETGs with high masses, low cold gas fractions and low
star formation rates are more likely to display aligned cold gas and stellar
components. We confirm these trends observationally for the first time using
ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ data. We argue that the high fraction of misaligned gas discs
observed in ETGs is mostly due to smooth gas accretion (e.g. cooling from the
hot halo of galaxies) which takes place after most of the stellar mass of the
galaxy is in place and comes misaligned with respect to the stellar component.
Galaxies that have accreted most of their cold gas content prior to the time
where most of the stellar mass was in place show aligned components.

structures and the cosmological parameters. On scales outside a few virial
radii, the halo bias, $b$, is linear and the lensing signal is dominated by the
correlated distribution of matter around galaxy clusters. We discuss a method
to measure the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and $b$ based on a minimal
modelling. We considered a sample of $\sim 120000$ clusters photometrically
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in the redshift range $0.1<z<0.6$.
The auto-correlation was studied through the two-point function of a subsample
of $\sim 70000$ clusters; the matter-halo correlation was derived from the weak
lensing signal of the subsample of $\sim 1200$ clusters with
Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey data. We obtained a direct measurement of
$b$, which increases with mass in agreement with predictions of the
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Assuming $\Omega_\mathrm{M}=0.3$, we found
$\sigma_8=0.78\pm0.16$. We used the same clusters for measuring both lensing
and clustering and the estimate of $\sigma_8$ did require neither the
mass-richness relation, nor the knowledge of the selection function, nor the
modelling of $b$. With an additional theoretical prior on the bias, we obtained
$\sigma_8=0.75\pm0.08$.

effective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 Mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us to

the faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higher
abundance of UV-bright galaxies at z>6, with M* ~ -21 at z>5, different than
that inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. At z=8, a single
power-law provides an equally good fit to the UV luminosity function, while at
z=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. We
compare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in M* is
consistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-end
of the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. We measure the
evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dust
attenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z>4,
consistent with observations at z>9. Our observations are consistent with a
reionization history that starts at z>10, completes at z>6, and reaches a
midpoint (x_HII = 0.5) at 6.7<z<9.4. Finally, our observations predict that the
abundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,
though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies. [abridged]

two reasons: Firstly, probing interactions at high invariant masses and

Standard Model, irrespective of a resonant or non-resonant character of a
particular BSM scenario. Secondly, under specific assumptions a class of models
exists for which the off-shell coupling measurement together with a measurement
of the on-shell signal strength can be re-interpreted in terms of a bound on
the total Higgs boson width. In this paper, we provide a first step towards a
classification of the models for which a total width measurement is viable and
we discuss examples of BSM models for which the off-shell coupling measurement
can be important in either constraining or even discovering new physics in the
upcoming LHC runs. Specifically, we discuss the quantitative impact of the
presence of dimension six operators on the (de)correlation of Higgs on- and
off-shell regions keeping track of all interference effects. We furthermore
investigate off-shell measurements in a wider context of new (non-)resonant

1-15 million year age range. Following up on reports of short-period
variability in young clusters, we designed a high-cadence photometric
monitoring campaign to search for deuterium-burning pulsation among a sample of
348 BDs and VLMSs in the four young clusters $\sigma$ Orionis, Chamaeleon I, IC
348, and Upper Scorpius. In the resulting light curves we achieved sensitivity
to periodic signals of amplitude several millimagnitudes, on timescales from 15
minutes to two weeks. Despite the exquisite data quality, we failed to detect
any periodicities below seven hours. We conclude that D-burning pulsations are
not able to grow to observable amplitudes in the early pre-main sequence. In
spite of the non-detection, we did uncover a rich set of variability behavior-
both periodic and aperiodic- on day to week timescales. We present new
compilations of variable sources from our sample, as well as three new
candidate cluster members in Chamaeleon I.

type of `symmetry breaking' for the fixed point subspace of the transfer
matrix, and relate physical anyon excitations to domain wall excitations at the
level of the transfer matrix. A topological phase transition to a trivial phase
triggers a change in the fixed point subspace to either a larger or smaller
symmetry and we explain how this relates to a condensation or confinement of
the corresponding anyon sectors. The tensor network formalism enables us to
determine the structure of the topological sectors in two-dimensional gapped
phases very efficiently, therefore opening novel avenues for studying
fundamental open questions related to anyon condensation.

braiding the zero modes. The measurement, however, is challenging as the

a setup for measuring the state of a Majorana qubit by employing standard tools

that a voltage-biased Josephson junction hosting Majorana fermions allows
photons to be emitted and absorbed at half the Josephson frequency. We show
that in the dispersive regime, our setup allows us to perform a quantum
nondemolition measurement and to reach the quantum limit. An appealing feature
of our setup is that the interaction of the Majorana qubit with the measurement
device can be turned on and off at will by changing the dc bias of the

cosmological information beyond the power spectrum, and will be an important
constraint of models of cosmology with the large survey areas provided by
forthcoming astronomical surveys. Surveys include masked areas due to bright
stars, bad pixels etc, which must be accounted for in producing constraints on
cosmology from shear maps. We advocate a forward-modeling approach, where the
impact of masking (and other survey artifacts) are accounted for in the
theoretical prediction of cosmological parameters, rather than removed from
survey data. We use masks based on the Deep Lens Survey, and explore the impact
of up to 37% of the survey area being masked on LSST and DES-scale surveys. By
reconstructing maps of aperture mass, the masking effect is smoothed out,
resulting in up to 14% smaller statistical uncertainties compared to simply
reducing the survey area by the masked area. We show that, even in the presence
of large survey masks, the bias in cosmological parameter estimation produced
in the forward-modeling process is ~1%, dominated by bias caused by limited
simulation volume. We also explore how this potential bias scales with survey
area and find that small survey areas are more significantly impacted by the
differences in cosmological structure in the data and simulated volumes, due to
cosmic variance.

transitions of ammonia: (J,K)=(6,6), (7,7), (9,9), (10,10), (12,12), (13,13),

above the ground state, and are observed in absorption against the HC-HII
region associated with NGC7538 IRS1. With a 500 AU linear resolution, we
resolve the elongated North-South ammonia structure into two compact
components: the main core and a southernmost component. Previous observations
of the radio continuum with a 0.08'' (or 200 AU) resolution, resolved in turn
the compact core in two (northern and southern) components. These features
correspond to a triple system of high-mass YSOs IRS1a, IRS1b, and IRS1c
identified with VLBI measurements of methanol masers. The velocity maps of the
compact core show a clear velocity gradient in all lines, which is indicative
of rotation in a (circumbinary) envelope, containing ~40 solar masses
(dynamical mass). In addition, we derived physical conditions of the molecular
gas: rotational temperatures ~280 K, ammonia column densities ~1.4-2.5 x 10^19
cm-2, H_2 volume densities ~3.5-6.2 x 10^10 cm-3, and a total gas mass in the

is the densest hot molecular core known, containing a rotating envelope which
hosts a multiple system of high-mass YSOs, possibly surrounded by accretion
disks. Future JVLA observations in the A-configuration are needed to resolve
the binary system in the core and may allow to study the gas kinematics in the

JHK) and first overtone (FO, J) Cepheids. The new templates together with PL
and PW relations provide Cepheid distances from single-epoch observations with
a precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. The
templates rely on a very large set of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds (MCs)
Cepheids (FU,~600; FO,~200) with well sampled NIR (IRSF data) and optical (V,I;
OGLE data) light curves. To properly trace the change in the shape of the light
curve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating Cepheids into
10 different period bins. The templates for the first time cover FO Cepheids
and the FU short-period Cepheids (P<5 days). Moreover, the zero-point phase is
anchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. The new
approach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump Cepheids
when compared with the phase of maximum light. We also provide new estimates of
the NIR-to-optical amplitude ratios for FU and FO Cepheids. We perform detailed
analytical fits using both 7th-order Fourier series and multi-Gaussian periodic
functions. The latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters
(9 vs 15). Mean NIR magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% more
accurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than mean
magnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertainties
ranging from 0.015 mag (J) to 0.019 mag (K). Moreover, the errors on individual
distances of Small MC Cepheids derived from NIR PW relations, are essentially
reduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations. Thus, the new
templates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise Cepheid distances from NIR
single-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3D structure of
the MCs.

of test particles in a thick brane scenario that corresponds to a regularized
version of the Garriga-Tanaka solution, which describes a black hole solution
in RSII model, in the weak field regime. By adapting a mechanism previously
formulated in order to describe the confinement of massive tests particles in a
domain wall (that simulates classically the trapping of the Dirac field in a
domain wall), we study the influence of the brane thickness on the
four-dimensional (4D) path of massless particles. Although the geometry is not
warped and, therefore, the bound motion in the transverse direction is not
decoupled from the movement in the 4D-world, we can find an explicit solution
for the light deflection and the time delay, if the motion in the fifth
direction is a high frequency oscillation. We verify that, owing to the
transverse motion, the light deflection and the time delay depend on the energy
of the light rays. This feature may lead to the phenomenon of gravitational
rainbow. We also consider the problem from a semi-classical perspective,
investigating the effects of the brane thickness on the motion of the zero-mode
in the 4D-world.

The co-evolution of galaxies and super massive black holes (SMBHs)
requires that some sort of feedback mechanism is operating during the active
galactic nuclei (AGN) phases. AGN driven winds are the most likely candidates
for such feedback mechanism, but direct observational evidence of their
existence and of their effects on the host galaxies are still scarce and their
physical origin is still hotly debated.
  Methods. X-shooter observations of a sample of X-ray selected, obscured
quasars at z$\sim$1.5, selected on the basis of their observed red colors and
X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, have shown the presence of outflowing ionized gas
identified by broad [OIII] emission lines in 6 out of 8 objects, confirming the
efficiency of the selection criteria. Here we present slit-resolved
spectroscopy for the two brightest sources, XID2028 and XID5321, to study the
complex emission and absorption line kinematics.
  Results. We detect outflow extended out to $\sim$ 10 kpc from the central
black hole (BH), both as blueshifted and redshifted emission. Interestingly, we
also detect kpc scale outflows in the [OII] emission lines and in the neutral
gas component, traced by the sodium D and magnesium absorption lines,
confirming that a substantial amount of the outflowing mass is in the form of
neutral gas.
  Conclusions. The measured gas velocities and the outflow kinetic powers,
inferred under reasonable assumptions on the geometry and physical properties
of these two systems, favor an AGN origin for the observed winds.

(NSs) which have been spun up to high rotation rates via accretion of matter
from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). However, many details
of this recycling scenario remain to be understood. Here we investigate binary
evolution in close LMXBs to study the formation of radio MSPs with low-mass
helium white dwarf companions (He WDs) in tight binaries with orbital periods
P_orb = 2-9 hr. In particular, we examine: i) if such observed systems can be
reproduced from theoretical modelling using standard prescriptions of orbital
angular momentum losses (i.e. with respect to the nature and the strength of
magnetic braking), ii) if our computations of the Roche-lobe detachments can
match the observed orbital periods, and iii) if the correlation between WD mass
and orbital period (M_WD, P_orb) is valid for systems with P_orb < 2 days.
Numerical calculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used to
trace the mass-transfer phase in ~ 400 close LMXB systems with different
initial values of donor star mass, NS mass, orbital period and the so-called
gamma-index of magnetic braking. Subsequently, we followed the orbital and the
interior evolution of the detached low-mass (proto) He WDs, including stages
with residual shell hydrogen burning. We find that a severe fine-tuning is
necessary to reproduce the observed MSPs in tight binaries with He WD
companions of mass < 0.20 M_sun, which suggests that something needs to be
modified or is missing in the standard input physics of LMXB modelling. We
demonstrate that the theoretically calculated (M_WD, P_orb)-relation is in
general also valid for systems with P_orb < 2 days, although with a large
scatter in He WD masses between 0.15-0.20 M_sun. The results of the thermal
evolution of the (proto) He WDs are reported in a follow-up paper (Paper II).

recently been discovered. The majority of these are orbiting another WD or a
millisecond pulsar (MSP) in a close binary system; a few examples are found to
show pulsations or to have a main-sequence star companion. There appear to be
discrepancies between the current theoretical modelling of such low-mass He WDs
and a number of key observed cases, indicating that their formation scenario
remains to be fully understood. Here we investigate the formation of detached
proto-He WDs in close-orbit low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Our prime focus is
to examine the thermal evolution and the contraction phase towards the WD
cooling track and investigate how this evolution depends on the WD mass. Our
calculations are then compared to the most recent observational data. Numerical
calculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used to trace the
mass-transfer phase in a large number of close-orbit LMXBs. Subsequently, we
followed the evolution of the detached low-mass proto-He WDs, including stages
with residual shell hydrogen burning and vigorous flashes caused by unstable
CNO burning. We find that the time between Roche-lobe detachment until the
low-mass proto-He WD reaches the WD cooling track is typically Delta_t_proto =
0.5 - 2 Gyr, depending systematically on the WD mass and therefore on its
luminosity. The lowest WD mass for developing shell flashes is ~0.21 M_sun for
progenitor stars of mass M2 <= 1.5 M_sun (and ~0.18 M_sun for M2 = 1.6 M_sun).
The long timescale of low-mass proto-He WD evolution can explain a number of
recent observations, including some MSP systems hosting He WD companions with
very low surface gravities and high effective temperatures. We find no evidence
for Delta_t_proto to depend on the occurrence of flashes and thus question the
suggested dichotomy in thermal evolution of proto-WDs.

discussed within the context of a Keating model and density functional
calculations. The Keating model is based on atomistic modeling of elastic
interactions in binary alloy using harmonic springs with species dependent
equilibrium lengths. It is demonstrated that the continuum limit for the strain
field are the usual equations of linear elasticity for alloys and that they
correctly capture the coarse-grained displacement field. In addition, it is
established that Euler-Lagrange equation of the continuum limit of the elastic
energy will yield the same strain field equation. However, a direct calculation
of the elastic energy of the atomistic model reveals that the continuum
expression for the elastic energy is both qualitatively and quantitatively
incorrect. This is because it does not take atomistic scale compositional
non-uniformity into account. Importantly, we also shows that finely mixed
alloys tend to have more elastic energy than segregated systems, which is the
opposite of predictions by some continuum theories. It is also shown that for
strained thin films the traditionally used effective misfit for alloys
systematically underestimate the strain energy. In some models, this drawback
is handled by including an elastic contribution to the enthalpy of mixing which
is characterized in terms of the continuum concentration. The direct
calculation of the atomistic model reveals that this approach suffers serious
difficulties. It is demonstrated that elastic contribution to the enthalpy of
mixing is non-isotropic and scale dependent. It also shown that such effects
are present in density-functional theory calculations for the Si/Ge and Ag/Pt
systems. This work demonstrates that it is critical to include the microscopic
arrangements in any elastic model to achieve even qualitatively correct
behavior.

attenuation mechanism in granular media, with special applicability to the
measurements of the so-called effective mass developed earlier. We consider
that the particles interact via Hertz-Mindlin elastic contact forces and that
the damping is describable as a force proportional to the velocity difference
of contacting grains. We determine the behavior of the complex-valued normal
mode frequencies using 1) DEM, 2) direct diagonalization of the relevant
matrix, and 3) a numerical search for the zeros of the relevant determinant.
All three methods are in strong agreement with each other. The real and the
imaginary parts of each normal mode frequency characterize the elastic and the
dissipative properties, respectively, of the granular medium. We demonstrate
that, as the interparticle damping, $\xi$, increases, the normal modes exhibit
nearly circular trajectories in the complex frequency plane and that for a
given value of $\xi$ they all lie on or near a circle of radius $R$ centered on
the point $-iR$ in the complex plane, where $R\propto 1/\xi$. We show that each
normal mode becomes critically damped at a value of the damping parameter $\xi
\approx 1/\omega_n^0$, where $\omega_n^0$ is the (real-valued) frequency when
there is no damping. The strong indication is that these conclusions carry over
to the properties of real granular media whose dissipation is dominated by the
relative motion of contacting grains. For example, compressional or shear waves

well-known that those edges normally do not cross when drawn over the sentence.
Here a new null hypothesis for the number of edge crossings of a sentence is
presented. That null hypothesis takes into account the length of the pair of
edges that may cross and predicts the relative number of crossings in random
trees with a small error, suggesting that a ban of crossings or a principle of
minimization of crossings are not needed in general to explain the origins of
non-crossing dependencies. Our work paves the way for more powerful null

into the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian comprising a sum of commuting terms.
Since such Hamiltonians are gapped they are considered natural candidates for
protection of quantum information and topological or adiabatic quantum
computation. However, we prove that they cannot be used to this end in the
2-local case. By making the favorable assumption that the gap is infinite we
show that single-site perturbations can generate a degeneracy splitting in the
ground subspace of this type of Hamiltonians which is of the same order as the
magnitude of the perturbation, and is independent of the number of interacting
sites and their Hilbert space dimensions, just as in the absence of the
protecting Hamiltonian. This splitting results in decoherence of the ground
subspace, and we demonstrate that for natural noise models the coherence time
is proportional to the inverse of the degeneracy splitting. Our proof involves
a new version of the no-hiding theorem which shows that quantum information
cannot be approximately hidden in the correlations between two quantum systems,
and should be of independent interest. The main reason that 2-local commuting
Hamiltonians cannot be used for quantum error suppression is that their ground
subspaces have only short-range (two-body) entanglement.

heliolongitudes. We use Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and white-light coronagraph

Observatory spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B) to determine the angular extent

the SEP event. We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each
spacecraft with the arrival time of the structures associated with the CME at
the footpoints of the field lines connecting each spacecraft with the Sun.
Whereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of
STEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the
particles observed by this spacecraft, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint
of the field lines connecting near-Earth observers with the Sun, even though an
intense SEP event was observed there. We show that the west flank of the
CME-driven shock propagating at high altitudes above the solar surface was most
likely the source of the particles observed near Earth, but it did not leave
any EUV trace on the solar disk. We conclude that the angular extent of the EUV
wave on the solar surface did not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP
event in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used reliably as a proxy
for the solar phenomena that accelerates and injects energetic particles over
broad ranges of longitudes.

critical for satisfying the growing electricity demand in the US. The primary
mechanism for demand management in the US is demand response (DR) programs that
attempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating
customers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR
programs rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR
signals. The ADRs are faulty; but the working state of the ADR is not directly
observable --one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption
during DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not
respond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset
the ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of
maintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be
formulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a
near-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices. We show that the
Whittle indices can be efficiently computed using a variational Bayes procedure

between the clocks at the utility and at the meter. The results of our

(i.e., exact sequences $0\to X\to X\oplus_\Omega X \to X\to 0$ in which the
quotient map is strictly singular), in which $X$ is the interpolation space
arising from a complex interpolation scheme and $\Omega$ is the induced
centralizer.
  Although our methods are quite general, in our applications we are mainly
concerned with the choice of $X$ as either a Hilbert space, or Ferenczi's
uniformly convex Hereditarily Indecomposable space. In the first case, we
construct new singular twisted Hilbert spaces, including the only known example
so far: the Kalton-Peck space $Z_2$. In the second case we obtain the first
example of an H.I. twisted sum of an H.I. space. We then use Rochberg's
description of iterated twisted sums to show that there is a sequence $\mathcal
F_n$ of H.I. spaces so that $\mathcal F_{m+n}$ is a singular twisted sum of
$\mathcal F_m$ and $\mathcal F_n$, while for $l>n$ the direct sum $\mathcal F_n
\oplus \mathcal F_{l+m}$ is a nontrivial twisted sum of $\mathcal F_l$ and
$\mathcal F_{m+n}$.
  We also introduce and study the notion of disjoint singular twisted sum of
K\""othe function spaces and construct several examples involving reflexive
$p$-convex K\""othe function spaces, which include the function version of the

  systems with multiple antenna arrays",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of the millimeter (mm) wave spectrum for next generation (5G) mobile
communication has gained significant attention recently. The small carrier
wavelengths at mmwave frequencies enable synthesis of compact antenna arrays,
providing beamforming gains that compensate the increased propagation losses.
In this work, we investigate the feasibility of employing multiple antenna
arrays to obtain diversity/multiplexing gains in mmwave systems, where each of
the arrays is capable of beamforming independently. Considering a codebook
based beamforming system (e.g., to facilitate limited feedback), we observe
that the complexity of \emph{jointly} optimizing the beamforming directions
across the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable
system parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity
algorithms for optimizing the choice of beamforming directions, premised on the
sparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically, we reduce the
cardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to
a small set of dominant candidate directions. To obtain the set of dominant
directions, we develop two complementary approaches: (a) based on computation
of a novel spatial power metric; a detailed analysis of this metric shows that,
in the limit of large antenna arrays, the selected candidate directions
approach the channel's dominant angles of arrival and departure, and (b)
precise estimation of the channel's (long-term) dominant angles of arrival,
exploiting the correlations of the signals received across the different
receiver subarrays. Our methods enable a drastic reduction of the optimization
search space (a factor of 100 reduction), while delivering close to optimal
performance, thereby indicating the potential feasibility of achieving
diversity and multiplexing gains in mmwave systems.

feasible to manipulate transient behaviors of a solid propeller-like system
such that the system can be turned by a weak buoyancy force, induced by the

quantum systems based on matter. In addition, when this interaction includes
driven magnetic fields, it can be controlled to sustain, characterize or modify
entanglement and other quantum properties. In this work, recent results about
evolution in a general anisotropic three dimensional Ising model including an
inhomogeneous magnetic field is considered to obtain some general quantum
control effects for their sustainability, programmed evolution or

been proposed to learn data-dependent hash functions which map a feature vector

during the binarization step which also causes ambiguity in measuring sample
similarity using Hamming distance. Besides, the learned hash functions cannot
be changed after training, which makes them incapable of adapting to new data

a flexible bitwise weight learning framework based on the binary codes obtained
by state-of-the-art hashing methods, and incorporate the learned weights into
the weighted Hamming distance computation. We then formulate the proposed
framework as a ranking problem and leverage the Ranking SVM model to offline
tackle the weight learning. The framework is further extended to an online mode
which updates the weights at each time new data comes, thereby making it
scalable to large and dynamic data sets. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate significant performance gains of using binary codes with bitwise
weighting in image retrieval tasks. It is appealing that the online weight
learning leads to comparable accuracy with its offline counterpart, which thus
makes our approach practical for realistic applications.

solve the equation numerically: one is a upwind scheme, the other two are
different central schemes. We observed that all the methods are stable and can
keep the total probability, but have totally different long-time behaviors

infinitesimal diffusion leads to a same artificial steady state. So upwind
scheme does not work due to its intrinsic numerical viscosity. We find one of
the central schemes introduces a numerical viscosity term too, which is beyond
the common understanding in the convection-diffusion community. Careful
analysis is presented to prove that the other central scheme does work. Our

for effective electrostatic pair interactions, we perform molecular dynamics
simulations to compute macroion-macroion radial distribution functions, static

Muons produced in charged current (CC) interactions of muon neutrinos with the

in the Resistive Plate Chambers~(RPCs) that are interleaved with iron layers.
Since the RPCs will be operated in the avalanche mode the signal rise-time is
$\sim~1~\rm{nsec}$ resulting in a fast time response. While the muon track is
derived from the X and Y hit information of the RPCs and the layer number (Z),
the upward or downward direction is obtained by using the time information from
the detector. Such a capability can be examined by analysing the timing
information from $1~\rm{m}~\times~1~\rm{m}$ glass RPCs, with $3~\rm{cm}$ wide
X- and Y- pick-up strips, in a $12$ layer RPC stack that measures cosmic muon
events. The present study looks at the pixel-wise time response of these RPCs

the cable and pick-up panel the time resolution improves, in some cases, to
$\leq~1~\rm{nsec}$ whereas in some cases there is no significant change. These
results will help in significantly improving on the extraction of the

compact compared with typical open clusters. The formation process of young
massive clusters is still unclear, and it is an open question whether the
formation process is the same as typical open clusters or not. We perform a
series of $N$-body simulations starting from initial conditions constructed
from the results of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds.
In our simulations, both open clusters and young massive clusters form when we
assume a density-dependent star formation efficiency. We find that a local star
formation efficiency higher than 50 % is necessary for the formation of young
massive clusters, but open clusters forms from less dense regions with a local
star formation efficiency of $<50$ %. We confirm that the young massive
clusters formed in our simulations have mass, size, and density profile similar
to those of observed young massive clusters such as NGC 3603 and Trumpler 14.
We also find that these simulated clusters evolve via hierarchical mergers of
sub-clusters within a few Myr, as is suggested by recent simulations and
observations. Although we do not assume initial mass segregation, we observe
that the simulated massive clusters show a shallower slope of the mass function
($\Gamma\sim-1$) in the cluster center compared to that of the entire cluster
($\Gamma\sim-1.3$). These values are consistent with those of some young
massive clusters in the Milky Way such as Westerlund 1 and Arches.

primary goal is to understand how dense filaments form in Giant Molecular
Clouds (GMCs). These structures, often observed as Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs)
in the Galactic plane, are thought to be the precursors to massive stars and
star clusters, so their formation may be the rate limiting step controlling
global star formation rates in galactic systems as described by the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our study follows on from Van Loo et al. (2013,
Paper I), which carried out simulations to 0.5~pc resolution and examined
global aspects of the formation of dense gas clumps and the resulting star
formation rate. Here, using our higher resolution, we examine the detailed
structural, kinematic and dynamical properties of dense filaments and clumps,
including mass surface density ($\Sigma$) probability distribution functions,
filament mass per unit length and its dispersion, lateral $\Sigma$ profiles,
filament fragmentation, filament velocity gradients and infall, and degree of
filament and clump virialization. Where possible, these properties are compared
to observations of IRDCs. By many metrics, especially too large mass fractions
of high $\Sigma>1\:{\rm g\:cm^{-2}}$ material, too high mass per unit length
dispersion due to dense clump formation, too high velocity gradients and too
high velocity dispersion for a given mass per unit length, the simulated
filaments differ from observed IRDCs. We thus conclude that IRDCs do not form
from global fast collapse of GMCs. Rather, we expect IRDC formation and
collapse is slowed significantly by the influence of dynamically important
magnetic fields, which may thus play a crucial role in regulating galactic star
formation rates.

observation of mixed valency in quantum critical $\beta$-YbAlB$_4$ has prompted
study of this model away from particle-hole symmetry. The critical spin
response associated with all Kondo destruction QCPs has been shown to be
accompanied, for $r=0.6$ and noninteger occupation of the impurity site, by a
divergence of the local charge susceptibility on both sides of the QCP. In this
work, we use the numerical renormalization-group method to characterize the
Kondo-destruction charge response using five critical exponents, which are
found to assume nontrivial values only for $0.55\lesssim r < 1$. For $0 < r
\lesssim 0.55$, by contrast, the local charge susceptibility shows no
divergence at the QCP, but rather exhibits nonanalytic corrections to a regular
leading behavior. Both the charge critical exponents and the previously
obtained spin critical exponents satisfy a set of scaling relations derived
from an ansatz for the free energy near the QCP. These critical exponents can
all be expressed in terms of just two underlying exponents: the
correlation-length exponent $\nu(r)$ and the gap exponent $\Delta(r)$. The
ansatz predicts a divergent local charge susceptibility for $\nu<2$, which
coincides closely with the observed range $0.55\lesssim r<1$. Many of these
results are argued to generalize to interacting QCPs that have been found in
other quantum impurity models.

chemical substitution, we have grown single crystals of TMP-F4TCNQ and analyzed
its electronic structure via electronic transport measurements, ab initio
density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV/VIS/IR absorption
spectroscopy. This system shows an almost ideal geometrical overlap of nearly
planar molecules alternately stacked (mixed stack) and this arrangement is
echoed by a semiconductor-like transport behavior with an increased
conductivity along the stacking direction. This is in contrast to TMP-TCNQ
which shows a less pronounced anisotropy and a smaller conductivity response.
Our bandstructure calculations confirm the one-dimensional behavior of
TMP-F4TCNQ with pro- nounced dispersion only along the stacking axis. Infrared
measurements illustrating the CN vibration frequency shift in F4TCNQ suggest
however no improvement on the degree of charge transfer in TMP-F4TCNQ with
respect to TMP-TCNQ. In both complexes about 0.1 is transferred from TMP to the
acceptor. Concerning the pressure effect, our DFT calculations on designed
TMP-TCNQ and TMP-F4TCNQ structures under different pressure conditions show
that application of uniaxial pressure along the stacking axis of TMP-TCNQ may
be the route to follow in order to obtain a much more pronounced charge

still one to two magnitudes fainter than the near infrared data). We follow-up

control theory, dynamical programming and finite element methods for solving
some partial differential equations. In most of these applications, it is
needed to compute a symmetric and positive definite solution. Here, we propose
new iterative algorithms for solving three different types of nonlinear matrix
equations. We have recently proposed a new algorithm for solving positive
definite total least squares problems. Making use of an iterative process for
inverse of a matrix, we convert the nonlinear matrix equation to an iterative
linear one, and, in every iteration, we apply our algorithm for solving a
positive definite total least squares problem to solve the linear subproblem
and update the newly defined variables and the matrix inverse terms using
appropriate formulas. Our proposed algorithms have a number of useful features.
One is that the computed unknown matrix remains symmetric and positive definite
in all iterations. As the second useful feature, numerical test results show
that in most cases our proposed approach turns to compute solutions with
smaller errors within lower computing times. Finally, we provide some test
results showing that our proposed algorithm converges to a symmetric and
positive definite solution in Matlab software environment on a PC, while other
methods fail to do so.

utilize CARMA's eight 3.5-m antennas to monitor an atmospheric calibrator while
simultaneously acquiring science observations with 6.1-m and 10.4-m antennas on
baselines ranging from a few hundred meters to ~2 km. We find that C-PACS is
systematically successful at improving coherence on long baselines under a

the atmospheric calibrator and target source is the most important
consideration, with consistently successful phase correction at CARMA requiring
a suitable calibrator located $\lesssim$6$^\circ$ away from the science target.

perturbation can be rejected with moderate significance, with $p$-value $\sim
0.07$ out to redshift $z < 0.045$. We estimate the direction of maximal
anisotropy on the sky for various pre-existing catalogs and show that it
remains relatively unaffected by the light curve fitting procedure. However the
recovered direction is biased by the underlying distribution of data points on
the sky. We estimate both the uncertainty and bias in the direction by creating
mock data containing a randomly oriented bulk flow and using our method to
reconstruct its direction. We conclude that the inhomogeneous nature of the
data introduces a directional bias in galactic latitude of approximately
$|\Delta b_{\rm max}| \sim 18^{\circ}$ for the supernova catalog considered in
this work, and after correcting for this effect we infer the direction of
maximum anisotropy as $(b,\ell) = (20^{\circ}, 276^{\circ}) \pm
(12^{\circ},29^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates. Finally we compare the
anisotropic signal in the data to mock realisations in which large scale
velocity perturbations are consistently accounted for at the level of linear
perturbation theory. We show that including the effect of the velocity
perturbation in our mock catalogs degrades the significance of the anisotropy
considerably, with $p$-value increasing to $\sim 0.29$. One can conclude from
our analysis that there is a moderate deviation from isotropy in the supernova
data, but the signal is consistent with a large scale bulk velocity expected

photoproduction of a neutrino-antineutrino pair on an electron, $\gamma e \to e

neutrino emissivity in both the non-resonance and the resonance cases has been
calculated with taking account of the photon dispersion properties in medium.
Our results show that the neutrino emissivity owing to the $\gamma e \to e \nu

  Information","To appear in Proceedings of ACNS 2015",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cryptographic access control has been studied for over 30 years and is now a
mature research topic. When symmetric cryptographic primitives are used, each
protected resource is encrypted and only authorized users should have access to
the encryption key. By treating the keys themselves as protected resources, it
is possible to develop schemes in which authorized keys are derived from the
keys explicitly assigned to the user's possession and publicly available
information. It has been generally assumed that each user would be assigned a
single key from which all other authorized keys would be derived. Recent work
has challenged this assumption by developing schemes that do not require public
information, the trade-off being that a user may require more than one key.
However, these new schemes, which require a chain partition of the partially
ordered set on which the access control policy is based, have some
disadvantages. In this paper we define the notion of a tree-based cryptographic
enforcement scheme, which, like chain-based schemes, requires no public
information. We establish that the strong security properties of chain-based
schemes are preserved by tree-based schemes, and provide an efficient
construction for deriving a tree-based enforcement scheme from a given policy
that minimizes the number of keys required.

the capability of finding models that are optimal wrt. some cost functions. In
previous work, namely ""Optimization Modulo Theory with Linear Rational Cost

minimization of cost functions on linear arithmetic over the rationals, by
means of a combination of SMT and LP minimization techniques. In this paper we
push the envelope of our OMT approach along three directions: first, we extend
it to work also with linear arithmetic on the mixed integer/rational domain, by
means of a combination of SMT, LP and ILP minimization techniques; second, we
develop a multi-objective version of OMT, so that to handle many cost functions
simultaneously; third, we develop an incremental version of OMT, so that to
exploit the incrementality of some OMT-encodable problems. An empirical
evaluation performed on OMT-encoded verification problems demonstrates the
usefulness and efficiency of these extensions.

deep-inelastic collisions of the light systems as the bombarding energy
increases owing to the competition between collective motion and
single-particle degrees of freedom. The role of spin-orbit force is given
particular emphasis in deep-inelastic collisions. The spin-orbit force causes a
significant enhancement of the dissipation. The time-even coupling of
spin-orbit force plays a dominant role at low energies, while the influence of
time-odd terms is notable at high energies. About 40-65\% of the total
dissipation depending on the different parameter sets is predicted to arise
from the spin-orbit force. The theoretical fusion cross section has a
reasonably good agreement with the experimental data, considering that no free
parameters are adjusted to reaction dynamics in the TDHF approach.

Alicante 1, embedded in Cam OB3. Aims. MY Cam consists of two early-O type
main-sequence stars and shows a photometric modulation suggesting an orbital
period slightly above one day. We intend to confirm this orbital period and
derive orbital and stellar parameters. Methods. Timing analysis of a very
exhaustive (4607 points) light curve indicates a period of 1.1754514 +-
0.0000015 d. High- resolution spectra and the cross-correlation technique
implemented in the TODCOR program were used to derive radial velocities and
obtain the corresponding radial velocity curves for MY Cam. Modelling with the
stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND was used to obtain stellar parameters and
create templates for cross-correlation. Stellar and orbital parameters were
derived using the Wilson-Devinney code, such that a complete solution to the
binary system could be described. Results. The determined masses of the primary
and secondary stars in MY Cam are 37.7 +- 1.6 and 31.6 +- 1.4 Msol,
respectively. The corresponding temperatures, derived from the model atmosphere
fit, are 42 000 and 39 000 K, with the more massive component being hotter.
Both stars are overfilling their Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope.
Conclusions. MY Cam contains the most massive dwarf O-type stars found so far
in an eclipsing binary. Both components are still on the main sequence, and
probably not far from the zero-age main sequence. The system is a likely merger
progenitor, owing to its very short period.

In the upper atmosphere of the Sun observations show convincing
evidence for crossing and twisted structures, which are interpreted as mutual
helicity and self-helicity. Aims. We use observations with the new Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to show the conversion of mutual helicity
into self-helicity in coronal structures on the Sun. Methods. Using far UV
spectra and slit-jaw images from IRIS and coronal images and magnetograms from
SDO, we investigated the evolution of two crossing loops in an active region,
in particular, the properties of the Si IV line profile in cool loops. Results.
In the early stage two cool loops cross each other and accordingly have mutual
helicity. The Doppler shifts in the loops indicate that they wind around each
other. As a consequence, near the crossing point of the loops (interchange)
reconnection sets in, which heats the plasma. This is consistent with the
observed increase of the line width and of the appearance of the loops at
higher temperatures. After this interaction, the two new loops run in parallel,
and in one of them shows a clear spectral tilt of the Si IV line profile. This
is indicative of a helical (twisting) motion, which is the same as to say that
the loop has self-helicity. Conclusions. The high spatial and spectral
resolution of IRIS allowed us to see the conversion of mutual helicity to
self-helicity in the (interchange) reconnection of two loops. This is
observational evidence for earlier theoretical speculations.

Binary convolutions, such as polynomial multiplication or the Walsh Transform
are a useful tool in many applications and are efficiently solved.
  In the last decade, several problems required efficient solution of sparse
binary convolutions. both randomized and deterministic algorithms were
developed for efficiently computing the sparse polynomial multiplication. The
key operation in all these algorithms was length reduction. The sparse data is
mapped into small vectors that preserve the convolution result. The reduction
method used to-date was the modulo function since it preserves location (of the
""1"" bits) up to cyclic shift.
  To date there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the sparse Walsh
transform. Since the modulo function does not preserve the Walsh transform a
new method for length reduction is needed. In this paper we present such a new
method - polynomials. This method enables the development of an efficient
algorithm for computing the binary sparse Walsh transform. To our knowledge,
this is the first such algorithm. We also show that this method allows a faster
deterministic computation of sparse polynomial multiplication than currently
known in the literature.

turn out to be very simple and manifestly coincide with those of a polymer
quantisation of a Bianchi I model for the simplest choice of full theory
quantum states compatible with the Bianchi I reduction. In particular, the
""improved"" $\bar{\mu}$ dynamics of loop quantum cosmology can be obtained by
modifying the regularisation of the Hamiltonian constraint with similar ideas,
in turn yielding insights into the full theory dynamics.

spatial diffeomorphism constraint, we propose two distinct quantum reductions
to spherical symmetry within full 3+1-dimensional loop quantum gravity. The
construction of observables corresponds to using the radial gauge for the
spatial metric and allows to identify rotations around a central observer as
unitary transformations in the quantum theory. Group averaging over these
rotations yields our first proposal for spherical symmetry. Hamiltonians of the
full theory with angle-independent lapse preserve this spherically symmetric
subsector of the full Hilbert space. A second proposal consists in implementing
the vanishing of a certain vector field in spherical symmetry as a constraint
on the full Hilbert space, leading to a close analogue of diffeomorphisms
invariant states. While this second set of spherically symmetric states does
not allow for using the full Hamiltonian, it is naturally suited to implement
the spherically symmetric midisuperspace Hamiltonian, as an operator in the
full theory, on it. Due to the canonical structure of the reduced variables,
the holonomy-flux algebra behaves effectively as a one parameter family of
2+1-dimensional algebras along the radial coordinate, leading to a diagonal
non-vanishing volume operator on 3-valent vertices. The quantum dynamics thus
becomes tractable, including scenarios like spherically symmetric dust
collapse.

heavy-tailed, specifically lognormal, distributions for rates, weights and

neurotransmitter (GABA (striatum) or glutamate (cortex)) or the level of
activation (low in cortex, high in Purkinje cells and midbrain nuclei) turns
out to be irrelevant for this feature. Logarithmic scale distribution of
weights and gains appears to be a general, functional property in all cases
analyzed. We then created a generic neural model to investigate adaptive
learning rules that create and maintain lognormal distributions. We
conclusively demonstrate that not only weights, but also intrinsic gains, need
to have strong Hebbian learning in order to produce and maintain the
experimentally attested distributions. This provides a solution to the
long-standing question about the type of plasticity exhibited by intrinsic
excitability.

average radial drifts. In omnigeneous stellarators, particles are perfectly
confined in the absence of turbulence and collisions, whereas in
non-omnigeneous configurations, particle can drift large radial distances. One
of the consequences of omnigeneity is that the unfavorable inverse scaling with
collisionality of the stellarator neoclassical fluxes disappears. In the
pioneering and influential article [Cary~J~R and Shasharina~S~G 1997 {\it Phys.
Plasmas} {\bf 4} 3323], the conditions that the magnetic field of a stellarator
must satisfy to be omnigeneous are derived. However, reference [Cary~J~R and

omnigeneous stellarators in which all the minima of the magnetic field strength

We show that omnigenenous magnetic fields can have local minima and maxima with
different values. Thus, the parameter space in which omnigeneous stellarators
are possible is larger than previously expected. The analysis presented in this

it is not applicable to energetic particles. However, one would expect that
improving neoclassical confinement would improve energetic particle
confinement.

focused on logical centralization and programmability. At the same time,
distributed routing protocols, most notably OSPF and IS-IS, are still prevalent
in IP networks, as they provide shortest path routing, fast topological
convergence after network failures, and, perhaps most importantly, the
confidence based on decades of reliable operation. Therefore, a hybrid SDN/OSPF
operation remains a desirable proposition. In this paper, we propose a new
method of hybrid SDN/OSPF operation. Our method is different from other hybrid
approaches, as it uses SDN nodes to partition an OSPF domain into sub-domains
thereby achieving the traffic engineering capabilities comparable to full SDN
operation. We place SDN-enabled routers as sub-domain border nodes, while the
operation of the OSPF protocol continues unaffected. In this way, the SDN
controller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes
before they are flooded into sub-domains. While local routing inside
sub-domains remains stable at all times, inter-sub-domain routes can be
optimized by determining the routes in each traversed sub-domain. As the
majority of traffic in non-trivial topologies has to traverse multiple
sub-domains, our simulation results confirm that a few SDN nodes allow traffic
engineering up to a degree that renders full SDN deployment unnecessary.

between the laser electric field and the atomic Coulomb field which controls
the low-energy spectrum also for small $\gamma$. In the present joint
experimental and theoretical study we investigate the vectorial momentum
spectrum at very low energies. Using a reaction microscope optimized for the
detection of very low energy electrons, we have performed a thorough study of
the three-dimensional momentum spectrum well below 1 eV. Our measurements are
complemented by quantum and classical simulations, which allow for an
interpretation of the LES, VLES and of the newly identified ZES in terms of
two-dimensional Coulomb focusing and recapture into Rydberg states,
respectively.

perform high contrast imaging at small angular separations. They feature a very
small inner working angle, a clear 360 degree discovery space, have
demonstrated very high contrast capabilities, are easy to implement on
high-contrast imaging instruments, and have already been extensively tested on
the sky. Since 2005, we have been designing, developing and testing an
implementation of the charge-2 vector vortex phase mask based on concentric
subwavelength gratings, referred to as the Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM).
Science-grade mid-infrared AGPMs were produced in 2012 for the first time,
using plasma etching on synthetic diamond substrates. They have been validated
on a coronagraphic test bench, showing broadband peak rejection up to 500:1 in
the L band, which translates into a raw contrast of about $6\times 10^{-5}$ at
$2 \lambda/D$. Three of them have now been installed on world-leading
diffraction-limited infrared cameras (VLT/NACO, VLT/VISIR and LBT/LMIRCam).
During the science verification observations with our L-band AGPM on NACO, we
observed the beta Pictoris system and obtained unprecedented sensitivity limits
to planetary companions down to the diffraction limit ($0.1''$). More recently,
we obtained new images of the HR 8799 system at L band during the AGPM first
light on LMIRCam. After reviewing these first results obtained with
mid-infrared AGPMs, we will discuss the short- and mid-term goals of the

known to date and is located at a distance of 2.31$\pm 0.08$ pc, giving it the
fourth largest parallax of any known star or brown dwarf system. We report deep
$z$-band observations of WISE 0855-07 using FORS2 on UT1/VLT. We do not detect
any counterpart to WISE 0855-07 in our $z$-band images and estimate a
brightness upper limit of AB mag $>$ 24.8 ($F_{\nu}$ $<$ 0.45 $\mu$Jy) at 910
$\pm$ 65 nm with $3\sigma$-confidence. We combine our z-band upper limit with
previous near- and mid-infrared photometry to place constraints on the
atmospheric properties of WISE 0855-07 via comparison to models which implement
water clouds in the atmospheres of $T_{eff} < 300$ K substellar objects. We
find that none of the available models that implement water clouds can
completely reproduce the observed SED of WISE 0855-07. Every model
significantly disagrees with the (3.6 $\mu$m / 4.5 $\mu$m) flux ratio and at
least one other bandpass. Since methane is predicted to be the dominant
absorber at 3-4 $\mu$m, these mismatches might point to an incorrect or
incomplete treatment of methane in current models. We conclude that \mbox{(a)
WISE0855-07} has $T_{eff} \sim 200-250$~K, (b) $< 80 \%$ of its surface is
covered by clouds, and (c) deeper observations, and improved models of
substellar evolution, atmospheres, clouds, and opacities will be necessary to
better characterize this object.

present, a widely used modeling assumption is the perfect synchronization
between the transmitter and the receiver. Unfortunately, this assumption is
unlikely to hold in most practical molecular systems. To remedy this, we
introduce a clock into the model---leading to the molecular timing channel with

upper and lower bounds on the variance-constrained capacity, which we view as
the step between the mean-delay and the peak-delay constrained capacity. By
numerically evaluating our bounds, we obtain a key practical insight: the drift
velocity of the clock links does not need to be significantly larger than the
drift velocity of the information link, in order to achieve the
variance-constrained capacity with perfect synchronization.

As such, accurate and reproducible measurement techniques are necessary for

communication in regulated biological systems. In general, communication in
regulated biological systems is difficult because the act of encoding
information about the state of the system can corrupt the message itself. In
this paper, we propose three strategies to cope with this problem to facilitate
reliable molecular communication links: communicate from the outskirts; build
it in; and leave a small footprint. Our strategies---inspired by communication
in natural biological systems---provide a classification to guide the design of
molecular communication mechanisms in synthetic biological systems. We
illustrate our classification using examples of the first two strategies in
natural systems. We then consider a molecular link within a model based on the
Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In particular, we compute the capacity of the link,
which reveals the potential of communicating using our leave a small footprint
strategy. This provides a way of identifying whether the molecular link can be
improved without affecting the function, and a guide to the design of synthetic
biological systems.

point of the Bloch sphere, there exists corresponding projective measurement.
By performing these measurements, we can scan the whole Bloch sphere like radar
to search for the orientation of and determine the eigenstates. We show the
convergency of the measurements. This result actually reveals a mathematical
structure of the n-fold Hilbert space .

wave is more affected by ion viscosity than by ion-electron friction only for
wavelengths shorter that 1-30 km, dependent on parameters and assuming the
perturbed magnetic field of one percent of its equilibrium value. For the

dependent on altitude and on wavelengths. In corona the viscosity is the main

show that there is a single relation between radius and irradiated energy per
gram per second ($l_-$), for all mass intervals. There is an extra increase in
radius of planets if $l_-$ is higher than 1100 times energy received by the
Earth ($l_\oplus$). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules. The tidal
interaction as a heating mechanism is also considered and found that its
maximum effect on the inflation of planets is about 15 per cent. We also
compute age and heavy element abundances from the properties of host stars,
given in the TEPCat catalogue (Southworth 2011). The metallicity given in the
literature is as [Fe/H]. However, the most abundant element is oxygen, and
there is a reverse relation between the observed abundances [Fe/H] and [O/Fe].
Therefore, we first compute [O/H] from [Fe/H] by using observed abundances, and
then find heavy element abundance from [O/H]. We also develop a new method for
age determination. Using the ages we find, we analyse variation of both radius
and mass of the planets with respect to time, and estimate the initial mass of
the planets from the relation we derive for the first time. According to our
results, the highly irradiated gas giants lose 5 per cent of their mass in

finite-size scaling analysis suggests that this divergence is accompanied by a
growing correlation length scale, which also diverges algebraically. We then
study the effect of soft repulsion, and propose a natural extension of the
standard granular rheology to account for softness effects, which we validate
from simulations. Close to the jamming transition, this `soft granular
rheology' offers a detailed description of the non-linear rheology of soft

hard to train using conventional error backpropagation methods because of the
difficulty in relating inputs over many time-steps. Regularization approaches
from MLP sphere, like dropout and noisy weight training, have been

greater than that in traditional wireless sensor networks. Thus, it is a huge

a new heterogeneous energy supply model for WMSN through the coexistence of

for the multiple multicast with distributed source coding and intra-session
network coding in heterogeneous powered wireless multimedia sensor networks
(HPWMSN) with correlated sources. The aim is to achieve the optimal reconstruct
distortion at sinks and the minimal cost of purchasing electricity from
electricity grid. Based on the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with perturbation
technique and dual decomposition technique, we propose a fully distributed
dynamic cross-layer algorithm, including multicast routing, source rate
control, network coding, session scheduling and energy management, only
requiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state. The explicit trade-off
between the optimization objective and queue backlog is theoretically proven.
Finally, the simulation results verify the theoretic claims.

upon individual neutrinos, and the correlation between pairs of neutrinos,

the effect of non-Kolmogorov turbulence power spectra upon neutrinos from a
point source as a function of neutrino energy and turbulence amplitude at a
fixed post-bounce epoch. We find the two effects of turbulence upon the
neutrinos - the distorted phase effect and the stimulated transitions - both
possess strong and weak limits in which dependence upon the power spectrum is
absent or evident respectively. Since neutrinos of a given energy will exhibit
these two effects at different epochs of the supernova each with evolving
strength, we find there is sensitivity to the power spectrum present in the
neutrino burst signal from a Galactic supernova.

  We show that one can do derived algebraic geometry a la To\""en--Vezzosi in an
abstract category of spectra. We also answer in the affirmative a question of
Goerss and Hopkins by showing that the obstruction theory for operadic algebras
in spectra can be done in the generality of spectra in an (essentially)
arbitrary model category. We construct strictly commutative simplicial ring
spectra representing a given cohomology theory and illustrate this with a
strictly commutative motivic ring spectrum representing higher order products
on Deligne cohomology.
  These results are obtained by first establishing Smith's stable positive
model structure for abstract spectra and then showing that this category of
spectra possesses excellent model-theoretic properties: we show that all
colored symmetric operads in symmetric spectra valued in a symmetric monoidal
model category are admissible, i.e., algebras over such operads carry a model
structure. This generalizes the known model structures on commutative ring
spectra and E-infinity ring spectra in simplicial sets or motivic spaces. We
also show that any weak equivalence of operads in spectra gives rise to a
Quillen equivalence of their categories of algebras. For example, this extends
the familiar strictification of E-infinity rings to commutative rings in a
broad class of spectra, including motivic spectra. We finally show that
operadic algebras in Quillen equivalent categories of spectra are again Quillen
equivalent.

photo-emission spectral measurements on semiconductors (GaAs, InP), we
theoretically study real time relaxation dynamics of macroscopically
photo-excited electrons, toward the Fermi degeneracy formation in an originally
vacant conduction band of these semiconductors. Very soon after the
photo-excitation, the whole electrons are shown to exhibit a quite rapid
relaxation, like an avalanching phenomenon, mainly due to successive
multi-(optical and acoustic) phonon emission from them. Repeating this
multi-phonon process, the whole energy distribution of the electrons is shown
to become a multi-peaked structure largely elongated over the lower part of the
wide conduction band. However, after around 1 ps from the excitation, this
relaxation critically slows down, since the emission of a long-wave acoustic
phonon from electrons around the Fermi level becomes prohibitively difficult.
By using the electron temperature approximation, we show that this slow
relaxation is inversely proportional to time. Thus, the formation of the
complete Fermi degeneracy takes an infinite time. These theoretical results are
quite consistent to the aforementioned recent experiment.

Cloud (LMC) and their influence on the environment at far-infrared (FIR) and
submillimeter wavelengths. We use new observations obtained with the {\it
Herschel} Space Observatory and archival data obtained with the {\it Spitzer}
Space Telescope, to make the first FIR atlas of these objects. The SNRs are not
clearly discernible at FIR wavelengths, however their influence becomes
apparent in maps of dust mass and dust temperature, which we constructed by
fitting a modified black-body to the observed spectral energy distribution in
each sightline. Most of the dust that is seen is pre-existing interstellar dust
in which SNRs leave imprints. The temperature maps clearly reveal SNRs heating
surrounding dust, while the mass maps indicate the removal of
3.7$^{+7.5}_{-2.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust per SNR. This agrees with the
calculations by others that significant amounts of dust are sputtered by SNRs.
Under the assumption that dust is sputtered and not merely pushed away, we
estimate a dust destruction rate in the LMC of $0.037^{+0.075}_{-0.025}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ due to SNRs, yielding an average lifetime for interstellar
dust of $2^{+4.0}_{-1.3}\times10^7$ yr. We conclude that sputtering of dust by
SNRs may be an important ingredient in models of galactic evolution, that
supernovae may destroy more dust than they produce, and that they therefore may
not be net producers of long lived dust in galaxies.

various MTJ STOs to estimate the performance of MTJ STOs together with their

introduced and verified by comparing it against measured data of three
different MTJ STOs, varying the angle and magnitude of the magnetic field, as
well as the DC biasing current. The proposed analytical model is suitable for
being implemented in Verilog-A and used for efficient simulations at device-,

circumstellar dust and to propose the first statistical study of exozodiacal
disks in the near-infrared using telescopes in both hemispheres. For this
purpose, Ertel et al. have conducted in 2012 a survey of nearby main sequence
stars with VLTI/PIONIER to search for the presence of circumstellar dust. This
survey, carried out during 12 nights, comprises about 100 stars. For each star,
we obtained typically three OBs and we searched for circumstellar emission
based on the measurement of squared visibilities at short baselines. A drop in
the measured visibilities with respect to the expected photospheric visibility
indicates the presence of resolved emission around the target star. It is
however generally not possible to conclude on the morphology of the detected
emission based solely on the squared visibilities. Here, we focus on closure
phases to search for faint companions around the whole sample. Indeed, to
derive robust statistics on the occurrence rate of bright exozodiacal disks, we
need to discriminate between companions and disks. For this reason, the main
goal of this paper is to discriminate between circumstellar disks (which show
no closure phase provided that they are point-symmetric) and faint companions
(point-like sources, creating non-zero closure phases). We also aim to reveal
new companions that do not necessarily produce a significant signature in the
squared visibilities, as the signature of the companion may show up more
prominently in the closure phases. In this process, we reveal four new stellar
companions with contrasts ranging from 2% to 95% (i.e., up to equal flux
binaries). We also tentatively detect faint companions around one other target
that will require follow-up observations to be confirmed or infirmed. We
discuss the implications of these discoveries on the results of the exozodi
survey.

photosphere. Despite a plethora of researches discussing the morphologies of
EBs, there has been a limited investigation of how these events appear at the
limb, specifically, whether they manifest as vertical extensions away from the
disc. In this article, we make use of high-resolution, high-cadence
observations of an AR at the solar limb, collected by the CRISP instrument, to
identify EBs and infer their physical properties. The upper atmosphere is also
probed using the SDO/AIA. We analyse 22 EB events evident within these data,
finding that 20 appear to follow a parabolic path away from the solar surface
at an average speed of 9 km s^(-1), extending away from their source by 580 km,
before retreating back at a similar speed. These results show strong evidence
of vertical motions associated with EBs, possibly explaining the dynamical
`flaring' (changing in area and intensity) observed in on-disc events. Two
in-depth case studies are also presented which highlight the unique dynamical
nature of EBs within the lower solar atmosphere. The viewing angle of these
observations allows for a direct linkage between these EBs and other
small-scale events in the H-alpha line wings, including a potential flux
emergence scenario. The findings presented here suggest that EBs could have a
wider-reaching influence on the solar atmosphere than previously thought, as we
reveal a direct linkage between EBs and an emerging small-scale loop, and other
near-by small-scale explosive events. However, as previous research found,
these extensions do not appear to impact upon the H-alpha line core, and are
not observed by the SDO/AIA EUV filters.

source, and retransmits it upstream towards a destination. Achievable ergodic
rates under both jointly optimal detection and decoding and practical separate
decoding schemes for arbitrary signaling schemes, along with the average bit
error rate for various receiver structures are derived in the regime where the
number of antennas at each terminal grows large without a bound. To overcome
the difficulty of averaging over channel realizations we apply large-system
analysis based on the replica method from statistical physics. The validity of
the large-system analysis is further verified through Monte Carlo simulations
of realistic finite-sized systems.

the gas around z ~ 2 - 3 galaxies. The internal dispersion velocities of the
gas in the haloes have converged for a box size of 30 comoving Mpc, but the
centre-of-mass peculiar velocities of the haloes have not up to a box size of
60 comoving Mpc. The density and temperature of the gas within the
instantaneous turn-around radii of the haloes are adequately captured for box
sizes 30 Mpc on a side, but the results are highly sensitive to the treatment
of unresolved, rapidly cooling gas, with the gas mass fraction within the
virial radius severely depleted by star formation in the GADGET-3 simulations.
Convergence of the gas peculiar velocity field on large scales requires a box

the gas agrees to 30 percent or better both with box size and between

brain connectivity measures derived from electro-encephalogram (EEG) of

from 128-channel EEG signals are obtained for typical children and children
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The phase synchronized states or
synchrostates temporally switch amongst themselves as an underlying process for
the completion of a particular cognitive task. We used 12 subjects in each
group (ASD and typical) for analyzing their EEG while processing fearful, happy
and neutral faces. The minimal and maximally occurring synchrostates for each
subject are chosen for extraction of brain connectivity features, which are
used for classification between these two groups of subjects. Among different
supervised learning techniques, we here explored the discriminant analysis and
support vector machine both with polynomial kernels for the classification
task. Main results. The leave one out cross-validation of the classification
algorithm gives 94.7% accuracy as the best performance with corresponding

Significance. The proposed method gives high classification accuracies and
outperforms other contemporary research results. The effectiveness of the

concentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers

ultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM).
Calculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for

from observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita
rate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections
occurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best
reduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This network analysis can

the theta constants with rational characteristics. For this purpose, we use the
arithmetic formulas of the number of representations of a natural number
$n,\,\,(n=1,2,\ldots)$ as the sum of two squares, or the sum of a square and
twice a square.

symmetry in flat Minkowski spacetime is discussed. The Stueckelberg trick of
introducing an auxiliary field along with a local symmetry in the initial
Lagrangian is used to convert the second-class constraints present in the
initial Lagrangian to first-class ones. An additional deformation is employed
in the resulting Lagrangian to handle properly the first-class constraints, and
the equivalence with the initial model is demonstrated using the BRST
invariance of the deformed Lagrangian. The framework for performing
perturbation theory is constructed and the structure of the Fock space is
discussed. Despite the presence of ghost and tachyon modes in the spectrum of
the theory, it is shown that one can implement consistent conditions to define
a unitary and stable reduced Fock space. Within the restricted Fock space, the
free model turns out to be equivalent to the Maxwell electrodynamics in the
temporal gauge.

  global warming? A new effect may exist","5pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whether natural factors could interpret the rise of the Earth's surface
temperature is still controversial. Though numerous recent researches have
reported apparent correlations between solar activity and the Earth's climate,
solar activity has encountered a big problem when describing the rapid global
warming after 1970s. Our investigation shows the good positive correlations
between the Earth's surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and the Earth's
surface temperature both in temporal and spatial variations by analyzing the
global surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and global surface
temperature data from 1980-1999. The rise of CO$_2$ cannot interpret the good
positive correlations, and we could even get an opposite result to the good
correlations when employing the rise of CO$_2$ to describe the relation between
them. Based on the good positive correlations, we suggest a new effect, named
""Highly Excited Water Vapor"" (HEWV) effect, which can interpret how the Sun
influences the Earth's surface temperature reasonably, including the rapid
warming after 1970s.

  Gravity","10 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a nonlocal generalization of field quantization is suggested.
This quantization principle presupposes the assumption that the commutator
between a field operator an the operator of the canonical conjugated variable
referring to other space-time points does not vanish as it is postulated in the
usual setting of quantum field theory. Based on this presupposition the
corresponding expressions for the field operators, the eigenstates and the path
integral formula are determined. The nonlocal quantization principle also leads
to a generalized propagator. If the dependence of the commutator between
operators on different space-time points on the distance of these points is
assumed to be described by a Gaussian function, one obtains that the propagator
is damped by an exponential. This leads to a disappearance of UV divergences.
The transfer of the nonlocal quantization principle to canonical quantum
gravity is considered as well. In this case the commutator has to be assumed to
depend also on the gravitational field, since the distance between two points
depends on the metric field.
