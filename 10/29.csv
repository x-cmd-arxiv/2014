self-gravitating system and the indistinguishability of its constituents (stars
or dark matter particles). This represents a refinement in the study of systems
exhibiting incomplete violent relaxation. Within a combinatorial analysis
similar to that of Lynden-Bell, we make use of this association to obtain a
distribution function that deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
increasing its slope for high energies. Considering the smallness of the
occupation numbers for large distances from the center of the system, we apply
a correction to Stirling's approximation which increases the distribution slope
also for low energies. The distribution function thus obtained presents some
resemblance to the ""S"" shape of distributions associated with cuspy density
profiles (as compared to the distribution function obtained from the Einasto
profile), although it is not quite able to produce sharp cusps. We also argue
how the association between mixing level and indistinguishability can provide a
physical meaning to the assumption of particle-permutation symmetry in the
N-particle distribution function, when it is used to derive the one-particle
Vlasov equation, which raises doubts about the validity of this equation during
violent relaxation.

Spectra and optical/IR photometry are consistent with the eclipsed star being a
lightly reddened B9III star of inferred age ~150 Myr and mass of ~4 solar

temperatures of ~1100-1400 K. We model the eclipses as being due to either a
transiting geometrically thin dust disk or gaseous accretion disk around a

again the strong influence of the $S_{11}(1535)$ isobar, which is in contrast
to the relatively weak behaviour seen near threshold for $\eta^{\prime}$

regarding the production mechanism and the interaction of the $\eta$ and

digital chaotic map as a black box with different explanations according to the
test results of the output, the dynamical properties of such chaotic maps are
first explored with a fixed-point arithmetic, using the Logistic map and the
Tent map as two representative examples, from a new perspective with the
corresponding state-mapping networks (SMNs). In an SMN, every possible value in
the digital domain is considered as a node and the mapping relationship between
any pair of nodes is a directed edge. The scale-free properties of the Logistic

in the non-relativistic limit through a mechanism of gravitational polarization

appeal to the role of present day conditions in promoting rheological weakening
of the lithosphere. However, it is unknown whether the conditions of the early
Earth were favorable for plate tectonics, or any form of subduction, and thus
how subduction begins is unclear. Using physical models based on grain-damage,
a grainsize-feedback mechanism capable of producing plate-like mantle
convection, we demonstrate that subduction was possible on the Hadean Earth
(hereafter referred to as proto-subduction or proto-plate tectonics), that
proto-subduction differed from modern day plate tectonics, and that it could
initiate rapidly. Scaling laws for convection with grain-damage show that,
though either higher mantle temperatures or higher surface temperatures lead to
slower plates, proto-subduction, with plate speeds of $\approx 1.75$ cm/yr, can
still be maintained in the Hadean, even with a CO$_2$ rich primordial
atmosphere. Furthermore, when the mantle potential temperature is high (e.g.
above $\approx 2000$ K), the mode of subduction switches to a ""sluggish
subduction"" style, where downwellings are drip-like and plate boundaries are
diffuse. Finally, numerical models of post-magma ocean mantle convection
demonstrate that proto-plate tectonics likely initiates within $\sim100$ Myrs
of magma ocean solidification, consistent with evidence from Hadean zircons.
After the initiation of proto-subduction, non-plate-tectonic ""sluggish
subduction"" prevails, giving way to modern style plate tectonics as both the
mantle interior and climate cool. Hadean proto-subduction may hasten the onset
of modern plate tectonics by drawing excess CO$_2$ out of the atmosphere and
cooling the climate.

mechanism for these observations based on the interplay between inertial forces
in the fluid and the geometrical asymmetry of the particle shape. We consider
an axisymmetric rigid near-sphere oscillating in a quiescent fluid along a
direction perpendicular to its symmetry axis. The kinematics of oscillations
can be either prescribed or can result dynamically from the presence of an
external oscillating velocity field. Steady streaming in the fluid, the
inertial rectification of the time-periodic oscillating flow, generates steady
stresses on the particle which, in general, do not average to zero, resulting
in a finite propulsion speed along the axis of the symmetry of the particle and
perpendicular to the oscillation direction. Our derivation of the propulsion
speed is obtained at leading order in the Reynolds number and the deviation of
the shape from that of a sphere. The results of our model are consistent with
the experimental measurements, and more generally explains how time periodic
forcing from an acoustic field can be harnessed to generate autonomous motion.

galaxies, 35 of which are spirals, from the Palomar nearby galaxy survey. It is
known that for ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and merger remnants
thesigma derived from the near-infrared CO band-heads is smaller than that
measured from optical lines, while no discrepancy between these measurements is
found for early-type galaxies. No such studies are available for spiral
galaxies - the subject of this paper. We used cross-dispersed spectroscopic
data obtained with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS), with spectral
coverage from 0.85 to 2.5um, to obtain sigma measurements from the 2.29 $\mu$m
CO band-heads (sigma_{CO}), and the 0.85 um calcium triplet (sigma_{CaT}). For
the spiral galaxies in the sample, we found that sigma_{CO} is smaller than
sigma_{CaT}, with a mean fractional difference of 14.3%. The best fit to the
data is given by sigma_{opt} = (46.0+/-18.1) + (0.85+/-0.12)sigma_{CO}. This
""sigma discrepancy"" may be related to the presence of warm dust, as suggested
by a slight correlation between the discrepancy and the infrared luminosity.
This is consistent with studies that have found no sigma-discrepancy in
dust-poor early-type galaxies, and a much larger discrepancy in dusty merger
remnants and ULIRGs. That sigma_{CO}$ is lower than sigma_{opt} may also
indicate the presence of a dynamically cold stellar population component. This
would agree with the spatial correspondence between low sigma_{CO} and
young/intermediate-age stellar populations that has been observed in
spatially-resolved spectroscopy of a handful of galaxies.

programming languages, such as alias analysis, constant propagation, etc.
Recursive state machines (RSMs) are standard models for interprocedural
analysis. We consider a general framework with RSMs where the transitions are
labeled from a semiring, and path properties are algebraic with semiring
operations. RSMs with algebraic path properties can model interprocedural
dataflow analysis problems, the shortest path problem, the most probable path
problem, etc. The traditional algorithms for interprocedural analysis focus on
path properties where the starting point is \emph{fixed} as the entry point of
a specific method. In this work, we consider possible multiple queries as
required in many applications such as in alias analysis. The study of multiple
queries allows us to bring in a very important algorithmic distinction between
the resource usage of the \emph{one-time} preprocessing vs for \emph{each
individual} query. The second aspect that we consider is that the control flow
graphs for most programs have constant treewidth.
  Our main contributions are simple and implementable algorithms that support
multiple queries for algebraic path properties for RSMs that have constant
treewidth. Our theoretical results show that our algorithms have small
additional one-time preprocessing, but can answer subsequent queries
significantly faster as compared to the current best-known solutions for
several important problems, such as interprocedural reachability and shortest
path. We provide a prototype implementation for interprocedural reachability
and intraprocedural shortest path that gives a significant speed-up on several
benchmarks.

Then I present the results of various recent studies on the impact on PDFs, in

below a cross-over temperature $T^\star \approx 41$K, which separates two
regimes of vortices: anisotropic Abrikosov-like at high and Josephson-like at
low temperatures. Yet in the transition region around $T^\star$, hybrid
vortices between these two characteristics appear. Only in this region around
$T^\star$ and for magnetic fields well aligned with the FeAs layers, we observe
oscillations of the c-axis critical current $j_c(H)$ periodic in
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{H}}$ due to a delicate balance of intervortex forces and
interaction with the layered potential. $j_c(H)$ shows pronounced maxima when a
hexagonal vortex lattice is commensurate with the crystal structure. The narrow
temperature window in which oscillations are observed suggests a significant
suppression of the order parameter between the superconducting layers in

production costs have to be as low as possible. Many different technologies
have been proposed to achieve the best efficiency to cost ratio. One of those
is concentrating photovoltaics (CPV) which takes advantage of the high
efficiency of multi-junction cells while limiting the costs by reducing the
size of the cell and concentrating the direct irradiance with a cheaper optical
element. Next to the widely used Fresnel lenses concave mirrors could be of
interest as concentrator optic. As for the whole module those optics have to
minimize losses and production costs at once. Measuring scattering and slope
errors of the mirrors is of great importance to achieve an optimal design and
production process. Therefore an optical test site doing so by observing the 2D
irradiance distribution in the focal point has been built at the Fraunhofer
ISE. The aim of this thesis is to characterize this test site. Therefore the
behavior of the different components (camera, objective, mirrors, glass plate,
light source and diffuser film) as well as of the whole test site have been
measured and modeled. While most parts of the test site could be modeled in a
satisfactory way, the diffuser film still isn't fully understood. Therefore an

enhancements have been reported in other pnictides LaFe$_2$P$_2$, LaFePO ($T_c

not. This is contrary to the common perceptions that the normal state
quasi-particle renormalizations reflect the strength of the superconducting
paring mechanism and leads to new questions about pairing in isostructural and
isoelectronic Ru- and Fe-pnictide superconductors.

Accounting for the amount of location information they are given by users,
these services are able to track users wherever they go and to learn sensitive
information about them (e.g. their points of interest including home, work,
religious or political places regularly visited). A number of solutions have
been proposed in the past few years to protect users location information while
still allowing them to enjoy geo-located services. Among the most robust
solutions are those that apply the popular notion of differential privacy to
location privacy (e.g. Geo-Indistinguishability), promising strong theoretical
privacy guarantees with a bounded accuracy loss. While these theoretical
guarantees are attracting, it might be difficult for end users or practitioners
to assess their effectiveness in the wild. In this paper, we carry on a
practical study using real mobility traces coming from two different datasets,
to assess the ability of Geo-Indistinguishability to protect users' points of
interest (POIs). We show that a curious LBS collecting obfuscated location
information sent by mobile users is still able to infer most of the users POIs
with a reasonable both geographic and semantic precision. This precision
depends on the degree of obfuscation applied by Geo-Indistinguishability.
Nevertheless, the latter also has an impact on the overhead incurred on mobile
devices resulting in a privacy versus overhead trade-off. Finally, we show in
our study that POIs constitute a quasi-identifier for mobile users and that
obfuscating them using Geo-Indistinguishability is not sufficient as an

many separate applications rather than a single Web browser application. These
applications often deal with sensitive user information such as financial data

unauthorized eavesdropping. However, recent studies have confirmed a
wide-spread misconfiguration of SSL verification in applications. This paper
considers the difficulty faced by Android application developers when modifying
SSL code for using common features like pinning or using a self-signed SSL
certificate. For example, developing an application that accesses a test Web
server with a self-signed certificate requires additional code to remove SSL
verification; however, this code is not always removed in production versions
of the application. To mitigate vulnerabilities introduced because of the
complexity of customizing SSL code in Android applications, we propose that
common SSL configuration should be specified in the application's package
manifest. We provide two concrete suggestions: 1) linking the application's
debug state to SSL verification, and 2) pinning certificates and CAs in the
manifest. We evaluate the appropriateness of these two suggestions on over
13,000 applications from Google's Play Store, of which 3,302 use SSL in

leaking a user's private information because apps can access these sensors
without requiring security permissions. By monitoring a device's motion, a
malicious app may be able to infer sensitive information about the owner of the
device. For example, related work has shown that sensitive information entered

be inferred from accelerometer and gyroscope data.
  In this paper, we study these motion-based keystroke inference attacks to
determine what information they need to succeed. Based on this study, we
propose two novel approaches to defend against keystroke inference attacks: 1)
Reducing sensor data accuracy; 2) Random keyboard layout generation. We present
the design and the implementation of these two defences on the Android platform

attacks so prevalent on desktop and server systems are now a threat to

and prevent attacks on operating systems (e.g., VM introspection and trusted
virtual domains), virtualization is not practical on smartphone systems due to
the lack of virtualization support and/or the expense of virtualization.
Current smartphone processors do have hardware support for running a protected
environment, such as the ARM TrustZone extensions, but such hardware does not
control the operating system operations sufficiently to enable VM
introspection. In particular, a conventional operating system running with
TrustZone still retains full control of memory management, which a rootkit can
use to prevent traps on sensitive instructions or memory accesses necessary for
effective introspection. In this paper, we present SPROBES, a novel primitive
that enables introspection of operating systems running on ARM TrustZone
hardware. Using SPROBES, an introspection mechanism protected by TrustZone can
instrument individual operating system instructions of its choice, receiving an
unforgeable trap whenever any SPROBE is executed. The key challenge in
designing SPROBES is preventing the rootkit from removing them, but we identify
a set of five invariants whose enforcement is sufficient to restrict rootkits
to execute only approved, SPROBE-injected kernel code. We implemented a
proof-of-concept version of SPROBES for the ARM Fast Models emulator,
demonstrating that in Linux kernel 2.6.38, only 12 SPROBES are sufficient to
enforce all five of these invariants. With SPROBES we show that it is possible

focus on specific attacks or threat models, ours systematically identifies
critical places where access controls are not present or do not properly

of the ring is offset from the star by 4.76$\pm$1.6 AU and that the deprojected
eccentricity is 0.06$\pm$0.02, in general agreement with previous studies. We
find that the average width of the ring is 14$^{+3}_{-2}%$, also comparable to
previous measurements. Such a narrow ring precludes the existence of
shepherding planets more massive than \about 4 \mj, comparable to hot-start
planets we could have detected beyond \about 60 AU in projected separation.
Combining our new scattered light data with archival HST/STIS and HST/NICMOS
data at \about 0.5-2 \microns, along with previously unpublished Spitzer/MIPS
thermal emission data and all other literature thermal data, we set out to
constrain the chemical composition of the dust grains. After testing 19
individual root compositions and more than 8,400 unique mixtures of these
compositions, we find that good fits to the scattered light alone and thermal
emission alone are discrepant, suggesting that caution should be exercised if
fitting to only one or the other. When we fit to both the scattered light and
thermal emission simultaneously, we find mediocre fits (reduced chi-square
\about 2). In general, however, we find that silicates and organics are the
most favored, and that water ice is usually not favored. These results suggest
that the common constituents of both interstellar dust and solar system comets
also may reside around HR 4796A, though improved modeling is necessary to place
better constraints on the exact chemical composition of the dust.

Fine's theorem are considered. While outcome determinism for projective (sharp)
measurements in quantum theory can be shown to follow from the assumption of
preparation noncontextuality, such a justification is not available for
nonprojective (unsharp) measurements which ought to admit
outcome-indeterministic response functions. The Liang-Spekkens-Wiseman (LSW)
inequality is cited as an example of a noncontextuality inequality that should
hold in any noncontextual model of quantum theory without assuming
factorizability. Three other noncontextuality inequalities, which turn out to
be equivalent to the LSW inequality under relabellings of measurement outcomes,
are derived for Specker's scenario. The polytope of correlations admissible in
this scenario, given the no-disturbance condition, is characterized.

transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic structure. We investigated the
temperature dependence of the frequencies of transverse acoustic (TA) phonons
that extrapolate to the shear vibrational mode at the zone center, which
corresponds to the orthorhombic deformation of the crystal structure at low
temperatures in BaFe 2 As 2 and SrFe 2 As 2 . We found that acoustic phonons at
small wavevectors soften gradually towards the transition from high
temperatures, tracking the increase of the size of slowly fluctuating magnetic
domains. On cooling below the transition to base temperature the phonons
harden, following the square of the magnetic moment. Our results provide
evidence for close correlation between magnetic and phonon properties in
Fe-based superconductors.

central problem both in neuroscience and in machine learning. However, the
performance level of the models that are inspired by cortical mechanisms,
including deep networks such as convolutional neural networks and deep belief
networks, is shown to significantly decrease in the presence of noise and
background objects [19, 24]. Here we develop a computational framework that is
hierarchical, relies heavily on key properties of the visual cortex including
mid-level feature selectivity in visual area V4 and Inferotemporal cortex (IT)
[4, 9, 12, 18], high degrees of selectivity and invariance in IT [13, 17, 18]
and the prior knowledge that is built into cortical circuits (such as the
emergence of edge detector neurons in primary visual cortex before the onset of
the visual experience) [1, 21], and addresses the problem of object recognition
in the presence of background noise and distractors. Our approach is
specifically designed to address large deformations, allows flexible
communication between different layers of representation and learns highly
selective filters from a small number of training examples.

spectra of galaxy clusters, individual clusters, the Andromeda galaxy and the
galactic center, leading to speculation that it could be due to decays of
metastable dark matter such as sterile neutrinos. However searches for the line
in other systems such as dwarf satellites of the Milky Way have given negative
or ambiguous results. We reanalyze both the positive and negative searches from
the point of view that the line is due to inelastic scattering of dark matter
to an excited state that subsequently decays---the mechanism of excited dark
matter (XDM). Unlike the metastable dark matter scenario, XDM gives a stronger
signal in systems with higher velocity dispersions, such as galaxy clusters. We
show that the predictions of XDM can be consistent with null searches from
dwarf satellites, while the signal from the closest individual galaxies can be
detectable having a flux consistent with that from clusters. We discuss the
impact of our new fits to the data for two specific realizations of XDM.

emergence of a coherent picture in which the budget of hydrogen-ionizing
photons is dominated by low-mass star-forming galaxies, with little
contribution from Pop III stars and quasars. The reionization history of the
Universe therefore critically depends on the number density of low-mass
galaxies at high redshift. In this work, we explore how changes in the
statistical properties of initial density fluctuations affect the formation of
early galaxies. Following Habouzit et al. (2014), we run 5 N-body simulations
with Gaussian and (scale-dependent) non-Gaussian initial conditions, all
consistent with Planck constraints. By appealing to a galaxy formation model
and to a population synthesis code, we compute the far-UV galaxy luminosity
function down to M_UV = -14 at redshift 7 < z < 15. We find that models with
strong primordial non-Gaussianities on < Mpc scales show a far-UV luminosity
function significantly enhanced in low-mass galaxies. We adopt a reionization
model calibrated from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and show that
such non-Gaussianities leave a clear imprint on the Universe reionization
history and electron Thomson scattering optical depth tau_E. Although current
uncertainties in the physics of reionization and on the determination of tau_E
still dominate the signatures of non-Gaussianities, our results suggest that
tau_E could ultimately be used to constrain the statistical properties of
initial density fluctuations.

classic unheated and unperturbed cooling flow model predicts dramatic cooling
rates and an isobaric X-ray spectrum with constant differential luminosity
distribution. The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong
deficit of soft X-ray emission: $dL_{\rm x}/dT \propto (T/T_{\rm
hot})^{\alpha=2\pm1}$. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such
deficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability
condensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN
outflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The
resultant average distribution slope is $\alpha \simeq 2$, oscillating within
the observed $1<\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray
spectrum remains isothermal ($\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a
too shallow slope, $\alpha<1$. AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out,
releasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating
alone induces a declining spectrum, $1<\alpha<2$. Turbulence further steepens
the spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot
phase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making
perturbations to depart from the isobaric mode. Such increase in $d\ln P/d\ln
T$ leads to $\alpha\approx3$. Self-regulated AGN outflow feedback can address
the soft X-ray problem through the interplay of heating and turbulence.

Suyu","Measuring angular diameter distances of strong gravitational lenses","Accepted to JCAP",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distance-redshift relation plays a fundamental role in constraining
cosmological models. In this paper, we show that measurements of positions and
time delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as those
of the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combined
to extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. Physically, as the
velocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ($GM/r$)
and a mass ($GM$) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical
size ($r$) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of
a lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch
between the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be
corrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the
original idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular
isothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical
mass density profile, an external convergence, and an anisotropic velocity
dispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when
dividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. We derive a
formula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of the
uncertainties in the observables. As an application, we use two existing strong
lens systems, B1608+656 ($z_{\rm L}=0.6304$) and RXJ1131$-$1231 ($z_{\rm
L}=0.295$), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameter
distances is dominated by that in the velocity dispersion, $\sigma^2$, and its
anisotropy. We find that the current data on these systems should yield about
16% uncertainty in $D_A$ per object. This improves to 13% when we measure
$\sigma^2$ at the so-called sweet-spot radius. Achieving 7% is possible if we
can determine $\sigma^2$ with 5% precision.

dominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical
surveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for
several physically-motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the
fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the
majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington
luminosities (such as disk winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis
relativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly
constrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission
channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much
less pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a
volume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample
of TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects,
already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our

For galaxies in selected samples of compact groups, loose groups and field, we
compare the distributions of the following parameters: D$_n(4000)$ as an age
indicator, and the specific star formation rate as indicator of ongoing star
formation. We analyse the dependence of these parameters on galaxy type,
stellar mass and, for group galaxies, their dependence on the dynamic state of
the system. We also analyse the fraction of old, and of high star forming
galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass in the environments we probe.
Galaxies in compact groups have, on average, older stellar populations than
their loose group or field counterparts. Early-type galaxies in compact groups
formed their stars and depleted their gas content more rapidly than in the
other environments. We have found evidence of two populations of late-type
galaxies in dynamically old compact groups: one with normal specific star
formation rates and another with markedly reduced star formation. Processes
that transform galaxies from star forming to quiescent act upon galaxies faster
and more effectively in compact groups. The unique characteristics of compact
groups make them an extreme environment for galaxies, where the transition to
quiescence occurs rapidly.

are centrally dominated by Seyfert/LINER-like emission, which illustrates that
galaxy characterisations based on single fibre spectra are necessarily
incomplete. We observe extended LINER-like emission (up to $\rm 1 R_{e}$) in
three galaxies. We make use of the $\rm EW(H \alpha)$ to argue that the
observed emission is consistent with ionisation from hot evolved stars. We
derive stellar population indices and demonstrate a clear correlation between
$\rm D_n(4000)$ and $\rm EW(H \delta_A)$ and the position in the ionisation
diagnostic diagram: resolved galactic regions which are ionised by a
Seyfert/LINER-like radiation field are also devoid of recent star formation and
host older and/or more metal rich stellar populations. We also detect
extraplanar LINER-like emission in two highly inclined galaxies, and identify
it with diffuse ionised gas. We investigate spatially resolved metallicities
and find a positive correlation between metallicity and star formation rate
(SFR) surface density. We study the relation between N/O vs O/H on resolved
scales. We find that, at given N/O, regions within individual galaxies are
spread towards lower metallicities, deviating from the sequence defined by
galactic central regions as traced by Sloan $3''$ fibre spectra. We suggest

altered by disorder potentials. Theory has predicted the existence of disorder
induced phenomena such as Anderson localization and the emergence of novel
glass and insulating phases as the Bose glass. More recently, it has been shown
that disorder breaking the 2D continuous symmetry, such as a one dimensional
(1D) modulation, can enhance long range correlations. Experimentally,
developments in quantum gases have allowed the observation of a wealth of
phenomena induced by the competition between interaction and disorder. However,
there are no experiments exploring the effect of symmetry-breaking disorder.
Here, we create a 2D vortex lattice at 0.1 K in a superconducting thin film
with a well-defined 1D thickness modulation and track the field induced
modification using scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the 1D
modulation becomes incommensurate to the vortex lattice and drives an
order-disorder transition, behaving as a scale-invariant disorder potential. We
show that the transition occurs in two steps and is mediated by the
proliferation of topological defects. We find that critical exponents
determining the loss of positional and orientational order are far above
theoretical expectations for scale-invariant disorder and follow instead the
critical behaviour which describes dislocation unbinding melting. Our data show
for the first time that randomness disorders a 2D crystal, and evidence

reddened by dust either in their host galaxies or in intervening absorber
galaxies are to a large degree missed by optical color selection criteria like
the one used by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To overcome this bias
against red QSOs, we employ a combined optical and near-infrared color
selection. In this paper, we present a spectroscopic follow-up campaign of a
sample of red candidate QSOs which were selected from the SDSS and the UKIRT
Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). The spectroscopic data and SDSS/UKIDSS
photometry are supplemented by mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer. In our sample of 159 candidates, 154 (97%) are
confirmed to be QSOs. We use a statistical algorithm to identify sightlines
with plausible intervening absorption systems and identify nine such cases
assuming dust in the absorber similar to Large Magellanic Cloud sightlines. We
find absorption systems toward 30 QSOs, 2 of which are consistent with the
best-fit absorber redshift from the statistical modeling. Furthermore, we
observe a broad range in SED properties of the QSOs as probed by the rest-frame
2 {\mu}m flux. We find QSOs with a strong excess as well as QSOs with a large
deficit at rest-frame 2 {\mu}m relative to a QSO template. Potential solutions
to these discrepancies are discussed. Overall, our study demonstrates the high
efficiency of the optical/near-infrared selection of red QSOs.

orbit near a ring of planetesimals that are experiencing destructive
collisions. Previous simulations of a planet opening a gap in a collisionless
debris disk have found that the width of the gap scales as the planet mass to
the 2/7th power ($\alpha$=2/7). We find that the gap sizes in a collisional
disk still obey a power law scaling with planet mass, but that the index alpha
of the power law depends on the age of the system t relative to the collisional
timescale $t_{coll}$ of the disk by $\alpha = 0.32(t/t_{coll})^{-0.04}$, with
inferred planet masses up to five times smaller than those predicted by the
classical gap law. The increased gap sizes likely stem from the interaction
between the collisions and the mean motion resonances near the chaotic zone. We
investigate the effects of the initial eccentricity distribution of the disk
particles and find a negligible effect on the gap size at Jovian planet masses,
since collisions tend to erase memory of the initial particle eccentricity
distributions. Finally, we find that the presence of Trojan analogs is a
potentially powerful diagnostic of planets in the mass range ~1-10 $M_{jup}$.
We apply our model to place new upper limits on planets around Fomalhaut, HR
4796 A, HD 202628, HD 181327, and $\beta$ Pictoris.

spectral transmission, reflection and absorption filters based on localized or

nanostructured materials. Realization of visible-frequency, high-performance,
large-area, optical filters based on nanoplasmonic materials is rather
challenging due to nanofabrication related problems (cost, fabrication
imperfection, surface roughness) and optical losses of metals. Here, we propose
and demonstrate large-area perfect absorbers and transmission filters that
overcome difficulties associated with the nanofabrication using a
lithography-free approach. We also utilize and benefit from the optical losses
in metals in our optical filter designs. Our resonant optical filter design is
based on a modified, asymmetric metal-insulator-metal (MIM) based Fabry-Perot
cavity with plasmonic, lossy ultra-thin (~30 nm) metallic films used as the top
metallic layer. We demonstrated a narrow bandwidth (~17 nm) super absorber with
97% maximum absorption with a performance comparable to
nanostructure/nanoparticle-based super absorbers. We also investigated
transmission (color) filters using ultra-thin metallic films, in which
different colors can be obtained by controlling the dielectric spacer
thickness. With performance parameters of transmission peak intensity reaching
60% and a narrow-band of ~ 40 nm, our color filters exceed the performance of
widely studied plasmonic nanohole array based color filters. Proposed
asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavities using ultra-thin metallic films could find
applications in spectrally selective optical (color and absorber) filters,
optoelectronic devices with controlled bandwidth such as narrow-band

Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$, using a paramagnetic electron model and
$^{7}$Li-NMR spectroscopy measurements with an externally applied magnetic
field $B_{0}$ = 9 T. We find that the magnetic dipole field component
($B_{||}^{\text{dip}}$) parallel to $B_{0}$ at the Li site from the Mo
electrons has no lattice axial symmetry; it is small around the middle between
the lattice $c$ and $a$ axes in the $ac$-plane with the minimum at the field
orientation angle $\theta$ = +52.5$^{\circ}$, while the $B_{||}^{\text{dip}}$
maximum is at $\theta$ = +142.5$^{\circ}$ when $B_{0}$ is applied perpendicular
to $b$ ($B_{0}$ $\perp$ $b$), where $\theta$ = 0$^{\circ}$ represents the
direction of $B_{0}$ $\parallel$ $c$. Further estimate indicates that
$B_{||}^{\text{dip}}$ has a maximum value of 0.35 G at $B_{0}$ = 9 T, and the
Mo ions have a possible effective magnetic dipole moment 0.015 $\mu_{\text{B}}$
per ion, which is significantly smaller than that of a spin 1/2 free electron.
By minimizing potential magnetic contributions to the NMR spectrum satellites
with the NMR spectroscopy measurements at the direction where the value of the
magnetic dipole field is the smallest, the behavior of the independent charge
contributions is observed. This work demonstrates that the magnetic dipole
field from the Mo electrons is the dominant source of the local magnetic fields
at the Li site, and it suggests that the mysterious ""metal-insulator"" crossover
at low temperatures is not a charge effect. The work also reveals valuable
local field information for further NMR investigation which is suggested
recently [Phys. Rev. B $\bf{85}$, 235128 (2012)] to be key important to the
understanding of many mysterious properties of this Q1D material of particular

QSO PG 1407+265 (z_em = 0.94). Besides Ne VIII, absorption from HI Lyman series
lines (HI 1025 - 915), several other low (C II, N II, O II, and S II),
intermediate (C III, N III, N IV, O III, S IV, and S V) and high (S VI, O VI,
and Ne VIII) ionization metal lines are detected. Disparity in the absorption
line kinematics between different ions implies that the absorbing gas comprises
of multiple ionization phases. The low and the intermediate ions (except S V)
trace a compact (~ 410 pc), metal-rich (Z ~ Z_sun) and over-dense (log n_H ~
-2.6) photoionized region that sustained star-formation for a prolonged period.
The high ions, Ne VIII and O VI, can be explained as arising in a low density
(-5.3 < log n_H < -5.0), metal-rich (Z > Z_sun) and diffuse (~ 180 kpc)
photoionized gas. The S V, S VI and C IV (detected in the FOS spectrum) require
an intermediate photoionization phase with -4.2 < log n_H < -3.5.
Alternatively, a pure collisional ionization model, as used to explain the
previous known Ne VIII absorbers, with 5.65 < log T < 5.72, can reproduce the S
VI, O VI, and Ne VIII column densities simultaneously in a single phase.
However, even such models require an intermediate phase to reproduce any
observable S V and/or C IV. Therefore, we conclude that when multiple phases
are present, the presence of Ne VIII is not necessarily an unambiguous
indication of collisionally ionized hot gas.

compactifications and torsion homology on the associated Calabi-Yau manifold.
Focusing on the simplest example of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we show that
there are two physically distinct ways that such a discrete gauge symmetry can
arise. First, compactifications of M-Theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds which
support a genus-one fibration with a bi-section are known to be dual to
six-dimensional F-theory vacua with a $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge symmetry. We show
that the resulting five-dimensional theories do not have a $\mathbb Z_2$
symmetry but that the latter emerges only in the F-theory decompactification
limit. Accordingly the genus-one fibred Calabi-Yau manifolds do not exhibit
discrete torsion. Associated to the bi-section fibration is a Jacobian
fibration which does support a section. Compactifying on these related but
distinct varieties does lead to a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry in five dimensions
and, accordingly, we find explicitly an associated discrete torsion. We
identify the expected particle and membrane system of the discrete symmetry in
terms of wrapped M2 and M5 branes and present a field-theory description of the
physics for both cases in terms of circle reductions of six-dimensional
theories. Our results and methods generalise straightforwardly to larger
discrete symmetries and to four-dimensional compactifications.

potential to determine the geometry of the magnetic field. This is a key probe
of the physical processes in the relativistic jet, such as ordered field
components, turbulence, magnetic reconnections, magnetic collimation and
acceleration of the jet flow, particle acceleration, and radiative processes
that produce extremely luminous, highly variable nonthermal emission.
Well-sampled monitoring observations of multi-waveband flux and radio-optical
polarization of blazars show a variety of behavior. In some cases, the observed
polarization patterns appear systematic, while in others randomness dominates.
Explanations involve helical magnetic fields, turbulence, and perhaps particle
acceleration that depends on the angle between the magnetic field and shock
fronts that might be present. Simulations from the author's TEMZ model, with
turbulent plasma crossing a standing conical shock in the jet, show that a
mixture of turbulent and toroidal magnetic field can produce the level of

potential to bring significant benefits to electric power networks have kindled
research efforts to design both market and regulatory frameworks to facilitate
the efficient construction and operation of such technologies. In this paper,
we examine an open access approach to the integration of storage, which enables
the complete decoupling of a storage facility's ownership structure from its
operation. In particular, we analyze a nodal spot pricing system built on a
model of economic dispatch in which storage is centrally dispatched by the
independent system operator (ISO) to maximize social welfare. Concomitant with
such an approach is the ISO's collection of a merchandising surplus reflecting
congestion in storage. We introduce a class of tradable electricity derivatives
---referred to as financial storage rights (FSRs)--- to enable the
redistribution of such rents in the form of financial property rights to
storage capacity; and establish a generalized simultaneous feasibility test to
ensure the ISO's revenue adequacy when allocating such financial property
rights to market participants. Several advantages of such an approach to open
access storage are discussed. In particular, we illustrate with a stylized
example the role of FSRs in synthesizing fully hedged, fixed-price bilateral

millimeter-size spheres floating on the surface of a turbulent flow. The flow
is generated in a layer of liquid metal by an electromagnetic forcing. By using
two magnet arrays, we are able to create one highly fluctuating flow and
another, more stationary flow. In both cases, we follow the motion of hundreds
of particles floating at the deformed interface of the liquid metal. We
evidence the clustering of floaters by a statistical study of the local
concentration of particles. Some dynamical properties of clusters are exposed.
We perform spatial correlations between particle concentration and
hydrodynamical quantities linked with inertial effects; with vortical motion,
and with horizontal divergence (corresponding to compressibility in the
surface). From comparing these correlations, we propose the so-called surface
compressibility as the main clustering mechanism in our system. Hence, although
floaters are not passive scalar and move on a deformed surface, the scenario is
similar to the one reported for passive scalar on an almost flat free surface
of a turbulent flow.

corrections to familiar blackbody expressions are linear in the temperature,

extends the Heisenberg models frequently used to analyze quantum magnetism. Due

massless scalar field theory does not admit any de Sitter-invariant Hadamard
state. Related to this is the fact that the propagator for the massive scalar
field corresponding to the de Sitter-invariant vacuum state diverges in the
massless limit, with the infrared-divergent term being a constant. Since the
Faddeev-Popov ghosts for the covariantly quantized Yang-Mills theory are
minimally coupled massless scalar fields, it might appear that de Sitter
symmetry would be broken in the ghost sector of Yang-Mills theory in de Sitter
space. It is shown in this paper that the modes responsible for de Sitter
symmetry breaking can be removed in a way consistent with BRST invariance and
that a de Sitter-invariant theory can be constructed. More generally, it is
shown that the spatially constant modes (the zero modes) of the Faddeev-Popov
ghosts can be disposed of in a wide class of spacetimes with compact spatial
sections. Then, the effective theory obtained by removing the zero modes, which
contains a non-local interaction term, is shown to be equivalent to the theory

velocity may approach the critical speed. Critically rotating stars cannot spin
up more, therefore they lose their excess angular momentum through an
equatorial outflowing disk. The radial extension of such disks is unknown,
partly because we lack information about the radial variations of the
viscosity. We study the magnetorotational instability, which is considered to
be the origin of anomalous viscosity in outflowing disks. We used analytic
calculations to study the stability of outflowing disks submerged in the
magnetic field. The magnetorotational instability develops close to the star if
the plasma parameter is large enough. At large radii the instability disappears
in the region where the disk orbital velocity is roughly equal to the sound
speed. The magnetorotational instability is a plausible source of anomalous
viscosity in outflowing disks. This is also true in the region where the disk
radial velocity approaches the sound speed. The disk sonic radius can therefore
be roughly considered as an effective outer disk radius, although disk material
may escape from the star to the insterstellar medium. The radial profile of the
angular momentum-loss rate already flattens there, consequently, the disk
mass-loss rate can be calculated with the sonic radius as the effective disk
outer radius. We discuss a possible observation determination of the outer disk
radius by using Be and Be/X-ray binaries.

explore the compactness selection hypothesis, we systematically compare the
predicted sizes of more than one hundred wild-type viral sequences with those
of their mutants, which are evolved in silico and subject to a number of known
evolutionary constraints. In particular, we enforce mutation synonynimity,
preserve the codon-bias, and leave untranslated regions intact. It is found
that progressive accumulation of these restricted mutations still suffices to
completely erase the characteristic compactness imprint of the viral RNA
genomes, making them in this respect physically indistinguishable from randomly
shuffled RNAs. This shows that maintaining the physical compactness of the
genome is indeed a primary factor among ssRNA viruses evolutionary constraints,
contributing also to the evidence that synonymous mutations in viral ssRNA
genomes are not strictly neutral.

distant galaxies; their shapes are sheared, their sizes and fluxes (magnitudes)
are magnified and their positions on the sky are modified by the lensing field.
Galaxy shapes probe the shear field whilst size, magnitude and number density
probe the convergence field. Both contain cosmological information. In this
paper we are concerned with the magnification of the size and magnitude of
individual galaxies as a probe of cosmic convergence. We develop a Bayesian
approach for inferring the convergence field from a measured size, magnitude
and redshift and demonstrate that the inference on convergence requires
detailed knowledge of the joint distribution of intrinsic sizes and magnitudes.
We build a simple parameterised model for the size-magnitude distribution and
estimate this distribution for CFHTLenS galaxies. In light of the measured
distribution, we show that the typical dispersion on convergence estimation is
~0.8, compared to ~0.38 for shear. We discuss the possibility of physical
systematics for magnification (similar to intrinsic alignments for shear) and
compute the expected gains in the Dark Energy Figure-of-Merit (FoM) from
combining magnification with shear for different scenarios regarding
systematics: when accounting for intrinsic alignments but no systematics on the
magnification signal, including magnification could improve the FoM by upto a
factor of ~2.5, whilst when accounting for physical systematics in both shear
and magnification we anticipate a gain between ~25% and ~65%. In addition to
the statistical gains, the fact that cosmic shear and magnification are subject
to different systematics makes magnification an attractive complement to any
cosmic shear analysis.

spatial templates well fitted by the square of a generalized
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with inner slope $\gamma=1.2$. The cosmic-ray
option was modeled with a 20-cm continuum emission Galactic Ridge template. A
template based on the HESS residuals were shown to give similar results. The
gamma-ray excess was found to be best fit by a combination of the generalized
NFW squared template and a Galactic Ridge template. We also found the spectra
of each template was not significantly affected in the combined fit and is
consistent with previous single template fits. Due to the ridge like morphology
of the molecular gas at the GC, the cosmic-ray option was not able to explain
all the excess gamma rays, indicating that DM annihilation and/or an unresolved

attempt to constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter solution
space, as an alternative to the cosmological use of type Ia supernovae.
  For a sample of 128 local compact HIIG with high equivalent widths of their
Balmer emission lines we obtained ionised gas velocity dispersion from high
S/N, high-dispersion spectroscopy (Subaru-HDS and ESO VLT-UVES) and integrated
H$\beta$ fluxes from low dispersion wide aperture spectrophotometry. We find
that the $L(\mathrm{H}\beta) - \sigma$ relation is strong and stable against
restrictions in the sample. The size of the starforming region is an important
second parameter, while adding the emission line equivalent width or the
continuum colour and metallicity, produces the solution with the smallest rms
scatter.
  We have used the $L(\mathrm{H}\beta) - \sigma$ relation from a local sample
of HIIG and a local calibration or `anchor', given by giant HII regions in
nearby galaxies which have accurate distance measurements determined via
primary indicators, to obtain a value of $H_0$. Using our best sample of 69
HIIG and 23 Giant HII regions in 9 galaxies we obtain $H_{0}=74.3 \pm 3.1$
(statistical)$\pm$ 2.9 (systematic) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, in excellent
agreement with, and independently confirming, the most recent SNa Ia based
results.
  Using a local sample (107 sources) and a sample of 21 high redshift HIIG, 6
of them with medium-dispersion spectroscopy (ESO VLT-XShooter) and 17 taken
from the literature, we have obtained constraints on the planes $H_0 -
\Omega_m$, $\Omega_m - w_0$ and $w_0 - w_1$ (CPL model).

population properties using the archival imaging and spectroscopic data from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find that they are likely a `smoking
gun' example of the formation of early-type dwarf galaxies (dEs) in the galaxy
group environment through the tidal stirring. Inner cores of these galaxies are
fairly intact and the observed light profiles are well fitted with the Sersic
functions, while the tidally stretched stellar halos are prominent in the outer
parts. They are all located within the 50 kpc sky-projected distance from the
center of host galaxies and no dwarf galaxies have relative line-of-sight
velocity larger than 205 km/s to their hosts. We derive the Composite Stellar
Population (CSP) properties these galaxies by fitting the SDSS optical spectra
to a multiple-burst composite stellar population model. We find that these
galaxies accumulate a significant fraction of stellar mass within the last 1
Gyr, while they contain a majority stellar population of intermediate age of 2
to 4 Gyr. With these evidences, we argue that tidal stirring, particularly
through the galaxy-galaxy interaction, might have an important role in the
formation and evolution of dEs in the group environment, where the influence of
other gas stripping mechanism might be limited.

high-redshift quasars (z > 4) cast challenging issues on the origin and
properties of dust in the early universe. In this Letter, we investigate the
evolutions of dust content and extinction curve in a high-z quasar, based on
the dust evolution model taking account of grain size distribution. First, we
show that the Milky-Way extinction curve is reproduced by introducing a
moderate fraction (~0.2) of dense molecular-cloud phases in the interstellar
medium for a graphite-silicate dust model. Then we show that the peculier
extinction curves in high-z quasars can be explained by taking a much higher
molecular-cloud fraction (>0.5), which leads to more efficient grain growth and
coagulation, and by assuming amorphous carbon instead of graphite. The large
dust content in high-z quasar hosts is also found to be a natural consequence
of the enhanced dust growth. These results indicate that grain growth and
coagulation in molecular clouds are key processes that can increase the dust
mass and change the size distribution of dust in galaxies, and that, along with
a different dust composition, can contribute to shape the extinction curve.

kinematics are very similar to that of the CO lines, which have been indicated
as the jet-entrained molecular gas in our past observations. In addition, high
HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) brightness temperature ratio of about unity is observed along
the jets, similar to that observed at the shocked molecular gas in our Galaxy.
These results strongly indicate that both diffuse and dense gases are entrained
by the jets and outflowing from the AGN. The channel map of HCN(1-0) at the
systemic velocity shows a strong emission right at the nucleus, where no
obvious emission has been detected in the CO lines. The HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0)
brightness temperature ratio at this region reaches >2, a value that cannot be

still requiring an enhanced HCN abundance for the cause of this high ratio.
This suggests the presence of a compact dense obscuring molecular gas in front

solvation effects on the excited-state twisting reaction of monomethine
cyanines. Suppression of this reaction is thought responsible for
environment-dependent fluorescence yield enhancement in these dyes.
Fluorescence is quenched because twisting is accompanied via the formation of
dark twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For monomethine
cyanines, where the ground state is a superposition of structures with
different bond and charge localization, there are two possible twisting
pathways with different charge localization in the excited state. For
parameters corresponding to symmetric monomethines, the model predicts two
low-energy twisting channels on the excited-state surface that lead to a
manifold of twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) states. For typical
monomethines, twisting on the excited state surface will occur with a small
barrier or no barrier. Changes in the solvation configuration can
differentially stabilize TICT states in channels corresponding to different
bonds, and that the position of a conical intersection between adiabatic states
moves in response to solvation to stabilize either one channel or the other.
There is a conical intersection seam that grows along the bottom of the
excited-state potential with increasing solvent polarity. For monomethine
cyanines with modest-sized terminal groups in moderately polar solution, the
bottom of the excited-state potential surface is completely spanned by a
conical intersection seam.

efficiency performances, low expenditures and intelligent centralized system
structures to operators, which has attracted intense interests in both academia
and industry. In this paper, a hybrid coordinated multi-point transmission
(H-CoMP) scheme is designed for the downlink transmission in C-RANs, which
fulfills the flexible tradeoff between cooperation gain and fronthaul
consumption. The queue-aware power and rate allocation with constraints of
average fronthaul consumption for the delay-sensitive traffic are formulated as
an infinite horizon constrained partially observed Markov decision process
(POMDP), which takes both the urgent queue state information (QSI) and the
imperfect channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) into account. To
deal with the curse of dimensionality involved with the equivalent Bellman
equation, the linear approximation of post-decision value functions is
utilized. A stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to allocate the
queue-aware power and transmission rate with H-CoMP, which is robust against
unpredicted traffic arrivals and uncertainties caused by the imperfect CSIT.
Furthermore, to substantially reduce the computing complexity, an online
learning algorithm is proposed to estimate the per-queue post-decision value
functions and update the Lagrange multipliers. The simulation results
demonstrate performance gains of the proposed stochastic gradient algorithms,
and confirm the asymptotical convergence of the proposed online learning
algorithm.

shows that edge states are almost buried in the valence band and there is no

works as acceptor, holes are doped from the edge state into the bulk. This
gives a possible explanation for p-type conduction in undoped black phosphorus.
Under the vertical electric field, the intrinsic hole doping is reduced because
a part of edge states move into the gap. These features of bilayer phosphorene

shotgun proteomics, is a widely-used high-throughput technology for identifying
proteins in complex biological samples. Analysis of the tens of thousands of
fragmentation spectra produced by a typical shotgun proteomics experiment
begins by assigning to each observed spectrum the peptide hypothesized to be
responsible for generating the spectrum, typically done by searching each
spectrum against a database of peptides. We have recently described a machine
learning method---Dynamic Bayesian Network for Rapid Identification of Peptides
(DRIP)---that not only achieves state-of-the-art spectrum identification
performance on a variety of datasets but also provides a trainable model
capable of returning valuable auxiliary information regarding specific
peptide-spectrum matches. In this work, we present two significant improvements
to DRIP. First, we describe how to use word lattices, which are widely used in
natural language processing, to significantly speed up DRIP's computations. To
our knowledge, all existing shotgun proteomics search engines compute
independent scores between a given observed spectrum and each possible
candidate peptide from the database. The key idea of the word lattice is to
represent the set of candidate peptides in a single data structure, thereby
allowing sharing of redundant computations among the different candidates. We
demonstrate that using lattices in conjunction with DRIP leads to speedups on
the order of tens across yeast and worm data sets. Second, we introduce a
variant of DRIP that uses a discriminative training framework, performing
maximum mutual entropy estimation rather than maximum likelihood estimation.
This modification improves DRIP's statistical power, enabling us to increase
the number of identified spectrum at a 1% false discovery rate on yeast and
worm data sets.

determined from the positions of the symmetric and stable profiles of the

the [NII] and [SII] forbidden emissions indicates the onset of the ionization
of the circumstellar envelope and the fact that the star is very close to
undergoing the planetary nebula stage. The broad range of heliocentric radial
velocity Vr estimates based on the core lines, which amounts to about 34 km/s,
is partly due to the deformations of the profiles caused by variable emissions.
The variations of the Vr in the line wings are smaller, about 23 km/s, and may
be due to pulsations and/or hidden binarity of the star. The deformations of
the profiles of complex absorption-emission lines may result from variations of
their absorption components caused by the variations of the geometry and
kinematics in the wind base. The H$\alpha$ lines exhibit P Cyg III type wind
profiles. Deviations of the wind from spherical symmetry are shown to be small.
The relatively low wind velocity (27$\div$74 km/s from different observations)

up to a factor of seven) are typical for hypergiants rather than the classical

three-dimensional (3D) silicon, is applied to silicene with the buckled 2D
structure. In the original WT model for four hybridized $sp^3$ orbitals on each
atom along with inter-atom hopping, the band structure can be systematically
examined in 3D, where flat (dispersionless) bands exist as well. For examining
silicene, here we re-formulate the WT model in terms of the overlapping
molecular-orbital (MO) method which enables us to describe flat bands away from
the electron-holesymmetric point. The overlapping MO formalism indeed enables
us to reveal an important difference: while in 3D the dipersive bands with
cones are sandwiched by doubly-degenerate flat bands, in 2D the dipersive bands
with cones are sandwiched by triply-degenerate and non-degenerate (nearly) flat
bands, which is consistent with the original band calculation by Takeda and
Shiraishi. Thus emerges a picture for why the whole band structure of silicene
comprises a pair of dispersive bands with Dirac cones with each of the band
touching a nearly flat (narrow) band at $\Gamma$. We can also recognize that,
for band engineering, the bonds perpendicular to the atomic plane are crucial,
and that a ferromagnetism or structural instabilities are expected if we can
shift the chemical potential close to the flat bands.

GQ Mus, RR Pic, V5558 Sgr, HR Del, and V723 Cas, based on an optically thick
wind theory of nova outbursts. For fast novae, free-free emission dominates the
spectrum in optical bands rather than photospheric emission and nova optical
light curves follow the universal decline law. Faster novae blow stronger winds
with larger mass loss rates. Since the brightness of free-free emission depends
directly on the wind mass loss rate, faster novae show brighter optical maxima.
In slower novae, however, we must take into account photospheric emission
because of their lower wind mass loss rates. We calculated three model light
curves of free-free emission, photospheric emission, and the sum of them for
various WD masses with various chemical compositions of their envelopes, and
fitted reasonably with observational data of optical, near-IR (NIR), and UV
bands. From light curve fittings of the seven novae, we estimated their
absolute magnitudes, distances, and WD masses. In PW Vul and V705 Cas,
free-free emission still dominates the spectrum in the optical and NIR bands.
In the very slow novae, RR Pic, V5558 Sgr, HR Del, and V723 Cas, photospheric
emission dominates the spectrum rather than free-free emission, which makes a
deviation from the universal decline law. We have confirmed that the absolute
brightnesses of our model light curves are consistent with the distance moduli
of four classical novae with known distances (GK Per, V603 Aql, RR Pic, and DQ

brighter than the proposed maximum magnitude vs. rate of decline relation.

presence of decoherence. It is natural that too strong coupling with the
environment can prevent an observation of quantum correlations. In this regard,
the use of various entropic functions may give additional capabilities to
reveal desired correlations. It was already shown that the Bell and
Leggett-Garg inequalities in terms conditional Tsallis entropies are more
sensitive in the cases of detection inefficiencies. In this paper, we study
capabilities of generalized conditional entropies of the Tsallis type in
analyzing the Bell theorem in decoherence scenarios. Two forms of the
conditional Tsallis $q$-entropy are known in the literature. We show that each
of them can be used for defining a metric in the probability space of interest.
Such metrics can be used in realizing the so-called triangle principle. The
triangle principle has recently been proposed as a unifying approach to
questions of local realism and non-contextuality. Applying the triangle
principle leads to the two families of $q$-metric inequalities of the Bell
type. Information-theoretic formulations in terms of the $q$-entropic metrics
are first discussed for the CHSH scenario in dephasing environment. Then we
also revisit $q$-entropic inequalities of the Leggett-Garg type. An
environmental influence is modeled by the phase damping channel and by the
depolarizing channel.

independent. However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained
by playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence,
in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to
enable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce
and formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative
through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all
the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm
with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded
parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only
finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the
optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability
one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each
other's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the
parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the
informativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk
bound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for
linearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have
applications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing.

analytical modeling of a spherical absorbing receiver under messenger molecule
degradation and show that our formulations are in agreement with the simulation
results of a similar topology. Next, we identify how such signal

degradation. Indeed, we show analytically how in MCvD, signal shaping is
achieved through degradation. We also compare communication under messenger
molecule degradation with the case of no-degradation and electromagnetic
communication in terms of channel characteristics. Lastly, we evaluate the
communication performance of the scenarios having various degradation rates.
Here, we assess the system performance according to traditional network metrics
such as the level of inter-symbol interference, detection performance, bit
error rate, and channel capacity. Our results indicate that introducing
degradation significantly improves the system performance when the rate of
degradation is appropriately selected. We make a thorough analysis of the

accuracy for high spin. The derived potential, which has an explicit velocity
dependence, contains the entire relativistic features of corresponding
spacetime including the frame dragging effect, unlike other prevailing
pseudo-Newtonian potentials (PNPs) for the Kerr metric where such an effect is
either totally missing or introduced in a ad hoc manner. The particle dynamics
with this potential precisely reproduce the GR results within a maximum ~ 10 %
deviation in energy for a particle orbiting circularly in the vicinity of a
rapidly corotating black hole. GR epicyclic frequencies are also well
reproduced with the potential, though with a relatively higher percentage of
deviation. For counterrotating cases, the obtained potential replicate the GR
results with precise accuracy. The Kerr-Newtonian potential also approximates
the radius of marginally stable and marginally bound circular orbits with
reasonable accuracy for a < 0.7. Importantly, the derived potential can imitate
the experimentally tested GR effects like perihelion advancement and bending of
light with reasonable accuracy. The formulated Kerr-Newtonian potential thus
can be useful to study complex accreting plasma dynamics and its implications

minimization (EDP) to solve the correspondence problem for stereo and motion. A
significant speedup is achieved using a recursive minimum search strategy
(RMS). The mentioned speedup is particularly important if the disparity space
is 2D as well as 3D. The proposed RMS can also be applied in the well-known
dynamic programming (DP) approach for stereo and motion. In this case, the
general 2D problem of the global discrete energy minimization is reduced to
several mutually independent sub-problems of the one-dimensional minimization.
The EDP method is used when the approximation of the general 2D discrete energy
minimization problem is considered. Then the RMS algorithm is an essential part
of the EDP method. Using the EDP algorithm we obtain a lower energy bound than
the graph cuts (GC) expansion technique on stereo and motion problems. The
proposed calculation scheme possesses natural parallelism and can be realized
on graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, and can be potentially restricted
further by the number of scanlines in the image plane. Furthermore, the RMS and
EDP methods can be used in any optimization problem where the objective
function meets specific conditions in the smoothness term.

diffuse clouds when they move from the hot ionized plasma to a cool cloud
embedded in that plasma. The spectrum of CR inside a cloud can be remarkably
different from the the one present in the hot interstellar medium because when
CRs pass through a dense cloud of matter, they suffer energy losses due to
ionization and nuclear interactions. Hence there is a net flux of CRs towards
the cloud that can excite Alfv\'en waves. In turn, self-excited Alfv\'en waves
enhances the diffusion of CRs near the edge of the cloud, forcing CRs to spend
more time in this layer and increasing the amount of energy losses. The final
effect is that the flux of CR entering into the cloud is strongly suppressed
below an energy threshold whose value depends on ambient parameters. For the
first time we use the full kinetic theory to describe this problem, coupling
CRs and Alfv\'en waves through the streaming instability, and including the
damping of the waves due to ion-neutral friction and the CR energy losses due
to ionization and pion production. Differently from previous approaches, this
method allow us to describe the full CR spectrum and the magnetic turbulence
spectrum in the transition region between hot interstellar medium and the
cloud. For the typical size and density of diffuse clouds in the Galaxy, we
find that the flux of particles entering the cloud is strongly reduced below
E~10-100 MeV, while for larger energies the CR spectrum remain unaltered.

of phenomena of collective behavior. By collectives we mean multi-agent systems
that transition from one state to another at discrete moments of time. The
behavior of a member of a collective (agent) is called conforming if the
opinion of this agent at current time moment conforms to the opinion of some
other agents at the previous time moment. We presume that at each moment of
time every agent makes a decision by choosing from the set {0,1} (where
1-decision corresponds to action and 0-decision corresponds to inaction). In
our approach we model collective behavior with synchronous Boolean networks. We
presume that in a network there can be agents that act at every moment of time.
Such agents are called instigators. Also there can be agents that never act.
Such agents are called loyalists. Agents that are neither instigators nor
loyalists are called simple agents. We study two combinatorial problems. The
first problem is to find a disposition of instigators that in several time
moments transforms a network from a state where a majority of simple agents are
inactive to a state with a majority of active agents. The second problem is to
find a disposition of loyalists that returns the network to a state with a
majority of inactive agents. Similar problems are studied for networks in which
simple agents demonstrate the contrary to conforming behavior that we call
anticonforming. We obtained several theoretical results regarding the behavior
of collectives of agents with conforming or anticonforming behavior. In
computational experiments we solved the described problems for randomly
generated networks with several hundred vertices. We reduced corresponding
combinatorial problems to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and used
modern SAT solvers to solve the instances obtained.

ten times or larger than that of the Earth. It is natural to link the formation
probability of gas giant planets with the supply of gas and solid in their

there is no shortage of planetary building-block material, 2) gas giants'
growth barrier is probably associated with whether they can merge into
super-critical cores, and 3) super Earths are probably failed cores which did
not attain sufficient mass to initiate efficient accretion of gas before it is
severely depleted. Here we construct a model based on the hypothesis that
protoplanetary embryos migrated extensively before they were assembled into
bona fide planets. We construct a Hermite-Embryo code based on a unified
viscous-irradiation disk model and a prescription for the embryo-disk tidal
interaction. This code is used to simulate 1) the convergent migration of
embryos, and 2) their close encounters and coagulation. Around the progenitors
of solar-type stars, the progenitor super-critical-mass cores of gas giant
planets primarily form in protostellar disks with relatively high ($\gtrsim

both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern
neuroscience. Recent technical and methodological progress in neuroimaging has
helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion
weighted images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state
functional connectivity (rsFC). However, comparing these two distinct datasets,
each of which can be encoded into a different complex network, is by no means
trivial as pairwise link-to-link comparisons represent a relatively restricted
perspective and provide only limited information. Thus, we have adopted a more
integrative systems approach, exploiting theoretical graph analyses to study
both SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects.
The aim is to find the main architectural traits shared by the structural and
functional networks by paying special attention to their common hierarchical
modular organization. This approach allows us to identify a common skeleton
from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted, with modules
sharing both structure and function. We describe these emerging common
structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail. In addition, we compare SFMs with
the classical Resting State Networks derived from independent component
analysis of rs-fMRI functional activity, as well as with anatomical
parcellations in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas and with the Broadmann
partition, highlighting their similitude and differences. The unveiling of SFMs
brings to light the strong correspondence between brain structure and
resting-state dynamics.

piezoelectric) limit their operation to laboratory conditions. All-optical
approach gives the possibility to overcome this problem, nevertheless, the
existing schemes are either fundamentally macroscopic or excessively
complicated and expensive in mass production. Here we propose a novel scheme of
extremely compact NEMS biosensor monolithically integrated on a chip with
all-nanophotonic transduction and actuation. It consists of the photonic
waveguide and the nanobeam cantilever placed above the waveguide, both
fabricated in the same CMOS-compatible process. Being in the near field of the
strongly confined photonic mode, cantilever is efficiently actuated and its
response is directly read out using the same optical waveguide, which results
in a very high sensitivity and capability of single-molecule detection even in
atmosphere.

homotopy theory of global analytic spaces. These have natural Betti, de Rham

integrality questions in the theory of special values of arithmetic

Molecular clouds are known to be turbulent and strongly affected by
stellar feedback. Moreover, stellar feedback is believed to drive turbulence at
large scales in galaxies.
  Aims. We study the role played by supernovae in molecular clouds and the
influence of the magnetic field on this process.
  Methods. We performed three-dimensional numerical simulations of supernova
explosions, in and near turbulent self-gravitating molecular clouds. In order
to study the influence of the magnetic field, we performed both hydrodynamical
and magnetohydrodynamical simulations. We also ran a series of simple uniform
density medium simulations and developed a simple analytical model.
  Results. We find that the total amount of momentum that is delivered during
supernova explosions typically varies by a factor of about 2, even when the gas
density changes by 3 orders of magnitude. However, the amount of momentum
delivered to the dense gas varies by almost a factor of 10 if the supernova
explodes within or outside the molecular cloud. The magnetic field has little
influence on the total amount of momentum injected by the supernova explosions
but increases the momentum injected into the dense gas.
  Conclusions. Supernovae that explode inside molecular clouds remove a
significant fraction of the cloud mass. Supernovae that explode outside have a
limited influence on the cloud. It is thus essential to know sufficiently well
the correlation between supernovae and the surrounding dense material in order
to know whether supernovae can regulate star formation effectively.

properties of single grain, (RE)BCO bulk superconductors (where RE = Sm, Gd and
Y). The presence of Ag in the (RE)BCO bulk composition, however, typically
reduces the melting temperature of the single crystal seed in the top seeded
melt growth (TSMG) process, which complicates significantly the controlled
nucleation and subsequent epitaxial growth of a single grain, which is
essential for high field engineering applications. The reduced reliability of
the seeding process in the presence of Ag is particularly acute for the SmBCO
system, since the melting temperature of SmBCO is very close to that of the
generic NdBCO(MgO) seed. SmBCO has the highest superconducting transition
temperature, Tc, and exhibits the most pronounced ""peak"" effect at higher
magnetic field of all materials in the family of (RE)BCO bulk superconductors
and, therefore, has the greatest potential for use in practical applications
(compared to GdBCO and YBCO, in particular). Development of an effective
seeding process, therefore, is one of the major challenges of the TSMG process
for the growth of large, high quantity single grain superconductors. In this
paper, we report a novel technique that involves introducing a buffer layer
between the seed crystal and the precursor pellet, primarily to inhibit the
diffusion of Ag from the green body to the seed during melt processing in order
to prevent the melting of the seed. The success rate of the seeding process
using this technique is 100% for relatively small batch samples. The
superconducting properties, Tc, Jc and trapped fields, of the single grains
fabricated using the buffers are reported and the micro-structures in the
vicinity of the buffer of single grains fabricated by the modified technique
are analysed.

erupting from the same active region (NOAA 11176) beneath a well-observed
helmet streamer. We find that the type II emissions in both events ended once
the CME/shock fronts passed the white-light streamer tip, which is presumably
the magnetic cusp of the streamer. This leads us to conjecture that the closed
magnetic arcades of the streamer may play a role in electron acceleration and
type II excitation at coronal shocks. To examine such a conjecture, we conduct
a test-particle simulation for electron dynamics within a large-scale
partially-closed streamer magnetic configuration swept by a coronal shock. We
find that the closed field lines play the role of an electron trap, via which
the electrons are sent back to the shock front for multiple times, and
therefore accelerated to high energies by the shock. Electrons with an initial
energy of 300eV can be accelerated to tens of keV concentrating at the loop
apex close to the shock front with a counter-streaming distribution at most
locations. These electrons are energetic enough to excite Langmuir waves and
radio bursts. Considering the fact that most solar eruptions originate from
closed field regions, we suggest that the scenario may be important to the
generation of more metric type IIs. This study also provides an explanation to
the general ending frequencies of metric type IIs at or above 20-30 MHz and the

understand their properties, and the processes that affect their behaviour in
order to model galaxy formation and development. We here present preliminary
results of an investigation into the cluster environments of radio galaxies. We
have found evidence of a strong correlation between radio luminosity and
environment richness for low excitation radio galaxies, and no evidence of
evolution of the environment with redshift. Conversely, for high excitation
radio galaxies, we found no correlation with environment richness, and
tentative evidence of evolution of the cluster environment.

heavier liquid released into lighter immiscible liquids. We focus on the regime
defined by small Ohnesorge numbers, density ratios of order one, and variable
Weber numbers. The observed stages in the fragmentation process include
deformation of the released fluid by either Rayleigh-Taylor instability or
vortex ring roll-up and destabilization, formation of filamentary structures,
capillary instability, and drop formation. At low and intermediate Weber
numbers, a wide variety of fragmentation regimes is identified. Those regimes
depend on early deformations, which mainly result from a competition between
the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the roll-up of a vortex ring.
At high Weber numbers, turbulent vortex ring formation is observed. We have
adapted the standard theory of turbulent entrainment to buoyant vortex rings
with initial momentum. We find consistency between this theory and our
experiments, indicating that the concept of turbulent entrainment is valid for
non-dispersed immiscible fluids at large Weber and Reynolds numbers.

comparing different approaches to quantum gravity. In this work, we apply this
formalism to the classical spectral actions obtained within the framework of
almost-commutative geometry. Analysing the propagation of spin-0, spin-1 and
spin-2 fields, we show that a non-trivial spectral dimension arises already at
the classical level. The effective field theory interpretation of the spectral
action yields plateau-structures interpolating between a fixed spin-independent
$D_{ S}(T) = d_S$ for short and $D_{ S}(T) = 4$ for long diffusion times $T$.
Going beyond effective field theory
  the spectral dimension is completely dominated by the high-momentum
properties of the spectral action, yielding $D_{ S}(T)=0$ for all spins. Our
results support earlier claims that high-energy bosons do not propagate.

economics and finance, large ensemble of interacting individuals following
(mainstream) or opposing (hipsters) to the majority are ubiquitous. In these
systems, interactions generally occur after specific delays associated to
transport, transmission or integration of information. We investigate here the
impact of anti-conformism combined to delays in the emergent dynamics of large
populations of mainstreams and hipsters. To this purpose, we introduce a class
of simple statistical systems of interacting agents composed of (i) mainstreams
and anti-conformists in the presence of (ii) delays, possibly heterogeneous, in
the transmission of information. In this simple model, each agent can be in one
of two states, and can change state in continuous time with a rate depending on
the state of others in the past. We express the thermodynamic limit of these
systems as the number of agents diverge, and investigate the solutions of the
limit equation, with a particular focus on synchronized oscillations induced by
delayed interactions. We show that when hipsters are too slow in detecting the
trends, they will consistently make the same choice, and realizing this too
late, they will switch, all together to another state where they remain alike.
Similar synchronizations arise when the impact of mainstreams on hipsters
choices (and reciprocally) dominate the impact of other hipsters choices, and
we show that these may emerge only when the randomness in the hipsters
decisions is sufficiently large. Beyond the choice of the best suit to wear
this winter, this study may have important implications in understanding
synchronization of nerve cells, investment strategies in finance, or emergent
dynamics in social science, domains in which delays of communication and the
geometry of information accessibility are prominent.

deriving a stochastic differential equation that describes the evolution of the
torque at one wind turbine driven by the wind speed. The stochastic equation is
derived directly from the measurements and is afterwards used for predicting
the fatigue loads at neighboring turbines. Such a framework could be used to
mitigate the financial efforts usually necessary for placing measurement
devices in all wind turbines within one wind farm. Finally, we also discuss the
limitations and possible improvements of the proposed procedure.

infinite graphs $X$, instead of the Ihara zeta function, with a perspective
towards zeta functions from number theory and connections to hypergeometric
functions. The Riemann hypothesis is shown to be equivalent to an approximate
functional equation of graph zeta functions. The latter holds at all points
where Riemann's zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is non-zero. This connection arises
via a detailed study of the asymptotics of the spectral zeta functions of
finite torus graphs in the critcal strip and estimates on the real part of the
logarithmic derivative of $\zeta(s)$. We relate $\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}$ to Euler's
beta integral and show how to complete it giving the functional equation
$\xi_{\mathbb{Z}}(1-s)=\xi_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)$. This function appears in the
theory of Eisenstein series although presumably with this spectral
intepretation unrecognized. In higher dimensions $d$ we provide a meromorphic
continuation of $\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}^{d}}(s)$ to the whole plane and identify the
poles. From our aymptotics several known special values of $\zeta(s)$ are
derived as well as its non-vanishing on the line $Re(s)=1$. We determine the

these magnetic parameters using two different NLFFF codes: The COR-NLFFF code
uses the line-of-sight magnetic field component $B_z$ from HMI to define the
potential field, and the 2D coordinates of automatically detected coronal loops
in 6 coronal wavelengths from AIA to measure the helical twist of coronal loops
caused by vertical currents, while the PHOT-NLFFF code extrapolates the
photospheric 3D vector fields. We find agreement between the two codes in the
measurement of free energies and dissipated energies within a factor of $

slopes that are approximately consistent with the fractal-diffusive
self-organized criticality model. The magnetic parameters exhibit scaling laws

$E_{free} \propto E_p^{1.7}$ and $E_{free} \propto B_{\varphi}^{1.0} L^{1.5}$,
for the dissipated energy, $E_{diss} \propto E_p^{1.6}$ and $E_{diss} \propto

The potential energies vary in the range of $E_p = 1 \times 10^{31} - 4 \times

1%-25%$. The Poynting flux amounts to $F_{flare} \approx 5 \times 10^{8} -
10^{10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ during flares, which averages to $F_{AR}

generate an unbounded amount of randomness from a finite amount of truly random
initial seed. One such protocol, given by Miller and Shi, uses a pair of
non-signaling untrusted quantum mechanical devices. These play XOR games with
inputs given by the user in order to generate an output. Here we present an
analysis of the required seed size, giving explicit upper bounds for the number
of initial random bits needed to jump-start the protocol. The bits output from
such a protocol are $\varepsilon$-close to uniform even against quantum
adversaries. Our analysis yields that for a statistical distance of
$\varepsilon=10^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$ from uniformity, the number of
required bits is smaller than 225,000 and 715,000, respectively; in general it
grows as $O(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$.

neutrino oscillations and mass hierarchy. In this paper, pushing the FSM
further, one first derives to 1-loop order the RGE for the rotation of
$\alpha$, and then applies it to fit mass and mixing data as a first test of
the model. With 7 real adjustable parameters, 18 measured quantities are
fitted, most (12) to within experimental error or to better than 0.5 percent,

fit, are: (i) that a theta-angle of order unity in the instanton term in QCD
would translate via rotation into a Kobayashi-Maskawa phase in the CKM matrix
of about the observed magnitude ($J \sim 10^{-5}$), (ii) that it would come out
correctly that $m_u<m_d$, despite the fact that $m_t \gg m_b, m_c \gg m_s$. Of
the 18 quantities fitted, 12 are deemed independent in the usual formulation of

class of pseudodifferential operators on manifolds of bounded geometry which is

Spakula's uniform K-homology and show that our elliptic pseudodifferential
operators naturally define classes there. Furthermore, we use the uniform
coarse assembly map to relate these classes to the index classes of these
operators in the K-theory of the uniform Roe algebra. Our investigation of
uniform K-homology goes on with constructing the external product for it and
deducing homotopy invariance. The next major result is the identification of
the dual theory of uniform K-homology: uniform K-theory. We give a simple
definition of uniform K-theory for all metric spaces and in the case of
manifolds of bounded geometry we give an interpretation via vector bundles of
bounded geometry over the manifold. This opens up the door for Chern-Weil
theory and we define a Chern character map from uniform K-theory of a manifold
to its bounded de Rham cohomology. We introduce a type of Mayer-Vietoris
argument for these uniform (co-)homology theories which enables us to show
firstly, that the Chern character induces an isomorphism modulo torsion, and
secondly, that we have Poincare duality between uniform K-theory and uniform
K-homology if the manifold is spin-c. Poincare duality together with the
relation of uniform K-homology to the index theorem of Roe mentioned above
directly leads to a generalization of the index theorem to elliptic
pseudodiffential operators. Finally, using homotopy invariance of uniform

non-linear $\delta N$ formalism to calculate the non-Gaussianity of the
primordial density and isocurvature perturbations due to the presence of
non-adiabatic, but approximately scale-invariant field fluctuations during
multi-field inflation. This local-type non-Gaussianity leads to a correlation
between very long wavelength inhomogeneities, larger than our observable
horizon, and smaller scale fluctuations in the radiation and matter density.
Matter isocurvature perturbations contribute primarily to low CMB multipoles
and hence can lead to a hemispherical asymmetry on large angular scales, with
negligible asymmetry on smaller scales. In curvaton models, where the matter
isocurvature perturbation is partly correlated with the primordial density
perturbation, we are unable to obtain a significant asymmetry on large angular
scales while respecting current observational constraints on the observed
quadrupole. However in the axion model, where the matter isocurvature and
primordial density perturbations are uncorrelated, we find it may be possible
to obtain a significant asymmetry due to isocurvature modes on large angular
scales. Such an isocurvature origin for the hemispherical asymmetry would
naturally give rise to a distinctive asymmetry in the CMB polarisation on large

$^6$Li$^{174}$Yb($^2\Sigma^+$)$ \to ^6$Li$_2(^1\Sigma^+$) + $^{174}$Yb($^1$S)
reaction is presented at cold and ultracold temperatures. The computations
involve determination and analytic fitting of a three-dimensional potential
energy surface for the Li$_2$Yb system and quantum dynamics calculations of
varying complexities, ranging from exact quantum dynamics within the
close-coupling scheme, to statistical quantum treatment, and universal models.
It is demonstrated that the two simplified methods yield zero-temperature
limiting reaction rate coefficients in reasonable agreement with the full
close-coupling calculations. The effect of the three-body term in the
interaction potential is explored by comparing quantum dynamics results from a
pairwise potential that neglects the three-body term to that derived from the
full interaction potential. Inclusion of the three-body term in the
close-coupling calculations was found to reduce the limiting rate coefficients
by a factor of two. The reaction exoergicity populates vibrational levels as
high as $v=19$ of the $^6$Li$_2$ molecule in the limit of zero collision
energy. Product vibrational distributions from the close-coupling calculations
reveal sensitivity to inclusion of three-body forces in the interaction
potential. Overall, the results indicate that a simplified model based on the
long-range potential is able to yield reliable values of the total reaction
rate coefficient in the ultracold limit but a more rigorous approach based on
statistical quantum or quantum close-coupling methods is desirable when product
rovibrational distribution is required.

confirm previous reports of an X-ray cold front, and report on the discovery of
a distinct core to the radio halo, 800 kpc in extent, that is strikingly
similar in morphology to the X-ray emission, and drops sharply in brightness at
the cold front. We detect additional radio emission trailing off from the core,
which blends smoothly into the 2 Mpc halo detected with the Green Bank
Telescope (GBT; Farnsworth et al., 2013). We speculate on the possible
mechanisms for such a two-component radio halo, with sloshing playing a
dominant role in the core. By directly comparing the X-ray and radio emission,
we find that a hadronic origin for the cosmic ray electrons responsible for the
radio halo would require a magnetic field and/or cosmic ray proton distribution
that increases with radial distance from the cluster center, and is therefore
disfavored.

over a field $k$ is its (full) splitting pattern, a finite sequence of integers
which describes the possible isotropy behaviour of $\phi$ under scalar
extension to arbitrary overfields of $k$. A similarly important, but more
accessible variant of this notion is that of the Knebusch splitting pattern of
$\phi$, which captures the isotropy behaviour of $\phi$ as one passes over a
certain prescribed tower of $k$-overfields. In this paper, we determine all
possible values of this latter invariant in the case where $\phi$ is totally
singular. This includes an extension of Karpenko's theorem (formerly Hoffmann's
conjecture) on the possible values of the first Witt index to the totally
singular case. Contrary to the existing approaches to this problem (in the
nonsingular case), our results are achieved by means of a new structural result
on the higher anisotropic kernels of totally singular quadratic forms.
Moreover, the methods used here readily generalise to give analogous results
for arbitrary Fermat-type forms of degree $p$ over fields of characteristic
$p>0$. Related problems concerning the Knebusch splitting of symmetric bilinear
forms over fields of characteristic 2 and the full splitting of totally
singular quadratic forms are also considered.

However, emphasis has been given on the acceptability of the model from
