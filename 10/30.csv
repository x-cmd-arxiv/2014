exhibit spin momentum locking (SML) of massless Dirac fermions in the surface
states. Usually optical methods, such as angle and spin-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, have been employed to observe the helical spin polarization in
the surface states of three-dimensional (3D) TIs up to room temperatures.
Recently, spin polarized surface currents in 3D TIs were detected by electrical
methods using ferromagnetic (FM) contacts in a lateral spin-valve measurement
geometry. However, probing the spin texture with such electrical approaches is
so far limited to temperatures below 125K, which restricts its application
potential. Here we demonstrate the room temperature electrical detection of the
spin polarization on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ due to SML by employing spin
sensitive FM tunnel contacts. The current-induced spin polarization on the
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface is probed at room temperature by measuring a spin-valve
signal while switching the magnetization direction of the FM detector. The spin
signal increases linearly with current bias, reverses sign with current
direction, exhibits a weak temperature dependence and decreases with higher TI
thickness, as predicted theoretically. Our results demonstrate the electrical
detection of the spin polarization on the surface of 3D TIs, which could lead
to innovative spin-based quantum information technology at ambient
temperatures.

expansions in the phase to model the spin-down of neutron stars. Studies of
pulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from
\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion
models. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous
gravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are
locked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity
between the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods
will result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as
`mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing
noise to its EM counterpart. We inject and recover fake CW signals, which
include timing noise generated from observational data on the Crab pulsar.
Measuring the mismatch over durations of order $\sim 10$ months, the effect is
for the most part found to be small. This suggests recent so-called
`narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the Crab
and Vela pulsars will not be significantly affected. At a fixed observation
time, we find the mismatch depends upon the observation epoch. Considering the
averaged mismatch as a function of observation time, we find that it increases
as a power law with time, and so may become relevant in long baseline searches.

  Hybrid Systems","HSCC 2015",,,,"cs.LO cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present ProbReach, a tool for verifying probabilistic reachability for
stochastic hybrid systems, i.e., computing the probability that the system
reaches an unsafe region of the state space. In particular, ProbReach will
compute an arbitrarily small interval which is guaranteed to contain the
required probability. Standard (non-probabilistic) reachability is undecidable
even for linear hybrid systems. In ProbReach we adopt the weaker notion of
delta-reachability, in which the unsafe region is overapproximated by a
user-defined parameter (delta). This choice leads to false alarms, but also
makes the reachability problem decidable for virtually any hybrid system. In
ProbReach we have implemented a probabilistic version of delta-reachability
that is suited for hybrid systems whose stochastic behaviour is given in terms
of random initial conditions. In this paper we introduce the capabilities of
ProbReach, give an overview of the parallel implementation, and present results
for several benchmarks involving highly non-linear hybrid systems.

likelihood or parsimony score, which can be induced by missing sequences in
partitioned multi-locus phylogenetic data matrices. The set of trees on a
terrace can be characterized by enumeration algorithms or consensus methods
that exploit the pattern of partial taxon coverage in the data, independent of
the sequence data themselves. Terraces add ambiguity and complexity to
phylogenetic inference particularly in settings where inference is already
challenging: data sets with many taxa and relatively few loci. In this paper we
present five new findings about terraces and their impacts on phylogenetic
inference. First we clarify assumptions about model parameters that are
necessary for the existence of terraces. Second, we explore the dependence of
terrace size on partitioning scheme and indicate how to find the partitioning
scheme associated with the largest terrace containing a given tree. Third, we
highlight the impact of terraces on bootstrap estimates of confidence limits in
clades, and characterize the surprising result that the bootstrap proportion
for a clade can be entirely determined by the frequency of bipartitions on a
terrace, with some bipartitions receiving high support even when incorrect.
Fourth, we dissect some effects of prior distributions of edge lengths on the
computed posterior probabilities of clades on terraces, to understand an
example in which long edges ""attract"" each other in Bayesian inference. Fifth,
we show that even if data are not partitioned, patterns of missing data studied
in the terrace problem can lead to instances of apparent statistical
inconsistency when even a small element of heterotachy is introduced to the
model generating the sequence data. Finally, we discuss strategies for
remediation of some of these problems.

role in planet formation. Viscous hydrodynamics results suggest RWI is excited
only when the viscosity changes over a radial distance less than two density
scale heights. However in the disks around Solar-mass T Tauri stars, it is not
viscosity but magnetic forces that provide the accretion stress beyond about 10
AU, where surface densities are low enough so stellar X-rays and interstellar
cosmic rays can penetrate. Here we aim to explore the conditions for RWI in the
smooth transition with increasing distance, from resistive and
magnetically-dead to conducting and magnetically-active. We perform 3D
unstratified MHD simulations with the Pencil Code, using static resistivity
profiles. As a result, we find that in MHD, contrary to viscous models, the RWI
is triggered even with a gradual change in resistivity extending from 10 to 40
AU (i.e., spanning 15 scale heights for aspect ratio 0.1). This is because
magneto-rotational turbulence sets in abruptly when the resistivity reaches a
threshold level. At higher resistivities the longest unstable wavelength is
quenched, resulting in a sharp decline of the Maxwell stress towards the star.
The sharp gradient in the magnetic forces leads to a localized density bump,
that is in turn Rossby wave unstable. We conclude that even weak gradients in
the resistivity can lead to sharp transitions in the Maxwell stress. The upshot
is that the RWI is more easily activated in the outer disk than previously
thought. Rossby vortices at the outer dead zone boundary thus could underlie
the dust asymmetries seen in the outer reaches of transition disks.

consistent with what is expected in a relativistic cosmological model if

of the unfolding of human entrainment - as expressed by the content and
patterns of hundreds of thousands of messages on Twitter - during the 2012 US
presidential debates. By time locking these data sources, we quantify the
impact of the unfolding debate on human attention. We show that collective
social behavior covaries second-by-second to the interactional dynamics of the
debates: A candidate speaking induces rapid increases in mentions of his name
on social media and decreases in mentions of the other candidate. Moreover,
interruptions by an interlocutor increase the attention received. We also
highlight a distinct time scale for the impact of salient moments in the
debate: Mentions in social media start within 5-10 seconds after the moment;
peak at approximately one minute; and slowly decay in a consistent fashion
across well-known events during the debates. Finally, we show that public
attention after an initial burst slowly decays through the course of the
debates. Thus we demonstrate that large-scale human entrainment may hold across
a number of distinct scales, in an exquisitely time-locked fashion. The methods

top-partner, which subsequently decays to a top quark plus a color-singlet
state. This singlet can serve as a WIMP dark-matter candidate. Such decay
chains lead to a spectacular signal of four top quarks plus missing energy. We
pursue a general categorization of the color-octet states and their decay
products according to their spin and gauge quantum numbers. We review the
current bounds on the new states at the LHC and study the expected discovery
reach at the 8-TeV and 14-TeV runs. We also present the production rates at a
future 100-TeV hadron collider, where the cross sections will be many orders of
magnitude greater than at the 14-TeV LHC. Furthermore, we explore the extent to
which one can determine the color octet's mass, spin, and chiral couplings.
Finally, we propose a test to determine whether the fermionic color octet is a
Majorana particle.

of THz and optical radiation in two spatial dimensions (2-D), (iii) self-phase
modulation and (iv) stimulated Raman scattering. The model is validated by
quantitative agreement with experiments and analytic calculations. We show that
the optical pump beam is significantly broadened in the transverse-momentum

generation. In the presence of this large frequency and transverse-momentum (or
angular) spread, group velocity dispersion causes a spatio-temporal break-up of
the optical pump pulse which inhibits further THz generation. The implications
of these effects on energy scaling and optimization of optical-to-THz
conversion efficiency are discussed. This suggests the use of optical pump
pulses with elliptical beam profiles for large optical pump energies. It is
seen that optimization of the setup is highly dependent on optical pump
conditions. Trade-offs of optimizing the optical-to-THz conversion efficiency
on the spatial and spectral properties of THz radiation is discussed to guide
the development of such sources.

is subject to both the tidal torques due to a time-dependent binary potential

angle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is
assumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which
the circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the
disk density and temperature gradient indices. This marginally stable warping
radius is very sensitive to viscosity parameters, a fiducial disk radius and
the temperature measured there, the stellar luminosity, and the disk surface
density at a radius where the disk changes from the optically thick to thin for
the irradiation from the central stars. On the other hand, it is insensitive to
the orbital eccentricity and binary irradiation parameter, which is a function
of the binary mass ratio and luminosity of each star. Since the tidal torques
can suppress the warping in the inner part of the circumbinary disk, the disk
starts to be warped in the outer part. While the circumbinary disks are most
likely to be subject to the radiation-driven warping on a AU to kilo-AU scale

background passes through foregrounds in which aligned dust grains produce
polarized dust emission, even in regions of the sky with the lowest level of
dust emission. One of the most commonly used ways to remove the dust foreground
is to extrapolate the polarized dust emission signal from frequencies where it
dominates (e.g., ~ 350 GHz) to frequencies commonly targeted by cosmic
microwave background experiments (e.g., ~150 GHz). In this paper, we describe
an interstellar medium effect that can lead to decorrelation of the dust
emission polarization pattern between different frequencies due to multiple
contributions along the line of sight. Using a simple 2-cloud model we show
that there are two conditions under which this decorrelation can be large: (a)
the ratio of polarized intensities between the two clouds changes between the
two frequencies; (b) the magnetic fields between the two clouds contributing
along a line of sight are significantly misaligned. In such cases, the 350 GHz
polarized sky map is not predictive of that at 150 GHz. We propose a possible
correction for this effect, using information from optopolarimetric surveys of
dichroicly absorbed starlight.

in a series of papers with the aim of testing how these parameters determine
the observable attributes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We have selected a
sample in a narrow redshift range, centered on z~1.55, that covers a wide range
in M_BH and $\dot{M}$, and are observing them with X-shooter, covering rest
wavelengths ~1200-9800 \AA. The current work covers 30 such objects and focuses
on the origin of the AGN spectral energy distribution (SED). After estimating
M_BH and $\dot{M}$ based on each observed SED, we use thin AD models and a
Bayesian analysis to fit the observed SEDs in our sample. We are able to fit
22/30 of the SEDs. Out of the remaining 8 SEDs, 3 can be fit by the thin AD
model by correcting the observed SED for reddening within the host galaxy and 4
can be fit by adding a disc wind to the model. In four of these 8 sources,
Milky Way-type extinction, with the strong 2175\AA\ feature, provides the best
reddening correction. The distribution in spin parameter covers the entire
range, from -1 to 0.998, and the most massive BHs have spin parameters greater
than 0.7. This is consistent with the ""spin-up"" model of BH evolution.
Altogether, these results indicate that thin ADs are indeed the main power
houses of AGN, and earlier claims to the contrary are likely affected by
variability and a limited observed wavelength range.

However, the formation mechanism and intrinsic frequency of such close extreme
mass-ratio binaries have been debated, especially considering none have
hitherto been detected. Utilizing observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud
galaxy conducted by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, we have
discovered a new class of eclipsing binaries in which a luminous B-type MS star
irradiates a closely orbiting low-mass pre-MS companion that has not yet fully
formed. The primordial pre-MS companions have large radii and discernibly
reflect much of the light they intercept from the B-type MS primaries
($\Delta$I$_{\rm refl}$ = 0.02-0.14 mag). For the 18 definitive MS + pre-MS

0.6-8 Myr, and small secondary masses M$_2$ = 0.8-2.4 M$_{\odot}$ (q =

associated with stellar nurseries, e.g. the system with the deepest eclipse
$\Delta$I$_1$ = 2.8 mag and youngest age $\tau$ = 0.6$\pm$0.4 Myr is embedded
in the bright H II region 30 Doradus. After correcting for selection effects,
we find that (2.0$\pm$0.6)% of B-type MS stars have companions with short
orbital periods P = 3.0-8.5 days and extreme mass ratios q = 0.06-0.25. This is
$\approx$10 times greater than that observed for solar-type MS primaries. We
discuss how these new eclipsing binaries provide invaluable insights,

we can reliably estimate random errors in computed absolute magnitudes due to
galaxy diversity, photometric error and redshift error. We derive K-corrections
for the five Sloan Digital Sky Survey filters and provide parameter tables for
use by the astronomical community. Using the New York Value-Added Galaxy

K-corrections produce absolute magnitudes that are generally in good agreement

intracluster medium (ICM) assumes that electrons are in thermal equilibrium
with ions in the plasma. However, electron-ion equilibration timescales can be
comparable to the Hubble time in the low density galaxy cluster outskirts,
leading to differences between the electron and ion temperatures. This
temperature difference can lead to systematic biases in cluster mass estimates
and mass-observable scaling relations. To quantify the impact of
non-equilibrium electrons on the ICM profiles in cluster outskirts, we use a
high resolution cosmological simulation with a two-temperature model assuming
the Spitzer equilibration timescale for the electrons. First, we show how the
radial profile of this temperature bias depends on both the mass and mass
accretion rate of the cluster; the bias is most pronounced in the most massive
and most rapidly accreting clusters. For the most extreme case in our sample,
we find that the bias is of order 10% at half of the cluster virial radius and
increases to 40% at the edge of the cluster. We also find that gas in filaments
is less susceptible to the non-equilibrium effect, leading to azimuthal
variations at large cluster-centric radii. By analyzing mock Chandra
observations of simulated clusters, we show that such azimuthal variations can
be probed with deep X-ray observations. Finally, the mass-dependent temperature
bias introduces biases in hydrostatic mass and cluster temperature, which has
implications for cluster-based cosmological inferences. We provide a
mass-dependent model for the temperature bias profile which can be useful for
modeling the effect of electron-ion equilibration in galaxy clusters.

as a source of particle-trapping vortices to mix chondrules and incubate
planetesimal formation. We present simulations with a pseudo-spectral anelastic
code and with the compressible code Athena, showing that stably stratified
flows in a shearing, rotating box are violently unstable and produce
space-filling, sustained turbulence dominated by large vortices with Rossby
numbers of order 0.2-0.3. This Zombie Vortex Instability (ZVI) is observed in
both codes and is triggered by Kolmogorov turbulence with Mach numbers less
than 0.01. It is a common view that if a given constant density flow is stable,
then stable vertical stratification should make the flow even more stable. Yet,
we show that sufficient vertical stratification can be unstable to ZVI. ZVI is
robust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial
entropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit
of infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable
stratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical
layers. ZVI has not been seen in previous studies of flows in rotating,
shearing boxes because those calculations frequently lacked vertical density
stratification and/or sufficient numerical resolution. Although we do not
expect appreciable angular momentum transport from ZVI in the small domains in
this study, we hypothesize that ZVI in larger domains with compressible
equations may lead to angular transport via spiral density waves.

Information about the read-channel degradation drives advanced signal
processing methods in Flash to mitigate its effect. In this context, channel
estimation must be ongoing since channel degradation evolves over time and as a
function of the number of program/erase (P/E) cycles. This paper proposes a
framework for ongoing model-based channel estimation using limited channel
measurements (reads). This paper uses a channel model characterizing
degradation resulting from retention time and the amount of charge programmed
and erased. For channel histogram measurements, bin selection to achieve
approximately equal-probability bins yields a good approximation to the
original distribution using only ten bins (i.e. nine reads). With the channel
model and binning strategy in place, this paper explores candidate numerical
least squares algorithms and ultimately demonstrates the effectiveness of the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm which provides both speed and accuracy.

these error bounds can be loose by up to sixteen orders of magnitude for some

clear correlation between ground state error and number of spin-orbitals. We
instead argue that chemical properties, such as the maximum nuclear charge in a

the cost of a quantum simulation. Our analysis motivates several strategies to
use classical processing to further reduce the required Trotter step size and
to estimate the necessary number of steps, without requiring additional quantum

compared to the field. To gain insight into the quenching process, we have
analysed ~2000 galaxies formed in the GIMIC suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before
accretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite
and host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies
(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive
satellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by
ram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming
interstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9
M_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and
clusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%
even for Milky Way analogues (M* ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun) in groups (M_host ~ 10^13.5
M_Sun). We show that (i) ISM stripping was significantly more effective at
early times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from
`galactic fountains' and half directly from the star forming disk; (iii)
galaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to ~100 times the
average at a given group/cluster-centric radius, because they are
preferentially located in overdense ICM regions. Remarkably, stripping causes
at most half the loss of the extended gas haloes surrounding our simulated
satellites. These results contrast sharply with the current picture of
strangulation -- removal of the ISM through star formation after stripping of
the hot halo -- being the dominant mechanism quenching group and cluster
satellites.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/798/2/108",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nature of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares remains
debated. Recent work has shown that power-law-like Fourier power spectra, also
referred to as 'red' noise processes, are an intrinsic property of solar and
stellar flare signals, a property that many previous studies of this phenomenon
have not accounted for. Hence a re-evaluation of the existing interpretations
and assumptions regarding QPP is needed. Here we adopt a Bayesian method for
investigating this phenomenon, fully considering the Fourier power law
properties of flare signals. Using data from the PROBA2/LYRA, Fermi/GBM,
Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Yohkoh/HXT instruments, we study a selection of
flares from the literature identified as QPP events. Additionally we examine
optical data from a recent stellar flare that appears to exhibit oscillatory
properties. We find that, for all but one event tested, an explicit oscillation
is not required in order to explain the observations. Instead, the flare
signals are adequately described as a manifestation of a power law in the
Fourier power spectrum, rather than a direct signature of oscillating
components or structures. However, for the flare of 1998 May 8, strong evidence
for the existence of an explicit oscillation with P ~ 14-16 s is found in the
17 GHz radio data and the 13-23 keV Yohkoh HXT data. We conclude that, most
likely, many previously analysed events in the literature may be similarly
described in terms of power laws in the flare Fourier power spectrum, without
the need to invoke a narrowband, oscillatory component. As a result the
prevalence of oscillatory signatures in solar and stellar flares may be less
than previously believed. The physical mechanism behind the appearance of the
observed power laws is discussed.

much smaller in CO than it is in millimeter continuum and scattered light

follows: initially a node knows a rumor and wants to spread it to all nodes in
a network quickly. In each round, every informed node sends the rumor to a
random neighbor, and every uninformed node contacts a random neighbor and gets
the rumor from her if she knows it. We analyze this protocol on random
$k$-trees, a class of power law graphs, which are small-world and have large
clustering coefficients, built as follows: initially we have a $k$-clique. In
every step a new node is born, a random $k$-clique of the current graph is
chosen, and the new node is joined to all nodes of the $k$-clique. When $k>1$
is fixed, we show that if initially a random node is aware of the rumor, then
with probability $1-o(1)$ after $O\left((\log n)^{1+2/k}\cdot\log\log n\cdot
f(n)\right)$ rounds the rumor propagates to $n-o(n)$ nodes, where $n$ is the
number of nodes and $f(n)$ is any slowly growing function. Since these graphs
have polynomially small conductance, vertex expansion $O(1/n)$ and constant
treewidth, these results demonstrate that Push-Pull can be efficient even on
poorly connected networks. On the negative side, we prove that with probability
$1-o(1)$ the protocol needs at least
$\Omega\left(n^{(k-1)/(k^2+k-1)}/f^2(n)\right)$ rounds to inform all nodes.
This exponential dichotomy between time required for informing almost all and
all nodes is striking. Our main contribution is to present, for the first time,
a natural class of random graphs in which such a phenomenon can be observed.
Our technique for proving the upper bound carries over to a closely related
class of graphs, random $k$-Apollonian networks, for which we prove an upper
bound of $O\left((\log n)^{c_k}\cdot\log\log n\cdot f(n)\right)$ rounds for
informing $n-o(n)$ nodes with probability $1-o(1)$ when $k>2$ is fixed. Here,
$c_k=(k^2-3)/(k-1)^2<1 + 2/k$.

ways to probe stellar interiors. Recent space missions such as Kepler have
provided us with an opportunity to study these oscillations with unprecedented
detail. For many multi-periodic pulsators such as {\gamma} Doradus stars, this
led to the detection of dozens to hundreds of oscillation frequencies that
could not be found from ground-based observations. Aims. We aim to detect
non-uniform period spacings in the Fourier spectra of a sample of {\gamma}
Doradus stars observed by Kepler. Such detection is complicated by both the
large number of significant frequencies in the space photometry and by
overlapping non-equidistant rotationally split multiplets. Methods. Guided by
theoretical properties of gravity-mode oscillation of {\gamma} Doradus stars,
we developed a period-spacing detection method and applied it to Kepler
observations of a few stars, after having tested the performance from
simulations. Results. The application of the technique resulted in the clear
detection of non-uniform period spacing series for three out of the five
treated Kepler targets. Disadvantages of the technique are also discussed, and
include the disability to distinguish between different values of the spherical
degree and azimuthal order of the oscillation modes without additional
theoretical modelling. Conclusions. Despite the shortcomings, the method is
shown to allow solid detections of period spacings for {\gamma} Doradus stars,
which will allow future asteroseismic analyses of these stars.

scenario of holonomy corrected Loop Quantum Cosmology. We focus our study in
two limits of the cosmic time, the large cosmic time limit and the small cosmic
time limit. For the former, we found that, in the presence of non-interacting
and non-relativistic matter, the $F(R)$ gravity that reproduces the late time
limit of the matter bounce solution is actually the Einstein-Hilbert gravity
plus a power law term. In the early time limit, since it corresponds to large
spacetime curvatures, assuming that the Jordan frame is described by a general
metric that when it is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame, produces
an accelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, we found explicitly the
scalar field dependence on time. After demonstrating that the solution in the
Einstein frame is indeed accelerating, we calculate the spectral index derived
from the Einstein frame scalar-tensor counterpart theory of the $F(R)$ theory
and compare it with the Planck experiment data. In order to implement the
resulting picture, we embed the $F(R)$ gravity explicitly in a Loop Quantum
Cosmology framework by introducing holonomy corrections to the $F(R)$ gravity.
In this way, the resulting inflation picture corresponding to the $F(R)$
gravity can be corrected in order it coincides to some extent with the current
experimental data.

Here we concentrate on the abundances and the dynamics of voids as these are
among the best candidates to provide information on cosmological parameters.
Cai, Padilla \& Li (2014) use the abundance of voids to tell apart Hu \&
Sawicki $f(R)$ models from General Relativity. An interesting result is that
even though, as expected, voids in the dark matter field are emptier in $f(R)$
gravity due to the fifth force expelling away from the void centres, this
result is reversed when haloes are used to find voids. The abundance of voids
in this case becomes even lower in $f(R)$ compared to GR for large voids.
Still, the differences are significant and this provides a way to tell apart
these models. The velocity field differences between $f(R)$ and GR, on the
other hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al.
(2013), concentrate on the velocity profiles around voids. First they show the
necessity of four parameters to describe the density profiles around voids
given two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. This
profile is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and the
combination of the latter with void density profiles allows the construction of
model void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions.
When these models are tuned to fit the measured correlation functions for voids
and galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, small voids are found to be of
the void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with being
void-in-void. This is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshift
space data around voids. These profiles can be used to remove systematics on
void-galaxy Alcock-Pacinsky tests coming from redshift-space distortions.

echo color is consistent with typical interstellar dust wavelength-dependent
scattering cross-sections, while the outer echo color does not match the

scattering, with the outer echo sheet thickness consistent with the inferred

cancellation were continuously detected within the active region, the latter
leading to the formation of two filaments.
  Our aim is to identify the origins of the flare taking into account the
complex dynamics of its close surroundings.
  We analyzed the magnetic topology of the active region using a linear
force-free field extrapolation to derive its 3D magnetic configuration and the
location of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) which are preferential sites for
flaring activity. Because the active region's magnetic field was nonlinear
force-free, we completed a parametric study using different linear force-free
field extrapolations to demonstrate the robustness of the derived QSLs.
  The topological analysis shows that the active region presented a complex
magnetic configuration comprising several QSLs. The considered data set
suggests that an emerging flux episode played a key role for triggering the
flare. The emerging flux likely activated the complex system of QSLs leading to
multiple coronal magnetic reconnections within the QSLs. This scenario accounts
for the observed signatures: the two extended flare-ribbons developed at
locations matched by the photospheric footprints of the QSLs, and were
accompanied with flare loops that formed above the two filaments which played
no important role in the flare dynamics.
  This is a typical example of a complex flare that can a-priori show standard
flare signatures that are nevertheless impossible to interpret with any
standard model of eruptive or confined flare. We find that a topological
analysis however permitted to unveil the development of such complex sets of
flare signatures.

that a ""rainbow"" is formed. The device is expected to have extremely low ohmic

spatial correlations where exponential attenuation (controlling the propagation
part of the transport) becomes power law. Direct transmission over optical
distance $\tau(s)$, for fixed physical distance $s$, thus becomes
$(1+\tau(s)/a)^{-a}$, with standard exponential decay recovered when
$a\to\infty$. Atmospheric turbulence phenomenology for fluctuating optical
properties rationalizes this switch. Foundational equations for this
generalized transport model are stated in integral form for $d=1,2,3$ spatial
dimensions. A deterministic numerical solution is developed in $d=1$ using
Markov Chain formalism, verified with Monte Carlo, and used to investigate
internal radiation fields. Standard two-stream theory, where diffusion is
exact, is recovered when $a=\infty$. Differential diffusion equations are not
presently known when $a<\infty$, nor is the integro-differential form of the
generalized transport equation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in $d=2$,
as a model for transport on random surfaces, to explore scaling behavior of
transmittance $T$ when transport optical thickness $\tau_\text{t} \gg 1$.
Random walk theory correctly predicts $T \propto
\tau_\text{t}^{-\min\{1,a/2\}}$ in the absence of absorption. Finally, single
scattering theory in $d=3$ highlights the model's violation of angular
reciprocity when $a<\infty$, a desirable property at least in atmospheric
applications. This violation is traced back to a key trait of generalized
transport theory, namely, that we must distinguish more carefully between two
kinds of propagation: one that ends in a virtual or actual detection, the other
in a transition from one position to another in the medium.

detections of g-mode pulsations in evolved He burning stars allow a rare
comparison of their internal structure with stellar models. Asteroseismology of
subdwarf B stars suggests convective cores of $0.22-0.28\,M_\odot$, $\gtrsim
45\,\%$ of the total stellar mass. Previous studies found significantly smaller
convective core masses ($\lesssim 0.19\,M_\odot$) at a comparable evolutionary
stage.
  We evolved stellar models with MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics) to explore how well the interior structure inferred from
asteroseismology can be reproduced by standard algorithms. Our qualitative
evolutionary paths, position in the $\log g-T_{\rm{eff}}$ diagram and model
timescales are consistent with previous results. SdB masses from our full
evolutionary sequences fall within the range of the empirical sdB mass
distribution, but are nearly always lower than the median.
  Using standard MLT with atomic diffusion we find convective core masses of
$\sim 0.17-0.18 M_\odot$, averaged over the entire sdB lifetime. We can
increase the convective core sizes to be as large as those inferred from
asteroseismology, but only for extreme values of the overshoot parameter
(overshoot gives numerically unstable and physically unrealistic behavior at
the boundary). High resolution three-dimensional (3D) simulations of turbulent
convection in stars suggest that the Schwarzschild criterion for convective
mixing sytematically {\it underestimates the actual extent of mixing because a
boundary layer forms.} Accounting for this would decrease the errors in both
sdB total and convective core masses.

A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability to
correctly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively
small vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possible
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. In this paper, we propose and implement an
effective technique to address this problem. We train an NMT system on data
that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT
system to emit, for each OOV word in the target sentence, the position of its
corresponding word in the source sentence. This information is later utilized
in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary.
Our experiments on the WMT14 English to French translation task show that this
method provides a substantial improvement of up to 2.8 BLEU points over an
equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique. With 37.5 BLEU points,
our NMT system is the first to surpass the best result achieved on a WMT14

an increase in hospital capacity to mitigate the impact of Ebola under several
scenarios, ranging from the planned scenario of 1700 beds in 10 weeks to a
considerably more aggressive approach of twice the number of beds in 5 weeks.
We find that even for the most aggressive scenarios, while increasing the
availability of healthcare reduces the number of Ebola cases and slows the
outbreak, it is not sufficient to stop the epidemic within the next three
months. We find that only a combination of increased hospital beds and a
dramatic decrease in the rate of transmission within the community can bring

restriction over the parameters. While some constraints are defined directly on
the parameter space, when they are instead defined by known behaviour on the
model, transformation of constraints into features on the parameter space may
not be possible. Difficulties in sampling from the posterior distribution as a
result of incorporation of constraints into the model is a common challenge
leading to truncations in the parameter space and inefficient sampling
algorithms. We propose a variant of sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for
posterior sampling in presence of constraints by defining a sequence of
densities through the imposition of the constraint. Particles generated from an
unconstrained or mildly constrained distribution are filtered and moved through
sampling and resampling steps to obtain a sample from the fully constrained
target distribution. General and model specific forms of constraints enforcing
strategies are defined. The Sequentially Constrained Monte Carlo algorithm is
demonstrated on constraints defined by monotonicity of a function, densities
constrained to low dimensional manifolds, adherence to a theoretically derived
model, and model feature matching.

absorption is also strongly enhanced at fixed HI, CIV, and SiIV optical depths,
and that this enhancement extends out to $\sim350$ km/s. At fixed HI the
increase in the median OVI optical depth near galaxies is 0.3-0.7 dex and is
detected at 2--3-$\sigma$ confidence for all seven HI bins that have
$\log_{10}\tau_{\rm HI}\ge-1.5$. We use ionization models to show that the
observed strength of OVI as a function of HI is consistent with enriched,
photoionized gas for pixels with $\tau_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10$. However, for pixels
with $\tau_{\rm HI} \lesssim 1$ this would lead to implausibly high
metallicities at low densities if the gas were photoionized by the background
radiation. This indicates that the galaxies are surrounded by gas that is
sufficiently hot to be collisionally ionized ($T > 10^5\,$K) and that a
substantial fraction of the hot gas has a metallicity $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ of
solar. Given the high metallicity and large velocity extent (out to
$\sim1.5\times v_{\rm circ}$) of this gas, we conclude that we have detected
hot, metal enriched outflows arising from star-forming galaxies.

in which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\ell_1$- and

the EN formulation does not achieve robust recovery of sparse vectors, whereas
the new CLOT formulation achieves robust recovery. Also, like EN but unlike
LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect, wherein coefficients
of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned
roughly comparable values. It is already known LASSO does not have the grouping
effect. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best features of both LASSO
(robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect).
  The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse

any analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery. It is
shown here that SGL achieves robust sparse recovery, and also achieves a

computed analytically, but had no intuitive or probabilistic interpretation,

the ""bottlenecks"" responsible for the rates of convergence and also gives tight
computable bounds on the total variation norm of the process between two

particular subset of many body wavefunctions that can be associated with
classical condensed matter and its interaction with delocalized wavefunctions.
This transfers questions of the ""strangeness"" of quantum mechanics from the
wavefunction to the macroscopic material itself. An effectively many-worlds
picture of measurement results for long times and induces a natural arrow of
time. The challenging part is then justifying why our macroscopic world is
dominated by such far-from-eigenstate matter. Condensing cold mesoscopic
clusters provide a pathway to a partitioning of a highly correlated many body
wavefunction to long lasting islands composed of classical-like bodies widely
separated in Fock space. Low mass rapidly delocalizing matter that recombines
with the solids ""slice"" the system into a set of nearby yet very weakly
interacting subsystems weighted according to the Born statistics and yields a
kind of many worlds picture but with the possibility of revived phase
interference on iterative particle desorption, delocalization and readsorption.
A proliferation of low energy photons competes with such a possibility.
Causality problems associated with correlated quantum measurement are resolved
and conserved quantities are preserved for the overall many body function
despite their failure in each observer's bifurcating ""slice-path."" The
necessity of such a state for a two state logic and reliable discrete state
machine suggests that later stages of the universe's evolution will destroy the
physical underpinnings required for consciousness and the arrow of time even
without heat-death or atomic destruction. Some exotic possibilities outside the
domain of usual quantum measurement are considered such as measurement with
delocalized devices and revival of information from past measurements.

sufficiently low that dim, unresolved background galaxies were a major
contaminant in the source counts. We isolated a clean sample of
red-giant-branch (RGB) stars extending to $\approx 0.8$ mag below the TRGB
through conservative magnitude and color cuts, to remove the (predominantly
blue) unresolved background galaxies. We derived stellar metallicities from
colors of the stars via isochrones and measured the density falloff of the halo
as a function of metallicity by combining our observations with HST imaging
taken of NGC 5128 halo fields closer to the galaxy center. We found both
metal-rich and metal-poor stellar populations and found that the falloff of the
two follows the same de Vaucouleurs' law profiles from $\approx 8$ kpc out to
$\approx$ 70 kpc. The metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the density
falloff agree with the results of two recent studies of similar outermost halo
fields in NGC 5128. We found no evidence of a ""transition"" in the radial
profile of the halo, in which the metal-rich halo density would drop rapidly,
leaving the underlying metal-poor halo to dominate by default out to greater
radial extent, as has been seen in the outer halo of two other large galaxies.
If NGC 5128 has such a transition, it must lie at larger galactocentric
distances.

the coherent band-like transport regime governed by the Redfield equation to
incoherent hopping transport in the classical regime. A non-monotonic
dependence of the diffusion coefficient is observed both as a function of
temperature and system-phonon coupling strength. In the band-like transport
regime, the diffusion coefficient is shown to be linearly proportional to the
system-phonon coupling strength, and vanishes at zero coupling due to Anderson
localization. In the opposite classical hopping regime, we correctly recover
that the dynamics are described by the Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) and establish
that the scaling of the diffusion coefficient depends on the phonon bath
relaxation time. In both the hopping and band-like transport regimes, it is
demonstrated that at low temperature the zero-point fluctuations of the bath
lead to non-zero transport rates, and hence a finite diffusion constant.
Application to rubrene and other organic semiconductor materials shows a good
agreement with experimental mobility data.

expected scores. A new estimator of the Ignorance score is derived which is
unbiased with respect to the ensemble size. In an application to seasonal
climate predictions it is shown that the standard Ignorance score assigns
better expected scores to simple climatological ensembles or biased ensembles
that have many members, than to physical dynamical and unbiased ensembles with
fewer members. By contrast, the new bias-corrected Ignorance score ranks the
physical dynamical and unbiased ensembles better than the climatological and
biased ones, independent of ensemble size. It is shown that the unbiased

members are statistically consistent with the observations. The finite ensemble
bias of ensemble verification scores is discussed more broadly. It is argued
that a bias-correction is appropriate when forecast systems with different

Accepted in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/33",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the discovery of a Jupiter-mass planet orbiting an M-dwarf star
that gave rise to the microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0265. Such a system is
very rare among known planetary systems and thus the discovery is important for
theoretical studies of planetary formation and evolution. High-cadence temporal
coverage of the planetary signal combined with extended observations throughout
the event allows us to accurately model the observed light curve. The final
microlensing solution remains, however, degenerate yielding two possible
configurations of the planet and the host star. In the case of the preferred
solution, the mass of the planet is $M_{\rm p} = 0.9\pm 0.3\ M_{\rm J}$, and
the planet is orbiting a star with a mass $M = 0.22\pm 0.06\ M_\odot$. The
second possible configuration (2$\sigma$ away) consists of a planet with
$M_{\rm p}=0.6\pm 0.3\ M_{\rm J}$ and host star with $M=0.14\pm 0.06\ M_\odot$.
The system is located in the Galactic disk 3 -- 4 kpc towards the Galactic
bulge. In both cases, with an orbit size of 1.5 -- 2.0 AU, the planet is a
""cold Jupiter"" -- located well beyond the ""snow line"" of the host star.
Currently available data make the secure selection of the correct solution
difficult, but there are prospects for lifting the degeneracy with additional
follow-up observations in the future, when the lens and source star separate.

high precision timing of radio pulsars to detect signals at such frequencies.
Here we present a time-domain implementation of the optimal cross-correlation

sampling typical of PTA data as well as the use of a timing model to predict
the times-of-arrival of radio pulses, time-domain methods are better suited for
gravitational wave data analysis of such data. We present a derivation of the
optimal cross-correlation statistic starting from the likelihood function, a
method to produce simulated stochastic background signals, and a rigorous
derivation of the scaling laws for the signal-to-noise ratio of the
cross-correlation statistic in the two relevant PTA regimes: the weak signal
limit where instrumental noise dominates over the gravitational wave signal at
all frequencies, and a second regime where the gravitational wave signal
dominates at the lowest frequencies.

$\gamma\subset D$ starting at $\partial H$, let $g_t$ be the unique conformal
map from $D\setminus\gamma[0,t]$ onto a standard slit domain $D_t={\mathbb H}

Komatu-Loewner equation in terms of the complex Poisson kernel of the Brownian
motion with darning (BMD) for $D_t$.
  We randomize the Jordan arc $\gamma$ according to a system of probability
measures on the family of equivalence classes of Jordan arcs that enjoy a
domain Markov property and a certain conformal invariance property. We show
that the induced process $(\xi(t), {\bf s}(t))$ satisfies a Markov type

  Conversely, given such functions $\alpha$ and $b$ with local Lipschitz
continuity, the corresponding SDE admits a unique solution $(\xi(t), {\bf

Komatu-Loewner equation. The resulting family of random growing hulls $\{F_t\}$
from the conformal mappings is called ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,b}.$ We show that it
enjoys a certain scaling property and a domain Markov property. Among other
things, we further prove that ${\rm SKLE}_{\alpha,-b_{\rm BMD}}$ for a constant
$\alpha >0$ has a locality property if and only if $\alpha = \sqrt{6}$, where
$b_{\rm BMD}$ is a BMD-domain constant that describes the discrepancy of a

evolve in a certain way: in the rising phase, it monotonically goes up till a
soft intermediate state is achieved. In the propagating oscillatory shock
model, oscillation of the Compton cloud is thought to cause QPOs. Thus, in
order to increase QPO frequency, Compton cloud must collapse steadily in the
rising phase. In decline phases, exactly opposite should be true. We
investigate cause of this evolution of the Compton cloud. The same viscosity
parameter which increases the Keplerian disk rate, also moves the inner edge of
the Keplerian component, thereby reducing the size of the Compton cloud and
reducing the cooling time scale. We show that cooling of the Compton cloud by
inverse Comptonization is enough for it to collapse sufficiently so as to
explain the QPO evolution. In the Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF)
configuration of Chakrabarti-Titarchuk, centrifugal force induced shock
represents boundary of the Compton cloud. We take the rising phase of 2010

variation of $\alpha$ parameter of the sub-Keplerian flow to be monotonically
rising from $0.0001$ to $0.02$, well within the range suggested by
magneto-rotational instability. We also estimate the inward velocity of the
Compton cloud to be a few meters/second which is comparable to what is found in
several earlier studies of our group by empirically fitting the shock locations

about two, above the nuclear density range is the key to establishing the
universality for neutron stars and quark stars with typical compactness from
about 0.1 to 0.3. On the other hand, the I-Love-Q relations of low-mass neutron
stars near the minimum mass limit depend more sensitively on the underlying
equation of state because these stars are composed mainly of softer matter at
low densities. However, the I-Love-Q relations for low-mass quark stars can
still be represented accurately by the incompressible limit. We also study the
I-Love relation connecting the moment of inertia and tidal deformability
analytically in Newtonian gravity and show why the I-Love-Q relation is weakly
dependent on the underlying equation of state and can be attributed to its
incompressible limit.

the study of the distribution of the sub-channel transmittance coefficients in
the presence of a Gaussian noise and the utilization of the moment generation

sub-channel selection and formulation of the transmittance coefficients, and
show a reduced complexity progressive sub-channel scanning method. We define a
random matrix formalism for multicarrier CVQKD to evaluate the statistical
properties of the information flowing process. Using random matrix theory, we
express the achievable secret key rates and study the efficiency of the
AMQD-MQA (adaptive multicarrier quadrature division-multiuser quadrature

substitutional, displacement and surface defects. Spatial composition variation
is taken into account by introducing a model in which the edge lengths of each
cell depend on the distribution of Zr and Ti ions in the cluster. Spatially
varying edge lengths and angles are referred to as microstrain. The Pb, Zr and
Ti cation positions were adjusted by bond-valence sum (BVS) model to fullfil
nominal valence requirement. The model is applied to compute the scattering
from ellipsoid shaped PZT clusters and to simulate the structural changes as a
function of average composition. Two-phase co-existence range, the so called
morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) composition is given correctly. To make a
comparison with commonly used x-ray and neutron diffraction data selected Bragg
reflection intensities and line shapes were simulated. Examples of the effect
of size and shape of the scattering clusters on diffraction patterns are given

antiferromagnetic behavior with an unusual temperature dependence. The
magnetization for fields 20 Oe < H < 5 kOe is fit to a combination of a power
law ((T-T_C)/T_C)^beta behavior representing the ferromagnetic long-range order
and sigmoid-convoluted Curie-Weiss-like behavior representing the
antiferromagnetic behavior. The critical exponent beta=0.63 +- 0.02 is
consistent with 2D (surface) ordering. Increased Co3O4 correlates well to
increased ferromagnetism. The weakening of the antiferromagnetism below T ~ 40K
is a consequence of the lattice reaching a critical rhombahedral distortion as
T is decreased for core regions far from the Co3O4 interfaces. We introduce a

hypotheses. The inequalities are based on exact finite sample formulas which
are also of interest for independent uniformly distributed p-values under the
null. As applications the asymptotic worst case FDR of step up and step down
tests coming from an non-decreasing rejection curve is established. In
addition, new step up tests are established and necessary conditions for the
FDR control are discussed. The reverse martingale models yield sharper FDR
results than the PRDS models. Already in certain multivariate normal dependence
models the familywise error rate of the Benjamini Hochberg step up test can be
different from the desired level alpha. The second part of the paper is devoted
to adaptive step up tests under dependence. The well-known Storey estimator is
modified so that the corresponding step up test has finite sample control for

recombination lines and H_2 ro-vibrational transitions. We provide seven
reliable A-ooefficient ratios between bright [Fe II] lines, which are compared

continuous gravitational-wave signals from the Crab and Vela pulsars conducted
on Virgo VSR4 data. In order to take into account a possible small mismatch
between the gravitational wave frequency and two times the star rotation
frequency, inferred from measurement of the electromagnetic pulse rate, a range
of 0.02 Hz around two times the star rotational frequency has been searched for
both the pulsars. No evidence for a signal has been found and 95$\%$ confidence
level upper limits have been computed both assuming polarization parameters are
completely unknown and that they are known with some uncertainty, as derived
from X-ray observations of the pulsar wind torii. For Vela the upper limits are
comparable to the spin-down limit, computed assuming that all the observed
spin-down is due to the emission of gravitational waves. For Crab the upper
limits are about a factor of two below the spin-down limit, and represent a
significant improvement with respect to past analysis. This is the first time
the spin-down limit is significantly overcome in a narrow-band search.

  Comments to author are still welcome!",,"10.1098/rspa.2014.0963",,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper derives stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for
fluid dynamics from a stochastic variational principle (SVP). The Legendre
transform of the Lagrangian formulation of these SPDEs yields their Lie-Poisson
Hamiltonian form. The paper proceeds by: taking variations in the SVP to derive
stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It\^o representation;
and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in
comparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid
models. The circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid
equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid
models. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic
Stratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in
incompressible stochastic flows. However, these Stratonovich properties are not
apparent in the equivalent It\^o representation, because they are disguised by
the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the Stratonovich to It\^o
transformation. This term is a geometric generalisation of the quadratic
covariation drift term already found for scalar densities in Stratonovich's
famous 1966 paper. The paper also derives motion equations for two examples of
stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics (SGFD); namely, the Euler-Boussinesq and
quasigeostropic approximations.

used to transfer information. Among the proposed methods, molecular
communication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main
challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits
communication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy
efficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a
pre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a
decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the
optimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally
calculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD
system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,
new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of
ISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a
modulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is
proposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.
Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes
the residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a
new energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute
for the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision
feedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are
compared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more
advantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower
computational complexity.

recurrent solar jets that occurred in active region NOAA 11133 on 11 December,
2010. These jets were well observed by the Solar Dynamic observatory (SDO) with
high spatial and temporal resolution. The speed of the jets ranged between 86
and 267 km/s. A type III radio burst was observed in association with all the
five jets. The investigation of the over all evolution of magnetic field in the
source regions suggested that the flux was continuously emerging on longer
term. However, all the jets but J5 were triggered during a local dip in the
magnetic flux, suggesting the launch of the jets during localised submergence
of magnetic flux. Additionally, using the PFSS modelling of the photospheric
magnetic field, we found that all the jets were ejected in the direction of
open field lines. We also traced sunspot oscillations from the sunspot interior
to foot-point of jets and found presence of ~ 3 minute oscillations in all the
SDO/AIA passbands. The wavelet analysis revealed an increase in amplitude of
the oscillations just before the trigger of the jets, that decreased after the
jets were triggered. The observations of increased amplitude of the oscillation
and its subsequent decrease provides evidence of wave-induced reconnection
triggering the jets.

core is formed via a spherical shock wave. The thermodynamical conditions in
the quark core are found from the conservation laws across the transition
region. Their dependence on the density and velocity of the incoming nuclear
matter are studied. It is found that the shock is especially violent in the
beginning of the conversion process when the velocity of the infalling matter
is especially high. As the shock propagates further from the center the front
velocity first increases and reaches a maximum value when the incoming velocity
is around $0.2$. Finally, the front velocity quickly goes to zero when incoming
matter velocity approaches zero. We have shown that the density and pressure

reduced to the general Heun equation, a second order linear differential

that the energy spectrum for the hydrogen atom in the de Sitter space should be
quasi-stationary, and the atom should be unstable. We derive an approximate
expression for energy levels within the quasi-classical approach and estimate
the probability of decay of the atom. A similar analysis shows that in the anti

strategy for a graph is measured by the guessing number of the digraph.
  Christofides and Markstr\""om studied guessing numbers of undirected graphs

results of this paper is a disproof of this conjecture.
  The main tool so far for computing guessing numbers of graphs is information

are not sufficient for computing the guessing number.

In these systems the pulsar's companion has a mass between 0.1 and about 0.5
solar masses in an orbital period of less than 1.5 days. All show extended
radio eclipses associated with circumbinary material. They do not lie on the
period-companion mass relation expected from the canonical intermediate-mass
X-ray binary evolution in which the companion filled its Roche lobe as a red
giant and has now lost its envelope and cooled as a white dwarf. The redbacks
lie closer to, but usually at higher period than, the period-companion mass
relation followed by cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. In
order to turn on as a pulsar mass accretion on to a neutron star must be
sufficiently weak, considerably weaker than expected in systems with low-mass
main-sequence companions driven together by magnetic braking or gravitational
radiation. If a neutron star is formed by accretion induced collapse of a white
dwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit some baryonic mass is abruptly
lost to its binding energy so that its effective gravitational mass falls. We
propose that redbacks form when accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf
takes place during cataclysmic variable binary evolution because the loss of
gravitational mass makes the orbit expand suddenly so that the companion no
longer fills its Roche lobe. Once activated, the pulsar can ablate its
companion and so further expand the orbit and also account for the extended
eclipses in the radio emission of the pulsar that are characteristic of these
systems. The whole period-companion mass space occupied by the redbacks can be
populated in this way.

number density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from GR. In contrast,
the same $f(R)$ voids are more empty of dark matter, and their profiles are
steeper. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing of
voids, for which the combination of a spectroscopic redshift and a lensing
photometric redshift survey over the same sky is required. Neglecting the
lensing shape noise, the $f(R)$ model parameter amplitudes $|f_{R0}|=10^{-5}$
and $10^{-4}$ may be distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear
signal around voids by 4 and 8$\sigma$ for a volume of 1~(Gpc/$h$)$^3$. The
line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the main systematics that
limits the significance of this signal for the near future wide angle and deep
lensing surveys. For this reason, it is challenging to distinguish
$|f_{R0}|=10^{-6}$ from GR. We expect that this can be overcome with larger
volume. The halo void abundance being smaller and the steepening of dark matter
void profiles in $f(R)$ models are unique features that can be combined to
break the degeneracy between $|f_{R0}|$ and $\sigma_8$.

linear order that we call $([0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0},<_{altlex})$, where
$[0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0}$ is the set of strictly decreasing transfinite
sequences of reals in $[0, 1]$ with last element $0$, and $<_{altlex}$, the so
called \emph{alternating lexicographical ordering}, is defined as follows: if
$(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi}, (x'_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi'} \in
[0,1]^{<\omega_1}_{\searrow 0}$, and $\delta$ is the minimal ordinal where the
two sequences differ then we say that \[ (x_\alpha)_{\alpha\leq \xi} <_{altlex}

found to correlate with the surface gravity of their planets. Stars with
low-gravity planets have on average a lower chromospheric flux. We propose that
this correlation is due to the absorption by circumstellar matter that comes
from the evaporation of the planets. Planets with a lower gravity have a
greater mass-loss rate which leads to a higher column density of circumstellar
absorption and this in turn explains the lower level of chromospheric emission
observed in their host stars. We estimated the required column density and
found that planetary evaporation can account for it. We derived a theoretical
relationship between the chromospheric emission as measured in the core of the
Ca II H&K lines and the planet gravity. We applied this relationship to a
sample of transiting systems for which both the stellar Ca II H&K emission and
the planetary surface gravity are known and found a good agreement, given the
various sources of uncertainties and the intrinsic variability of the stellar
emissions and planetary evaporation rates. We consider implications for the
radial velocity jitter applied to fit the spectroscopic orbits and for the age
estimates of planetary systems based on the chromospheric activity level of
their host stars.

question. Recent studies suggest that AGN can regulate the gas accretion and
thus slow down star formation (negative feedback). However, evidence of AGN
positive feedback has also been observed in a few radio galaxies (eg. Centaurus
A).
  Here we present CO observations of 3C 285 and Minkowski Object (MO), which
are examples of jet-induced star formation. A spot (named 09.6) aligned with
the 3C 285 radio jet, at a projected distance of ~70 kpc from the galaxy
centre, shows star formation, detected in optical emission. MO is located along
the jet of NGC 541 and also shows star formation. To know the distribution of
molecular gas along the jets is a way to study the physical processes at play
in the AGN interaction with the intergalactic medium.
  We observed CO lines in 3C 285, NGC 541, 09.6 and MO with the IRAM-30m
telescope. In the central galaxies, the spectra present a double-horn profile,
typical of a rotation pattern, from which we are able to estimate the molecular
gas density profile of the galaxy. The molecular gas appears to be in a compact
reservoir. In addition, no kinematic signature of a molecular outflow is
detected by the 30m-telescope.
  Interestingly, 09.6 and MO are not detected in CO. The cold gas mass upper
limits are consistent with a star formation induced by the compression of dense
ambient material by the jet. The depletion time scales are of the order of and
even smaller than what is found in 3C 285, NGC 541 and local spiral galaxies
(10^9 yr). The molecular gas surface density in 09.6 follows a
Schmidt-Kennicutt law if the emitting region is very compact, while MO is found
to have a much higher SFE (very short depletion time). Higher sensitivity and
spatial resolution are necessary to detect CO in the spots of star formation,
and map the emission in these jet-induced star forming regions.

sustaining the force-free magnetic field configuration of a monopolar
structure. The result differs substantially from the customary picture of the
radial speed-of-light motion of massless particles. In our case, the electron
and positron constituents follow slightly curved trajectories and are
characterized by definite number densities and distinct velocities. The
velocity shift is determined by the first-order longitudinal electric field,
which appears the necessary ingredient of the self-consistent two-fluid model
and implies the parallel conductivity of the order of the inverse particle
mass. Our model is believed to be a proper context to describe radiation
processes in the pulsar magnetosphere, including both the radio and high-energy
emissions. The velocity shift is suggestive of the two-stream instability which
may underlie the pulsar radio emission mechanism. The differential rotation of
the particle flow may cause the diochotron instability expected to be
responsible for the radio subpulse phenomenon. The connection between the radio
and high-energy emissions of pulsars is predicted as well.

four warmest observed stars are (moderately) O-poor, Na-rich, and N-rich, and
they probably belong to the second generation. While our sample is not fully
representative of the whole HB population in NGC6723, our data suggest that in
this cluster only HB stars warmer than ~9000 K, that is one fourth of the
total, belong to the second generation, if at all. Since in many other clusters
this fraction is about two thirds, we conclude that the fraction of
first/second generation in globular clusters may be strongly variable. In
addition, the wide range in colour of chemically homogeneous first-generation
HB stars requires a considerable spread in mass loss (>0.10 Mo). The reason for

inclusion with compact support embedded in the free space. We consider cases
where an observer can produce incident plane waves and measure the far field
pattern of the resulting scattered field only in a finite set of directions. In
this context, we say that a wavenumber is a non-scattering wavenumber if the
associated relative scattering matrix has a non trivial kernel. Under certain
assumptions on the physical coefficients of the inclusion, we show that the
non-scattering wavenumbers form a (possibly empty) discrete set. Then, in a
second step, for a given real wavenumber and a given domain D, we present a
constructive technique to prove that there exist inclusions supported in D for
which the corresponding relative scattering matrix is null. These inclusions
have the important property to be impossible to detect from far field
measurements. The approach leads to a numerical algorithm which is described at
the end of the paper and which allows to provide examples of (approximated)
invisible inclusions.

stars in the early universe. It has been proposed that gas cooling by dust
thermal emission can trigger fragmentation of a low-metallicity star-forming
gas cloud. In order to determine the critical condition in which dust cooling
induces the formation of low-mass stars, we follow the thermal evolution of a
collapsing cloud by a one-zone semi-analytic collapse model. Earlier studies
assume the dust amount in the local universe, where all refractory elements are
depleted onto grains, and/or assume the constant dust amount during gas
collapse. In this paper, we employ the models of dust formation and destruction
in early supernovae to derive the realistic dust compositions and size
distributions for multiple species as the initial conditions of our collapse
calculations. We also follow accretion of heavy elements in the gas phase onto
dust grains, i.e., grain growth, during gas contraction. We find that grain
growth well alters the fragmentation property of the clouds, and that this
still does not approach to the value in the local universe. The critical
conditions can be written by the gas metallicity Zcr and the initial depletion
efficiency fdep,0 of gas-phase metal onto grains, or dust-to-metal mass ratio,
as (Zcr/10^{-5.5} Zsun) = (fdep,0/0.18)^{-0.44} with small scatters in the
range of Zcr = [0.06--3.2]x10^{-5} Zsun. We also show that the initial dust

behave as porous soft solids and store large amount of solvent. These gels
undergo spontaneous aging, called syneresis that consists in the shrinkage of
the gel matrix and the progressive expulsion of the solvent. As a result, a
biogel originally casted in a container often lose contact with the container
sidewalls, and the detachment time is a priori difficult to anticipate since it
may occur over variable time spans (from hours to days). Here we report on the
syneresis phenomena in agar plates that consist in Petri dishes filled with a
gel mainly composed of agar. Direct observations and speckle pattern
correlation analysis allow us to rationalize the delayed detachment of the gel
from the sidewall of the Petri dish. The detachment time $t^*$ is surprisingly
not controlled by the mass loss as one would intuitively expect. Instead, $t^*$
is strongly correlated to the gel minimum thickness $e_{min}$ measured along
the sidewall of the plate, and increases as a robust function of $e_{min}$
independently of the prior mass-loss history. Time-resolved correlation
spectroscopy atypically applied to such weakly diffusive media gives access to
the local thinning rate of the gel. This technique also allows us to detect the
gel micro-displacements that are triggered by the water evaporation prior to
the detachment, and even to anticipate the latter from a few hours. Our work
provides observables to predict the detachment time of agar gels in dishes, and
highlights the relevance of speckle pattern correlation analysis for the
quantitative investigation of the syneresis dynamics in biopolymer gels.

luminosity L= 0.9 x 10^{42} erg/s and duration ~90 days, which is somewhat
shorter than standard Type II-P supernovae. We estimate the nickel mass as
0.040 +/- 0.015 Msun from the luminosity at the beginning of the radioactive
tail of the light curve. The explosion parameters of SN 2012ec were estimated
from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the observed temperature
and velocity evolution of the ejecta with predictions from hydrodynamical
models. We derived an envelope mass of 12.6 Msun, an initial progenitor radius
of 1.6 x 10^{13} cm and an explosion energy of 1.2 foe. These estimates agree
with an independent study of the progenitor star identified in pre-explosion
images, for which an initial mass of M=14-22 Msun was determined. We have
applied the same analysis to two other type II-P supernovae (SNe 2012aw and
2012A), and carried out a comparison with the properties of SN 2012ec derived

progenitors obtained from pre-explosion images and masses derived from
hydrodynamical models. We estimate the distance to SN 2012ec with the
Standardized Candle Method (SCM) and compare it with other estimates based on
other primary and secondary indicators. SNe 2012A, 2012aw and 2012ec all follow
the standard relations for the SCM for the use of Type II-P SNe as distance

questions about prime numbers that had previously seemed intractable. Zhang
even showed that one can take $B = 70000000$. Moreover, a co-operative team,
\emph{polymath8}, collaborating only on-line, had been able to lower the value
of $B$ to ${4680}$. They had not only been more careful in several difficult
arguments in Zhang's original paper, they had also developed Zhang's techniques
to be both more powerful and to allow a much simpler proof (and forms the basis
for the proof presented herein). In November 2013, inspired by Zhang's
extraordinary breakthrough, James Maynard dramatically slashed this bound to
$600$, by a substantially easier method. Both Maynard, and Terry Tao who had
independently developed the same idea, were able to extend their proofs to show
that for any given integer $m\geq 1$ there exists a bound $B_m$ such that there
are infinitely many intervals of length $B_m$ containing at least $m$ distinct
primes. We will also prove this much stronger result herein, even showing that
one can take $B_m=e^{8m+5}$.

metal-insulator transition in the quasi-two-dimensional organic charge-transfer
salt $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br. In this material, the terminal
ethylene groups of the BEDT-TTF molecules can adopt two different structural
orientations within the crystal structure, namely eclipsed (E) and staggered
(S) with the relative orientation of the outer C$-$C bonds being parallel and
canted, respectively. These two conformations are thermally disordered at room
temperature and undergo a glass-like ordering transition at $T_g \sim 75\,$K.
When cooling through $T_g$, a small fraction that depends on the cooling rate
remains frozen in the S configuration, which is of slightly higher energy,
corresponding to a controllable degree of structural disorder. We demonstrate
that, when thermally coupled to a low-temperature heat bath, a pulsed heating
current through the sample causes a very fast relaxation with cooling rates at
$T_g$ of the order of several 1000$\,$K/min. The freezing of the structural
degrees of freedom causes a decrease of the electronic bandwidth $W$ with
increasing cooling rate, and hence a Mott metal-insulator transition as the
system crosses the critical ratio $(W/U)_{c}$ of bandwidth to on-site Coulomb
repulsion $U$. Due to the glassy character of the transition, the effect is
persistent below $T_g$ and can be reversibly repeated by melting the frozen
configuration upon warming above $T_g$. Both by exploiting the characteristics
of slowly-changing relaxation times close to this temperature and by
controlling the heating power, the materials can be fine-tuned across the Mott
transition. A simple model allows for an estimate of the energy difference
between the E and S state as well as the accompanying degree of frozen disorder
in the population of the two orientations.

debates and studies in the last century. First the idea was to make a
resemblance of a cell with a Carnot engine, which is the most thermodynamically
perfect machine. This approach was clearly not the best, since the yield
achieved within a cell cannot be ideal, but can we even measure it? Several
models approach the living cell, since the very simple one (e.g. Prigogine
model) to more elaborated proposals. The concept of entropy has been the centre
of discussions within several scientific fields. To interpret how entropy is
produced in the complicated system of a cell is as hard as to understand how
life originated at the first place. Understanding the way a cell works is key
in biology, medicine, and multiple other scientific fields. Thermodynamics is
essential in multitude of processes around us. I give here an insight of what
has been done and a personal opinion about the topic, focusing in the results
from Himeoka and Kaneko paper.

extinction of one or more state variable components occurs in the tail of the
quasi-stationary probability distribution, thereby making it a rare event. Here
we show how to extend the theory of large deviations to random networks to
predict extinction times. In particular, we use the theory to find the most
probable path leading to extinction. We apply the methodology to epidemic
models and discover how mean extinction times scale with epidemiological and
network parameters in Erdos-Renyi networks. The results are shown to compare
quite well with Monte Carlo simulations of the network in predicting both the
most probable paths to extinction and mean extinction times.

interlamellar gaps or in spaces made by non-planar conformers. The electrons
from the former ones are bound more weakly than those from the latter ones. The

robust framework for solving multiple square-root LASSO problems, based on a
sketch of the learning data that uses low-rank approximations. Our approach
allows a dramatic reduction in computational effort, in effect reducing the
number of observations from $m$ (the number of observations to start with) to
$k$ (the number of singular values retained in the low-rank model), while not
sacrificing---sometimes even improving---the statistical performance.
Theoretical analysis, as well as numerical experiments on both synthetic and
real data, illustrate the efficiency of the method in large scale applications.

thermodynamics is considered as a basic cosmic mechanism acting on the flat FRW
geometry. By assuming that the gravitationally induced particle production
occurs under ""adiabatic"" conditions, the deceleration parameter is expressed in
terms of the particle creation rate which is chosen as a truncated power series
of the Hubble parameter. The model shows the evolution of the Universe starting
from inflation to the present late time acceleration and it also predicts

ratio cuts and ratio association have become popular in recent years because
they are widely applicable and simple to implement via standard eigenvector
computations. Despite strong performance for a number of clustering tasks,
spectral graph cut algorithms still suffer from several limitations: first,
they require the number of clusters to be known in advance, but this
information is often unknown a priori; second, they tend to produce clusters
with uniform sizes. In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size
distribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human-segmented images tend
to yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we
propose a general framework of power-law graph cut algorithms that produce
clusters whose sizes are power-law distributed, and also does not fix the
number of clusters upfront. To achieve our goals, we treat the Pitman-Yor
exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) as a regularizer to graph
cut objectives. Because the resulting objectives cannot be solved by relaxing
via eigenvectors, we derive a simple iterative algorithm to locally optimize
the objectives. Moreover, we show that our proposed algorithm can be viewed as
performing MAP inference on a particular Pitman-Yor mixture model. Our
experiments on various data sets show the effectiveness of our algorithms.

(LBIE) based on moving least squares approximation (MLS) and local radial point
interpolation (LRPI) based on Wu's compactly supported radial basis functions

the matrix method. In fact, based on an analysis carried out in the present
paper, the methods are unconditionally stable for implicit Euler (\theta = 0)

LRPI schemes lead to banded and sparse system matrices. Therefore, we use a

stochastic volatility models with jumps in returns (SVJ) and stochastic
volatility models with jumps in returns and volatility (SVCJ). To evaluate
these options, mesh-based methods are applied in a number of papers but it is
well-known that these methods depend strongly on the mesh properties which is
the major disadvantage of them. Therefore, we propose the use of the meshless
methods to solve the aforementioned options models, especially in this work we
select and analyze one scheme of them, named local radial point interpolation
(LRPI) based on Wendland's compactly supported radial basis functions
(WCS-RBFs) with C6, C4 and C2 smoothness degrees. The LRPI method which is a
special type of meshless local Petrov-Galerkin method (MLPG), offers several
advantages over the mesh-based methods, nevertheless it has never been applied
to option pricing, at least to the very best of our knowledge. These schemes
are the truly meshless methods, because, a traditional non-overlapping
continuous mesh is not required, neither for the construction of the shape
functions, nor for the integration of the local sub-domains. In this work, the
American option which is a free boundary problem, is reduced to a problem with
fixed boundary using a Richardson extrapolation technique. Then the
implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping scheme is employed for the time
derivative which allows us to smooth the discontinuities of the options'
payoffs. Stability analysis of the method is analyzed and performed. In fact,
