particles interacting via a spherically symmetric potential that is found to
form, upon cooling from a liquid state, a low-density porous crystalline phase.
Its structure analysis demonstrates that the crystal can be described by a net
with a topology that belongs to the class of topologies characteristic of the
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The observed net is new, and it is now
included in the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource database (RCSR). The
observation that a net topology characteristic of MOF crystals, which are known
to be formed by a coordination-driven self-assembly process, can be reproduced
by a thermodynamically stable configuration of a simple single-component system
of particles opens a possibility of using these models in studies of MOF nets.
It also indicates that structures with MOF topology, as well as other
low-density porous crystalline structures can possibly be produced in colloidal
systems of spherical particles, with an appropriate tuning of interparticle
interaction.

interest by using a social networking service (SNS). News or messages propagate
through inhomogeneous connections in an SNS by sharing or facilitating
additional comments. Such human activity is known to lead to endogenous
bursting in the rate of message occurrences. We analyze a multi-dimensional
self-exciting process to reveal dependence of the bursting activity on the
topology of connections and the distribution of interaction strength on the
connections. We determine the critical conditions for the cases where
interaction strength is regulated at either the point of input or output for
each person. In the input regulation condition, the network may exhibit
bursting with infinitesimal interaction strength, if the dispersion of the
degrees diverges as in the scale-free networks. In contrast, in the output
regulation condition, the critical value of interaction strength, represented
by the average number of events added by a single event, is a constant
$1-1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.3$, independent of the degree dispersion. Thus, the
stability in human activity crucially depends on not only the topology of
connections but also the manner in which interactions are distributed among the
connections.

scale forcing of a high dimensional chaotic ocean system. Using a simple
parameterisation scheme, the velocity components of a 30km resolution shallow
water ocean model are optimised to have the same climatological mean and
variance as that of a less viscous 7.5km resolution model. The 5 day
lag-covariance is also optimised, leading to a more accurate estimate of the
high resolution response to forcing using the low resolution model.
  The system considered is an idealised barotropic double gyre that is chaotic
at both resolutions. Using the optimisation scheme, we find and apply the
constant in time, but spatially varying, forcing term that is equal to the time
integrated forcing of the sub-mesoscale eddies. A linear stochastic term,
independent of the large-scale flow, with no spatial correlation but a
spatially varying amplitude and time scale is used to represent the transient
eddies. The climatological mean, variance and 5 day lag-covariance of the
velocity from a single high resolution integration is used to provide an
optimisation target. No other high resolution statistics are required.
Additional programming effort, for example to build a tangent linear or adjoint
model, is not required either.
  The focus of this paper is on the optimisation scheme and the accuracy of the
optimised flow. The method can be applied in future investigations into the
physical processes that govern barotropic turbulence and it can perhaps be
applied to help understand and correct biases in the mean and variance of a
more realistic coarse or eddy-permitting ocean model. The method is
complementary to current parameterisations and can be applied at the same time
without modification.

mechanism for organisms to adapt, both within and between generations. However,
neither the extent to which this occurs, nor the molecular mechanisms involved
are known. Here we investigate DNA methylation variation in Swedish Arabidopsis
thaliana accessions grown at two different temperatures. Environmental effects
on DNA methylation were limited to transposons, where CHH methylation was found
to increase with temperature. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that the
extensive CHH methylation variation was strongly associated with genetic
variants in both cis and trans, including a major trans-association close to
the DNA methyltransferase CMT2. Unlike CHH methylation, CpG gene body
methylation (GBM) on the coding region of genes was not affected by growth
temperature, but was instead strongly correlated with the latitude of origin.
Accessions from colder regions had higher levels of GBM for a significant
fraction of the genome, and this was correlated with elevated transcription
levels for the genes affected. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that
this effect was largely due to trans-acting loci, a significant fraction of
which showed evidence of local adaptation. These findings constitute the first
direct link between DNA methylation and adaptation to the environment, and
provide a basis for further dissecting how environmentally driven and
genetically determined epigenetic variation interact and influence organismal
fitness.

generically in the Torelli locus in the Siegel modular variety $\mathcal{A}_g$.
Using the poly-stability of Higgs bundles on curves and the slope inequality of
Xiao on fibred surfaces, we show that a Shimura curve $C$ is not contained
generically in the Torelli locus if its canonical Higgs bundles contains a
unitary Higgs subbundle of rank at least $(4g+2)/5$. From this we prove that a
Shimura subvariety of $\mathbf{SU}(n,1)$-type is not contained generically in
the Torelli locus when a numerical inequality holds, which involves the genus
$g$, the dimension $n+1$, the degree $2d$ of CM field of the Hermitian space,
and the type of the symplectic representation defining the Shimura subdatum. A
similar result holds for Shimura subvarieties of $\mathbf{SO}(n,2)$-type,
defined by spin groups associated to quadratic spaces over a totally real
number field of degree at least 6 subject to some natural constraints of
signatures.

to Planck's law of blackbody radiation, are also responsible for van der Waals
and Casimir forces, as well as near-field radiative energy transfer between
objects. Electromagnetic waves transport energy, momentum, and entropy. For
classical thermal radiation, the dependence of the above mentioned quantities
on the temperature is well-known mainly due to Planck's work. When near-field
effects, namely the collective influence of diffraction, interference, and
tunneling of waves, become important, Planck's theory is no longer valid. Of
momentum, energy, and entropy transfer, the role of near-field effects on
momentum transfer between two half-spaces separated by a vacuum gap (van der
Waals pressure in the vacuum gap) was first determined by Lifshitz, using
Rytov's theory of fluctuational electrodynamics in 1956. Subsequently,
Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii, employing sophisticated methods from
quantum field theory, generalized Lifshitz' result for van der Waals pressure
in a vacuum layer to the case of van der Waals pressure in a dissipative layer
between two half-spaces. The influence of near-field effects on radiative
transfer was appreciated only in the late 1960s and, subsequently, in the last
two decades because of the enhancement in radiative transfer due to
electromagnetic surface waves. The role played by near-field effects on entropy
transfer has not been investigated so far, at least when the temperature
distribution is non-uniform.

comprising of alternating nanowire and nanotube sections is investigated by
means of Monte Carlo simulations. Such nanoelements may feature a three-state
behaviour with an intermediate plateau in the hysteresis curve due to a
metastable pinning of the domain walls at the wire-tube interfaces. It turns
out that vortex as well as transverse domain walls contribute to the
magnetization reversal. By varying the geometric parameters, the sequence, or
the material of the elements the nucleation location of domain walls, as well
as their nucleation field, can be tailored. Especially interesting is the novel
possibility to drive domain walls coherently in the same or in opposite
directions by changing the geometry of the hybrid nanoelement. This important
feature adds additional flexibility to the construction of logical devices
based on domain wall movement. Another prominent outcome is that domain walls
can be nucleated near the centre of the element and then traverse to the outer
tips of the cylindrical structure when the applied field is increased, which
also opens the possibility to use these three-segment nanoelements for the
field induced delivery of domain walls as substitutes for large nucleation
pads.

different stages of the interaction. Each galactic encounter triggers a
starburst activity, but the varying physical conditions change the triggering
mechanism of each starburst. During the first two pericenter passages, the
starburst is spatially extended and forms many star clusters. However, the
starburst associated to the third, final passage is more centrally
concentrated: stars form almost exclusively in the galactic nucleus and no new
star cluster is formed. The maximum mass of stars clusters in this merger is
more than 30 times higher than those in a simulation of an isolated Milky
Way-like galaxy. Antennae-like mergers are therefore a formation channel of
young massive clusters possibly leading to globular clusters. Monitoring the
evolution of a few clusters reveals the diversity of formation scenarios
including the gathering and merger of gas clumps, the monolithic formation and
the hierarchical formation in sub-structures inside a single cloud. Two stellar
objects formed in the simulation yield the same properties as ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies. They share the same formation scenario than the most massive
clusters, but have a larger radius either since birth, or get it after a
violent interaction with the galactic center. The diversity of environments
across space and time in a galaxy merger can account for the diversity of the
stellar objects formed, both in terms of mass and size.

energy, momentum or the symplectic form, are called geometric integrators. In
this paper we present a method to construct symplectic-momentum integrators for
higher-order Lagrangian systems. Given a regular higher-order Lagrangian
$L\colon T^{(k)}Q\to\mathbb{R}$ with $k\geq 1$, the resulting discrete
equations define a generally implicit numerical integrator algorithm on
$T^{(k-1)}Q\times T^{(k-1)}Q$ that approximates the flow of the higher-order
Euler--Lagrange equations for $L$. The algorithm equations are called
higher-order discrete Euler--Lagrange equations and constitute a variational
integrator for higher-order mechanical systems. The general idea for those
variational integrators is to directly discretize Hamilton's principle rather
than the equations of motion in a way that preserves the invariants of the
original system, notably the symplectic form and, via a discrete version of
Noether's theorem, the momentum map.
  We construct an exact discrete Lagrangian $L_d^e$ using the locally unique
solution of the higher-order Euler--Lagrange equations for $L$ with boundary
conditions. By taking the discrete Lagrangian as an approximation of $L_d^e$,
we obtain variational integrators for higher-order mechanical systems. We apply
our techniques to optimal control problems since, given a cost function, the
optimal control problem is understood as a second-order variational problem.

Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In addition, the non-commutativity of the
basic quantum operators add some terms to the quantum equations of motion that
explicitly depend on the Planck constant and are not present in the classical
setting. These are thus purely-quantum effects. Some particular Hamiltonians

related to the smallness of a lepton number violating mass term whilst the

ongoing and planned measurements of the Higgs boson properties at the LHC, we
found timely to investigate the possibility of having large lepton flavor

the most generic case where three additional pairs of massive right-handed

required to be compatible with the present neutrino data and the present
experimental bounds for the three LFV radiative decays, and also consistent
with other constraints, like perturbativity of the neutrino Yukawa couplings.

simulate the accretion disks around super-Jovian planets and find that giant
moons with masses similar to Mars can form. Our results suggest that the
Galilean moons formed during the final stages of accretion onto Jupiter, when
the circumjovian disk was sufficiently cool. But in contrast to other studies,

complete photoevaporation of the circumsolar nebula. To counteract the steady
loss of moons into the planet due to type I migration, we propose that the
water ice line around Jupiter and super-Jovian exoplanets acted as a migration
trap for moons. Heat transitions, however, cross the disk during the gap
opening within 10^4 yr, which makes them inefficient as moon traps. This
indicates a fundamental difference between planet and moon formation. We find
that icy moons larger than the smallest known exoplanet can form at about 15 -
30 Jupiter radii around super-Jovian planets. Their size implies detectability

nuclei (AGN) and the dark matter halos in which they reside is key to
constraining how black-hole fueling is triggered and regulated. Previous
efforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering,
weak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modeling. In
practice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, no matter how they are
identified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation
function whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. In this work,
we show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparison
of the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of AGN hosts to a
fiducial stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) derived for all galaxies. Our
technique exploits the fact that the global SHMR can be measured with much
higher accuracy than any statistic derived from AGN samples alone. Using 382
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN at z<1 from the COSMOS field, we report the first
measurements of weak gravitational lensing from an X-ray selected sample.
Comparing this signal to predictions from the global SHMR, we find that,
contrary to previous results, most X-ray AGN do not live in medium size groups
---nearly half reside in relatively low mass halos with Mh~10^12.5 Msun. The
AGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all
galaxies but with a lower normalization---the fraction of halos with AGN in our
sample is a few percent. By highlighting the relatively ""normal"" way in which
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy halos, our results suggest that the
environmental signature of distinct fueling modes for luminous QSOs compared to
moderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed.

extensively for early and late-type galaxies, both in the local universe and at
high redshifts. The abundant differences between the properties of disky and
elliptical, or star-forming and quiescent, galaxies seem to be characteristic
of the local Universe; such clear distinctions begin to disintegrate as
observations of massive galaxies probe higher redshifts. In this Paper, we
investigate the existence the mass fundamental plane of all massive galaxies
($\sigma\gtrsim$ 100 km/s). This work includes local galaxies (0.05<z<0.07)
from the SDSS, in addition to 31 star-forming and 72 quiescent massive galaxies
at intermediate redshift (z~0.7) with absorption line kinematics from deep
Keck-DEIMOS spectra and structural parameters from HST imaging. In two
parameter scaling relations, star-forming and quiescent galaxies differ
structurally and dynamically. However, we show that massive star-forming and
quiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane, or the
relationship between stellar mass surface density, stellar velocity dispersion,
and effective radius. The scatter in this relation (measured about
$\log\sigma$) is low: 0.072 dex (0.055 dex intrinsic) at z~0 and 0.10 dex (0.08
dex intrinsic) at z~0.7. This three dimensional surface is not unique: virial
relations, with or without a dependence on luminosity profile shapes, can
connect galaxy structures and stellar dynamics with similar scatter. This
result builds on the recent finding that mass fundamental plane has been stable
for early-type galaxies since z~2 (Bezanson et al. 2013). As we now find this
also holds for star-forming galaxies to z~0.7, this implies that these scaling
relations of galaxies will be minimally susceptible to progenitor biases due to
the evolving stellar populations, structures, and dynamics of galaxies through
cosmic time.

environments. We measure gas-phase oxygen abundances and gas fractions for
eight dwarf galaxies (M_r > -16.2), carefully selected to reside within the

existing samples of isolated dwarf galaxies. We find no significant difference

that dwarf galaxy chemical evolution proceeds independent of the large-scale

suggests that external gas accretion is playing a limited role in the chemical

photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy for the WZ Sge-type dwarf nova EZ
Lyn during its 2010 superoutburst. Dual-band photometry revealed that the
$g'-i'$ color reddened with a decrease in brightness, during the main
superoutburst and the following rebrightening phase, whereas the color became
bluer with a further decrease in brightness during the slow, final decline
phase. With a fit to our photometric results by a blackbody function, we
estimated the disk radius ratio (ratio of the disk radius to the binary
separation) and compared this with that of V455 And, a WZ Sge-type object that
did not show any rebrightening in the 2007 superoutburst. The comparison
revealed: (1) the disk radius ratio of EZ Lyn decreased more slowly than that
of V455 And; and (2) the radius ratio of EZ Lyn at the end of the main
superoutburst was larger than that of the V455 And. These results favor the
mass reservoir model for the mechanism of rebrightening. During both the
superoutburst plateau and subsequent rebrightening phase, H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ lines were detected. The H$\alpha$ line showed a double-peak profile
from which we estimated the disk radius ratio. The comparison of this ratio
with that derived by photometry, indicates that the H$\alpha$ disk was larger
than the photometric one, which suggests that the optically thin gas was
extended to the outer region more than the optically thick gas disk and was
possibly responsible for the rebrightening phenomenon. Time-series dual-band
photometry during the main superoutburst revealed that color variations during
the early superhump show roughly the same behavior as that of V455 And, whereas
color variations during the ordinary superhump display clear anticorrelation
with brightness, in contrast to that seen in the V455 And.

as a tool to reveal the unconventional transport behavior of novel materials.
In this work, we show that a p-n junction made from a three dimensional
topological insulator (3DTI) in a magnetic field realizes an electronic
Mach-Zehnder interferometer with virtually perfect visibility. This is owed to
the confinement of the topological Dirac fermion state to a closed
two-dimensional surface, which offers the unprecedented possibility of
utilizing external fields to design networks of chiral modes wrapping around
the bulk in closed trajectories, without the need of complex constrictions or
etching. Remarkably, this junction also acts as a spin filter, where the path
of the particle is tied to the direction of spin propagation. It therefore
constitutes a novel and highly tunable spintronic device where spin polarized
input and output currents are naturally formed and could be accessed and
manipulated seperately.

controlling the growth of structure. We use data from all principal
cosmological probes: of these, Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic
oscillations, and the peak locations in the cosmic microwave background angular
power spectrum constrain the geometry, while the redshift space distortions,
weak gravitational lensing and the abundance of galaxy clusters constrain both
geometry and growth. Both geometry and growth separately favor the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology with the matter density relative to critical $\Omega_M\simeq 0.3$.
When the equation of state is allowed to vary separately for probes of growth

($w\simeq -1$), with the major exception of redshift-space distortions which
favor less growth than in $\Lambda$CDM at 3-$\sigma$ confidence, favoring the
equation of state $w^{\rm grow}\simeq -0.8$. The anomalous growth favored by
redshift space distortions has been noted earlier, and is common to all
redshift space distortion data sets, but may well be caused by systematics, or
be explained by the sum of the neutrino masses higher than that expected from
the simplest mass hierarchies, $m_\nu \simeq 0.45$ eV. On the whole, the

the current-carrying electrons, an effect known as Hall drift, should play a
very important role as the ions remain essentially fixed (as long as the solid
does not break). Although Hall drift preserves the magnetic field energy, it
has been argued that it may drive a turbulent cascade to scales at which Ohmic
dissipation becomes effective, allowing a much faster decay in objects with
very strong fields. On the other hand, it has been found that there are ""Hall
equilibria"", i.e., field configurations that are unaffected by Hall drift.
Here, we address the crucial question of the stability of these equilibria
through axially symmetric (2D) numerical simulations of Hall drift and Ohmic
diffusion, with the simplifying assumption of uniform electron density and
conductivity. We demonstrate the 2D-stability of a purely poloidal equilibrium,
for which Ohmic dissipation makes the field evolve towards an attractor state
through adjacent stable configurations, around which damped oscillations occur.
For this field, the decay scales with the Ohmic timescale. We also study the
case of an unstable equilibrium consisting of both poloidal and toroidal field
components that are confined within the crust. This field evolves into a stable
configuration, which undergoes damped oscillations superimposed on a slow
evolution towards an attractor, just as the purely poloidal one.

$\sim$ 1 AU of the SBH. Very little is known about the formation and evolution
of planetesimals in galactic nuclei such as the GC, making predictions for
flaring event rates uncertain. We explore two scenarios for the formation of
planetesimals in the GC: (1) in a large-scale cloud bound to the SBH, and (2)
in debris discs around stars. We model their orbital evolution around the SBH
using the Fokker-Planck equation and investigate the effect of gravitational
interactions with various relevant perturbers. Our predicted flaring rate,
$\approx 0.6 \, \mathrm{day^{-1}}$, is nearly independent of the distribution
of perturbers. Moreover, it is insensitive to scenarios (1) or (2). The assumed
number of planetesimals per star is consistent with debris discs around stars
in the Solar neighbourhood. In scenario (1) this implies that the number of
planetesimals formed in the large-scale cloud is strongly correlated with the
number of stars, and this requires finetuning for our results to be consistent

entrainment over the downstream cylinders reducing their heat exchange. The

improves the existing results in literature through a technique of solving a

$n^{-1}\log k$. A key step to establish the lower bound is to construct a novel
subset of the parameter space and then apply Fano's lemma, from which we see a
clear distinction of the nonparametric graphon estimation problem from
classical nonparametric regression, due to the lack of identifiability of the
order of nodes in exchangeable random graph models. As an immediate
application, we consider nonparametric graphon estimation in a H\""{o}lder class

over the affine part in such a way that the invariant line corresponds to the
line at infinity. We say that two such foliations are topologically equivalent
provided there exists a homeomorphism of $\mathbb{P}^2$ which brings the leaves
of one foliation onto the leaves of the other and preserves orientation both on
the ambient space and on the leaves. The main result of this paper is that in
the generic case two such foliations may be topologically equivalent if and
only if they are analytically equivalent. In fact, it is shown that the
analytic conjugacy class of the holonomy group of the invariant line is the
modulus of both topological and analytic classification. We obtain as a
corollary that two generic orbitally topologically equivalent quadratic vector
fields on $\mathbb{C}^2$ must be affine equivalent. This result improves, in
the case of quadratic foliations, a well-known result by Ilyashenko that claims
that two generic and topologically equivalent foliations with an invariant line
at infinity are affine equivalent provided they are close enough in the space
of foliations and the linking homeomorphism is close enough to the identity map
on $\mathbb{P}^2$.

in a fairly general framework, which includes the case of waves on hyperbolic

the profile decomposition to address a specific nonlinear problem, namely the
question of global well-posedness and scattering for the defocusing, energy
critical, semi-linear wave equation on three-dimensional hyperbolic space,
possibly perturbed by a repulsive time-independent potential. Using the
concentration compactness/rigidity method introduced by Kenig and Merle, we
prove that all finite energy initial data lead to a global evolution that
scatters to linear waves in infinite time. This proof will serve as a blueprint
for the arguments in a forthcoming work, where we study the asymptotic behavior
of large energy equivariant wave maps on the hyperbolic plane.

in the infrared pumping rates. We analyze the main implications this discovery
has on the interpretation of molecular line emission in the envelopes of
Mira-type stars. Radiative transfer calculations have to take into account both
the time variability of infrared pumping and the possible variation of the dust

of molecular lines at different epochs. The effect of gas temperature
variations with stellar phase could be particularly important for lines
produced in the innermost regions of the envelope. Each layer of the
circumstellar envelope sees the stellar light radiation with a different lag
time (phase). Our results show that this effect must be included in the models.

two points are fixed, the remaining seven must lie on a pinched torus that a
standard moment mapping projects to a circle in R^3. We use this approach to
prove that any SIC set in CP^2 is isometric to a known solution, given by nine
points lying in triples on the equators of the three 2-spheres each defined by
the vanishing of one homogeneous coordinate. We set up a system of equations to
describe hexagons in CP^2 with the property that any two vertices are related
by a cross ratio (transition probability) of 1/4. We then symmetrize the
equations, factor out by the known solutions, and compute a Groebner basis to
show that no SIC sets remain. We do find new configurations of nine points in

in spaces of bandlimited functions. In the first part, signal spaces are
characterized in which the classical sampling series uniformly converge, and we
investigate whether adaptive recovery algorithms can yield uniform convergence
in spaces where non-adaptive sampling series does not. In particular, it is
shown that the investigation of adaptive signal recovery algorithms needs
completely new analytic tools since the methods used for non-adaptive
reconstruction procedures, which are based on the celebrated Banach-Steinhaus
theorem, are not applicable in the adaptive case. The second part analyzes the
approximation of the output of stable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems based
on samples of the input signal, and where the input is assumed to belong to the
Paley-Wiener space of bandlimited functions with absolute integrable Fourier
transform. If the samples are acquired by point evaluations of the input signal
f, then there exist stable LTI systems H such that the approximation process
does not converge to the desired output H(f) even if the oversampling factor is
arbitrarily large. If one allows generalized measurements of the input signal,
then the output of every stable LTI system can be uniformly approximated in
terms of generalized measurements of the input signal. The last section studies
the situation where only the amplitudes of the signal samples are known. It is
shown that one can find specific measurement functionals such that signal
recovery of bandlimited signals from amplitude measurement is possible, with an
overall sampling rate of four times the Nyquist rate.

of the dense molecular clouds known as starless cores. Continuum observations
have not been able to distinguish among the several different hypotheses that
describe the collapse because the predicted density distributions are the
almost the same, as they are for all spherical self-gravitating clouds.
However, the predicted contraction velocities are different enough that the
models can be discriminated by comparing the velocities at large and small
radii. This can be done by observing at least two different molecular line
transitions that are excited at different densities. For example, the spectral
lines of the H2O (110 - 101) and C18O (1-0) have critical densities for
collisional de-excitation that differ by 5 orders of magnitude. We compare
observations of these lines from the contracting starless core L1544 against
the spectra predicted for several different hypothetical models of contraction
including the Larson-Penston flow, the inside-out collapse of the singular
isothermal sphere, the quasi-equilibrium contraction of an unstable
Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and the non-equilibrium collapse of an over-dense
Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Only the model of the unstable quasi-equilibrium
Bonnor-Ebert sphere is able to produce the observed shapes of both spectral
lines. This model allows us to interpret other observations of molecular lines
in L1544 to find that the inward velocities seen in observations of CS(2-1) and
N2H+ are located within the starless core itself, in particular in the region
where the density profile follows an inverse square law. If these conclusions
were to hold in the analysis of other starless cores, this would imply that the
formation of hydrostatic clouds within the turbulent interstellar medium is not
only possible but not exceptional and may be an evolutionary phase in low-mass
star formation.

function by generalizing the classical A-optimal experimental design criterion
using the expected value of the trace of the posterior covariance. We seek a
method that solves the OED problem at a cost (measured in the number of forward
PDE solves) that is independent of both the parameter and sensor dimensions. To
facilitate this, we construct a Gaussian approximation to the posterior at the
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) point, and use the resulting covariance
operator to define the OED objective function. We use randomized trace
estimation to compute the trace of this (implicitly defined) covariance
operator. The resulting OED problem includes as constraints the PDEs
characterizing the MAP point, and the PDEs describing the action of the
covariance operator to vectors. The sparsity of the sensor configurations is
controlled using sparsifying penalty functions. We elaborate our OED method for
the problem of determining the sensor placement to best infer the coefficient
of an elliptic PDE. Adjoint methods are used to compute the gradient of the
PDE-constrained OED objective function. We provide numerical results for
inference of the permeability field in a porous medium flow problem, and
demonstrate that the number of PDE solves required for the evaluation of the

testable correlations between outcomes of measurements of macroscopic positions
are consistent with both the classical and the quantum laws, there is no
conflict between the superposition principle and the existence of measurement
outcomes. (ii) Intrinsically, each fundamental particle is numerically
identical with every other fundamental particle. What presents itself here and
now with these properties and what presents itself there and then with those
properties is one and the same entity, herein called ""Being."" (iii) The
distinction between a classical domain and a quantum domain is essentially a
distinction between the manifested world and its manifestation. By entering
into reflexive spatial relations, Being gives rise to (a) what looks like a
multiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is ignored,
and (b) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial quality of the
relations is reified. (iv) The reason why quantum mechanics is a calculus of
correlations between measurement outcomes is that it concerns the progressive
realization of distinguishable objects and distinguishable regions of space.
(v) The key to the relation between quantum mechanics and experience is that
Being does not simply manifest the world, Being manifests the world to itself.
It is at once the single substance by which the world exists and the ultimate
self or subject for which it exists. The question how we are related to this
ultimate self or subject is discussed.

GPS enabled devices and location-based applications. While spatial
transformation techniques such as location perturbation or generalization have
been studied extensively, most techniques rely on syntactic privacy models
without rigorous privacy guarantee. Many of them only consider static scenarios
or perturb the location at single timestamps without considering temporal
correlations of a moving user's locations, and hence are vulnerable to various
inference attacks. While differential privacy has been accepted as a standard
for privacy protection, applying differential privacy in location based
applications presents new challenges, as the protection needs to be enforced on
the fly for a single user and needs to incorporate temporal correlations
between a user's locations.
  In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to preserve location privacy
with rigorous privacy guarantee. First, we propose a new definition,
""$\delta$-location set"" based differential privacy, to account for the temporal
correlations in location data. Second, we show that the well known
$\ell_1$-norm sensitivity fails to capture the geometric sensitivity in
multidimensional space and propose a new notion, sensitivity hull, based on
which the error of differential privacy is bounded. Third, to obtain the
optimal utility we present a planar isotropic mechanism (PIM) for location
perturbation, which is the first mechanism achieving the lower bound of
differential privacy. Experiments on real-world datasets also demonstrate that
PIM significantly outperforms baseline approaches in data utility.

scores across multiple levels are finally fused to produce the saliency map.
The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we propose a discriminate

with existing heuristic models, our proposed method is able to automatically
integrate high-dimensional regional saliency features and choose discriminative
ones. The other is that by investigating standard generic region properties as

used to describe the mutual interaction of populations of swimming aerobic
bacteria with the surrounding fluid. Up to now, however, global existence
results seem to be available only for certain simplified variants such as
e.g.the two-dimensional analogue, or the associated chemotaxis-Stokes system
obtained on neglecting the nonlinear convective term in the fluid equation. The
present work gives an affirmative answer to the question of global solvability
in the following sense: Under mild assumptions on the initial data, and under
modest structural assumptions on $f$ and $\chi$, inter alia allowing for the
prototypical case when \[ f(s)=s \quad {for all} s\ge 0 \qquad {and} \qquad

the evolution of systems exposed to stochastic shot noise sources, and have

the non-stationary characteristics of Vm fluctuations in response to

framework of Poisson Point Processes transformations to analyse these systems

are then applied to a model of neuronal membranes subject to conductance shot

optical peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of LEDs is individually constrained.
Fixing the average optical power, our scheme is able to achieve much lower
bit-error rate (BER) than conventional schems especially when illumination
color is more ""unbalanced"". When cross-talks exist among the multiple optical
channels, we apply a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based pre-equalizer and
redesign the constellations, and such scheme is shown to outperform
post-equalized schemes based on zero-forcing or linear

spin-orbit coupling on the spin polarization of a two-dimensional repulsive
Fermi gas. By using a variational many-body wavefunction, based on a suitable
spinorial structure, we find that the polarization properties of the system are
indeed controlled by the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive
interaction. In particular, two main effects are found: 1) The Rashba coupling
determines a gradual increase of the degree of polarization beyond the critical
repulsive interaction strength, at variance with conventional 2D Stoner
instability. 2) The critical interaction strength, above which finite
polarization is developed, shows a dependence on the Rashba coupling, i.e. it
is enhanced in case the Rashba coupling exceeds a critical value. A simple
analytic expression for the critical interaction strength is further derived in
the context of our variational formulation, which allows for a straightforward
and insightful analysis of the present problem.

computational geometry. It asks for the minimum number of guards required to
achieve visibility coverage of a given polygon. The AGP is well-known to be
NP-hard even in restricted cases. In this paper, we consider the Art Gallery
Problem with Fading (AGPF): A polygonal region is to be illuminated with light
sources such that every point is illuminated with at least a global threshold,
light intensity decreases over distance, and we seek to minimize the total
energy consumption. Choosing fading exponents of zero, one, and two are
equivalent to the AGP, laser scanner applications, and natural light,
respectively. We present complexity results as well as a negative solvability
result. Still, we propose two practical algorithms for AGPF with fixed light
positions (e.g. vertex guards) independent of the fading exponent, which we
demonstrate to work well in practice. One is based on a discrete approximation,
the other on non-linear programming by means of simplex-partitioning
strategies. The former approach yields a fully polynomial-time approximation
scheme for AGPF with fixed light positions. The latter approach obtains better
results in our experimental evaluation.

  Networks",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study dynamical transportation networks in a framework that includes
extensions of the classical Cell Transmission Model to arbitrary network
topologies. The dynamics are modeled as systems of ordinary differential
equations describing the traffic flow among a finite number of cells
interpreted as links of a directed network. Flows between contiguous cells, in
particular at junctions, are determined by merging and splitting rules within
constraints imposed by the cells' demand and supply functions as well as by the
drivers' turning preferences, while inflows at on-ramps are modeled as
exogenous and possibly time-varying.
  First, we analyze stability properties of dynamical transportation networks.
We associate to the dynamics a state-dependent dual graph whose connectivity
depends on the signs of the derivatives of the inter-cell flows with respect to
the densities. Sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibria and
periodic solutions are then provided in terms of the connectivity of such dual
graph.
  Then, we consider synthesis of control policies that use a combination of
turning preferences, speed limits, and ramp metering, in order to optimize
convex objectives. We first show that, in the general case, the optimal control
synthesis problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, and that the
equilibrium of the controlled network is in free-flow. If the control policies
are restricted to speed limits and ramp metering, then the resulting synthesis
problem is still convex for networks where every node is either a merge or a
diverge junction, and where the dynamics is monotone. These results apply both
to the optimal selection of equilibria and periodic solutions, as well as to
finite-horizon network trajectory optimization.
  Finally, we illustrate our findings through simulations on a road network
inspired by the freeway system in southern Los Angeles.

intermediate step of an on-going disk dispersal process, where planet formation
is probably in progress. Recent millimetre observations of transition disks
reveal radially and azimuthally asymmetric structures, where micron- and
millimetre-sized dust particles may not spatially coexist. These properties can
be the result of particle trapping and grain growth in pressure bumps
originating from the disk interaction with a planetary companion. The multiple
features observed in some transition disks, such as SR 21, suggest the presence
of more than one planet. We study the gas and dust distributions of a disk
hosting two massive planets as function of different disk and dust parameters.
Observational signatures, such as the spectral energy distribution,
sub-millimetre, and polarised images are simulated for the various parameters.
We confirm that planets can lead to particle trapping, although for a disk with
high viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$), the planet should be more
massive than $5 M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and dust fragmentation should occur with low
efficiency ($v_{f}\sim30\rm{m s}^{-1}$). This will lead to a ring-like feature
as observed in transition disks in the millimetre. When trapping occurs, we
find that a smooth distribution of micron sized grains throughout the disk,
sometimes observed in scattered light, can only happen if the combination of
planet mass and turbulence is such that small grains are not fully filtered
out. A high disk viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$) ensures a
replenishment of the cavity in micron-sized dust, while for lower viscosity
($\alpha_{\rm{turb}}=10^{-3}$), the planet mass is constrained to be less than
$5 M_{\rm{Jup}}$. In these cases, the gas distribution is likely to show
low-amplitude azimuthal asymmetries caused by disk eccentricity rather than by
long-lived vortices.

expanding the frontiers of knowledge on exoplanets toward higher stellar
masses, and to constrain star-planet interaction mechanisms. These stars,
however suffer from intrinsic activity that complicates the interpretation of
precise radial velocity measurement and are often avoided in planet searches.
We have, over the last 10 years, monitored about 1000 evolved stars for radial
velocity variations in search for low-mass companions under the Penn State -
Toru\'n Centre for Astronomy Planet Search with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.
Selected prospective candidates that required higher RV precision meassurements
have been followed with HARPS-N at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo.
  Aims. To detect planetary systems around evolved stars, to be able to build
sound statistics on the frequency and intrinsic nature of these systems, and to
deliver in-depth studies of selected planetary systems with evidences of
star-planet interaction processes.
  Methods. We have obtained for TYC 1422-614-1 69 epochs of precise radial
velocity measurements collected over 3651 days with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope,
and 17 epochs of ultra precise HARPS-N data collected over 408 days. We have
complemented these RV data with photometric time-series from the All Sky
Automatic Survey archive.
  Results. We report the discovery of a multiple planetary system around the
evolved K2 giant star TYC 1422-614-1. The system orbiting the 1.15 M$_\odot$
star is composed of a planet with mass m$sin i$=2.5 M$_J$ in a 0.69 AU orbit,
and a planet/brown dwarf with m$sin i$=10 M$_J$ in a 1.37 AU orbit. The

hydrodynamic, non-radiative simulation in combination with a simple abundance
matching approach to determine the ram pressure statistics for bent radio
sources (BRSs). The abundance matching approach allows us to determine the
locations of all galaxies with stellar masses $> 10^{11} MSol$ in the
simulation volume. Assuming ram pressure exceeding a critical value causes bent
morphology, we compute the ratio of all galaxies exceeding the ram pressure
limit (RPEX galaxies) relative to all galaxies in our sample. According to our
model 50% of the RPEX galaxies at $z = 0$ are found in clusters with masses
larger than $10^{14.5}MSol$ the other half resides in lower mass clusters.
Therefore, the appearance of bent tail morphology alone does not put tight
constraints on the host cluster mass. In low mass clusters, $M < 10^{14}MSol$,
RPEX galaxies are confined to the central 500 kpc whereas in clusters of $>
10^{15}Msol$ they can be found at distances up to 1.5Mpc. Only clusters with
masses $> 10^{15}MSol $ are likely to host more than one BRS. Both criteria may
prove useful in the search for distant, high mass clusters.

difficult or impossible to directly measure such correlations among different

amount of organizational information can be posted online by individuals and
spread instantly through Twitter. Such information can be crucial for detecting
organizational correlations. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering
correlations among organizations from Twitter. Mining organizational
correlations is a very challenging task due to the following reasons: a) Data
in Twitter occurs as large volumes of mixed information. The most relevant
information about organizations is often buried. Thus, the organizational
correlations can be scattered in multiple places, represented by different
forms; b) Making use of information from Twitter collectively and judiciously
is difficult because of the multiple representations of organizational
correlations that are extracted. In order to address these issues, we propose
multi-CG (multiple Correlation Graphs based model), an unsupervised framework
that can learn a consensus of correlations among organizations based on
multiple representations extracted from Twitter, which is more accurate and
robust than correlations based on a single representation. Empirical study
shows that the consensus graph extracted from Twitter can capture the
organizational correlations effectively.

version of the model has a single GS phase transition at $\kappa^{cl}=$1/8 in
this window from a phase with 3-sublattice antiferromagnetic (AFM)
120$^{\circ}$ N\'{e}el order for $\kappa < \kappa^{cl}$ to an infinitely
degenerate family of 4-sublattice AFM N\'{e}el phases for $\kappa >
\kappa^{cl}$. This classical accidental degeneracy is lifted by quantum
fluctuations, which favor a 2-sublattice AFM striped phase. For the quantum

spins, with no consequent need for any finite-size scaling analysis of our
results. We perform high-order CCM calculations within a well-controlled
hierarchy of approximations, which we show how to extrapolate to the exact
limit. In this way we find results for the case $\kappa = 0$ of the spin-1/2
model for the GS energy per spin, $E/N=-0.5521(2)J_{1}$, and the GS magnetic
order parameter, $M=0.198(5)$, which are among the best available. For the

quasiclassical AFM states (viz., the 120$^{\circ}$ N\'{e}el state and the

mode splitting exceeding the radiative linewidth can be established (strong
cavity-cavity coupling condition). In realistic and high quality factor
photonic crystal cavity devices, such distance can largely exceed the emission

pair MF approach to the ground state (GS) of dimerized spin 1/2 systems with
anisotropic ferromagnetic-type XY and XYZ couplings in a transverse field,
including chains and arrays with first neighbor and also longer range

Its phase diagram differs significantly from that of the latter, exhibiting
(Sz) parity breaking just in a finite field window if the coupling between
pairs is sufficiently weak, together with a fully dimerized phase below this
window and a partially aligned phase above it. It is then shown that through
symmetry restoration, the approach is able to correctly predict not only the
concurrence of a pair, but also its entanglement with the rest of the chain,
which shows a pronounced peak in the parity breaking window. Perturbative
corrections allow to reproduce more subtle observables like the entanglement
between weakly coupled spins and the low lying energy spectrum. All predictions

there exist axisymmetric structures consisting of $N \geq 2$ bodies; every

the rest of the bodies (may be none) are heaving at the same frequency as

curve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the
next 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni - 56Co
radioactive decay. The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the
position of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of
evidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object
is likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the
9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery
revealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak
features that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying
host. Fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy
revealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift the peak magnitude of the OT
is close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however,
the lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death
hypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal
disruption of a sun-like star by the central super-massive black hole. We argue
that this transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington tidal
disruption events.

Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/797/1/30",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chondrules are millimeter-sized silicate spherules ubiquitous in primitive
meteorites, but whose origin remains mysterious. One of the main proposed
mechanisms for producing them is melting of solids in shock waves in the
gaseous protoplanetary disk. However, evidence is mounting that
chondrule-forming regions were enriched in solids well above solar abundances.
Given the high velocities involved in shock models destructive collisions would
be expected between differently sized grains after passage of the shock front
as a result of differential drag. We investigate the probability and outcome of
collisions of particles behind a 1D shock using analytic methods as well as a
full integration of the coupled mass, momentum, energy and radiation equations.
Destruction of protochondrules seems unavoidable for solid/gas ratios $\epsilon
\gtrsim 0.1$, and possibly even for solar abundances because of ""sandblasting""
by finer dust. A flow with $\epsilon \gtrsim 10$ requires much smaller shock
velocities ($\sim 2$ vs 8 km s$^{-1}$) in order to achieve chondrule-melting
temperatures, and radiation trapping allows slow cooling of the shocked
fragments. Initial destruction would still be extensive; although re-assembly
of mm-sized particles would naturally occur by grain sticking afterward, the
compositional heterogeneity of chondrules may be difficult to reproduce. We
finally note that solids passing through small-scale bow shocks around
few-km-sized planetesimals might experience partial melting and yet escape
fragmentation.

synchronous dynamics of a network is contained in the dynamics of its quotient
networks. DeVille and Lerman have recently shown that the original network and
its quotients are related by graph fibrations and hence their dynamics are
conjugate. This paper demonstrates the importance of self-fibrations of network
graphs. Self-fibrations give rise to symmetries in the dynamics of a network.
We show that every homogeneous network admits a lift with self-fibrations and
that every robust synchrony in this lift is determined by the symmetries of its
dynamics. These symmetries moreover impact the global dynamics of network
systems and can be used to explain and predict generic scenarios for synchrony
breaking. We also discuss networks with interior symmetries and nonhomogeneous

is derived. Model calculations predict binding energies and widths of the quasi
bound state. Another method is to derive the $\eta$ nucleus interaction from
excitation functions of $\eta$ production experiments. The $s$ wave interaction

perspectives: 1) Does the muzzle flash reveal friendly positions to naked eye
observers so as to draw fire from enemy combatants? 2) Can flash signatures be
recognized by electronic surveillance with sufficient accuracy to identify
source firearms? 3) Is the muzzle flash so bright as to diminish the night
vision of friendly forces during a firefight? This paper addresses a fourth
question: Does the muzzle flash of a specific cartridge provide sufficient
duration and intensity of illumination with visible light to allow observers to
positively identify a shooter's face? The experiment used two shooters firing a
total of 20 shots from a 22 LR semi-automatic pistol. Shooters fired in
randomized order, while eight observers (male US military veterans) attempted
to identify the shooter for each trial shot. The firing range was mostly
darkened with only enough ambient light to safely conduct firing tests at the
direction of a range safety officer. There was not enough ambient light to
identify the shooter's face. Observers correctly identified the shooter 54% of
the time and failed to correctly identify the shooter 46% of the time.
Observers were unanimous that there was no hint of any visible illumination on
the shooter's face provided by the muzzle flash. In cases where the shooter was
correctly identified, observers reported using visual cues such as the
sillhouette of the shooters' hair and slight differences in arm positions when
firing the pistol. Other people in the room (including the author) were in
unanimous agreement that there was no illumination of the shooters' faces from

important decision problems are effectively encoded into Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT). In the last decade efficient SMT solvers have been developed
for several theories of practical interest (e.g., linear arithmetic, arrays,
bit-vectors). Surprisingly, little work has been done to extend SMT to deal
with optimization problems; in particular, we are not aware of any previous
work on SMT solvers able to produce solutions which minimize cost functions
over arithmetical variables. This is unfortunate, since some problems of
interest require this functionality.
  In the work described in this paper we start filling this gap. We present and
discuss two general procedures for leveraging SMT to handle the minimization of
linear rational cost functions, combining SMT with standard minimization
techniques. We have implemented the procedures within the MathSAT SMT solver.
Due to the absence of competitors in the AR, FV and SMT domains, we have
experimentally evaluated our implementation against state-of-the-art tools for
the domain of linear generalized disjunctive programming (LGDP), which is
closest in spirit to our domain, on sets of problems which have been previously
proposed as benchmarks for the latter tools. The results show that our tool is
very competitive with, and often outperforms, these tools on these problems,
clearly demonstrating the potential of the approach.

to define and differentiate events. This is either implicit, for example due to
resolution limits, or explicit, in order to filter certain small scale physics
from the supposed true asymptotic events. Thresholding the birth-death process,
however, introduces a scaling region into the event size distribution, which is
characterised by an exponent that is unrelated to the actual asymptote and is
rather an artefact of thresholding. As a result, numerical fits of simulation
data produce a range of exponents, with the true asymptote visible only in the
tail of the distribution. This tail is increasingly difficult to sample as the
threshold is increased. In the present case, the exponents and the spurious
nature of the scaling region can be determined analytically, thus demonstrating
the way in which thresholding conceals the true asymptote. The analysis also
suggests a procedure for detecting the influence of the threshold by means of a
data collapse involving the threshold-imposed scale.

significantly improve our understanding of cosmology from the rapid growth of
cluster masses below z < 0.5. Here we examine the consistency of cluster
catalogues selected from the SDSS by applying two independent gravity-based
methods using all available spectroscopic redshifts from the DR10 release.
First, we detect a gravitational redshift related signal for 20,119 and 13,128
clusters with spectroscopic redshifts contained in the GMBCG and redMaPPer
catalogues, respectively, at a level of $\sim - 10$ km s$^{-1}$. This we show
is consistent with the magnitude expected using the richness-mass relations
provided by the literature and after applying recently clarified relativistic
and flux bias corrections. This signal is also consistent with the richest
clusters in the larger catalogue of Wen et al. (2012), corresponding to
$M_{200m} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,h^{-1}$, however we find
no significant detection of gravitational redshift signal for less riched
clusters, which may be related to bulk motions from substructure and spurious
cluster detections. Second, we find all three catalogues generate
mass-dependent levels of lensing magnification bias, which enhances the mean
redshift of flux-selected background galaxies from the BOSS survey. The
magnitude of this lensing effect is generally consistent with the corresponding
richness-mass relations advocated for the surveys. We conclude that all
catalogues comprise a high proportion of reliable clusters, and that the GMBCG
and redMaPPer cluster finder algorithms favor more relaxed clusters with a
meaningful gravitational redshift signal, as anticipated by the red-sequence
colour selection of the GMBCG and redMaPPer samples.

  spatial-frequency domain for high-order astronomical adaptive-optics systems","Accepted for publication on JOSA-A",,"10.1364/JOSAA.31.002763",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computationally-efficient wave-front reconstruction techniques for
astronomical adaptive optics systems have seen a great development in the past
decade. Algorithms developed in the spatial-frequency (Fourier) domain have
gathered large attention specially for high-contrast imaging systems.
  In this paper we present the Wiener filter (resulting in the maximization of
the Strehl-ratio) and further develop formulae for the anti-aliasing Wiener
filter that optimally takes into account high-order wave-front terms folded
in-band during the sensing (i.e. discrete sampling) process.
  We employ a continuous spatial-frequency representation for the forward
measurement operators and derive the Wiener filter when aliasing is explicitly
taken into account. We further investigate and compare to classical estimates
using least-squares filters the reconstructed wave-front, measurement noise and
aliasing propagation coefficients as a function of the system order. Regarding
high-contrast systems, we provide achievable performance results as a function
of an ensemble of for ward models for the Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor
(using sparse and non-sparse representations) and compute point-spread function
raw intensities.
  We find that for a 32x32 single-conjugated adaptive optics system the
aliasing propagation coefficient is roughly 60% of the least-squares filters
whereas the noise propagation is around 80%. Contrast improvements of factors
of up to 2 are achievable across the field in H-band. For current and next
generation high-contrast imagers, despite better aliasing mitigation,
anti-aliasing Wiener filtering cannot be used as a stand-alone method and must
therefore be used in combination with optical spatial filters deployed before
image formation takes actual place.

the high photon energy regime are studied. The nonlocal dielectric permittivity
of a metal is determined by the quantum plasma effects and is calculated by
applying the Wigner equation in the kinetic theory and taking into account the

investigated in a thin gold film. The spectrum and the damping rate of the
quantum bulk plasmon are obtained for a wide range of energies, and the
electron wave function is analytically calculated in both classical and quantum
limits. It is shown that the quantum bulk plasmons exist with a propagation
length of 1 to 10nm, which strongly depends on the electron energy. The
propagation length is found to be much larger than the propagation length in
the classical regime which is comparable to the atomic radius and the average
inter particle distance. It is found that the spatial localization of the
electron wave function is extended due to the quantum effects. Also, it is
shown that the damping of electromagnetic waves decreases when the energy of
the photon decreases which is opposite to the conclusions obtained from the
classical Drude model. The importance of the quantum effects in the development
of next-generation metamaterials is also discussed.

in 3D where the CoH only exists for high symmetry particles, the CoH always
exists for Brownian motion in 2D. We develop an analytical model based on

regulation strategies, homeostasis allows living cells to control their
internal environment as a means for surviving changing and unfavourable
environments. While many endogenous homeostatic motifs have been studied in
living cells, some other motifs may remain under-explored or even undiscovered.
At the same time, known regulatory motifs have been mostly analyzed at the
deterministic level, and the effect of noise on their regulatory function has
received low attention. Here we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at
the molecular level that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of
biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and design of
robust homeostatic circuits. Using these ideas, we propose a new regulation
motif, which we refer to as {\em antithetic integral feedback, and demonstrate
its effectiveness as a strategy for generically regulating a wide class of
reaction networks. By combining tools from probability and control theory, we
show that the proposed motif preserves the stability of the overall network,
steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point, and
achieves robust perfect adaptation -- all with low prior knowledge of reaction
rates. Moreover, our proposed regulatory motif can be implemented using a very
small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load.
Strikingly, the regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise, leading to enhanced
regulation in scenarios where noise-free implementations result in
dysregulation. Finally, we discuss the possible manifestation of the proposed
antithetic integral feedback motif in endogenous biological circuits and its
realization in synthetic circuits.

with solar flares originating on the visible hemisphere of the Sun and at least
of magnitude M1. Taking into account all flares and CMEs that occurred during
this period, the probability for the occurrence of an SEP event near Earth is
determined. A strong rise of this probability is observed for increasing flare
intensities, more western locations, larger CME speeds and halo CMEs. The
correlations between the proton peak flux and these solar parameters are
derived for a low (>10 MeV) and high (>60 MeV) energy range excluding any flux
enhancement due to the passage of fast interplanetary shocks. The obtained
correlation coefficients are: 0.55+-0.07 (0.63+-0.06) with flare intensity and
0.56+-0.08 (0.40+-0.09) with the CME speed for E>10 MeV (E>60 MeV). For both
energy ranges, the correlations with flare longitude and CME width are very
small or non-existent. Furthermore, the occurrence probabilities, correlation
coefficients and mean peak fluxes are derived in multi-dimensional bins
combining the aforementioned solar parameters. The correlation coefficients are
also determined in different proton energy channels ranging from 5 to 200 MeV.
The results show that the correlation between the proton peak flux and the CME
speed decreases with energy, while the correlation with the flare intensity
shows the opposite behavior. Furthermore, the correlation with the CME speed is
stronger than the correlation with the flare intensity below 15 MeV and becomes
weaker above 20 MeV. Excluding the flux enhancements due to interplanetary
shocks, only a small but not very significant change is observed in the
correlation between the peak flux below 7 MeV and the CME speed.

the role of confinement effects in long ballistic junctions. In the normal
regime, scattering at the two contacts gives rise to two distinct features in
conductance, Fabry-Perot resonances and Fano dips. The latter arise in the
presence of a strong Zeeman field $B$ that removes a spin sector in the leads
(\emph{helical} leads), but not in the central region. Conversely, a helical
central region between non-helical leads exhibits helical gaps of half-quantum
conductance, with superimposed helical Fabry-Perot oscillations. These normal
features translate into distinct subgap states when the leads become
superconducting. In particular, Fabry-Perot resonances within the helical gap
become parity-protected zero-energy states (parity crossings), well below the
critical field $B_c$ at which the superconducting leads become topological. As
a function of Zeeman field or Fermi energy, these zero-modes oscillate around
zero energy, forming characteristic loops, which evolve continuously into
Majorana bound states as $B$ exceeds $B_c$. The relation with the physics of
parity crossings of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states is discussed.

hybrid systems. For two traces, from $[0,T]$ to values in a metric space $O$,
it measures the best match between the traces when allowed continuous bijective
timing distortions. Formally, it computes the infimum, over all timing
distortions, of the maximum of two components: the first component quantifies
the {\em timing discrepancy} of the timing distortion, and the second
quantifies the mismatch (in the metric space $O$) of the values under the
timing distortion. Skorokhod distances appear in various fundamental hybrid
systems analysis concerns: from definitions of hybrid systems semantics and
notions of equivalence, to practical problems such as checking the closeness of
models or the quality of simulations. Despite its popularity and extensive
theoretical use, the \emph{computation} problem for the Skorokhod distance
between two finite sampled-time hybrid traces has remained open.
  We address in this work the problem of computing the Skorokhod distance
between two polygonal traces (these traces arise when sampled-time traces are
completed by linear interpolation between sample points). We provide the first
algorithm to compute the exact Skorokhod distance when trace values are in
$\reals^n$ for the $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_{\infty}$ norms. Our algorithm, based
on a reduction to Frechet distances, is fully polynomial-time, and incorporates
novel polynomial-time procedures for a set of geometric primitives in
$\reals^n$ over the three norms.

sampling of the oscillations. The targets were chosen on the basis of
detectable rotation in the initial Kepler results, biasing towards youth.The
analysis reveals no oscillations attributable to pulsations at a detection
limit of several parts per million, showing that either the driving mechanisms
are not efficient in developing the oscillations to observable amplitudes, or
that if pulsations are driven, the amplitudes are very low. The size of the
sample, and the possibility that the instability strip is not pure, allowing
the coexistence of pulsators and non-pulsators, prevent us from deriving
definite conclusions. Inmediate plans include more M dwarfs photometric

by a distributed set of miners and transaction are broadcasted via a
peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin provides some level of anonymity (or rather
pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to have any number of random-looking
Bitcoin addresses, recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather
low. This encourages users to connect to the Bitcoin network through
anonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for
popular mobile SPV clients. In this paper we show that combining Tor and
Bitcoin creates an attack vector for the deterministic and stealthy
man-in-the-middle attacks. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of
information flows between all users who chose to use Bitcoin over Tor. In
particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of
pseudonyms used, control which Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to
the user and can \ delay or discard user's transactions and blocks. In
collusion with a powerful miner double-spending attacks become possible and a
totally virtual Bitcoin reality can be created for such set of users. Moreover,
we show how an attacker can fingerprint users and then recognize them and learn
their IP address when they decide to connect to the Bitcoin network directly.

membrane potentials of finite system of neurons in the absence of external
stimuli. The values of the membrane potentials evolve under the effect of {\it
chemical synapses}, {\it electrical synapses} and a \textit{leak current}. The
evolution of the process can be informally described as follows. Each neuron
spikes randomly following a point process with rate depending on its membrane
potential. When a neuron spikes, its membrane potential is immediately reset to
a resting value. Simultaneously, the membrane potential of the neurons which
are influenced by it receive an additional positive value. Furthermore, between
consecutive spikes, the system follows a deterministic motion due both to
electrical synapses and the leak current. Electrical synapses push the system
towards its average potential, while the leak current attracts the membrane
potential of each neuron to the resting value.
  We show that in the absence leakage the process converges exponentially fast
to an unique invariant measure, whenever the initial configuration is non null.
More interesting, when leakage is present, we proved the system stops spiking
after a finite amount of time almost surely. This implies that the unique
invariant measure is supported only by the null configuration.

extension to matrix factorization by incorporating auxiliary features into the
model. Unfortunately, making those algorithms scale to real world problems is
challenging, and simple parallelization strategies fail due to the complex
cross talking patterns between sub-tasks. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge with a novel parallel and efficient algorithm for feature-based

handle hundreds of millions of instances and features on a single machine. The
key recipe of this algorithm is an iterative relaxation of the objective to
facilitate parallel updates of parameters, with guaranteed convergence on

that the proposed method is effective on a wide range of matching problems,

family of technical standards based on IEEE 802.16 standard that defines the
high speed connection through radio waves unlike DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
or other wired technology. It can provide coverage to remote rural areas of
several kilometers in radius, it's an adequate response to some rural or
inaccessible areas. WiMAX can provide point-to-point (P2P) and
point-to-multipoint (PMP) modes. In parallel, it was observed that, unlike the
traditional assessment methods for quality, nowadays, current research focuses
on the user perceived quality, the existing scheduling approaches take into
account the quality of service (QoS) and many technical parameters, but does
not take into account the quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we
present a scheduling algorithm to provide QoE in WiMAX network under Manhattan
Mobility. A new approach is proposed, particularly for the Best Effort (BE)
service class WiMAX, in this approach, if a packet loss occurs on a link
connection, the system then reduces the transmission rate of this connection to
obtain its minimum allowable transmission rate. The NS-2 simulation results
show that the QoE provided to users is enhanced in terms of throughput, jitter,
packet loss rate and delay.

Academy of Sciences of China to explore various possible mission options to
detect gravitational waves in space alternative to that of the eLISA/LISA
mission concept. Based on the relative merits assigned to science and
technological viability, a few representative mission options descoped from the
ALIA mission are considered. A semi-analytic Monte Carlo simulation is carried
out to understand the cosmic black hole merger histories starting from
intermediate mass black holes at high redshift as well as the possible
scientific merits of the mission options considered in probing the light seed
black holes and their coevolution with galaxies in early Universe. The study
indicates that, by choosing the armlength of the interferometer to be three
million kilometers and shifting the sensitivity floor to around one-hundredth
Hz, together with a very moderate improvement on the position noise budget,
there are certain mission options capable of exploring light seed, intermediate
mass black hole binaries at high redshift that are not readily accessible to
eLISA/LISA, and yet the technological requirements seem to within reach in the
next few decades for China.

Fokker-Planck equation in a similar way to that of Chandrasekhar (Rev. Modern
Phys., 1943), deriving a formula for the particle deposition velocity to a
surface as a function of the particle response time. For very small particle
response times, the particle deposition velocity reduces to that obtained using
a quasi-steady solution of Smoluchowski's equation and for very large particle
response times, the deposition velocity corresponds to that based on the
transition state method (E. Wigner, Trans. Faraday Soc., 1938).

same vertex set $V$ is defined as the ratio $$
  \phi(G,H) = \min_{S\subseteq V} \frac{cap_G(S,\bar{S})}{ cap_H(S,\bar{S})},
$$ where $cap_G(S,\bar{S})$ is the total weight of the edges crossing from $S$
to $\bar{S}=V-S$. We show that the minimum generalized eigenvalue
$\lambda(L_G,L_H)$ of the pair of Laplacians $L_G$ and $L_H$ satisfies $$
  \lambda(L_G,L_H) \geq \phi(G,H) \phi(G)/8, $$ where $\phi(G)$ is the usual
conductance of $G$. A generalized cut that meets this bound can be obtained
from the generalized eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda(L_G,L_H)$. The
inequality complements a recent proof that $\phi(G)$ cannot be replaced by
$\Theta(\phi(G,H))$ in the above inequality, unless the Unique Games Conjecture
is false.
