time coverage due to gaps. The presence of periodic gaps may generate spurious
peaks in the power spectrum that limit the analysis of the data. Various
methods have been developed to deal with gaps in time series data. However, it
is still important to improve these methods to be able to extract all the
possible information contained in the data. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to handle the problem, the so-called inpainting method. This
technique, based on a sparsity prior, enables to judiciously fill-in the gaps
in the data, preserving the asteroseismic signal, as far as possible. The
impact of the observational window function is reduced and the interpretation
of the power spectrum is simplified. This method is applied both on ground and
space-based data. It appears that the inpainting technique improves the
oscillation modes detection and estimation. Additionally, it can be used to
study very long time series of many stars because its computation is very fast.
For a time series of 50 days of CoRoT-like data, it allows a speed-up factor of
1000, if compared to methods of the same accuracy.

analysis, it is important to approximate a given tensor by a tensor that is
sparsely representable. For matrices, i.e. 2-tensors, such a representation can
be obtained via the singular value decomposition, which allows to compute best
rank k-approximations. For very big matrices a low rank approximation using SVD
is not computationally feasible. In this case different approximations are
available. It seems that variants of CUR decomposition are most suitable. For
d-mode tensors T with d>2, many generalizations of the singular value
decomposition have been proposed to obtain low tensor rank decompositions. The
most appropriate approximation seems to be best (r_1,...,r_d)-approximation,
which maximizes the l_2 norm of the projection of T on a tensor product of
subspaces U_1,...,U_d, where U_i is an r_i-dimensional subspace. One of the
most common method is the alternating maximization method (AMM). It is obtained
by maximizing on one subspace U_i, while keeping all other fixed, and
alternating the procedure repeatedly for i=1,...,d. Usually, AMM will converge
to a local best approximation. This approximation is a fixed point of a
corresponding map on Grassmannians. We suggest a Newton method for finding the
corresponding fixed point. We also discuss variants of CUR-approximation method
for tensors. The first part of the paper is a survey on low rank approximation
of tensors. The second new part of this paper is a new Newton method for best

wavelengths, especially by the Herschel Space Observatory, are analysed with
polytropic models in cylindrical symmetry. The observed radial density profiles
are well reproduced by negative-index cylindrical polytropes with polytropic
exponent $1/3\lesssim \gamma_{\rm p} \lesssim 2/3$ (polytropic index
$-3\lesssim n \lesssim -3/2$), indicating either external heating or
non-thermal pressure components. However, the former possibility requires
unrealistically high gas temperatures at the filament's surface and is
therefore very unlikely. Non-thermal support, perhaps resulting from a
superposition of small-amplitude Alfv\'en waves (corresponding to $\gamma_{\rm
p}=1/2$), is a more realistic possibility, at least for the most massive
filaments. If the velocity dispersion scales as the square root of the density
(or column density) on the filament's axis, as suggested by observations, then
polytropic models are characterised by a uniform width. The mass per unit
length of pressure-bounded cylindrical polytropes depends on the conditions at
the boundary and is not limited as in the isothermal case. However, polytropic
filaments can remain stable to radial collapse for values of the
axis-to-surface density contrast as large as the values observed only if they
are supported by a non-isentropic pressure component.

magnetisation of the cloud. We derive scale-free solutions appropriate to
describe the properties of the envelopes of filaments at radii larger than the
flat-density region. In these solutions, the polytropic exponent determines the
radial profiles of the density and the magnetic field. The latter decreases
with radius less steeply than the density, and field lines are helices twisted
over cylindrical surfaces. A soft equation of state supports magnetic
configurations that preferentially compress and confine the filament, whereas
in the isothermal limit the field provides support. For each value of the
polytropic exponent, the Lorentz force is directed outward or inward depending
on whether the pitch angle is below or above some critical value which is a
function of the polytropic exponent only.

hole burning methods reveal uniform decoherence properties and the possibility
to produce full transparency for persistent spectral holes across the entire 56

decoherence is well described by elastic Raman scattering of phonons with an
additional weaker component that may arise from a low density of glass-like
dynamic disorder modes (two-level systems). Analysis of the observed behavior
suggests that an optical coherence lifetime approaching one millisecond may be
possible in this system at temperatures below 1 K for crystals grown with

rather occurs at the one-loop level in association with an extra jet.
Signatures like t anti-t plus jets readily emerge as a result of the subsequent
decay of the resonance into a pair of top quarks. Without the additional jet,
the resonance can still be produced off-shell, which gives a sizeable
contribution at low masses. The lower top quark multiplicity of the loop
induced resonance production facilitates its reconstruction as compared to the
tree level production that gives rise to more exotic signatures involving three
or even four top quarks in the final state. For all these cases, we discuss the
constraints on the resonance production stemming from recent experimental
measurements in the top quark sector. We find that the top-philic vector
resonance remains largely unconstrained for the majority of the parameter

inflation broadly fall into two classes, depending upon the early and late time
behavior of the field potential. In the first type we include models in which
the field potential is steep for most of the history of the Universe but turn
shallow at late times, whereas in the second type the potential is shallow at
early times followed by a steep behavior thereafter. In models of the first
category inflation can be realized by invoking high-energy brane-induced
damping, which is needed to facilitate slow roll along a steep potential. In
models of second type one may invoke a non-minimal coupling of the scalar field
with massive neutrino matter, which might induce a minimum in the potential at
late times as neutrinos turn non-relativistic. In this category we review a
class of models with non-canonical kinetic term in the Lagrangian, which can
comply with recent B mode polarization measurements. The scenario under
consideration is distinguished by the presence of a kinetic phase, which
precedes the radiative regime, giving rise to blue spectrum of gravity waves

labeling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem. It consists in
finding a labeling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with

optimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither
results in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result.

proposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new
heuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem,
by following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm:
the first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which
follow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the
Jaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the
merging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a
partial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the
cyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in
terms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs
whose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where
the consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to
weighted graphs is also proposed.

of the ChoiceGAPs describe utilities of players for acting in various ways
based on utilities of their neighbors in those and other situations. We define
multi-player Nash equilibrium for such programs - but because they require some
conditions that are hard to satisfy in the real world, we introduce a new
model-theoretic concept of strong equilibrium. We show that stable equilibria
can capture all Nash equilibria. We prove a host of complexity (intractability)
results for checking existence of strong equilibria (as well as related
counting complexity results), together with algorithms to find them. We then
identify a class of ChoiceGAPs for which stable equilibria can be polynomially
computed. We develop algorithms for computing these equilibria under various
restrictions. We come up with the important concept of an estimation query
which can compute quantities w.r.t. a given strong equilibrium, and approximate
ranges of values (answers) across the space of strong equilibria. Even though
we show that computing range answers to estimation queries exactly is
intractable, we are able to identify classes of estimation queries that can be
answered in polynomial time. We report on experiments we conducted with a

circumstellar bubbles from the MIPSGAL 24 {\mu}m Galactic Plane Survey. We find
that this set of MIPSGAL bubbles (MBs) is divided into two categories, and that
this distinction correlates with the morphologies of the MBs in the mid- IR.
The four MBs with central sources in the mid-IR exhibit dust-rich, low
excitation spectra, and their 24 {\mu}m emission is accounted for by the dust
continuum. The seven MBs without central sources in the mid-IR have spectra
dominated by high excitation gas lines (e.g., [O IV] 26.0 {\mu}m, [Ne V] 14.3
and 24.3 {\mu}m, [Ne III] 15.5 {\mu}m), and the [O IV] line accounts for 50 to
almost 100% of the 24 {\mu}m emission in five of them. In the dust-poor MBs,
the [Ne V] and [Ne III] line ratios correspond to high excitation conditions.
Based on comparisons with published IRS spectra, we suggest that the dust-poor
MBs are highly excited planetary nebulae with peculiar white dwarfs (e.g.,
[WR], novae) at their centers. The central stars of the four dust-rich MBs are
all massive star candidates. Dust temperatures range from 40 to 100 K in the
outer shells. We constrain the extinction along the lines of sight from the IRS
spectra. We then derive distance, dust masses, and dust production rate
estimates for these objects. These estimates are all consistent with the nature
of the central stars. We summarize the identifications of MBs made to date and
discuss the correlation between their mid-IR morphologies and natures.
Candidate Be/B[e]/LBV and WR stars are mainly ""rings"" with mid-IR central
sources, whereas PNe are mostly ""disks"" without mid-IR central sources.
Therefore we expect that most of the 300 remaining unidentified MBs will be
classified as PNe.

near-optimal response time can be coupled with strong fairness guarantees.
Despite this, such systems are very rarely implemented in practical settings,
because they require knowing a priori the amount of work needed to complete
jobs: this assumption is very difficult to satisfy in concrete systems. It is
definitely more likely to inform the system with an estimate of the job sizes,
but existing studies point to somewhat pessimistic results if existing
scheduler policies are used based on imprecise job size estimations. We take
the goal of designing scheduling policies that are explicitly designed to deal
with inexact job sizes: first, we show that existing size-based schedulers can
have bad performance with inexact job size information when job sizes are
heavily skewed; we show that this issue, and the pessimistic results shown in
the literature, are due to problematic behavior when large jobs are
underestimated. Once the problem is identified, it is possible to amend
existing size-based schedulers to solve the issue. We generalize FSP -- a fair
and efficient size-based scheduling policy -- in order to solve the problem
highlighted above; in addition, our solution deals with different job weights
(that can be assigned to a job independently from its size). We provide an
efficient implementation of the resulting protocol, which we call Practical
Size-Based Scheduler (PSBS). Through simulations evaluated on synthetic and
real workloads, we show that PSBS has near-optimal performance in a large
variety of cases with inaccurate size information, that it performs fairly and
it handles correctly job weights. We believe that this work shows that PSBS is
indeed pratical, and we maintain that it could inspire the design of schedulers

estimation by using modern sparse-low-rank decompositions, i.e., Robust
PCA-like methods, to impose global rank constraints. Robust decompositions have
shown to be good at splitting a corrupted matrix into an uncorrupted low-rank
matrix and a sparse matrix, containing outliers. However, this process only
works when matrices have relatively low rank with respect to their ambient
space, a property not met in motion estimation problems. As a solution, we
propose to exploit the partial information present in the decomposition to
decide which matches are outliers. We provide evidences showing that even when
it is not possible to recover an uncorrupted low-rank matrix, the resulting
information can be exploited for outlier detection. To this end we propose the
Robust Decomposition with Constrained Rank (RD-CR), a proximal gradient based
method that enforces the rank constraints inherent to motion estimation. We
also present a general framework to perform robust estimation for stereo Visual

Here we explore the alternative possibility that the central compact body is a

considered in the previous study. Our analysis indicates that for all but one
of the considered models there exists at least one interval of a > 1 that is
compatible with constraints given by the ranges of the central compact object
mass independently estimated for the three sources. For most of the models, the
inferred values of a are several times higher than the extreme Kerr black hole
value a = 1. These values may be too high since the spin of superspinars is
often assumed to rapidly decrease due to accretion when a >> 1. In this
context, we conclude that only the epicyclic and the Keplerian resonance model
provides estimates that are compatible with the expectation of just a small

the momentum and winding charges of two large extra dimensions to the R-charges

heavy string thresholds that contribute to the running of the gauge couplings.
In the general case, these contributions are proportional to the volume of the
two large dimensions and invalidate the perturbative string expansion. The
problem is evaded if the susy breaking sectors arise as a spontaneously broken
phase of N=4 -> N=2 -> N=0 supersymmetry, provided that N=4 supersymmetry is
restored on the boundary of the moduli space. We discuss the mechanism in the
case of Z_2 x Z_2 orbifolds, which requires that the twisted sector that
contains the large extra dimensions has no fixed points. We analyse the full
string partition function and show that the twisted sectors distribute
themselves in non-aligned N=2 orbits, hence preserving the solution to the
string decompactification problem. Remarkably, we find that the contribution to

requires a particular attention from the international health authorities due

situation, there is a need of development of decision tools, such as
mathematical models, to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in
important factors to eradicate Ebola. In this work, we propose a novel
deterministic spatial-temporal model, called Be-CoDiS (Between-Countries
Disease Spread), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between
countries. The main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the
consideration of the movement of people between countries, the control measure
effects and the use of time dependent coefficients adapted to each country.
First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model
and explain how its parameters and inputs are obtained. Then, in order to
validate our approach, we consider two numerical experiments regarding the
2014-15 Ebola epidemic. The first one studies the ability of the model in
predicting the EVD evolution between countries starting from the index cases in
Guinea in December 2013. The second one consists of forecasting the evolution
of the epidemic by using some recent data. The results obtained with Be-CoDiS
are compared to real data and other models outputs found in the literature.
Finally, a brief parameter sensitivity analysis is done. A free Matlab version

despite having strong H$_2$ line emission and $2\times 10^9$M$_{\odot}$ of
molecular gas. The [CII] line is twice as strong as the 0-0S(1) 17$\mu$m H$_2$
line, and both lines are much in excess what is expected from UV heating. We
combine infrared Spitzer and Herschel data with gas and dust modeling to infer
the gas physical conditions. The [CII] line traces 30 to 50% of the molecular
gas mass, which is warm (70<T<100K) and at moderate densities
$700<n_{H}<3000$cm$^{-3}$. The [CII] line is broad with a blue-shifted wing,
and likely to be shaped by a combination of rotation, outflowing gas, and
turbulence. It matches the near-infrared H$_2$ and the Na D optical absorption
lines. If the wing is interpreted as an outflow, the mass loss rate would be
larger than 20M$_{\odot}$/yr, and the depletion timescale shorter than the
orbital timescale ($10^8$yr). These outflow rates may be over-estimated because
the stochastic injection of turbulence on galactic scales can contribute to the
skewness of the line profile and mimic outflowing gas. We argue that the
dissipation of turbulence is the main heating process of this gas. Cosmic rays
can also contribute to the heating but they require an average gas density
larger than the observational constraints. We show that strong turbulent
support maintains a high gas vertical scale height (0.3-4kpc) in the disk and
can inhibit the formation of gravitationally-bound structures at all scales,
offering a natural explanation for the weakness of star formation in 3C 326N.
To conclude, the bright [CII] line indicates that strong AGN jet-driven
turbulence may play a key role in enhancing the amount of molecular gas
(positive feedback) but yet can prevent star formation on galactic scales
(negative feedback).

We find that the photoelectric heating efficiency of the gas, traced via the
([CII]+[OII]63)/$F_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ ratio, varies from a mean of
3.5$\times$10$^{-3}$ in the centre up to 8$\times$10$^{-3}$ at increasing

([CII]+[OI]63)/$F_{\mathrm{PAH}}$ with increasing FIR colour suggests that
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may become important for gas heating in
the central regions. We compare the observed flux of the FIR cooling lines and
total IR emission with the predicted flux from a PDR model to determine the gas
density, surface temperature and the strength of the incident far-ultraviolet
(FUV) radiation field, $G_{0}$. Resolving details on physical scales of ~0.6
kpc, a pixel-by-pixel analysis reveals that the majority of the PDRs in NGC
891's disc have hydrogen densities of 1 < log ($n$/cm$^{-3}$) < 3.5
experiencing an incident FUV radiation field with strengths of 1.7 < log $G_0$
< 3. Although these values we derive for most of the disc are consistent with
the gas properties found in PDRs in the spiral arms and inter-arm regions of
M51, observed radial trends in $n$ and $G_0$ are shown to be sensitive to
varying optical thickness in the lines, demonstrating the importance of
accurately accounting for optical depth effects when interpreting observations
of high inclination systems. With an empirical relationship between the MIPS 24
$\mu$m and [NII] 205 $\mu$m emission, we estimate an enhancement of the FUV
radiation field strength in the far north-eastern side of the disc.

multi-phase origins of [CII], one might expect this relation to break down at
small scales. We investigate the origins of [CII] emission by examining high
spatial resolution observations of [CII] in M31, with the Survey of Lines in
M31 (SLIM). We present five ~700x700 pc (3""x3"") Fields mapping the [CII]
emission, Halpha emission, combined with ancillary infrared (IR) data. We
spatially separate star-forming regions from diffuse gas and dust emission on
~50 pc scales. We find that the [CII] - SFR correlation holds even at these
scales, although the relation typically has a flatter slope than found at
larger (~kpc) scales. While the Halpha emission in M31 is concentrated in the
SFR regions, we find that a significant amount (~20-90%) of the [CII] emission
comes from outside star-forming regions, and that the total IR (TIR) emission
has the highest diffuse fraction of all SFR tracers. We find a weak correlation
of the [CII]/TIR to dust color in each Field, and find a large scale trend of
increasing [CII]/TIR with galactocentric radius. The differences in the
relative diffuse fractions of [CII], Halpha and IR tracers are likely caused by
a combination of energetic photon leakage from HII regions and heating by the
diffuse radiation field arising from older (B-star) stellar populations.
However, we find that by averaging our measurements over ~kpc scales, these
effects are minimized, and the relation between [CII] and SFR found in other
nearby galaxy studies is retrieved.

tidal effects of a dark matter halo on the shape and orientation of its
substructure. Although tides are often assumed to enhance asphericity and to
stretch subhaloes tangentially, these effects are short lived: as in earlier
work, we find that subhaloes affected by tides become substantially more
spherical and show a strong radial alignment toward the centre of the host
halo. These results, combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,
may be used to assess the effect of Galactic tides on the observed population
of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
If, as the model suggests, the relatively low dark matter content of luminous
dSphs such as Fornax and Leo I is due to tidal stripping, then their
gravitational potential must be substantially more spherical than that of more
heavily dark matter-dominated systems such as Draco or Carina. The model also
predicts a tidally-induced statistical excess of satellites whose major axis
aligns with the direction to the central galaxy. We find tantalizing evidence
of this in the M31 satellite population, which suggests that tides may have
played an important role in its evolution.

some limits on the quantity and nature of accreted dwarf galaxy contributions
to the Milky Way stellar halo by typically utilizing stellar phase-space
information to identify the most recent halo accretion events. In this study we
tested the prospects of using 2-D chemical abundance ratio distributions
(CARDs) found in stars of the stellar halo to determine its formation history.
First, we used simulated data from eleven ""MW-like"" halos to generate satellite
template sets of 2-D CARDs of accreted dwarf satellites which are comprised of
accreted dwarfs from various mass regimes and epochs of accretion. Next, we
randomly drew samples of $\sim10^{3-4}$ mock observations of stellar chemical
abundance ratios ([$\alpha$/Fe], [Fe/H]) from those eleven halos to generate
samples of the underlying densities for our CARDs to be compared to our
templates in our analysis. Finally, we used the expectation-maximization
algorithm to derive accretion histories in relation to the satellite template
set (STS) used and the sample size. For certain STS used we typically can
identify the relative mass contributions of all accreted satellites to within a
factor of 2. We also find that this method is particularly sensitive to older
accretion events involving low-luminous dwarfs e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs -
precisely those events that are too ancient to be seen by phase-space studies
of stars and too faint to be seen by high-z studies of the early Universe.
Since our results only exploit two chemical dimensions and near-future surveys
promise to provide $\sim6-9$ dimensions, we conclude that these new
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys of the stellar halo will allow us to
recover its accretion history - and the luminosity function of infalling dwarf
galaxies - across cosmic time.

optoelectronic applications. In the work that follows, we calculate the one-
and two-photon absorption coefficients for degenerate interband absorption in a
graphene bilayer hosting an asymmetry gap and adjustable chemical
potential--all at finite temperature. Our analysis is comprehensive,
characterizing one- and two-photon absorptive behavior over wide ranges of
photon energy, gap, chemical potential, and thermal broadening. The two-photon
absorption coefficient for bilayer graphene displays a rich structure as a
function of photon energy and band gap due to the existence of multiple
absorption pathways and the nontrivial dispersion of the low energy bands. This
systematic work will prove integral to the design of bilayer-graphene-based
nonlinear optical devices.

that whenever stars form, central density cusps are likely to be erased. Gas

core with central logarithmic density slope gamma=0 before stellar feedback

period, G+M-type detached double-lined eclipsing binary V530 Ori, an important
new benchmark system for testing stellar evolution models for low-mass stars.
We determine accurate masses and radii for the components with errors of 0.7%
and 1.3%, as follows: M(A) = 1.0038 +/- 0.0066 M(sun), M(B) = 0.5955 +/- 0.0022
M(sun), R(A) = 0.980 +/- 0.013 R(sun), and R(B) = 0.5873 +/- 0.0067 R(sun). The
effective temperatures are 5890 +/- 100 K (G1V) and 3880 +/- 120 K (M1V),
respectively. A detailed chemical analysis probing more than 20 elements in the
primary spectrum shows the system to have a slightly subsolar abundance, with
[Fe/H] = -0.12 +/- 0.08. A comparison with theory reveals that standard models
underpredict the radius and overpredict the temperature of the secondary, as
has been found previously for other M dwarfs. On the other hand, models from
the Dartmouth series incorporating magnetic fields are able to match the
observations of the secondary star at the same age as the primary (3 Gyr) with
a surface field strength of 2.1 +/- 0.4 kG when using a rotational dynamo
prescription, or 1.3 +/- 0.4 kG with a turbulent dynamo approach, not far from
our empirical estimate for this star of 0.83 +/- 0.65 kG. The observations are
most consistent with magnetic fields playing only a small role in changing the
global properties of the primary. The V530 Ori system thus provides an
important demonstration that recent advances in modeling appear to be on the
right track to explain the long-standing problem of radius inflation and
temperature suppression in low-mass stars.

This series of observations presents the first long-term monitoring of this
enigmatic system in the extremely hard X-ray band between 15-40 keV. During
most of the orbit, the 15-25 keV emission varied similarly to the 2-10 keV
emission, indicating an origin in the hard energy tail of the kT ~4 keV
wind-wind collision (WWC) plasma. However, the 15-25 keV emission declined only
by a factor of 3 around periastron when the 2-10 keV emission dropped by two
orders of magnitude due probably to an eclipse of the WWC plasma. The observed
minimum in the 15-25 keV emission occurred after the 2-10 keV flux had already
recovered by a factor of ~3. This may mean that the WWC activity was strong,
but hidden behind the thick primary stellar wind during the eclipse. The 25-40
keV flux was rather constant through the orbital cycle, at the level measured
with INTEGRAL in 2004. This result may suggest a connection of this flux
component to the gamma-ray source detected in this field. The Helium-like Fe
Kalpha line complex at ~6.7 keV became strongly distorted toward periastron as
seen in the previous cycle. The 5-9 keV spectra can be reproduced well with a
two-component spectral model, which includes plasma in collision equilibrium
(CE) and a plasma in non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) with tau ~1e11 cm-3 s-1.

the effects of recombination within the ionized gas. We find that weak D-type
IFs always have the post-IF magnetosonic Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm M2} \leq
1$. For such fronts, magnetic fields increase the maximum propagation speed of
the IFs, while reducing the expansion factor $\alpha$ by a factor of
$1+1/(2\beta_1)$ compared to the unmagnetized case, with $\beta_1$ denoting the
plasma beta in the pre-IF region. IFs become unstable to distortional
perturbations due to gas expansion across the fronts, exactly analogous to the
Darrieus-Landau instability of ablation fronts in terrestrial flames. The
growth rate of the IF instability is proportional linearly to the perturbation
wavenumber as well as the upstream flow speed, and approximately to
$\alpha^{1/2}$. The IF instability is stabilized by gas compressibility and
becomes completely quenched when the front is D-critical. The instability is
also stabilized by magnetic pressure when the perturbations propagate in the
direction perpendicular to the fields. When the perturbations propagate in the
direction parallel to the fields, on the other hand, it is magnetic tension
that reduces the growth rate, completely suppressing the instability when
$\mathcal{M}_{\rm M2}^2 < 2/(\beta_1 - 1)$. When the front experiences an

qualitative resistance, since it exerts less selective pressure on the
pathogens. However, the process of progressive pathogen adaptation to
quantitative resistance is poorly understood, which makes it difficult to
predict its durability or to derive principles for its sustainable deployment.
Here, we study the dynamics of pathogen adaptation in response to quantitative
plant resistance affecting pathogen reproduction rate and its carrying
capacity. We developed a stochastic model for the continuous evolution of a
pathogen population within a quantitatively resistant host. We assumed that
pathogen can adapt to a host by the progressive restoration of reproduction
rate or of carrying capacity, or of both. Our model suggests that a combination
of QTLs affecting distinct pathogen traits was more durable if the evolution of
repressed traits was antagonistic. Otherwise, quantitative resistance that
depressed only pathogen reproduction was more durable. In order to decelerate
the progressive pathogen adaptation, QTLs that decrease the pathogen's ability
to extend must be combined with QTLs that decrease the spore production per
lesion or the infection efficiency or that increase the latent period. Our
theoretical framework can help breeders to develop principles for sustainable
deployment of quantitative trait loci..

ion and electron scales is still under debate. Using the Cluster/STAFF
instrument, we make a survey of the power spectral density and of the
polarization of these fluctuations at frequencies $f\in[1,400]$ Hz, during five
years (2001-2005), when Cluster was in the free solar wind. In $\sim 10\%$ of
the selected data, we observe narrow-band, right-handed, circularly polarized
fluctuations, with wave vectors quasi-parallel to the mean magnetic field,
superimposed on the spectrum of the permanent background turbulence. We
interpret these coherent fluctuations as whistler mode waves. The life time of
these waves varies between a few seconds and several hours. Here we present,
for the first time, an analysis of long-lived whistler waves, i.e. lasting more
than five minutes. We find several necessary (but not sufficient) conditions
for the observation of whistler waves, mainly a low level of the background
turbulence, a slow wind, a relatively large electron heat flux and a low
electron collision frequency. When the electron parallel beta factor
$\beta_{e\parallel}$ is larger than 3, the whistler waves are seen along the
heat flux threshold of the whistler heat flux instability. The presence of such
whistler waves confirms that the whistler heat flux instability contributes to
the regulation of the solar wind heat flux, at least for $\beta_{e\parallel}
\ge$ 3, in the slow wind, at 1 AU.

supergravity theories is used to study the anomaly structure of supergravity
and the cancellation of field theory anomalies under a $U(1)$ gauge
transformation and under the T-duality group of modular transformations in
effective supergravity theories with three K\""ahler moduli $T^i$ obtained from
orbifold compactification of the weakly coupled heterotic string. This
procedure requires constraints on the chiral matter representations of the
gauge group that are consistent with known results from orbifold
compactifications. Pauli-Villars regulator fields allow for the cancellation of
all quadratic and logarithmic divergences, as well as most linear divergences.
If all linear divergences were canceled, the theory would be anomaly free, with
noninvariance of the action arising only from Pauli-Villars masses. However
there are linear divergences associated with nonrenormalizable
gravitino/gaugino interactions that cannot be canceled by PV fields. The
resulting chiral anomaly forms a supermultiplet with the corresponding
conformal anomaly, provided the ultraviolet cut-off has the appropriate field
dependence, in which case total derivative terms, such as Gauss-Bonnet, do not
drop out from the effective action. The anomalies can be partially canceled by
the four-dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, but additional
counterterms, and/or a more elaborate set of Pauli-Villars fields and
couplings, are needed to cancel the full anomaly, including D-term
contributions to the conformal anomaly that are nonlinear in the parameters of
the anomalous transformations.

implantation of high-energy protons into an elevated-temperature silicon

obtained that the radiation-enhanced diffusion occurs by means of formation,
migration, and dissociation of ""impurity atom -- silicon self-interstitial""
pairs being in a local thermodynamic equilibrium with substitutionally
dissolved impurity atoms and nonequilibrium point defects generated due to
external irradiation. The resulting value of the average migration length of
nonequilibrium silicon self-interstitials decreases from 0.19 micrometer for
proton energy of 140 keV to 0.09 and 0.08 micrometer for energies of 110 and 80
keV, respectively. The decrease of the average migration length with the proton
energy can be due to the interaction of silicon self-interstitials with the
vacancies generated at the surface or with the defects formed in the phosphorus
implanted region. Based on the pair diffusion mechanism, a theoretical
investigation of the form of impurity profiles that can be created in thin
silicon layers due to the radiation-enhanced diffusion was carried out. It is
shown that depletion of the uniformly doped silicon layer occurs during plasma
treatment except for the silicon -- insulator interface where a narrow region
with a high impurity concentration is formed. The results of calculations give
a clear evidence in favor of further investigation of various doping processes
based on the radiation-enhanced diffusion, especially the processes of plasma

enabling accretion in sufficiently ionized astrophysical disks. The rate at
which MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the
strength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree
of anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies
of the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we
investigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a
pseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the
underlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a
quasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies
motivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor
invariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic
turbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with
brief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent
flow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,
especially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for
characterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract
spectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic
character depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier
spectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in
Fourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of
the three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over
most scales, except the largest ones. Our results suggest that a
first-principles theory to describe fully developed MRI-driven turbulence will
likely have to consider the anisotropic nature of the flow at a fundamental
level.

Bessel-Gauss and Bessel, truncated Neumann-Gauss and Hankel-Gauss,
Laguerre-Gauss, and other Gaussian-type vortex beams are considered. The
mathematical expressions are exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation. The
results presented here are particularly useful to accurately evaluate
analytically and compute numerically the acoustic scattering and other
mechanical effects of finite vortex beams, such as the axial and 3D acoustic
radiation force and torque components on a sphere of any (isotropic,
anisotropic etc.) material (fluid, elastic, viscoelastic etc.). Numerical
predictions allow optimal design of parameters in applications including but
not limited to acoustical tweezers, acousto-fluidics, beam-forming design and
imaging to name a few.

obtained for the excitation density in the space-time representation in the
continuous limit and this solution is used to characterize the energy transport
time and intensity. Three transport mechanisms are identified such as
ballistic, diffusive and directed diffusive regimes, occurring at different
distances and time ranges. The crossover between the two diffusive regimes is
continuous, while the switch between the ballistic and diffusive mechanisms
occurs in discontinuous manner in accord with the recent experimental data on

terrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs of
detectors. The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among
other things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the
separation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is
more sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located
detector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from
correlated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could
contaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and
mitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential
increase in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first
SGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the
complications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated
noise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO
Hanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low
frequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlated
noise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic
gravitational-wave signal. However, at high frequencies, 460-1000 Hz, these
techniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on
the gravitational-wave energy density of \Omega(f)<7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 Hz)^3,
which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. In doing
so, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches using
advanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)
may affect even widely separated detectors.

naturally countable graphs, and the completed graph space $\mathscr{G}(V)$ is
identified with the 2-adic integers as well as the Cantor set. The goal of this
paper is to develop a model for differentiation on graph space in the spirit of
the Newton-Leibnitz calculus. To this end, we first study the space of all
finite labelled graphs and their limiting objects, and establish analogues of
left-convergence, homomorphism densities, a Counting Lemma, and a large family
of topologically equivalent metrics on labelled graph space. We then establish
results akin to the First and Second Derivative Tests for real-valued functions

to any underlying quantum field theoretic model of the $q\bar{q}$ system, and
not just to models, like exact QCD, where the quark self-energy $\Sigma$
couples to the electromagnetic field solely via dressed quark propagators. In
this way, applications to effective field theories and other QCD motivated

attaching currents to all possible places in the Feynman diagrams contributing
to the dressed quark propagator. The gauge invariance of our construction is
thus a direct consequence of respecting the underlying structure of the quantum

Narrow Line Region (NLR) is a cone-shaped region of gas ionized by radiation
from a nuclear source collimated by a dusty torus, where the gas is in outflow.
In this contribution, I discuss a 3D view of the NLR obtained via Integral
Field Spectroscopy, showing that: (1) although the region of highest emission
is elongated (and in some cases cone-shaped), there is also lower level
emission beyond the ""ionization cone"", indicating that the AGN radiation leaks
through the torus; (2) besides outflows, the gas kinematics include also
rotation in the galaxy plane and inflows; (3) in many cases the outflows are
compact and restricted to the inner few 100pc; we argue that these may be early
stages of an outflow that will evolve to an open-ended, cone-like one. Inflows
are observed in ionized gas in LINERs, and in warm molecular gas in more
luminous AGN, being usually found on hundred of pc scales. Mass outflow rates
in ionized gas are of the order of a few solar masses per year, while the mass
inflow rates are of the order of tenths of solar masses per year. Mass inflow
rates in warm molecular gas are ~4-5 orders of magnitude lower, but these
inflows seem to be only tracers of more massive inflows in cold molecular gas
that should be observable at mm wavelengths.

It is shown that a magnetic field profile that is 10% of the cycle time out of

that the influence of changing the magnetic field was more or less the same for

fermions in magnetic fields. This property persists even when the Dirac cone is
tilted, which has been shown by Kawarabayashi et al. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 83},
153414 (2011)] to be a consequence of a ""generalized chiral symmetry"". Here we
pose a question whether this property will be washed out when the tilted Dirac
fermion becomes massive. Surprisingly, the levels persist to be
delta-function-like, although the mass term that splits $n=0$ Landau levels may
seem to degrade the anomalous sharpness. This has been shown both numerically
for a tight-binding model, and analytically in terms of the Aharonov-Casher
argument extended to the massive tilted Dirac fermions. A key observation is
that, while the generalized chiral symmetry is broken by the mass term, the
$n=0$ Landau level remains to accommodate eigenstates of the generalized chiral
operator, resulting in the robustness against chiral-symmetric disorders.
Mathematically, the conventional and generalized chiral operators are related
with each other via a non-unitary transformation, with which the split,
nonzero-energy $n=0$ wave functions of the massive system are just
gauge-transformed zero-mode wave functions of the massless system. A message is
that the chiral symmetry, rather than a simpler notion of the sublattice

nm to visible wavelengths in light detection systems used for liquid argon
time-projection chambers (LArTPCs). To date, LArTPC light collection systems
have employed tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) coatings on photomultiplier tubes

TPB-coated light guides was proposed. In this paper, we report on light guides
with improved attenuation lengths above 100 cm when measured in air. This is an
important step in the development of meter-scale light guides for future
LArTPCs. Improvements come from using a new acrylic-based coating,
diamond-polished cast UV transmitting acrylic bars, and a hand-dipping
technique to coat the bars. We discuss a model for connecting bar response in
air to response in liquid argon and compare this to data taken in liquid argon.
The good agreement between the prediction of the model and the measured
response in liquid argon demonstrates that characterization in air is
sufficient for quality control of bar production. This model can be used in
simulations of light guides for future experiments.

measurement of typical heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ has
demonstrated multi-Fermi surface structure, which has not been in detail
studied theoretically in a model system like the Kondo-Heisenberg model. In
this work, we make a step toward such an issue with revisiting the
Kondo-Heisenberg model. It is surprising to find that the usual self-consistent
calculation cannot reproduced the fermionology of the experimental observation
of the system due to the unfounded sign binding between the hopping of the
conduction electrons and the mean-field valence-bond order. To overcome such
inconsistency, we assume that the sign binding should be relaxed and the
mean-field valence-bond order can be considered as a free/fit parameter so as
to meet with real-life experiments. Given the fermionology, the calculated
effective mass enhancement, entropy, superfluid density and Knight shift are
all in qualitative agreement with the experimental results of CeCoIn$_{5}$,
which confirms our assumption. Our result supports a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave
pairing structure in heavy fermion material CeCoIn$_{5}$. In addition, we have
also provided the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) spectra of the system,

represented as disorganized ""bags"" of features which can then be analyzed using
models originally developed to capture co-variation of word counts in text.
However, image feature counts are likely to be constrained in different ways
than word counts in text. For example, as a camera pans upwards from a building
entrance over its first few floors and then further up into the sky Fig. 1,
some feature counts in the image drop while others rise -- only to drop again
giving way to features found more often at higher elevations. The space of all
possible feature count combinations is constrained both by the properties of
the larger scene and the size and the location of the window into it. To
capture such variation, in this paper we propose the use of the counting grid
model. This generative model is based on a grid of feature counts, considerably
larger than any of the modeled images, and considerably smaller than the real
estate needed to tile the images next to each other tightly. Each modeled image
is assumed to have a representative window in the grid in which the feature
counts mimic the feature distribution in the image. We provide a learning
procedure that jointly maps all images in the training set to the counting grid
and estimates the appropriate local counts in it. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that the resulting representation captures the space of feature
count combinations more accurately than the traditional models, not only when
the input images come from a panning camera, but even when modeling images of
different scenes from the same category.

any such configuration, the motion of the windings in the compact space may
render the string effectively tensionless from a four-dimensional perspective,
so that it remains static with respect to the large dimensions. Such a critical
configuration occurs when (locally) exactly half the square of the string
length lies in the large dimensions and half lies in the compact space. The
critical solution is then seen to arise as a special case, in which the
wavelength of the windings is equal to their circumference. As examples, long
straight strings and circular loops are considered in detail, and the solutions
to the equations of motion that satisfy the tensionless condition are
presented. These solutions are then generalized to planar loops and arbitrary
three-dimensional configurations. Under the process of dimensional reduction,
in which higher-dimensional motion is equivalent to an effective worldsheet
current (giving rise to a conserved charge), this phenomenon may be seen as the
analogue of the tensionless condition which arises for superconducting and

unitarity in a framework known as the method of unitarity bounds.We use a QCD
correlator computed on the spacelike axis by operator product expansion and
perturbative QCD as input, and exploit unitarity and the positivity of its
spectral function, including the two-pion contribution that can be reliably
calculated using high-precision data on the pion form factor. From this
information, we derive upper and lower bounds on the modulus of the $\omega\pi$
form factor in the elastic region. The results provide a significant check on
those obtained with standard dispersion relations, confirming the existence of
a disagreement with experimental data in the region around 0.6 GeV.

walks on regular graphs and relates the symmetry group of those graphs to a
coarse-graining of the ABM that is still Markovian. An ABM in which $N$ agents
can be in $\delta$ different states leads to a Markov chain with $\delta^N$
states. In ABMs with a sequential update scheme by which one agent is chosen to
update its state at a time, transitions are only allowed between system
configurations that differ with respect to a single agent. This characterizes
ABMs as random walks on regular graphs. The non-trivial automorphisms of those
graphs make visible the dynamical symmetries that an ABM gives rise to because
sets of micro configurations can be interchanged without changing the
probability structure of the random walk. This allows for a systematic
loss-less reduction of the state space of the model.

that, in reality, different databases are sampling different parts of a

combination of Weibull and log-normal distributions -- where a pure Weibull
(log-normal) characterizes the distribution of structures with fluxes below

separate mechanisms giving rise to visible structures on the photosphere: one
directly connected to the global component of the dynamo (and the generation of
bipolar active regions), and the other with the small-scale component of the
dynamo (and the fragmentation of magnetic structures due to their interaction
with turbulent convection). Additionally, we demonstrate that the Weibull
distribution shows the expected linear behavior of a power-law distribution
(when extended into smaller fluxes), making our results compatible with the

amplitudes from multi-band photometric data and relying on the traditional
approximation for the treatment of oscillations in rotating stars.
  Models consistent with the observed mean parameters are considered. For the
five frequency peaks, the candidates for the identifications are searched
amongst unstable modes. In the case of the third frequency, which is an exact
multiple of the orbital frequency, this condition is relaxed. The systematic
search is continued up to a harmonic degree $\ell =6$.
  Determination of the angular numbers, $(\ell,m)$, is done simultaneously with
the rotation rate, $V_{\rm rot}$, and the inclination angle, $i$, constrained
by the spectroscopic data on the projected rotational velocity, $V_{\rm
rot}\sin i$, which is assumed constant. All the peaks may be accounted for with
g-modes of high radial orders and the degrees $\ell\le 6$. There are
differences in some identifications between the models. For the two
lowest--amplitude peaks the identifications are not unique. Nonetheless, the
equatorial velocity is constrained to a narrow range of (135, 140) km/s.
  Our work presents the first application of the photometric method of mode
identification in the framework of the traditional approximation and we believe

programming languages with bounded computational complexity; indeed,
guaranteeing and certifying a limited resources usage is of central importance
for various aspects of computer science. One of the more promising approaches
to this aim is based on the use of lambda-calculus as paradigmatic programming
language and the design of type assignment systems for lambda-terms, where
types guarantee both the functional correctness and the complexity bound. Here
we propose a system of stratified types, inspired by intersection types, where
intersection is a non-associative operator. The system, called STR, is correct
and complete for polynomial time computations; moreover, all the strongly
normalizing terms are typed in it, thus increasing the typing power with
respect to the previous proposals. Moreover, STR enjoys a stronger expressivity
with respect to the previous system STA, since it allows to type a restricted
version of iteration.

the detection of ETNOs with arguments of perihelion close to 0 degrees and 180

has been offered so far to account for this unusual pattern. Here, we study the
dynamical evolution of comet 96P/Machholz 1, a bizarre near-Earth object (NEO)
that may provide the key to explain the puzzling clustering of orbits around
argument of perihelion close to 0 degrees recently found for the population of
ETNOs. Comet 96P/Machholz 1 is currently locked in a Kozai resonance with
Jupiter such that the value of its argument of perihelion is always close to 0
degrees at its shortest possible perihelion (highest eccentricity and lowest
inclination) and about 180 degrees near its shortest aphelion (longest
perihelion distance, lowest eccentricity and highest inclination). If this
object is a dynamical analogue (albeit limited) of the known ETNOs, this
implies that massive perturbers must keep them confined in orbital parameter
space. Besides, its future dynamical evolution displays orbital flips when its
eccentricity is excited to a high value and its orbit turns over by nearly 180
degrees, rolling over its major axis. This unusual behaviour, that is preserved
when post-Newtonian terms are included in the numerical integrations, may also
help understand the production of NEOs on retrograde orbits.

can neither be generated nor become larger than its initial value. Different
from the entanglement dynamics, QD can be amplified, and even be generated by
the interaction between particles and the common environment. We also observe
that QD decays asymptotically to zero and later experiences a rival when the
average number of excitation in the 1D N-spin array becomes larger in the case
of nonzero inter-distance between two particles.

determine information about the link. However, when many crossings are added to
a single twist region of a link diagram, the geometry of the link complement
stabilizes (approaches a geometric limit), but a corresponding checkerboard

implies a dust-association rate of 99% for the full MMB catalogue. Evaluation
of the derived dust and maser properties leads us to conclude that the combined
sample represents a single population tracing the same phenomenon. We find
median clump masses of a few 10$^3$ M$\odot$ and that all but a handful of
sources satisfy the mass-size criterion required for massive star formation.
This study provides the strongest evidence of the almost ubiquitous association
of methanol masers with massive, star-forming clumps. The fraction of
methanol-maser associated clumps is a factor of ~2 lower in the outer Galaxy
than the inner Galaxy, possibly a result of the lower metallicity environment
of the former. We find no difference in the clump-mass and maser-luminosity
distributions of the inner and outer Galaxy. The maser-pumping and
clump-formation mechanisms are therefore likely to be relatively invariant to
Galactic location. Finally, we use the ratio of maser luminosity and clump mass
to investigate the hypothesis that the maser luminosity is a good indicator of
the evolutionary stage of the embedded source, however, we find no evidence to
support this.

originates in the central starburst. With the new short spacings-corrected maps
we derive some of the properties of the dense molecular gas in the base of the
outflow. From the HCN and HCO$^{+}$ J=(1-0) line emission, and under the
assumptions of the gas being optically thin and in local thermodynamic
equilibrium, we place lower limits to the amount of dense molecular gas in the
base of the outflow. The lower limits are $7\times10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ and
$21\times10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$, or $\gtrsim2\%$ of the total molecular mass in
the outflow. The kinematics and spatial distribution of the dense gas outside
the central starburst suggests that it is being expelled through chimneys.
Assuming a constant outflow velocity, the derived outflow rate of dense
molecular gas is $\geq0.3$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which would lower the
starburst lifetime by $\geq5\%$. The energy required to expel this mass of
dense gas is $(1-10)\times10^{52}$ erg.

which are known to have an important effect on nucleosynthesis conditions in SN

with unbound nucleons that are consistent with existing SN equations of state
(EOSs) are specified. The nucleon self-energies are made available online as
electronic tables. The discussion is mostly restricted to relativistic
mean-field models.
  In the first part of the article, the generic properties of this class of
models at finite temperature and asymmetry are studied. It is found that the
quadratic expansion of the EOS in terms of asymmetry works reasonably well at
finite temperatures and deviations originate mostly from the kinetic part. The
interaction part of the symmetry energy is found to be almost temperature
independent. At low densities, the account of realistic nucleon masses requires
the introduction of a linear term in the expansion. Finally, it is shown that
the important neutron-to-proton potential difference is given approximately by
the asymmetry of the system and the interaction part of the zero-temperature
symmetry energy. The results of different interactions are then compared with
constraints from nuclear experiments and thereby the possible range of the
potential difference is limited.
  In the second part, for a certain class of SN EOS models, the formation of
nuclei is considered. Only moderate modifications are found for the
self-energies of unbound nucleons that enter the weak charged-current
interaction rates. This is because in the present approach the binding energies
of bound states do not contribute to the single-particle energies of unbound

numerical analysis by quantifying uncertainties in predictions. In this work we
present a formulation of a fully nonlinear and dispersive potential flow water
wave model with random inputs for the probabilistic description of the
evolution of waves. The model is analyzed using random sampling techniques and
non-intrusive methods based on generalized Polynomial Chaos (PC). These methods
allow to accurately and efficiently estimate the probability distribution of
the solution and require only the computation of the solution in different
points in the parameter space, allowing for the reuse of existing simulation
software. The choice of the applied methods is driven by the number of
uncertain input parameters and by the fact that finding the solution of the
considered model is computationally intensive. We revisit experimental
benchmarks often used for validation of deterministic water wave models. Based
on numerical experiments and assumed uncertainties in boundary data, our
analysis reveals that some of the known discrepancies from deterministic
simulation in comparison with experimental measurements could be partially
explained by the variability in the model input. We finally present a synthetic
experiment studying the variance based sensitivity of the wave load on an
off-shore structure to a number of input uncertainties. In the numerical
examples presented the PC methods have exhibited fast convergence, suggesting
that the problem is amenable to being analyzed with such methods.

of amorphous water ice at low temperature (10 K) and to characterize the
evolution of the porosity (and the specific surface area) as a function of
temperature (from 10 to 120 K). Methods. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are
used to mimic the formation and the thermal evolution of pores in amorphous
water ice. We follow the accretion of gas-phase water molecules as well as
their migration on surfaces with different grid sizes, both at the top growing
layer and within the bulk. Results. We show that the porosity characteristics
change substantially in water ice as the temperature increases. The total
surface of the pores decreases strongly while the total volume decreases only
slightly for higher temperatures. This will decrease the overall reaction
efficiency, but in parallel, small pores connect and merge, allowing trapped
molecules to meet and react within the pores network, providing a pathway to
increase the reaction efficiency. We introduce pore coalescence as a new solid
state process that may boost the solid state formation of new molecules in

become sensitive to polarization modes of the partons and protons that one

particular when one looks at azimuthal asymmetries. Matrix elements used in the
description of hadronic processes, such as DY, require the inclusion of gauge

entanglement. We show that in the process of color disentangling each gauge
link remains sensitive to this color flow. After disentanglement, we find that
particular combinations of TMDs require a different numerical color factor than
one might have expected. Such color factors will even play a role for azimuthal
asymmetries in the simplest hadronic processes such as the DY process.

intra-voxel white-matter fiber orientations from diffusion MRI data. However,
while some of these methods assume a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for the
underlying noise, its real distribution is known to be non-Gaussian and to
depend on the methodology used to combine multichannel signals. Indeed, the two
prevailing methods for multichannel signal combination lead to Rician and
noncentral Chi noise distributions. Here we develop a Robust and Unbiased
Model-BAsed Spherical Deconvolution (RUMBA-SD) technique, intended to deal with
realistic MRI noise, based on a Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm adapted to
Rician and noncentral Chi likelihood models. To quantify the benefits of using
proper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established
method based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study
was to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial
regularization term in the estimation framework. To do this, we developed TV
spatially-regularized versions of both RUMBA-SD and dRL-SD algorithms. The
evaluation was performed by comparing various quality metrics on 132
three-dimensional synthetic phantoms involving different inter-fiber angles and
volume fractions, which were contaminated with noise mimicking patterns
generated by data processing in multichannel scanners. The results demonstrate
that the inclusion of proper likelihood models leads to an increased ability to
resolve fiber crossings with smaller inter-fiber angles and to better detect
non-dominant fibers. The inclusion of TV regularization dramatically improved
the resolution power of both techniques. The above findings were also verified
in brain data.

hybridization, due to the QD confinement, which may significantly change the

systematic study of the intervalley coupling by QD confinement potentials on
extended TMD monolayers. We find that the intervalley coupling in such geometry
is generically weak due to the vanishing amplitude of the electron wavefunction
at the QD boundary, and hence valley hybridization shall be well quenched by
the much stronger spin-valley coupling in monolayer TMDs and the QDs can well
inherit the valley physics of the 2D bulk. We also discover sensitive
dependence of intervalley coupling strength on the central position and the
lateral length scales of the confinement potentials, which may possibly allow

flagellar waves; the waveform emerges as a consequence of elastic structure,
internal active moments, and low Reynolds number fluid dynamics. Engineered
microchannels have recently been proposed as a method of sorting and
manipulating motile cells; the interaction of cells with these artificial
environments therefore warrants investigation. A numerical method is presented
for the geometrically nonlinear elastohydrodynamic interaction of active
swimmers with domain features. This method is employed to examine hydrodynamic
scattering by a model microchannel backstep feature. Scattering is shown to
depend on backstep height and the relative strength of viscous and elastic
forces in the flagellum. In a 'high viscosity' parameter regime corresponding
to human sperm in cervical mucus analogue, this hydrodynamic contribution to
scattering is comparable in magnitude to recent data on contact effects, being
of the order of 5-10 degrees. Scattering can be positive or negative depending
on the relative strength of viscous and elastic effects, emphasising the
importance of viscosity on the interaction of sperm with their
microenvironment. The modulation of scattering angle by viscosity is associated
with variations in flagellar asymmetry induced by the elastohydrodynamic
interaction with the boundary feature.

where to make bar recursive updates, terminating the computation whenever

demand-driven bar recursion can be directly used to give an alternative
functional interpretation of classical countable choice. We provide a short
case study as an illustration, in which we extract a new bar recursive program
from the proof that there is no injection from $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ to
$\mathbb{N}$, and compare this to the program that would be obtained using

investigating the noncommutative corrections on the Aharonov-Casher and
He-McKellar-Wilkens effects. This approach is based on the effective $U(1)$
gauge symmetry for the electrodynamics of spin on the two dimensional space.
The Seiberg-Witten map for this symmetry is then employed when we study the
noncommutative corrections. Because the Seiberg-Witten map preserves the gauge
symmetry, the noncommutative corrections can be defined consistently with the
ordinary phases. Based on this approach we find the noncommutative corrections
on the Aharonov-Casher and He-McKellar-Wilkens phases consist of two terms. The
first one depends on the beam particle velocity and consistence with the
previous results. However the second term is velocity-independent and then
completely new. Therefore our results indicate it is possible to investigate
the noncommutative space by using ultra-cold neutron interferometer in which
the velocity-dependent term is negligible. Furthermore, both these two terms
are proportional to the ratio between the noncommutative parameter $\theta$ and
the cross section $A_{e/m}$ of the electrical/magnetic charged line enclosed by
the trajectory of beam particles. Therefore the experimental sensitivity can be
significantly enhanced by reduce the cross section of the charge line

Nautilus has been used with an extended deuterium network. For the protostellar

state of the adatom chain, we extract the corresponding phase diagram which
exhibits an interplay of ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and spiral
orders. We determine the parameter regime for which the FM or AFM phases
dominate over the spiral and additionally become stable against thermal and
quantum fluctuations. For the topological analysis we focus on the FM and AFM
cases and employ a low-energy effective model relying on Shiba bound states. We
find that for both magnetic patterns the hybrid system behaves as a topological
superconductor which can harbor one or even two MFs per edge, due to chiral

quantitatively distinct topological features that are reflected in the spatial

components: a bridge-like feature extended between NGC 4631 and NGC 4656
(stream_SE) and an overdensity with extended features on the opposite side of
the NGC 4631 disk (stream_NW). Together, these features extend more than 85 kpc
and display a clear (g-r) colour gradient. The orientation of stream_SE
relative to the orientations of NGC 4631 and NGC 4656 is not consistent with an
origin from interaction between these two spirals, and is more likely debris
from a satellite encounter. The stellar tidal features can be qualitatively
reproduced in an N-body model of the tidal disruption of a single, massive
dwarf satellite on a moderately eccentric orbit (e=0.6) around NGC 4631 over
$\sim$ 3.5 Gyr, with a dynamical mass ratio (m1:m2) of ~40. Both modelling and
inferences from the morphology of the streams indicate these are not associated
with the complex HI tidal features observed between both spirals, which likely
originate from a more recent, gas-rich accretion event. The detailed structure
of stream_NW suggests it may contain the progenitor of the stream, in agreement
with the N-body model. In addition, stream_NW is roughly aligned with two very
faint dwarf spheroidal candidates. The system of dwarf galaxies and the tidal
stream around NGC 4631 can provide an additional interesting case for exploring
the anisotropy distribution of satellite galaxies recently reported in Local

Dirac operator are localised, while moving up in the spectrum states become
extended. This localisation/delocalisation transition has been shown to be a
genuine second-order phase transition, in the same universality class as that
of the 3D Anderson model. The existence of localised modes and the effective
dimensional reduction can be tentatively explained as a consequence of local
fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, that provide 3D on-site disorder, in analogy
to the on-site disorder of the Anderson model. To test the viability of this
explanation we study a 3D effective, Anderson-like model, with on-site disorder
provided by the spins of a spin model, which mimics the Polyakov loop dynamics.
Our preliminary results show that localised modes are present in the ordered
phase, thus supporting the proposed mechanism for localisation in QCD.

result in data-dependent improvements factors for the excess risk over the

use less attributes than full-information algorithms, which is the main concern

extensively studied since its first VHE detection in 1996. Our goal is to
characterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with the
radio-to-X-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is less
often studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. We organized a
multiwavelength (MW) campaign on Mrk 501 between March and May 2008. This
multi-instrument effort included the most sensitive VHE gamma-ray instruments
in the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
MAGIC and VERITAS, as well as Swift, RXTE, the F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, and other
collaborations and instruments. Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of
activity during the campaign, with a VHE flux in the range of 10%-20% of the
Crab nebula flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected with
various instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. The
broadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission states
of the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described by
an increase in the electron number density. This agrees with previous studies
of the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.
We report for the first time a tentative X-ray-to-VHE correlation during a low
VHE activity. Although marginally significant, this positive correlation
between X-ray and VHE, which has been reported many times during flaring
activity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the X-ray/VHE emission
during non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that are
responsible for the emission during flaring activity.

develop an abstract operator-theoretic approach to maximal regularity.
  The results are applied to the case of $m$-th order elliptic operators $A$
with time and space-dependent coefficients. Here the highest order coefficients
are assumed to be measurable in time and continuous in the space variables.
This results in an $L^p(L^q)$-theory for such equations for $p,q\in (1,

  In the final section we extend a well-posedness result for quasilinear
equations to the time-dependent setting. Here we give an example of a nonlinear

update will have room for more topics. The scope covers mostly nano-magnetic
phenomena and applications, where surfaces and interfaces provide additional
functionality. New developments in fundamental topics such as interacting

scenario of coincidence and devise a set-up for its realization. In order to
model the scenario, the energy arising from the torsion component is considered
analogous to dark energy. An interaction between dark energy and dark matter is
considered, which is by far the best possible tool to realize the coincidence.
A set-up is designed and a constraint equation is obtained which screens the
models of \textit{f(T)} gravity that can successfully accommodate the
stationary scenario in its framework, from those which cannot. Due to the
absence of a universally accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental
theory, the study is conducted over three different forms of chosen interaction
terms. As an illustration two widely known models of \textit{f(T)} gravity are
taken into consideration and used in the designed setup. The study reveals that
the realization of the coincidence scenario as well as the role played by
torsion in the current universe is a model dependent phenomenon. It is found
that the first model showed a considerable departure from the stationary
scenario. On the contrary the other four models are perfectly consistent with
our setup and generated a satisfactory stationary scenario, thus showing their
cosmological viability and their superiority over their counterparts. For the
third model (exponential model) it was seen that the cosmological coincidence
is realized only in the phantom regime. For the fourth (logarithmic model) and
the fifth models, we see that the the stationary scenario is attained for
negative interaction values. This shows that the direction of flow must be from
dark energy to dark matter unlike the previous models. Under such circumstances
the universe will return from the present energy dominated phase to a matter
dominated phase.

of early-type disk galaxies shows the following features. The disks of
lenticular and early-type spiral galaxies have similar thicknesses. The
presence of a bar results in only a slight marginal increase of the thickness.
However, we have found a substantial difference between the thicknesses of the
disks with a single-scaled exponential brightness profile and the disks that
represent the inner segments of the Type III (antitruncated) profiles. The
disks are significantly thicker in the former subsample than in the latter one.
This may provide evidence for a surface-brightness distribution of a

sensitivity of large modern intensity interferometers can be improved by
factors up to approximately 25,000, corresponding to 11 photometric magnitudes,

possible by (i) using avalanche photodiodes (APD) as light detectors, (ii)
distributing the light received from the source over multiple independent
spectral channels, and (iii) use of arrays composed of multiple large light
collectors. Our approach permits the construction of large (with baselines
ranging from few kilometers to intercontinental distances) optical
interferometers at the cost of (very) long-baseline radio interferometers.
Realistic intensity interferometer designs are able to achieve limiting R-band
magnitudes as good as ~14, sufficient for spatially resolved observations of
main-sequence O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Multi-channel intensity
interferometers can address a wide variety of science cases: (i) linear radii,
effective temperatures, and luminosities of stars; (ii) mass-radius
relationships of compact stellar remnants; (iii) stellar rotation; (iv) stellar
convection and the interaction of stellar photospheres and magnetic fields; (v)
the structure and evolution of multiple stars; (vi) direct measurements of
interstellar distances; (vii) the physics of gas accretion onto supermassive
black holes; and (viii) calibration of amplitude interferometers by providing a

around the world; thus, forecasting their impact is crucial for planning an

Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza affects between 5% to 20% of the U.S.
population and causes major economic impacts resulting from hospitalization and
absenteeism. Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is
fundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies.
  We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and
CDC influenza like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for
seasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013--2014 influenza season
but are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence

In addition, we provide a way to determine where the model diverges from
observation and evaluate forecast accuracy.
  Wikipedia article access logs are shown to be highly correlated with
historical ILI records and allow for accurate prediction of ILI data several
weeks before it becomes available. The results show that prior to the peak of
the flu season, our forecasting method projected the actual outcome with a high
probability. However, since our model does not account for re-infection or
multiple strains of influenza, the tail of the epidemic is not predicted well
after the peak of flu season has past.

considering the dilute boson limit and using the Bethe-Salpeter equation to
determine the first instability of the saturated paramagnet. Close to the
highly frustrated point $J_2/J_1\sim0.5$, we find that the spin-nematic state
is stable even for $|J_{\text{C}}/J_1|\sim 1$. For larger values of $J_2/J_1$,
interlayer coupling favors a broad, phase-separated region. Further increase of
