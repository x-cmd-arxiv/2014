performed manually and it is a very time consuming procedure. The opportunity
to communicate with on a one-to-one basis is highly valued. However with many
hundreds of applications each year, one-to-one conversations are not feasible
in most cases. The communication will require a member of academic staff to
expend several hours to find suitable answers and contact each student. It
would be useful to reduce his costs and time.
  The project aims to reduce the burden on the head of admissions, and
potentially other users, by developing a convincing chatbot. A suitable
algorithm must be devised to search through the set of data and find a
potential answer. The program then replies to the user and provides a relevant
web link if the user is not satisfied by the answer. Furthermore a web
interface is provided for both users and an administrator.
  The achievements of the project can be summarised as follows. To prepare the
background of the project a literature review was undertaken, together with an
investigation of existing tools, and consultation with the head of admissions.
The requirements of the system were established and a range of algorithms and
tools were investigated, including keyword and template matching. An algorithm
that combines keyword matching with string similarity has been developed. A
usable system using the proposed algorithm has been implemented. The system was
evaluated by keeping logs of questions and answers and by feedback received by
potential students that used it.

energy-optimized, there is one disturbing, contradictory observation: In
theory, computation limited by thermal noise can occur as cheaply as ~$2.9\cdot

discrepancy from this minimum is startling - ignoring inhibition the
discrepancy is $10^7$ times this amount and taking inhibition into account
$>10^9$. Here we point out that what has been defined as neural computation is
actually a combination of computation and neural communication: the
communication costs, transmission from each excitatory postsynaptic activation
to the S4-gating-charges of the fast Na+ channels of the initial segment
(fNa's), dominate the joule-costs. Making this distinction between
communication to the initial segment and computation at the initial segment
(i.e., adding up of the activated fNa's) implies that the size of the average
synaptic event reaching the fNa's is the size of the standard deviation of the
thermal noise. Moreover, defining computation as the addition of activated
fNa's, yields a biophysically plausible mechanism for approaching the desired
minimum. This mechanism, requiring something like the electrical engineer's
equalizer (not much more than the action potential generating conductances),
only operates at threshold. This active filter modifies the last few synaptic
excitations, providing barely enough energy to allow the last sub-threshold
gating charge to transport. That is, the last, threshold-achieving S4-subunit

cell consists of four orthorhombic units in the $b$ direction.The refinements
show that this structure consists of (0 1 0) ferromagnetic planes stacked along
$b$, in which the moments are oriented parallel to $a$ (the easy anisotropy
axis according to bulk magnetization measurements) and nearly equal in
magnitude ($\approx 1.7-1.9\ \mu_B$). The alternating 8-plane sequence
providing the best agreement to the data turns out to be that which yields the
lowest exchange energy if one assumes antiferromagnetic near-neighbor exchange
interactions with $J_1 \gg J_2, J_3$. With increasing temperature, the
single-crystal measurements indicate the suppression of the $\mathbf{k}_2$
component at $T = 2.7$ K, supporting the idea that the anomalies previously
observed around 2--2.5 K result from a squaring transition. In a magnetic field
applied along the $a$ axis, the magnetic Bragg satellites disappear at $H_c =
2.45$ T, in agreement with earlier measurements. Comparisons are made with
related magnetic orders occurring in Ce$T_2$Al$_{10}$ ($T$: Ru, Os) and
TbFe$_2$Al$_{10}$.

complete magnetic transition, be inexpensive, and environmentally friendly. One
system that may fulfill these requirements is MnxFe2-xP1-yGey, where a combined
first-order structural and magnetic transition occurs between the high
temperature paramagnetic and low temperature ferromagnetic phase. We have used
neutron diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and magnetization

located on the 3g sites are detrimental. The entropy changes measured directly

hysteresis of the transition, and entropy change can be controlled by both the
compositional homogeneity and the particle size, and an annealing procedure has
been developed that substantially improves the performance of all three

  Structural SVMs with a Costly max-Oracle",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are amongst the best performing
models for structured computer vision tasks, such as semantic image
segmentation or human pose estimation. Training SSVMs, however, is
computationally costly, because it requires repeated calls to a structured
prediction subroutine (called \emph{max-oracle}), which has to solve an
optimization problem itself, e.g. a graph cut.
  In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for SSVM training that is more
efficient than earlier techniques when the max-oracle is computationally
expensive, as it is frequently the case in computer vision tasks. The main idea
is to (i) combine the recent stochastic Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm
with efficient hyperplane caching, and (ii) use an automatic selection rule for
deciding whether to call the exact max-oracle or to rely on an approximate one
based on the cached hyperplanes.
  We show experimentally that this strategy leads to faster convergence to the
optimum with respect to the number of requires oracle calls, and that this
translates into faster convergence with respect to the total runtime when the
max-oracle is slow compared to the other steps of the algorithm.

flight time of the pulse through the material. The geometry of the slab of

turn determines that vacuum modes whose wavelengths are of the order of the
thickness of the slab give the dominant contribution. Some numerical estimates
are made, which indicate that fractional fluctuations in flight time of the

an analog model for the lightcone fluctuations predicted by quantum gravity.

detection efficiency over a 453-day interval using the Pan-STARRS moving object

seek for an account of quantum non-locality in the framework of ontic
structural realism (OSR), which integrates the notions of holism and
non-separability that have been employed since the 1980s to achieve such an
account. However, recent research shows that OSR on its own cannot provide such
an account. Against this background, the paper argues that by applying OSR to
the primitive ontology theories of quantum physics, one can accomplish that
task. In particular, Bohmian mechanics offers the best prospect for doing so.
(2) In general, the paper seeks to bring OSR and the primitive ontology
theories of quantum physics together: on the one hand, in order to be
applicable to quantum mechanics, OSR has to consider what the quantum ontology
of matter distributed in space-time is. On the other hand, as regards the
primitive ontology theories, OSR provides the conceptual tools for these
theories to answer the question of what the ontological status of the

is an integral part of many analysis and robust control design procedures. Most
prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced L2
norm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain
theorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter
dependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to
compute lower bounds for the induced L2 norm. The proposed approach computes a
lower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a
periodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact
calculation of the L2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The
proposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound
complements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between
the bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more
complex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm
returns a bad parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further
analyzed to provide insight into the system performance.

Statistical Multifragmentation Model which employs state densities that take
the pairing gap in the nuclear levels into account. Attention is focused on the
properties of the charge distributions observed in the breakup of the source.
Since the microcanonical version of the model used in this study provides the
primary fragment excitation energy distribution, one may correlate the
reduction of the odd-even staggering in the charge distribution with the
increasing occupation of high energy states. Thus, in the frame- work of this
model, such staggering tends to disappear as a function of the total excitation
energy of the source, although the energy per particle may be small for large
systems. We also find that, although the deexcitation of the primary fragments
should, in principle, blur these odd-even effects as the fragments follow their
decay chains, the consistent treatment of pairing may significantly enhance
these staggering effects on the final yields. In the framework of this model,
we find that odd-even effects in the charge distributions should be observed in
the fragmentation of relatively light systems at very low excitation energies.
Our results also suggest that the odd-even staggering may provide useful
information on the nuclear state density.

  Rays","Submitted to ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2015)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the following classical search problem: given a target point $p\in
\Re$, starting at the origin, find $p$ with minimum cost, where cost is defined
as the distance travelled. Let $D$ be the distance of $p$ from the origin. When
no lower bound on $D$ is given, no competitive search strategy exists. Demaine,
Fekete and Gal (Online searching with turn cost, Theor. Comput. Sci.,
361(2-3):342-355, 2006) considered the situation where no lower bound on $D$ is
given but a fixed \emph{turn cost} $t>0$ is charged every time the searcher
changes direction. When the total cost is expressed as $c D+\phi$, where $c$
and $\phi$ are positive constants, they showed that if $c$ is set to $9$, then
the optimal search strategy has a cost of $9D+2t$. Although their strategy is
optimal for $c=9$, we prove that the minimum cost in their framework is
$5D+t+2\sqrt{2D(2D+t)} < 9D+2t$. Note that the minimum cost requires knowledge
of $D$. However, given $D$, the optimal strategy has a smaller cost of $3D+t$.
Therefore, this problem cannot be solved optimally and exactly when no lower
bound on $D$ is given.
  To resolve this issue, we introduce a general framework where the cost of
moving distance $x$ away from the origin is $\alpha_1 x+\beta_1$ and the cost
of moving distance $y$ towards the origin is $\alpha_2 y+\beta_2$ for constants
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta_1,\beta_2$. Given a lower bound $\lambda$ on $D$, we
provide a provably optimal competitive search strategy when
$\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta_1,\beta_2 \geq 0$ and $\alpha_1+\alpha_2 > 0$.
Finally, we address the problem of searching for a target lying on one of $m$
rays extending from the origin where the cost is measured as the total distance
travelled plus $t \geq 0$ times the number of turns. We provide a search
strategy and compute its cost. We prove our strategy is optimal for small
values of $t$ and conjecture it is always optimal.

study: the central velocity dispersion (sigma), which relates to local drivers
of star formation, and the mass of the host halo, which relates to
environment-related effects. In addition, we separate the sample between
centrals (the most massive galaxy in a halo) and satellites. We derive trends
of age, metallicity, and [alpha/Fe] enhancement, with sigma. We confirm that
the major driver of stellar population properties in ETGs is velocity
dispersion, with a second-order effect associated to the central/satellite
nature of the galaxy. No environmental dependence is detected for satellite
ETGs, except at low sigma - where satellites in groups or in the outskirts of
clusters tend to be younger than those in the central regions of clusters. In
contrast, the trends for centrals show a significant dependence on halo mass.
Central ETGs in groups (i.e. with a halo mass >10^12.5 M_Sun) have younger
ages, lower [alpha/Fe], and higher internal reddening, than ""isolated"" systems
(i.e. centrals residing in low-mass, <10^12.5 M_Sun, halos). Our findings imply
that central ETGs in groups formed their stellar component over longer time
scales than ""isolated"" centrals, mainly because of gas-rich interactions with
their companion galaxies.

be either positive (indicating relations such as trust) or negative (indicating
relations such as distrust), are increasingly common. Thus the interplay
between positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an
important research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign
inference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of
these two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the
two nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e.g., common
friend). In this paper we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by
applying a new model for node types. Initially, we analyze the local node
structure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying
node types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their
types; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors.
We show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed
triads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or
social status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies
based upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in
which the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges. Our
approach yields better performance than state-of-the-art approaches for these
three signed directed networks.

general. At zero mass one of the families is Weyl invariant. Such massless
theory has no particle content in $D=3$ and gives rise, via master action, to a
dual higher order (in derivatives) description of massive spin-2 particles in
$D=3$ where both the second and the fourth order terms are Weyl invariant,
contrary to the linearized New Massive Gravity. However, only the fourth order
term is invariant under arbitrary antisymmetric shifts. Consequently, the
antisymmetric part of the tensor $e_{[\mu\nu]}$ propagates at large momentum as
$1/p^2$ instead of $1/p^4$. So, the same kind of obstacle for the

stochastic background generated by the incoherent superposition of
gravitational waves (GWs), in particular from the cosmic population of
supermassive black hole binaries. Current stochastic background searches assume
that pulsars in a PTA are separated from each other and the Earth by many GW
wavelengths. As more millisecond pulsars are discovered and added to PTAs, some
may be separated by only a few radiation wavelengths or less, resulting in
correlated GW phase changes between close pulsars in the array. Here we
investigate how PTA overlap reduction functions (ORFs), up to quadrupole order,
are affected by these additional correlated phase changes, and how they are in
turn affected by relaxing the assumption that all pulsars are equidistant from
the solar system barycenter. We find that in the low frequency GW background
limit of $f\sim10^{-9}$~Hz, and for pulsars at varying distances from the
Earth, that these additional correlations only affect the ORFs by a few percent
for pulsar pairs at large angular separations, as expected. However when nearby
(order 100 pc) pulsars are separated by less than a few degrees, the correlated
phase changes can introduce variations of a few tens of percent in the
magnitude of the isotropic ORF, and much larger fractional differences in the
anisotropic ORFs-- up to 188 in the $m=0$, $l=2$ ORF for equidistant pulsars
separated by 3 degrees. In fact, the magnitude of most of the anisotropic ORFs
is largest at small, but non-zero, pulsar separations. Finally, we write down a
small angle approximation for the correlated phase changes which can easily be
implemented in search pipelines, and for completeness, examine the behavior of
the ORFs for pulsars which lie at a radiation wavelength from the Earth.

this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon_r <= 0.1,

black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in

distinct component in the giant early-type galaxy M87, via datasets obtained
with the SAURON and MUSE integral-field spectroscopic units. The MUSE velocity
field reveals a strong twist of ~140 deg within the central 30 arcsec
connecting outwards such a kinematically distinct core to a prolate-like
rotation around the large-scale photometric major-axis of the galaxy. The
existence of these kinematic features within the apparently round central
regions of M87 implies a non-axisymmetric and complex shape for this galaxy,
which could be further constrained using the presented kinematics. The
associated orbital structure should be interpreted together with other tracers
of the gravitational potential probed at larger scales (e.g., Globular
Clusters, Ultra Compact Dwarfs, Planetary Nebulae): it would offer an insight
in the assembly history of one of the brightest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster.
These data also demonstrate the potential of the MUSE spectrograph to uncover
low-amplitude spectral signatures.

wave function formalism is presented. It is argued that it is in the spirit of
the semiclassical wave function formalism to make necessary rationalization of
respective quantities accompanied the procedure of the semiclassical
quantization in polygon billiards. Unfolding rational polygon billiards (RPB)
into corresponding Riemann surfaces (RS) periodic structures of the latter are
demonstrated with 2g independent periods on the respective multitori with g as
their genuses. However it is the two dimensional real space of the real linear
combinations of these periods which is used for quantizing RPB. A class of
doubly rational polygon billiards (DRPB) is distinguished for which these real
linear relations are rational and their semiclassical quantization by wave
function formalism is presented. It is shown that semiclassical quantization of
both the classical momenta and the energy spectra are determined completely by
periodic structure of the corresponding RS. Each RS is then reduced to
elementary polygon patterns (EPP) as its basic periodic elements. Each such EPP
can be glued to a torus of genus g. Semiclassical wave functions (SWF) are then
constructed on EPP. The SWF for DRPB appear to be exact. They satisfy the
Dirichlet, the Neumannn or the mixed boundary conditions. Not every mixing is
allowed however and a respective incompleteness of SWF is discussed. Dens
families of DRPB are used for approximate semiclassical quantization of RPB.
General rational polygons are quantized by approximating them by DRPB. An
extension of the formalism to irrational polygons is described as well. The
semiclassical approximations constructed in the paper are controlled by general
criteria of the eigenvalue theory. A relation between the superscar solutions
and SWF constructed in the paper is also discussed.

is that each pair of points of the configuration establishes a random

We then use the birth and death structure to establish a hierarchy of balance

- is personally familiar, moderately heritable, and regulated by many genes,
including those involved in general body symmetry. But behavioral handedness,
i.e. lateralization, is a multifaceted phenomenon. For example, people display
clockwise or counter-clockwise biases in their walking behavior that is
uncorrelated to their hand dominance, and lateralized behavioral biases have
been shown in species as disparate as mice (paw usage), octopi (eye usage), and
tortoises (side rolled on during righting). However, the mechanisms by which
asymmetries are instilled in behavior are unknown, and a system for studying
behavioral handedness in a genetically tractable model system is needed. Here
we show that Drosophila melanogaster flies exhibit striking variability in
their left-right choice behavior during locomotion. Very strongly biased
""left-handed"" and ""right-handed"" individuals are common in every line assayed.
The handedness of an individual persists for its lifetime, but is not passed on
to progeny, suggesting that mechanisms other than genetics determine individual
handedness. We use the Drosophila transgenic toolkit to map a specific set of
neurons within the central complex that regulates the strength of behavioral
handedness within a line. These findings give insights into choice behaviors
and laterality in a simple model organism, and demonstrate that individuals
from isogenic populations reared under experimentally identical conditions
nevertheless display idiosyncratic behaviors.

derived to calculate the shear viscosity $\eta$ as a function of $T$ in finite
nuclei directly from the GDR width and energy at zero and finite $T$. Based on
this result, the values $\eta/s$ of specific shear viscosity in several medium
and heavy nuclei were calculated and found to decrease with increasing $T$ to
reach $(1.3 - 4)\times\hbar/(4\pi k_B)$ at $T =$ 5 MeV, that is almost the same
value obtained for quark-gluon-plasma at $T >$ 170 MeV.

silicene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs) are investigated by first-principles
calculations. When ZSiNRs are substitutionally doped by a single Al atom on
different sites in every three primitive cells, they become half-metallic in
some cases, a property that can be used in spintronic devices. More
interestingly, spin-down electrons can be transported at the Fermi energy when
the Al atom is placed on the sub-edge site. In contrast, spin-up electrons can
be transported at the Fermi energy when the ZSiNRs are doped on sites near
their center. The magnetic moment on edge is considerably suppressed if the Al
atom is doped on edge or near-edge sites. Similar results are obtained for a
phosphorus-(P) and boron-(B) doped ZSiNR. When two or more Si atoms are
replaced by Al atoms, in general the half-metallic behavior is replaced by a
metallic, spin gapless semiconducting or semiconducting one. When a line of six
Si atoms, along the ribbon's width, are replaced by Al atoms, the spin
resolution of the band structure is suppressed and the system becomes
nonmagnetic.

attracted a significant attention in the database community. A variety of
crowdsourced queries have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the
crowdsourced join query which aims to utilize humans to find all pairs of
matching objects from two collections. As a human-only solution is expensive,
we adopt a hybrid human-machine approach which first uses machines to generate
a candidate set of matching pairs, and then asks humans to label the pairs in
the candidate set as either matching or non-matching. Given the candidate
pairs, existing approaches will publish all pairs for verification to a
crowdsourcing platform. However, they neglect the fact that the pairs satisfy
transitive relations. As an example, if $o_1$ matches with $o_2$, and $o_2$
matches with $o_3$, then we can deduce that $o_1$ matches with $o_3$ without
needing to crowdsource $(o_1, o_3)$. To this end, we study how to leverage
transitive relations for crowdsourced joins. We propose a hybrid
transitive-relations and crowdsourcing labeling framework which aims to
crowdsource the minimum number of pairs to label all the candidate pairs. We
prove the optimal labeling order in an ideal setting and propose a heuristic
labeling order in practice. We devise a parallel labeling algorithm to
efficiently crowdsource the pairs following the order. We evaluate our
approaches in both simulated environment and a real crowdsourcing platform.
Experimental results show that our approaches with transitive relations can
save much more money and time than existing methods, with a little loss in the
result quality.

gravastar (gravitational-vacuum-star) which was originally proposed by Mazur
and Mottola. For definiteness, we adopt a spherical thin-shell model of a
gravastar developed by Visser and Wiltshire, which connects interior de-Sitter
geometry and exterior Schwarzschild geometry. We find that unstable circular
orbits of photons can appear around the gravastar. Then, we investigate the
optical images of the gravastar possessing unstable circular orbits, with
assuming the optically transparent surface of it and two types of optical
sources behind the gravastar: (i) an infinite optical plane and (ii) a
companion star. The main feature of the image of (i) is that a bright disk and
a dark thick ring surrounding the disk appear in the center of the region which
would be completely dark if the compact object was not the gravastar but
Schwarzschild black hole. Also in the case (ii), a small disk and arcs around
the disk appear in the region which would be completely dark for the lensing
image by Schwarzschild black hole. Because characteristic images appear inside
the gravastar in both cases, we could tell the difference between a black hole
and a gravastar with high-resolution VLBI observations near future.

pulsar emits during ""active states"" separated by nulls lasting many thousands
of rotations, while active states themselves are interrupted by nulls with a
bimodal distribution of durations; one to two rotations, or tens of rotations.
We detect no subpulse structure or flux density variations during active

on pulsed emission during inactive states. Finally, our high-quality data have
also allowed us to measure for the first time many important properties of PSR

illustrate the odd-parity electric octupole order generated in a bilayer

quadrupole arising from the Pomeranchuk instability and/or the orbital order.

transition density of the underlying asset or its moments are known in closed
form, it can be convenient and more efficient to utilize direct integration
methods to calculate the required option price expectations in a backward
time-stepping algorithm. This paper presents a simple, robust and efficient
algorithm that can be applied for pricing many exotic options by computing the
expectations using Gauss-Hermite integration quadrature applied on a cubic
spline interpolation. The algorithm is fully explicit but does not suffer the
inherent instability of the explicit finite difference counterpart. A `free'
bonus of the algorithm is that it already contains the function for fast and
accurate interpolation of multiple solutions required by many discretely
monitored path dependent options. For illustrations, we present examples of
pricing a series of American options with either Bermudan or continuous
exercise features, and a series of exotic path-dependent options of target
accumulation redemption note (TARN). Results of the new method are compared
with Monte Carlo and finite difference methods, including some of the most
advanced or best known finite difference algorithms in the literature. The
comparison shows that, despite its simplicity, the new method can rival with
some of the best finite difference algorithms in accuracy and at the same time
it is significantly faster. Virtually the same algorithm can be applied to
price other path-dependent financial contracts such as Asian options and
variable annuities.

active galactic nuclei (AGN), we propose a novel approach for black hole (BH)
mass estimation using two filtered luminosities computed from single-epoch (SE)
AGN spectra around the Hbeta region. We found that the two optimal-filter
luminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad
line region, BLR) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH
mass estimator. The major advantages of this new recipe over traditional SE BH
mass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) it
has a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2) it
is extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the
spectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with
low signal-to-noise spectra. The combination of the two luminosities can also
cancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introduced
by uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated
the traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum
(FWHM) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that
using the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100 (derived from fitting the BLR
radius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion and
SE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and
2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic
scatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses. We compared
different estimators and discussed their applications to the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) quasar sample. Due to the limitations of the current RM sample,
application of any SE recipe calibrated against RM masses to distant quasars
should be treated with caution.

with different recovery resources, which allow them to recover from a virus
with different rates. In this paper, we aim to understand know how to allocate
the limited recovery resources to efficiently prevent the spreading of
epidemics. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model
on directed scale-free networks. In the classic SIS model, a susceptible node
can be infected by an infected neighbor with the infection rate $\beta$ and an
infected node can be recovered to be susceptible again with the recovery rate
$\delta$. In the steady state a fraction $y_\infty$ of nodes are infected,
which shows how severely the network is infected. We propose to allocate the
recovery rate $\delta_i$ for node $i$ according to its indegree and
outdegree-$\delta_i\scriptsize{\sim}k_{i,in}^{\alpha_{in}}k_{i,out}^{\alpha_{out}}$,
given the finite average recovery rate $\langle\delta\rangle$ representing the
limited recovery resources over the whole network. We find that, by tuning the
two scaling exponents $\alpha_{in}$ and $\alpha_{out}$, we can always reduce
the infection fraction $y_\infty$ thus reducing the extent of infections,
comparing to the homogeneous recovery rates allocation. Moreover, we can find
our optimal strategy via the optimal choice of the exponent $\alpha_{in}$ and
$\alpha_{out}$. Our optimal strategy indicates that when the recovery resources
are sufficient, more resources should be allocated to the nodes with a larger
indegree or outdegree, but when the recovery resource is very limited, only the
nodes with a larger outdegree should be equipped with more resources. We also
find that our optimal strategy works better when the recovery resources are
sufficient but not yet able to make the epidemic die out, and when the indegree
outdegree correlation is small.

We find rich hole dynamics, ranging from rotation to swinging motion. The
motion of the hole depends on the final energy and the spin of the
photoelectron and can be controlled by the laser frequency and intensity.
Crucially, hole rotation is a purely non-adiabatic effect, completely missing
in the framework of quasistatic (adiabatic) tunneling theories. We explore the
possibility to use hole rotation as a clock for measuring ionization time.
Analysing the relationship between the relative phases in different ionization
channels we show that in the case of short-range electron-core interaction the
hole is always initially aligned along the instantaneous direction of the laser
field, signifying zero delays in ionization. Finally, we show that strong-field
ionization in circular fields creates spin currents (i.e. different flow of
spin-up and spin-down density in space) in the ions. This phenomenon is
intimately related to the production of spin-polarized electrons in strong
laser fields [Barth I and Smirnova O 2013 Phys. Rev. A 88 013401]. We
demonstrate that rich spin dynamics of electrons and holes produced during

answering whether small perturbations when a system is in a given quantitative
state will push the system permanently to a different quantitative state.
However, typically the quantitative state of socioeconomic systems is subject
to constant change. Therefore, a key stability question that has been
under-investigated is how strong the conditions of a system itself can change
before the system moves to a qualitatively different behavior, i.e., how
structurally stable the systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to
investigate the structural stability of socioeconomic systems formed by the
network of interactions among agents competing for resources. We measure the
structural stability of the system as the range of conditions in the
distribution and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative
behavior in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time.
To illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the global
socioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing for
multinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate that the
structural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of
competition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources.
Importantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global
socioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of
resources. We believe this work provides a methodological basis to develop
sustainable strategies for socioeconomic systems subject to constantly changing
conditions.

For
inference of a model which involves an unobserved stochastic process, the
standard implementation uses the particle filter to propose new values for the
stochastic process, and MCMC moves to propose new values for the parameters. We
show how particle MCMC can be generalised beyond this. Our key idea is to
introduce new latent variables. We then use the MCMC moves to update the latent
variables, and the particle filter to propose new values for the parameters and
stochastic process given the latent variables. A generic way of defining these
latent variables is to model them as pseudo-observations of the parameters or
of the stochastic process. By choosing the amount of information these latent
variables have about the parameters and the stochastic process we can often
improve the mixing of the particle MCMC algorithm by trading off the Monte
Carlo error of the particle filter and the mixing of the MCMC moves. We show
that using pseudo-observations within particle MCMC can improve its efficiency
in certain scenarios: dealing with initialisation problems of the particle
filter; speeding up the mixing of particle Gibbs when there is strong
dependence between the parameters and the stochastic process; and enabling
further MCMC steps to be used within the particle filter.

pressure is investigated based on first-principles phonon calculations. Spin
configurations of the PM phase are approximated using a binary special
quasi-random structure (SQS) with a supercell approach. The behavior of phonon
modes can be associated with pressure-induced phase transitions to the
face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures as
follows: For the PM phase, it is found that the low-frequency transverse mode
at the N point (N$_4^-$ mode), which corresponds to a bcc-hcp phase transition
pathway, exhibits strong softening under isotropic volume compression. The
frequency of this mode becomes zero by $2\%$ volume decrease within the
harmonic approximation. This result is not consistent with the experimental
fact that phase transition from the PM bcc to hcp phases does not occur under
volume compression. The seeming contradiction can be explained only when
anharmonic behavior of the N$_4^-$ mode is taken into consideration; a
potential energy curve along the N$_4^-$ mode becomes closer to a double-well
shape for the PM phase under the volume compression. On the other hand,
softening of the longitudinal mode at the 2/3[111] point under the volume
compression is also found for the PM phase, which indicates the
pressure-induced bcc-fcc phase transition along this mode. Such behaviors are
not seen in ferromagnetic (FM) bcc Fe, implying that the magnetic structure
plays essential roles on the phase transition mechanism.

improve the spectrum utilization. It however may be vulnerable to security
problems as the primary and secondary network access the same resource.
Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of a cognitive
radio network in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV) who illegally listens to
the primary user (PU) communication in which the transmit power of the
secondary transmitter (SU-Tx) is subject to the joint constraint of peak
transmit power of the SU-Tx and outage probability of the PU. Accordingly, an
adaptive transmit power policy and an analytical expression of symbol error
probability are derived for the SU. Most importantly, security evaluations of
primary network in terms of the probability of existence of non-zero secrecy
capacity and outage probability of secrecy capacity are obtained. Numerical
results reveal a fact that the security of the primary network does not only
depends on the channel mean powers between primary and secondary networks, but
also strongly depends on the channel condition of the SU-Tx to EAV link and
transmit power policy of the SU-Tx.

compound with an unusually high Neel temperature of 27 K. Here we study the
stability of the unusual magnetic order by means of controlled doping, and we
uncover further surprising attributes of this phase transition. The heat
capacity, resistivity and $\mu$SR measurements reveal an onset of magnetic
ordering below 23 K, while a broad peak at 31 K (i.e. above $T_N$), has been
observed in the temperature dependent susceptibility, indicating an opening of
a spin gap above $T_N$. Our important finding, from the neutron diffraction, is
that the compound orders antiferromagnetically with a propagation vector $\bf
k$ = (1 0 0) and the ordered state moment is 0.20(1)$\mu_B$ along the $b-$axis.
This is in sharp contrast to the undoped compound, which shows AFM ordering at
27 K with the ordered moment of 0.39(3)$\mu_B$ along the $c-$axis. Similar to
CeRu$_2$Al$_{10}$ our inelastic neutron scattering study on the Re doped shows
a sharp spin gap-type excitation near 8 meV at 5 K, but with slightly reduced
intensity compared to the undoped compound. Further the excitation broadens and
shifts to lower energy ($\le$ 4 meV) near 35 K. These results suggest that the
low temperature magnetic properties of the hole doped sample is governed by the
competition between the anisotropic hybridization effect and crystal field
anisotropy as observed in hole-doped CeOs$_2$Al$_{10}$.

establish a network theory for quantum transport systems where typically the

us to study quantum feedback networks where fields arrive at ports in
input-output pairs, which is then just a specially case of the uni-directional

traditional approaches which tends to view the components in quantum transport
as scatterers for the various fields, in the process allows us to consider
emission and absorption of field quanta by these components. The quantum
feedback network theory is applicable to both Bose and Fermi fields, moreover

theory. To represent the bulk phases of these systems, we use the generalized
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model that incorporates the Hubbard-like onsite Coulomb
energy U in addition to the spin-orbit coupling term that causes band
inversion. The topological and Mott insulating phases are realized by
appropriately choosing smaller and larger values of U, respectively. As
expected, the interface is found to be metallic because of the localized edge
state. When the Coulomb energy in the Mott insulator is close to the critical
value, however, this edge state exhibits its largest amplitude deep within the
Mott insulator rather than at the interface. This finding corresponds to a new
type of proximity effect induced by the neighboring topological band insulator
and demonstrates that, as a result of spin-orbit coupling within the Mott
insulator, several layers near the interface convert from the Mott insulating
phase to a topological insulating phase. Moreover, we argue that the ordinary
proximity effect, whereby a Kondo peak is induced in a Mott insulator by
neighboring metallic states, is accompanied by an additional reverse proximity
effect, by which the Kondo peak gives rise to an enhancement of the density of
states in the neighboring metallic layer.

thermally-evolving, viscous disc models. The simulations incorporate type I
migration (including corotation torques and their saturation), gap formation,
type II migration, gas accretion onto planetary cores, and gas disc dispersal
through photoevaporation. The aim is to examine whether or not the oligarchic
growth scenario, when combined with self-consistent disc models and up-to-date
prescriptions for disc-driven migration, can produce planetary systems similar
to those that have been observed.
  The results correlate with the initial disc mass. Low mass discs form
close-packed systems of terrestrial-mass planets and super-Earths. Higher mass
discs form multiple generations of planets, with masses in the range 10 < mp <
45M_Earth. These planets generally type I migrate into the inner disc, because
of corotation torque saturation, where they open gaps and type II migrate into
the central star. Occasionally, a final generation of low-to-intermediate mass
planets forms and survives due to gas disc dispersal. No surviving gas giants
were formed in our simulations. Analysis shows that these planets can only
survive migration if a core forms and experiences runaway gas accretion at
orbital radii r > 10 au prior to the onset of type II migration.
  We conclude that planet growth above masses mp > 10M_Earth during the gas
disc life time leads to corotation torque saturation and rapid inward
migration, preventing the formation and survival of gas giants. This result is
in contrast to the success in forming gas giant planets displayed by some
population synthesis models. This discrepancy arises, in part, because the type
II migration prescription adopted in the population synthesis models causes too
large a reduction in the migration speed when in the planet dominated regime.

game where each UE allocates its available transmit power over the set of
assigned subcarriers so as to maximize its individual utility (defined as the
user's throughput per Watt of transmit power) subject to minimum-rate
constraints. In this framework, the relevant solution concept is that of Debreu
equilibrium, a generalization of Nash equilibrium which accounts for the case
where an agent's set of possible actions depends on the actions of its
opponents. Since the problem at hand might not be feasible, Debreu equilibria
do not always exist. However, using techniques from fractional programming, we
provide a characterization of equilibrial power allocation profiles when they
do exist. In particular, Debreu equilibria are found to be the fixed points of
a water-filling best response operator whose water level is a function of
minimum rate constraints and circuit power. Moreover, we also describe a set of
sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Debreu equilibria
exploiting the contraction properties of the best response operator. This
analysis provides the necessary tools to derive a power allocation scheme that
steers the network to equilibrium in an iterative and distributed manner
without the need for any centralized processing. Numerical simulations are then
used to validate the analysis and assess the performance of the proposed
algorithm as a function of the system parameters.

an effective low-energy Hamiltonian for the Kondo-lattice model with a depleted

singlets are formed at the spinful sites which bind a fraction of conduction
electrons. The low-energy theory describes the scattering of the excess
conduction electrons at the Kondo singlets as well as their effective
interactions generated by virtual excitations of the singlets. Besides the
Hubbard term, already discussed by Nozieres, we find a ferromagnetic Heisenberg

and, in more than one dimensions, three- and four-site interactions. The
interaction term can be cast into highly symmetric and formally simple
spin-only form using the spin of the bonding orbital symmetrically centered
around the Kondo singlet. This spin is non-local. We show that, depending on
the geometry of the depleted lattice, spatial overlap of the non-local spins
around different Kondo singlets may cause ferromagnetic order. This is
sustained by a rigorous argument, applicable to the half-filled model, by a
variational analysis of the stability of the fully polarized Fermi sea of
excess conduction electrons as well as by exact diagonalization of the

perspective. We show that the minimum broadcast rate of an index coding problem
for different variations of the problem such as non-linear, scalar, and vector
index code, can be upper bounded by the minimum broadcast rate of another index
coding problem when there exists a homomorphism from the complement of the side
information graph of the first problem to that of the second problem. As a
result, we show that several upper bounds on scalar and vector index code
problem are special cases of one of our main theorems.
  For the linear scalar index coding problem, it has been shown in [1] that the
binary linear index of a graph is equal to a graph theoretical parameter called
minrank of the graph. For undirected graphs, in [2] it is shown that
$\mathrm{minrank}(G) = k$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from
$\bar{G}$ to a predefined graph $\bar{G}_k$. Combining these two results, it
follows that for undirected graphs, all the digraphs with linear index of at
most k coincide with the graphs $G$ for which there exists a homomorphism from
$\bar{G}$ to $\bar{G}_k$. In this paper, we give a direct proof to this result
that works for digraphs as well.
  We show how to use this classification result to generate lower bounds on
scalar and vector index. In particular, we provide a lower bound for the scalar
index of a digraph in terms of the chromatic number of its complement.
  Using our framework, we show that by changing the field size, linear index of
a digraph can be at most increased by a factor that is independent from the
number of the nodes.

transit events of TrES-2. Eight 0.2 - 2.2-m telescopes located at six
observatories in Germany, Poland and Spain were used. In addition, we analysed
18 quarters (Q0-Q17) of observational data from NASA's space telescope Kepler
including 435 individual transit events and 11 publicly available ground-based
light curves. Assuming different limb darkening (LD) laws we performed an
analysis for all light curves and redetermined the parameters of the system. We
also carried out a joint analysis of the ground- and space-based data. The long
observation period of seven years (2007-2013) allowed a very precise
redetermination of the transit ephemeris. For a total of 490 transit light
curves of TrES-2, the time of transit mid-point was determined. The transit
times support neither variations on long time-scale nor on short time-scales.
The nearly continuous observations of Kepler show no statistically significant
increase or decrease in the orbital inclination i and the transit duration D.
Only the transit depth shows a slight increase which could be an indication of
an increasing stellar activity. In general, system parameters obtained by us

of the future an online algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain
competitive ratio. Using advice complexity, we define the first online
complexity class, AOC. The class includes independent set, vertex cover,
dominating set, and several others as complete problems. AOC-complete problems
are hard, since a single wrong answer by the online algorithm can have
devastating consequences. For each of these problems, we show that
$\log\left(1+(c-1)^{c-1}/c^{c}\right)n=\Theta (n/c)$ bits of advice are
necessary and sufficient (up to an additive term of $O(\log n)$) to achieve a
competitive ratio of $c$.
  The results are obtained by introducing a new string guessing problem related
to those of Emek et al. (TCS 2011) and B\""ockenhauer et al. (TCS 2014). It
turns out that this gives a powerful but easy-to-use method for providing both
upper and lower bounds on the advice complexity of an entire class of online
problems, the AOC-complete problems.
  Previous results of Halld\'orsson et al. (TCS 2002) on online independent
set, in a related model, imply that the advice complexity of the problem is
$\Theta (n/c)$. Our results improve on this by providing an exact formula for
the higher-order term. For online disjoint path allocation, B\""ockenhauer et
al. (ISAAC 2009) gave a lower bound of $\Omega (n/c)$ and an upper bound of
$O((n\log c)/c)$ on the advice complexity. We improve on the upper bound by a
factor of $\log c$. For the remaining problems, no bounds on their advice
complexity were previously known.

Thus, participants can be unaware that other participants have not received the

We present a deterministic solution that allows all participants to use a
default strategy when other participants have not received on time the complete

its output according to the effect of message omission failures so that the
disagreement period occurs for no longer than a constant time (of the order of
milliseconds) that only depends on the message delay. We formally show the
correctness and perform experiments to corroborate its efficiency. We explain
how the proposed solution can be used on vehicular platooning to attain high

spread of airborne infections (e.g., influenza) because of the high mixing
rates of school children. The closure of schools has therefore been proposed as
efficient mitigation strategy, with however high social and economic costs:
alternative, less disruptive interventions are highly desirable. The recent
availability of high-resolution contact networks in school environments
provides an opportunity to design micro-interventions and compare the outcomes
of alternative mitigation measures. We consider mitigation measures that
involve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily
available information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in
a class. We focus on the case of a primary school for which we have
high-resolution data on the close-range interactions of children and teachers.
We simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population by using
an SEIR model with asymptomatics and compare the outcomes of different
mitigation strategies. We find that targeted class closure affords strong
mitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time -equal to the
sum of the average infectious and latent durations- whenever two infectious
individuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70%
and strongly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all
classes of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the
whole school. Targeted class closure strategies based on readily available
information on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing
patterns, such as the grade structure of the school, can be almost as effective
as whole-school closure, at a much lower cost. This may inform public health
policies for the management and mitigation of influenza-like outbreaks in the
community.

Quantifier Elimination (PQE). Given a number n, the CRR method finds a
counterexample of length less or equal to n or proves that such a

developed earlier can be efficiently applied to derivation of constraining
clauses for transition relations of realistic benchmarks.
  One of the most appealing features of the CRR method is that it can
potentially find long counterexamples. This is the area where it can beat model
checkers computing reachable states (or their approximations as in IC3) or
SAT-based methods of bounded model checking. PQE cannot be efficiently
simulated by a SAT-solver. This is important because the current research in

cross section weighted with the collisional momentum transfer. We investigate
the electric conductivity dependence on the microscopic details of the 2-body

particles. We find that the RTA underestimates considerably $\sigma_{el}$; for
example at screening masses $m_D \sim \,T$ such underestimation can be as large

In order to extract this transport coefficient, we employ the Green-Kubo
formalism and, independently, a method motivated by the classical definition of
electric conductivity. To this end we evaluate the static electric diffusion
current upon the influence of an electric field. Both methods give identical
results. For the first time, we obtain numerically the Drude electric
conductivity formula for an ultrarelativistic gas of quarks and gluons
employing constant isotropic binary cross sections. Furthermore, we extract the

screened binary and inelastic, radiative $2\leftrightarrow 3$ perturbative QCD

contraction-towards-the-origin of the electronic charge in hydrogenic systems

minima) in the electron density of the excited states of these systems. In
addition we point out the (largely ignored) gradient reduction of the charge
density near and far the nucleus. In this work we quantify these effects by
means of single (Fisher information) and composite (Fisher-Shannon complexity
and plane, LMC complexity) information-theoretic measures. While the Fisher
information measures the gradient content of the density, the (dimensionless)
composite information-theoretic quantities grasp two-fold facets of the
electronic distribution: The Fisher-Shannon complexity measures the combined
balance of the gradient content and the total extent of the electronic charge,
and the LMC complexity quantifies the disequilibrium jointly with the spreading
of the density in the configuration space. Opposite to other complexity notions
(e.g., computational and algorithmic complexities), these two quantities
describe intrinsic properties of the system because they do not depend on the
context but they are functionals of the electron density. Moreover, they are
closely related to the intuitive notion of complexity because they are minimum
for the two extreme (or least complex) distributions of perfect order and
maximum disorder.

separated by a distance L. The walls exert competing surface fields so that one
wall is attractive and may be completely wet by liquid (it is solvophilic)
while the other is solvophobic. Such asymmetric confinement is sometimes termed
a `Janus Interface'. The second wall is: (i) purely repulsive and therefore
completely dry (contact angle 180 degrees) or (ii) weakly attractive and
partially dry (the contact angle is typically in the range 160-170 degrees). At
low temperatures, but above the bulk triple point, we find using classical
density functional theory (DFT) that the fluid is highly structured in the
liquid part of the density profile. In case (i) a sequence of layering
transitions occurs: as L is increased at fixed chemical potential (mu) close to
bulk gas--liquid coexistence, new layers of liquid-like density develop
discontinuously. In contrast to confinement between identical walls, the
solvation force is repulsive for all wall separations and jumps discontinuously
at each layering transition and the excess grand potential exhibits many
metastable minima as a function of the adsorption. For a fixed temperature
T=0.56Tc, where Tc is the bulk critical temperature, we determine the
transition lines in the L, mu plane. In case (ii) we do not find layering
transitions and the solvation force oscillates about zero. We discuss how our
mean-field DFT results might be altered by including effects of fluctuations
and comment on how the phenomenology we have revealed might be relevant for
experimental and simulation studies of water confined between hydrophilic and
hydrophobic substrates, emphasizing it is important to distinguish between

metallicity, and spatial distributions of \ion{H}{ii}\ regions (hereafter
HIIRs) as observed in M31, we compute the apparent metallicities that we would
obtain when the spectrum of a target region is blended with those of
surrounding HIIRs within the length scale of typical spatial resolution. When
the spatial resolution of spectroscopy is $\lesssim$ 0.5\,kpc, which is typical
for the existing studies of CC SN sites, we find that the apparent
metallicities reflect the metallicities of target regions, but with significant
systematic uncertainties in some cases. When the spatial resolution is
$\gtrsim$ 1.0 kpc, regardless of the target regions (which has a wide range of
metallicity that spans $\sim$ 0.6 dex for the M31 HIIRs), we always obtain the
apparent metallicities similar to the average metallicity of the M31 HIIRs.
Given that the apparent metallicities measured with $\gtrsim$\,kpc scale
resolution do not necessarily reflect the immediate environment of the stellar
explosions, the current observational estimates of high metallicities for some
of the long GRB host galaxies do {\em not} rule out the hypothesis that the
long GRBs are exclusively born in a low-metallicity environment.

solution rather than scattered-field computations ('right-hand-side'
computations) and that as the bandwidth of interest becomes narrower than 50%
of the center frequency, ET-AIM computational costs become significantly
smaller than TD-AIM ones. ET-AIM is also shown to efficiently solve large and

different dimensional non- commutative inspired spacetimes. It is well known
that the noncommutativity of the space is an outcome of string theory and it
replaced the usual point like object by a smeared object. Here we have chosen
Lorentzian distribution as the density function in the noncommutative inspired
space- time. We have observed that the wormhole solutions exist only in four
and five dimension, however, higher than fine dimension no wormhole exists. For
five dimensional spacetime, we get a wormhole for a restricted region. In usual
four dimensional spacetime, we get a stable wormhole which is asymptotically
flat.

have pushed towards replacement of conventional batteries with energy
harvesters in particular, vibratory energy harvesters. In the recent years,
nonlinearity has been intentionally introduced into the otherwise linear energy
harvesters in the hope of increasing the frequency bandwidth and power density.
However, fundamental limits on the harvestable energy of a harvester subjected
to an arbitrary excitation force is yet unknown. Understanding of these limits
is not only essential for assessment of the technology potential, but also
provides a broader prospective on the current harvesting mechanisms and
guidance in their improvement. Here we derive the fundamental limits on output
power of an ideal energy harvester, and develop an analysis framework for
simple computation of this limit for more sophisticated set-ups. We show that
the optimal harvester maximizes the harvested energy through a mechanical
analogue of 'buy low-sell high' strategy. Inspired by this strategy we propose
a novel concept of latch-assisted harvesting that is shown to harvest energy
more efficiently than its linear and bistable counterparts over a wider range
of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.
