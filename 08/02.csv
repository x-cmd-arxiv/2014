Algol binaries involved calculations of the predicted dynamical behavior of the
gravitational flow and the dynamics at the impact site, analysis of the
velocity images constructed from tomography, and the influence on the tomograms
of orbital inclination, systemic velocity, orbital coverage, and shadowing. The
H$\alpha$ tomograms revealed eight sources: chromospheric emission, a gas
stream along the gravitational trajectory, a star-stream impact region, a bulge
of absorption or emission around the mass-gaining star, a Keplerian accretion
disk, an absorption zone associated with hotter gas, a disk-stream impact
region, and a hot spot where the stream strikes the edge of a disk. We
described several methods used to extract the physical properties of the
emission sources directly from the velocity images, including S-wave analysis,
the creation of simulated velocity tomograms from hydrodynamic simulations, and
the use of synthetic spectra with tomography to sequentially extract the
separate sources of emission from the velocity image. In summary, the
tomography images have revealed results that cannot be explained solely by
gravitational effects: chromospheric emission moving with the mass-losing star,
a gas stream deflected from the gravitational trajectory, and alternating
behavior between stream state and disk state. Our results demonstrate that
magnetic effects cannot be ignored in these interacting binaries.

nonabelian dark matter with typical mass ~ 1-10 GeV (higher values being
allowed in some models) and eV-scale splittings that arise naturally from the
breaking of the nonabelian gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing between the photon
and the hidden sector gauge bosons can occur through a dimension-5 or 6
operator. Radiative decays of the excited states proceed through transition
magnetic moments that appear at one loop. The decaying excited states can
either be primordial or else produced by upscattering of the lighter dark
matter states. These models are significantly constrained by direct dark matter
searches or cosmic microwave background distortions, and are potentially
testable in fixed target experiments that search for hidden photons. We note
that the upscattering mechanism could be distinguished from decays in future
observations if sources with different dark matter velocity dispersions seem to

Alice and Bob's measurement outcomes. Repeated use of this protocol for each
spatial axis of Alice allows transfer of a complete 3-dimensional reference
frame, up to inversion of each of the axes. The technological complexity of
this protocol is similar to that needed for BB84 quantum key distribution, and

Fermat in the decade from 1630 to 1640, but modern number theory, that is, the
systematic and mathematically rigorous development of the subject from
fundamental properties of the integers, began in 1801 with the appearance of
the landmark text of Gauss, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. A major part of the
Disquisitiones deals with quadratic residues and nonresidues. Beginning with
these fundamental contributions of Gauss, the study of quadratic residues and
nonresidues has subsequently led directly to many of the key ideas and
techniques that are used everywhere in number theory today, and the primary
goal of these lectures is to use this study as a window through which to view
the development of some of those ideas and techniques. In pursuit of that goal,
we will employ methods from elementary, analytic, and combinatorial number
theory, as well as methods from the theory of algebraic numbers.

More recently, BICs that that are both robust and not symmetry-protected

has symmetry-protected BICs. Here we show that both types of BICs in such

generated or annihilated by making large changes in the system parameters, and
then only according to strict rules, which we derive and test numerically. Our

Water Mark (HWM) convergents of Champernowne's Constant in various bases (Cb),
specifically in bases 2 through 124. The convergents are formed by truncating
the Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) of Cb immediately before the CFE HWMs.
These patterns have been extended from the known patterns in the CFE HWMs of
Champernowne's Constant in base ten. We show that the patterns may be used to
efficiently calculate the CFE coefficients of Cb, and to calculate and predict
the lengths of the HWM coefficients, the number of correct digits of Cb as
calculated by the convergent, and the convergent error. We have discovered that
minor corrections to the pattern formulations in base 10 are required for some
bases, and these corrections are presented and discussed. The resulting
formulations may be used to make the calculations for Cb in any base.

near-resonant type of multi-mode pulsation, where two (or sometimes more)
periodic oscillations with slightly different frequencies gradually slip in
phase, producing a beat frequency type of modulation. Typically one of these
oscillations is strongly non-sinusoidal. Two oscillations are sufficient for
the standard Blazhko effect; additional oscillations are needed to explain
multi-frequency modulation. Previous work on this hypothesis by Arthur N. Cox
and others is extended in this paper by developing a simple (non-hydro) model
that can accurately reproduce several important features found in Kepler data
for RR Lyr, including the pulsation waveform, the upper and lower Blazhko
envelope functions and the motion, disappearance and reappearance of the bump
feature. The non-sinusoidal oscillation is probably generated by the
fundamental mode and the other oscillations are probably generated by nonradial
modes. This model provides an explanation for the strong asymmetry observed in
the side peak spectra of most RR Lyrae stars. The motion and disappearance of
the bump feature are shown to be an illusion, just an artifact of combining the
oscillations. V445 Lyr is presented as an example with dual modulation. The
mysterious double-maxima waveform observed for this star is explained,
providing additional strong evidence that this beating-modes hypothesis is
correct. Problems with other recent explanations of the Blazhko effect are
discussed in some detail.

sphere-plate geometry was implemented using spheres with diameters of 1.3 mm,
5.0 mm, and 76 mm. The MicroBooNE cryogenic system allowed measurements to be
taken at a variety of electronegative contamination levels ranging from a few

1)it is inherently vectorial, and therefore better suited for full vectorial
(beyond paraxial) electromagnetic problems, 2) it provides closed-form
solutions, and is therefore extremely fast. Incidentally, the method reveals
that a metasurface is fundamentally capable to transform up to four independent
wave triplets (incident, reflected and refracted waves). In addition, the paper
provides the closed-form expressions relating the synthesized susceptibilities
and the scattering parameters simulated within periodic boundary conditions,
which allows one to design the scattering particles realizing the desired
susceptibilities. The versatility of the method is illustrated by examples of
metasurfaces achieving the following transformations: generalized refraction,
reciprocal and non-reciprocal polarization rotation, Bessel vortex beam

The high eccentricities of many S stars mean that relativistic effects peak
strongly around pericentre; for example, orbit precession is not a smooth

enriched in 15N compared to the Sun and Jupiter. While the solar and jovian
nitrogen isotope ratio is believed to represent the composition of the
protosolar nebula, a still unidentified process has caused 15N-enrichment in
the solids. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the variations,
including chemical fractionation. However, observational results that constrain
the fractionation models are scarce. While there is evidence of 15N-enrichment
in prestellar cores, it is unclear how the signature evolves into the
protostellar phases. Our aim is to measure the 14N/15N ratio around three
nearby, embedded low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. Isotopologues of HCN and
HNC were used to probe the 14N/15N ratio. A selection of H13CN, HC15N, HN13C,
and H15NC transitions was observed with the APEX telescope. The 14N/15N ratios
were derived from the integrated intensities assuming a standard 12C/13C ratio.
The assumption of optically thin emission was verified using radiative transfer
modeling and hyperfine structure fitting. Two sources, IRAS 16293A and R CrA
IRS7B, show 15N-enrichment by a factor of around 1.5-2.5 in both HCN and HNC
with respect to the solar composition. Solar composition cannot be excluded for
the third source, OMC-3 MMS6. Furthermore, there are indications of a trend
toward increasing 14N/15N ratios with increasing outer envelope temperature.
The enhanced 15N abundances in HCN and HNC found in two Class~0 sources
(14N/15N of 160-290) and the tentative trend toward a temperature-dependent
14N/15N ratio are consistent with the chemical fractionation scenario, but
14N/15N ratios from additional tracers are indispensable for testing the
models. Spatially resolved observations are needed to distinguish between
chemical fractionation and isotope-selective photochemistry.

scale supersymmetry breaking. While such models may be difficult to test in
colliders, we propose looking for signatures at much lower energies. We show
that a keV line in the X-ray spectrum of galaxy clusters (such as the recently
disputed 3.5 keV observation) can have its origin in a universal string axion
coupled to a hidden supersymmetry breaking sector. A linear combination of the
string axion and an additional axion in the hidden sector remains light,
obtaining a mass of order 10 keV through supersymmetry breaking dynamics. In
order to explain the X-ray line, the scale of supersymmetry breaking must be
about $10^{11-12}$ GeV. This motivates high scale supersymmetry as in pure
gravity mediation or minimal split supersymmetry and is consistent with all
current limits. Since the axion mass is controlled by a dynamical mass scale,
this mass can be much higher during inflation, avoiding isocurvature (and
domain wall) problems associated with high scale inflation. In an appendix we
present a mechanism for dilaton stabilization that additionally leads to
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ modifications of the gaugino mass from anomaly mediation.

that conformal pinning arrays exhibit enhanced pinning compared to

conformal arrays arises from the continuum of length scales introduced into the
arrays by the conformal transformation, allowing for a broad range of local
commensuration effects. At higher vortex fillings above the range of conformal
effectiveness, we show that a non-conformal rectangular gradient array exhibits
strong pinning due to a novel commensuration effect and vortex ordering. Using
transport simulations where vortices are driven along the gradient and at an
angle to the gradient, we confirm the effectiveness of conformal pinning at
increasing the critical current. For a rotated drive, the gradient arrays
produce a strong vortex guidance effect in the direction perpendicular to the

ground state and excited states of the atomic nucleus, such as masses, radii,
deformations and giant resonance energies. SCMF models are based on the
independent particle picture where nucleons are assumed to move in a
self-generated average potential. In the first part of this work, we apply a
state-of-the-art SCMF approach, based on the Skyrme effective interaction, to
two different excitations (viz. the pygmy dipole resonance and the isovector
giant quadrupole resonance), investigating their relation with the nuclear
matter symmetry energy, which corresponds to the energy cost for changing
protons into neutrons and is a key parameter for the nuclear equation of state.
However, SCMF models present well known limitations which require the inclusion
of further dynamical correlations, e.g. the ones coming from the interweaving
between single-particle and collective degrees of freedom (particle-vibration
coupling - PVC). In the second part of this work, we report on the application
to inclusive (namely, the strength function of giant resonances) and exclusive
(the gamma decay of giant resonances) observables of a new self-consistent
model based on the PVC idea in the Skyrme framework. In our model we use an
effective interaction fitted at mean-field level to some selected experimental
data. In principle, when these interactions are used in beyond mean-field
theories, one would need to re-determine the parameters of the interaction at
the same level of approximation. Moreover, due to the zero-range nature of the
employed interaction, divergences arise. In the last and most innovative part
of this thesis, we develop, for the first time in finite nuclei, a possible way
to cure the divergences, paving the way to the possibility of producing an
effective interaction fitted at PVC level.

agent-based simulations to study the performance of a group of agents in

the best performing agent in its influence network. There is a complex
trade-off between the number of agents N and the imitation probability p, and
for the optimal balance between these parameters we observe a thirtyfold
diminution in the computational cost to find the solution of the
cryptarithmetic problem as compared with the independent search. If those
parameters are chosen far from the optimal setting, however, then imitative
learning can impair greatly the performance of the group. The observed
maladaptation of imitative learning for large N offers an alternative

This is of
particular interest in finance, as the increasing complexity of financial
systems is coupled with information overload. Opinion formation, therefore, is
not always the result of optimal information processing. On the contrary,
agents are boundedly rational and naturally tend to observe and imitate others
in order to gain further insights. Hence, a certain degree of interaction,
which can be envisioned as a network, occurs within the system. Opinions, the
interaction network and prices in financial markets are then heavily
intertwined and influence one another. We build on previous contributions on
adaptive systems, where agents have hetereogenous beliefs, and introduce a
dynamic confidence network that captures the interaction and shapes the opinion
patterns. The analytical framework we adopt for modeling the interaction is
rooted in the opinion dynamics problem. This will allow us to introduce a
nonlinear model where the confidence network, opinion dynamics and price
formation coevolve in time. A key aspect of the model is the classification of
agents according to their topological role in the network, therefore showing
that topology matters in determining how of opinions and prices will coevolve.
We illustrate the dynamics via simulations, discussing the stylized facts in
finance that the model is able to capture. Last, we propose an empirical

systems, it is desirable to have coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics simulation
approaches appropriate for the study of complex systems. This paper examines
the use of two common truncated Lennard-Jones (WCA) potentials to describe a
pair of colloidal particles in a thermal bath of depletants. The shifted-WCA
model is the steeper of the two repulsive potentials considered, while the
combinatorial-WCA model is the softer. It is found that the depletion-induced
well depth for the combinatorial-WCA model is significantly deeper than the
shifted-WCA model because the resulting overlap of the colloids yields extra
accessible volume for depletants. For both shifted- and combinatorial-WCA
simulations, the second virial coefficients and pair potentials between
colloids are demonstrated to be well approximated by the Morphometric
Thermodynamics (MT) model. This agreement suggests that the presence of
depletants can be accurately modelled in MD simulations by implicitly including
them through simple, analytical MT forms for depletion-induced interactions.
Although both WCA potentials are found to be effective generic coarse-grained
simulation approaches for studying depletion effects in complicated soft matter
systems, combinatorial-WCA is the more efficient approach as depletion effects
are enhanced at lower depletant densities. The findings indicate that for soft
matter systems that are better modelled by potentials with some
compressibility, predictions from hard-sphere systems could greatly
underestimate the magnitude of depletion effects at a given depletant density.

electric potential due to arbitrary-located point electrodes in
three-dimensional cylindrically stratified media, where the radial thickness
and the medium resistivity of each cylindrical layer can vary by many orders of
magnitude. A basic roadblock for robust potential computations in such
scenarios is the poor scaling of modified-Bessel functions used for computation
of the semi-analytical solution, for extreme arguments and/or orders. To
accommodate this, we construct a set of rescaled versions of modified-Bessel
functions, which avoids underflows and overflows in finite precision
arithmetic, and minimizes round-off errors. In addition, several extrapolation
methods are applied and compared to expedite the numerical evaluation of the
(otherwise slowly convergent) associated Sommerfeld-type integrals. The
proposed algorithm is verified in a number of scenarios relevant to geophysical
exploration, but the general formulation presented is also applicable to other
problems governed by Poisson equation such as Newtonian gravity, heat flow, and
potential flow in fluid mechanics, involving cylindrically stratified

a complex and surprising form when the Hurst function is greatly irregular.
Nevertheless, most of the literature devoted to the subject considers
sufficiently smooth cases which lead to sample paths locally similar to a
fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The main goal of this paper is therefore to
extend these results to a more general frame and consider any type of
continuous Hurst function. More specifically, we mainly focus on obtaining a
complete characterization of the pointwise H\""older regularity of the sample

  Hero","Jointly Sparse Global SIMPLS Regression",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial least squares (PLS) regression combines dimensionality reduction and
prediction using a latent variable model. Since partial least squares
regression (PLS-R) does not require matrix inversion or diagonalization, it can
be applied to problems with large numbers of variables. As predictor dimension
increases, variable selection becomes essential to avoid over-fitting, to
provide more accurate predictors and to yield more interpretable parameters. We
propose a global variable selection approach that penalizes the total number of
variables across all PLS components. Put another way, the proposed global
penalty encourages the selected variables to be shared among the PLS
components. We formulate PLS-R with joint sparsity as a variational
optimization problem with objective function equal to a novel global SIMPLS
criterion plus a mixed norm sparsity penalty on the weight matrix. The mixed
norm sparsity penalty is the $\ell_1$ norm of the $\ell_2$ norm on the weights
corresponding to the same variable used over all the PLS components. A novel
augmented Lagrangian method is proposed to solve the optimization problem and
soft thresholding for sparsity occurs naturally as part of the iterative
solution. Experiments show that the modified PLS-R attains better or as good
performance with many fewer selected predictor variables.

the distribution of metals resulting from one Population III supernova and from
a small number of such supernovae exploding in close succession. Overall,
supernova ejecta are highly inhomogeneously dispersed throughout the
simulations. When the supernova bubbles collapse, quasi-virialized
metal-enriched clouds, fed by fallback from the bubbles and by streaming of
metal-free gas from the cosmic web, grow in the centers of the dark matter
halos. Partial turbulent homogenization on scales resolved in the simulation is
observed only in the densest clouds where the vortical time scales are short
enough to ensure true homogenization on subgrid scales. However, the abundances
in the clouds differ from the gross yields of the supernovae. Continuing the
simulations until the cloud have gone into gravitational collapse, we predict
that the abundances in second-generation stars will be deficient in the
innermost mass shells of the supernova (if only one has exploded) or in the
ejecta of the latest supernovae (when multiple have exploded). This indicates
that hydrodynamics gives rise to biases complicating the identification of
nucleosynthetic sources in the chemical abundance spaces of the surviving

enriched over a quantaloid Q (or Q-categories for short), with the following
types of adjunctions involved: (1) adjoint functors between Q-categories; (2)
adjoint distributors between Q-categories; (3) adjoint functors between
categories consisting of Q-categories. For a small quantaloid Q and a
distributor between Q-categories, two adjunctions between the Q-categories of
contravariant and covariant presheaves are presented. These adjunctions
respectively extend the fundamental construction of Isbell adjunctions and Kan
extensions in category theory, so, they will be called the Isbell adjunction
and Kan adjunction, respectively. The functoriality of these constructions is
the central topic of this dissertation. In order to achieve this, infomorphisms
between distributors are introduced to organize distributors (as objects) into
a category. Then we proceed as follows: first, the Isbell adjunction and Kan
adjunction associated with each distributor between Q-categories give rise to
two monads, which are respectively (covariant) functorial and contravariant
functorial from the category of distributors and infomorphisms to the category
of Q-closure spaces; second, it is shown that the assignments of a distributor
to the fixed points of the two monads are respectively (covariant) functorial
and contravariant functorial from the category of distributors and
infomorphisms to that of skeletal complete Q-categories and left adjoint
functors. As consequences of the functoriality of the above processes, three
factorizations of the free cocompletion functor of Q-categories are presented.
Finally, as applications, the theory of formal concept analysis and that of
rough sets are extended to theories based on fuzzy relations between fuzzy

treatment and the outcome are not confounded, has been a source of considerable
controversy. We here present formulae for identifying under which circumstances
biases are inflated or reduced. In particular, we show that the magnitude of
M-Bias in linear structural equation models tends to be relatively small
compared to confounding bias, suggesting that it is generally not a serious
concern in many applied settings. These theoretical results are consistent with
recent empirical findings from simulation studies. We also generalize the
M-Bias setting (1) to allow for the correlation between the latent factors to
be nonzero, and (2) to allow for the collider to be a confounder between the
treatment and the outcome. These results demonstrate that mild deviations from
the M-Structure tend to increase confounding bias more rapidly than M-Bias,
suggesting that choosing to condition on any given covariate is generally the
superior choice. As an application, we re-examine a controversial example

crucial for the success of many online applications/services due to their

systems suffer from the data sparsity and the cold-start problems. To alleviate
these issues, in recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in
exploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with
the rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main
motivation for exploiting trust information in recommendation process stems
from the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make
are significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user
communities, in addition to trust relations, the distrust relations also exist
between users. For instance, in Epinions the concepts of personal ""web of
trust"" and personal ""block list"" allow users to categorize their friends based
on the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. In
this paper, we propose a matrix factorization based model for recommendation in
social rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust
relationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the
data sparsity and the cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the
Epinions data set, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard
trust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy,
thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit
distrust information can have on recommender systems.

distortion of carbon atoms at the GNR edges induces a large spin-orbit coupling
on the edges atoms, which enhances spin-flip scattering of edge states of the
zigzag GNR. With sufficient spin-flip scattering, the wave-function of edge
states becomes a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down components. Then
the coupling of the two edges becomes important. This removes the edge degree
of freedom in the zigzag GNR and results in the evolution of the conductance
from G0 to G0/2 with increasing the length.

symmetry of the orthorhombic perovskite phase has been reported5. We present
here unambiguous evidence for a non-apparent isostructural phase transition8 in
the stable orthorhombic perovskite phase of CaTiO3 which may have relevance to
phase transitions in the perovskite phase of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 also, as both the

diffraction patterns using Rietveld and mode crystallography techniques and are

ascertain whether the formation of glasses from liquids is fundamentally
thermodynamic or dynamic in origin. While the thermodynamic paradigm has
dominated theoretical research for decades, the purely kinetic perspective of
the dynamical facilitation (DF) theory has attained prominence in recent times.
In particular, recent experiments and simulations have highlighted the
importance of facilitation using simple model systems composed of spherical
particles. However, an overwhelming majority of liquids possess anisotropy in
particle shape and interactions and it is therefore imperative to examine
facilitation in complex glass-formers. Here, we apply the DF theory to systems
with orientational degrees of freedom as well as anisotropic attractive
interactions. By analyzing data from experiments on colloidal ellipsoids, we
show that facilitation plays a pivotal role in translational as well as
orientational relaxation. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of
attractive interactions leads to spatial decoupling of translational and
rotational facilitation, which subsequently results in the decoupling of
dynamical heterogeneities. Most strikingly, the DF theory can predict the
existence of reentrant glass transitions based on the statistics of localized
dynamical events, called excitations, whose duration is substantially smaller
than the structural relaxation time. Our findings pave the way for
systematically testing the DF approach in complex glass-formers and also
establish the significance of facilitation in governing structural relaxation
in supercooled liquids.

GANIL laboratory in France. Its purposes are to enhance as much as possible the
beam quality: transverse geometric emittance of less than 3 {\pi}.mm.mrad and a
longitudinal energy spread close to 1 eV, and to transmit more than 60 % of
ions. Numerical simulations and experimental studies have shown that the
required beam quality can be reached only in the term of the emittance. The
energy spread is very far from expected values. It is sensitive to the space
charge and buffer gas diffusion and more importantly to the RF field derivative
effect. The latter arises at the RFQ exit and increases with the following RF
parameters: the frequency and the amplitude of the RF voltage applied to the
RFQ electrodes. Studies allowing to enhance the cooled beam quality, mainly the
energy spread reduction, are presented and discussed along this paper. They
consist in implementing a miniature RFQ at the RFQ exit. Using the development
of these studies, it becomes possible to enhance the cooled beam quality and to
reach 1 eV of longitudinal energy spread and less than 1.8 {\pi}.mm.mrad of
transverse geometric emittance for beam currents going up to 1 {\micro}A. The
transport of the cooled beam from the exit of the extraction section towards a

each other as they propagate in the heliosphere. In this paper, we analyze the
collision and post-interaction characteristics of two Earth-directed CMEs,
launched successively on 2012 November 9 and 10, using white light imaging
observations from STEREO/SECCHI and in situ observations taken from WIND
spacecraft. We tracked two density enhanced features associated with leading
and trailing edge of November 9 CME and one density enhanced feature associated
with leading edge of November 10 CME by constructing J-maps. We found that the
leading edge of November 10 CME interacted with the trailing edge of November 9
CME. We also estimated the kinematics of these features of the CMEs and found a
significant change in their dynamics after interaction. In in situ
observations, we identified distinct structures associated with interacted CMEs
and also noticed their heating and compression as signatures of CME-CME
interaction. Our analysis shows an improvement in arrival time prediction of
CMEs using their post-collision dynamics than using pre-collision dynamics.
Estimating the true masses and speeds of these colliding CMEs, we investigated
the nature of observed collision which is found to be close to perfectly
inelastic. The investigation also places in perspective the geomagnetic
consequences of the two CMEs and their interaction in terms of occurrence of
geomagnetic storm and triggering of magnetospheric substorms.

(SMBH), which makes it the best laboratory to study the close environment of
extremely massive compact objects. Polarimetry is sensitive to geometry of the
source, which makes it a particularly suitable technique to probe the medium
surrounding the GC SMBH. The detection of hard X-ray spectra and prominent iron
K$\alpha$ fluorescence features coincident with localized gas clouds (e.g.
Sgr~B2, Sgr~C) is known for nearly twenty years now and is commonly associated
with a past outburst of the SMBH whose radiation is reprocessing onto the
so-called ""reflection nebulae"". Since scattering leads to polarization, the
re-emitted signal from the giant molecular clouds in the first 100~pc of the GC
is expected to be polarized. X-ray polarization measurement is thus
particularly adapted to probe the origin of the diffuse X-ray emission from the
GC reflection nebulae and reveal the past activity of the central SMBH. In this
research note, we summarize the results from past and current polarimetric
simulations in order to show how a future X-ray polarimeter equipped with
imaging detectors could improve our understanding of high-energy astrophysics.

the results confirm our hypothesis as the SA algorithm produces very close
results to those obtained from the traditional deterministic methods of
identifying the flow fields by solving a set of simultaneous equations based on
the conservation principles. The same results apply to electric ohmic

experiments conducted in this regard confirm this extension. Further studies

emergence of the torus isomers is associated with the alignments of
single-particle angular momenta, which is the same mechanism as found in

precession motion at least two rotational periods. The moment of inertia about
a perpendicular axis, which characterizes the precession motion, is found to be

SATIRE-S reconstruction to cover the last three solar cycles without data gaps

and SORCE/SOLSTICE ultraviolet (UV) observations. SATIRE-S displays similar
cycle behaviour to NRLSSI for wavelengths below 242 nm and almost twice the
variability between 242 and 310 nm. During the decline of last solar cycle,
between 2003 and 2008, SSI from SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 and 10 typically
displays more than three times the variability of SATIRE-S between 200 and 300
nm. All three datasets are used to model changes in stratospheric ozone within
a 2D atmospheric model for a decline from high solar activity to solar minimum.
The different flux changes result in different modelled ozone trends. Using
NRLSSI leads to a decline in mesospheric ozone, while SATIRE-S and
SORCE/SOLSTICE result in an increase. Recent publications have highlighted
increases in mesospheric ozone when considering version 10 SORCE/SOLSTICE
irradiances. The recalibrated SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 irradiances result in a
much smaller mesospheric ozone response than when using version 10 and now
similar in magnitude to SATIRE-S. This shows that current knowledge of
variations in spectral irradiance is not sufficient to warrant robust
conclusions concerning the impact of solar variability on the atmosphere and
climate.

faced by analytical theories of turbulence, we explore three-dimensional
homogeneous shear turbulence of incompressible Newtonian fluids via optimal
control and convex optimization. The framework is composed of multi-point
spatial correlations of velocity and pressure fluctuations up to the degenerate
fourth order, their evolution equations and constraints. The integral of trace
of the second order correlations is argued as the objective functional to be
maximized. The sources of the constraints are discussed like the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality and the non-negativity of variance of products (NNVP). Two models
are defined: the second-order model uses the contracted and degenerate third
order correlations as control variables; the third-order model takes the
degenerate fourth order correlations as control variables. Both are
second-order cone programs. Computation of large-scale and huge-scale and link
to big data are noted. The exponential growth rates of the asymptotic states
are bounded from above by zero. The steady state of the second-order model is
solved. Three finite macro length scales are predicted beyond which the
two-point correlations are negligible. The predicted values of the anisotropy
tensor are consistent with experimental data qualitatively (concerning the
relative numerical order of the diagonal components), albeit with large
quantitative differences attributed to the non-enforceability of NNVP within
the model. Compared with DNS data, the predicted second order correlation
functions contain flawed features of local minima too large in magnitude or
present spuriously. The third-order model is expected to improve predictions,
owing to its ability to include constraints from NNVP and its formulation in an
enlarged control variable space. It is yet open how to solve this huge-scale
problem.

construction, it exactly ensures that any observable is totally independent
from the interchange of particles. It is based on the use of conditional
Bohmian wave functions which are solutions of single-particle
pseudo-Schr\""odinger equations. The exchange symmetry is directly defined by
demanding symmetry properties of the quantum trajectories in the configuration
space with a universal algorithm, rather than through a particular
exchange-correlation functional introduced into the single-particle
pseudo-Schr\""odinger equation. It requires the computation of N^2 conditional
wave functions to deal with N identical particles. For separable Hamiltonians,
the algorithm reduces to the standard Slater determinant for fermions, or
permanent for bosons. A numerical test for a two-particle system, where exact
solutions for non-separable Hamiltonians are computationally accessible, is
presented. The numerical viability of the algorithm for quantum electron
transport (in a far-from equilibrium time-dependent open system) is
demonstrated by computing the current and fluctuations in a nano-resistor, with

Van Hiele - Freudenthal combination since 1957. Hans Freudenthal (1905-1990)
also suggested that Van Hiele only saw application to geometry, and that only
he, Freudenthal, saw the general application. Freudenthal adopted various
notions from Van Hiele, misrepresented those, gave those new names of himself,
and started referring to this instead of to Van Hiele. The misrepresentation
may clarify why Tall didn't recognise Van Hiele's theory. Freudenthal mistook
Van Hiele's distinction of concrete versus abstract for the distinction of
reality versus model (applied mathematics). Freudenthal's misconception of
""realistic mathematics education"" (RME) partly doesn't work and the part that
works was mostly taken from Van Hiele. This common lack of understanding of Van
Hiele partly explains the situation in the education in mathematics and the
research on this. Another factor is that mathematicians like Freudenthal and
Tall are trained for abstraction and have less understanding of the empirics of
mathematics education.

user (SU) harvests energy from both the nature resources and the primary user
(PU) radio frequency(RF) signal. We propose an energy-based probabilistic
access scheme in which SU probabilistically accesses and senses the primary
channel. The decision is based on the available energy and the PU's activity.
We investigate the problem of maximizing the SU's success rate provided that
the PU average quality of service (QoS) constraint is satisfied. We also assume
multi-packet reception (MPR) capability and sensing errors under a Rayleigh
fading channel. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed
probabilistic access scheme.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation inconsistent with the null
hypothesis at a significance of > 5 {\sigma}. This result has been often
interpreted as a signature of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic
inflation, even if actually polarized dust emission may be at the origin of
such a signal. Even assuming that part of this CMB B-mode polarization really
corresponds to the early Universe dynamics, its interpretation in terms of
inflation and primordial gravitational waves is not the only possible one.
Alternative cosmologies such as pre-Big Bang patterns and the spinorial
space-time (SST) we introduced in 1996-97 can naturally account for such CMB
B-modes. In particular, the SST automatically generates a privileged space
direction (PSD) whose existence may have been confirmed by Planck data. If such
a PSD exists, it seems normal to infer that vector perturbations have been
present in the early Universe leading to CMB B-modes in suitable cosmological
patterns. Inflation would not be required to explain the BICEP2 result assuming
it really contains a primordial signal. More generally, pre-Big Bang
cosmologies can also generate gravitational waves in the early Universe without
any need for cosmic inflation. We further discuss here possible alternatives to
the inflationary interpretation of a primordial B-mode polarization of cosmic
microwave background radiation.
