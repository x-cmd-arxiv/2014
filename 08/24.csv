  Object Representation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchies allow feature sharing between objects at multiple levels of
representation, can code exponential variability in a very compact way and
enable fast inference. This makes them potentially suitable for learning and
recognizing a higher number of object classes. However, the success of the
hierarchical approaches so far has been hindered by the use of hand-crafted
features or predetermined grouping rules. This paper presents a novel framework
for learning a hierarchical compositional shape vocabulary for representing
multiple object classes. The approach takes simple contour fragments and learns
their frequent spatial configurations. These are recursively combined into
increasingly more complex and class-specific shape compositions, each exerting
a high degree of shape variability. At the top-level of the vocabulary, the
compositions are sufficiently large and complex to represent the whole shapes
of the objects. We learn the vocabulary layer after layer, by gradually
increasing the size of the window of analysis and reducing the spatial
resolution at which the shape configurations are learned. The lower layers are
learned jointly on images of all classes, whereas the higher layers of the
vocabulary are learned incrementally, by presenting the algorithm with one
object class after another. The experimental results show that the learned
multi-class object representation scales favorably with the number of object
classes and achieves a state-of-the-art detection performance at both, faster
inference as well as shorter training times.

FRs), are detected by in situ measurements in the solar wind. While small FRs
are crossed by the observing spacecraft within few hours, with a radius
typically less than 0.1AU, larger FRs, or magnetic clouds (hereafter, MCs),
have durations of about half a day.
  The main aim of this study is to compare the properties of both populations
of FRs observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU.
  To do so, we use standard correlation techniques for the FR parameters, as
well as histograms and more refined statistical methods. Although several
properties seem at first different for small FRs and MCs, we show that they are
actually governed by the same propagation physics. For example, we observe no
in situ signatures of expansion for small FRs, contrary to MCs. We demonstrate
that this result is in fact expected: small FRs expand similarly to MCs, as a
consequence of a total pressure balance with the surrounding medium, but the
expansion signature is well hidden by velocity fluctuations.
  Next, we find that the FR radius, velocity and magnetic field strength are
all positively correlated, with correlation factors than can reach a value
>0.5. This result indicates a remnant trace of the FR ejection process from the
corona. We also find a larger FR radius at the apex than at the legs (up to
three times larger at the apex), for FR observed at 1 AU.
  Finally, assuming that the detected FRs have a large-scale configuration in
the heliosphere, we derived the mean axis shape from the probability
distribution of the axis orientation. We therefore interpret the small FR and
MC properties in a common framework of FRs interacting with the solar wind, and
we disentangle the physics present behind their common and different features.

applying Hamilton's modified Ricci flow and depends only upon the restricted
metric of the surface and not on its mean curvature. The theorem is proven by
studying a class of asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds foliated by
surfaces satisfying Hamilton's modified Ricci flow with prescribed scalar
curvature. Such manifolds were first constructed by the first author in her
dissertation conducted under the supervision of M.T. Wang. We make a further
study of this class of manifolds bounding the ADM masses of such manifolds and
analyzing the rigid case when the Hawking mass of the inner surface of the

various convexity assumptions on function f. In addition, rate statements are
also provided to quantify the degradation in rate resulted from learning
process. In the second part of the paper, we consider the solution of
misspecified monotone variational inequality problems to contend with more
general equilibrium problems as well as the possibility of misspecification in
the constraints. We first present a constant steplength misspecified

reliant on problem parameters (such as Lipschitz constants)and leads us to
present a misspecified variant of iterative Tikhonov regularization. Numerics
support the asymptotic and rate statements.

challenging task, especially when the smallest magnitude singular values are
needed in high accuracy. Most recent efforts try to address this problem
through variations of the Lanczos bidiagonalization method, but they are still
challenged even for medium matrix sizes due to the difficulty of the problem.
We propose a novel SVD approach that can take advantage of preconditioning and
of any well designed eigensolver to compute both largest and smallest singular
triplets. Accuracy and efficiency is achieved through a hybrid, two-stage
meta-method, PHSVDS. In the first stage, PHSVDS solves the normal equations up
to the best achievable accuracy. If further accuracy is required, the method
switches automatically to an eigenvalue problem with the augmented matrix. Thus
it combines the advantages of the two stages, faster convergence and accuracy,
respectively. For the augmented matrix, solving the interior eigenvalue is
facilitated by a proper use of the good initial guesses from the first stage
and an efficient implementation of the refined projection method. We also
discuss how to precondition PHSVDS and to cope with some issues that arise.
Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the method.

and triggering at high rate experiments. At hadron colliders the dominant
fraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering
(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for
hit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In
all such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can
be largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided
by pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties
are solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.
Fitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in
solenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a
complete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.
The triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be
treated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and
industrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full
scale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC
or future high energy (hadron) colliders. In this paper tracking performance
studies for full-scale pixel detectors, including their optimisation for
3D-triplet tracking, are presented. The results obtained for different types of
tracker geometries and different reconstruction methods are compared. The
potential of reducing the number of tracking layers and -- along with that --
the material budget using this new tracking concept is discussed. The
possibility of using 3D-triplet tracking for triggering and fast online

2nd degree and order-gravity field with harmonic coefficients C20 and C22. By
introducing the spacecraft's higher-order inertia integrals, a full
fourth-order gravity gradient torque model of the spacecraft is established
through the gravitational potential derivatives. Our full fourth-order model is
more precise than previous fourth-order model due to the consideration of
higher-order inertia integrals of the spacecraft. Some interesting conclusions
about the gravity gradient torque model are reached. Then a numerical
simulation is carried out to verify our model. In the numerical simulation, a
special spacecraft consisted of 36 point masses connected by rigid massless
rods is considered. We assume that the asteroid is in a uniform rotation around
its maximum-moment principal axis, and the spacecraft is on the stationary
orbit in the equatorial plane. Simulation results show that the motion of

Based on the natural symplectic structure, the non-canonical Hamiltonian

equations of motion are obtained in a differential geometric method. The
equilibrium of the equations of motion, i.e. the equilibrium attitude of the
spacecraft, is determined from a global point of view. Nonlinear stability
conditions of the equilibrium attitude are obtained with the energy-Casimir
method. The nonlinear attitude stability is then investigated versus three
parameters of the asteroid, including the ratio of the mean radius to the
stationary orbital radius, the harmonic coefficients C20 and C22. It is found
that when the spacecraft is located on the intermediate-moment principal axis
of the asteroid, the nonlinear stability domain can be totally different from
the classical Lagrange region on a circular orbit in a central gravity field.

rigid body in a J2 gravity field. Different with the original J2 problem, the
gravitational orbit-rotation coupling of the rigid body is considered in this
generalized problem. The linear stability of the classical type of relative
equilibria of the rigid body, which have been obtained in our previous paper,
is studied in the framework of geometric mechanics with the second-order
gravitational potential. Non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the problem,
i.e., Poisson tensor, Casimir functions and equations of motion, are obtained
through a Poisson reduction process by means of the symmetry of the problem.
The linear system matrix at the relative equilibria is given through the
multiplication of the Poisson tensor and Hessian matrix of the variational
Lagrangian. Based on the characteristic equation of the linear system matrix,
the conditions of linear stability of the relative equilibria are obtained.
With the stability conditions obtained, the linear stability of the relative
equilibria is investigated in details in a wide range of the parameters of the
gravity field and the rigid body. We find that both the zonal harmonic J2 and
the characteristic dimension of the rigid body have significant effects on the
linear stability. Similar to the attitude stability in a central gravity field,
the linear stability region is also consisted of two regions that are analogues
of the Lagrange region and the DeBra-Delp region. Our results are very useful
for the studies on the motion of natural satellites in our solar system.

continuously create sufficiently flat and homogeneous Universe, providing the
necessary initial condition for the subsequent slow-roll inflation that
generates the density perturbations of the right magnitude. While the condition
for the topological Higgs inflation is only marginally satisfied in the
Standard Model, it can be readily satisfied if one introduces the right-handed
neutrinos and/or the non-minimal coupling to gravity; currently unknown quantum
gravity corrections to the potential may also help. We also discuss the $B-L$

necessary initial condition, the restored $B-L$ symmetry, can be naturally
realized by the preceding topological Higgs inflation.

  Fe, New Mexico, January 26-30, 2014",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orbit-attitude hovering of a spacecraft at the natural relative equilibria in
the body-fixed frame of a uniformly rotating asteroid is discussed in the
framework of the full spacecraft dynamics, in which the spacecraft is modeled
as a rigid body with the gravitational orbit-attitude coupling. In this
hovering model, both the position and attitude of the spacecraft are kept to be
stationary in the asteroid body-fixed frame. A Hamiltonian structure-based
feedback control law is proposed to stabilize the relative equilibria of the
full dynamics to achieve the orbit-attitude hovering. The control law is
consisted of two parts: potential shaping and energy dissipation. The potential
shaping is to make the relative equilibrium a minimum of the modified
Hamiltonian on the invariant manifold by modifying the potential artificially.
With the energy-Casimir method, it is shown that the unstable relative
equilibrium can always be stabilized in the Lyapunov sense by the potential
shaping with sufficiently large feedback gains. Then the energy dissipation
leads the motion to converge asymptotically to the minimum of the modified
Hamiltonian on the invariant manifold, i.e., the relative equilibrium. The
feasibility of the proposed stabilization control law is validated through
numerical simulations in the case of a spacecraft orbiting around a small
asteroid. The main advantage of the proposed hovering control law is that it is
very simple and is easy to implement autonomously by the spacecraft with little
computation. This advantage is attributed to the utilization of dynamical
behaviors of the system in the control design.

(i) learn models of normal driving behaviour, and (ii) use such models to
detect important and potentially dangerous deviations from the norm in
real-time, and thus enable the generation of appropriate alerts. Crucially, we
believe that such models and interventions should and can be personalised and

distraction on drivers, based on simple time series analysis. We have tested
our method on a rich dataset of driving sessions, carried out in a professional

different type of cognitive distraction, and resulted in multiple time series
from a variety of on-board sensors as well as sensors worn by the driver.
Crucially, each driver also recorded an initial session with no distractions.
In our model, such initial session provides the baseline times series that make

number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context, and
simplifies the development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our
framework decomposes the into two steps: binary code (hash bits) learning, and
hash function learning. The first step can typically be formulated as a binary
quadratic problem, and the second step can be accomplished by training standard
binary classifiers. For solving large-scale binary code inference, we show how
to ensure that the binary quadratic problems are submodular such that an
efficient graph cut approach can be used. To achieve efficiency as well as
efficacy on large-scale high-dimensional data, we propose to use boosted
decision trees as the hash functions, which are nonlinear, highly descriptive,
and very fast to train and evaluate. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed
method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods, especially on
high-dimensional data.

uniform distribution of markers, we find the scaling
$\left<[E(t)-E(0)]^n\right>\propto t$ and $\left<p^n\right> \propto
\textrm{Re}^{n-1}$ for the power as a function of the Reynolds number. Both

moments of the energy difference including the pre-factor for
$\left<E(t)-E(0)\right>$. To complete the single particle picture for Burgers
we compute the moments of the Lagrangian velocity difference and show that they
are bi-fractal. This arises in a similar manner to the bi-fractality of
Eulerian velocity differences. In the above setting time irreversibility is
directly manifest as particles eventually end up in shocks. We additionally
investigate time irreversibility in the long-time limit when all particles are
located inside shocks and the Lagrangian velocity statistics are stationary. We
find the same scalings for the power and energy differences as at short times
and argue that this is also a consequence of rare ""flight-crash"" events related

entanglement spectrum. The spacetime is a kind of canonical parameter space
defined by the Fisher information metric. As a concrete example, we focus on
the spectrum for free fermions in spatially one dimension. The spectrum has
exponential family form like thermal probability distribution owing to
mixed-state feature emerging from truncation of environmental degrees of
freedom. In this case, the Fisher metric is given by the second derivative of
the Hessian potential that can be identified with the entanglement entropy. We
emphasize that the canonical parameters are nontrivial functions of partial
system size by the truncation, filling fraction of fermions, and time. Then,
the precise determination of this nontrivial mapping is necessary to derive the
functional form of the Hessian potential that leads to correct entanglement
entropy scaling. By this potential, we find that the emergent geometry becomes
anti-de Sitter spacetime with imaginary time, and a radial axis as well as
spacetime coordinates appears spontaneously. We also find that the information
of the UV limit of the original free fermions lives in the boundary of the
anti-de Sitter spacetime. These findings strongly suggest that the Hessian
potential for free fermions has enough geometrical meaning associated with
gauge-gravity correspondence. Furthermore, some deformation of the spectrum
near the conformal fixed point is mapped onto spacetime dynamics. The
fluctuation of the entanglement entropy embedded into the spacetime behaves
like free scaler field, and the dynamics is described by the Einstein equation
with a negative cosmological constant. Therefore, the Einstein equation can be
regarded as the equation of original quantum state.

Bruijn graph built by the assembler. Thus, there have been many paradigms
developed to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious
combinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of $k$ to vary; having a
larger value of $k$ where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of $k$
where the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One
open problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the
value of $k$ prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values
of $k$ can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in
a phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple
values of $k$ practical for genome assembly.
  Results: We present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses
homology information to choose a value of $k$ for each read prior to the de
Bruijn graph construction. The chosen $k$ is optimal if there are no sequencing
errors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the
construction of the {\em maximal sequence landscape}, which is a data structure
that stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated
substring containing that position. In particular, we show the maximal sequence
landscape can be constructed in $O(n + n \log n)$-time and $O(n)$-space.
HyDA-Vista first constructs the maximal sequence landscape for a homologous
genome. The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of $k$
are assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the
alignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn
graph construction method. Our results and comparison to other assemblers
demonstrate that HyDA-Vista achieves the best assembly of {\em E. coli} before
repeat resolution or scaffolding.

quantum Ising model on various fractal lattices such as the Sierpi\'nski
carpet, Sierpi\'nski gasket, and Sierpi\'nski tetrahedron. Using a
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulation method and the finite-size
scaling analysis, I identify the quantum critical point and investigate its
scaling properties. Among others, I calculate the dynamic critical exponent and
find that it is greater than one for all three structures. The fact that it
deviates from one is a direct consequence of the fractal structures not being
integer-dimensional regular lattices. Other critical exponents are also
calculated. The exponents are different from those of the classical critical
point, and satisfy the quantum scaling relation, thus confirming that I have
indeed found the quantum critical point. I find that the Sierpi\'nski
tetrahedron, of which the dimension is exactly two, belongs to a different
universality class than that of the two-dimensional square lattice. I conclude
that the critical exponents depend on more details of the structure than just
the dimension and the symmetry.

We study the effect of inner part of a circumstellar disk covering a region
from near the central star to the radius of approximately $5$ AU (hereafter,
the inner disk). Using the fluctuated mass accretion rate onto the inner disk
$\dot{M}_{\rm out}$, we consider the viscous evolution of the inner disk and
the time variability of the mass accretion rate onto the central star
$\dot{M}_{\rm in}$ by means of numerical calculation of an unsteady viscous
accretion disk in a one-dimensional axisymmetric model. First, we calculate the
evolution of the inner disk assuming an oscillating $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$. It is
shown that the time variability of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}$ does not coincide with
$\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ due to viscous diffusion. Second, we investigate the
properties of spontaneous outbursts with temporally constant $\dot{M}_{\rm
out}$. Outburst occur only in a limited range of mass accretion rates onto the
inner disk $10^{-10}<\dot{M}_{\rm out}< 3\times 10^{-6}~{\rm M}_{\odot} {\rm
yr}^{-1}$ due to gravo-magneto limit cycle (GML). Finally, we discuss the case
with a combination of episodic $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ and accretion outbursts
cause by the GML in the inner disk. The GML can drive accretion outbursts onto
the star even for the case of fluctuating $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$, although
fluctuations of $\dot{M}$ decay during transmitting the inner disk inwards. We
newly identified two modes of outburst which are spontaneous one and stimulated
one. In a stimulated mode of outburst, $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ does appear directly
in $\dot{M}_{\rm in}$ (the latter defining the stellar accretion luminosity).
In a spontaneous mode of outburst, $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ appears as the interval
between outbursts.

Fornax dwarf spheroidal from R~16,000 spectra. The targets have been obtained
in the outer parts of the galaxy, a region which has been poorly studied
before. Our sample shows a wide range in [Fe/H], between -0.5 and -3.0 dex, in
which we detect three subgroups. Removal of stars belonging to the most
metal-rich population produces a truncated metallicity distribution function
that is identical to Sculptor, indicating that these systems have shared a
similar early evolution, only that Fornax experienced a late, intense period of
star formation (SF). The derived age-metallicity relation shows a fast increase
in [Fe/H] at early ages, after which the enrichment flattens significantly for
stars younger than ~8 Gyr. Additionally, the data indicate a strong population
of stars around 4 Gyr, followed by a second rapid enrichment in [Fe/H]. A
leaky-box chemical enrichment model generally matches the observed relation but
does not predict a significant population of young stars nor the strong
enrichment at late times. The young population in Fornax may therefore
originate from an externally triggered SF event. Our dynamical analysis reveals
an increasing velocity dispersion with decreasing [Fe/H] from sigma_sys 7.5
km/s to >14 km/s, indicating an outside-in star formation history in a dark
matter dominated halo. The large velocity dispersion at low metallicities is
possibly the result of a non-Gaussian velocity distribution amongst stars older
than ~8 Gyr. Our sample also includes members from the Fornax GCs H2 and H5. In
agreement with past studies we find [Fe/H]=-2.04+-0.04 and a mean radial
velocity RV=59.36+-0.31 km/s for H2 and [Fe/H]=-2.02+-0.11 and RV=59.39+-0.44

on $L^p$-spaces and $QSL^p$-spaces. The universal completions $F^p(G)$ and
$F^p_{\mathrm{QS}}(G)$ of $L^1(G)$ with respect to these classes of
representations (which were first considered by Phillips and Runde,
respectively), can be regarded as analogs of the full group \ca{} of $G$ (which
is the case $p=2$). We study these completions of $L^1(G)$ in relation to the
algebra $F^p_\lambda(G)$ of $p$-pseudofunctions. We prove a characterization of
group amenability in terms of certain canonical maps between these universal
Banach algebras. In particular, $G$ is amenable if and only if
$F^p_{\mathrm{QS}}(G)=F^p(G)=F^p_\lambda(G)$.
  One of our main results is that for $1\leq p< q\leq 2$, there is a canonical
map $\gamma_{p,q}\colon F^p(G)\to F^q(G)$ which is contractive and has dense
range. When $G$ is amenable, $\gamma_{p,q}$ is injective, and it is never
surjective unless $G$ is finite. We use the maps $\gamma_{p,q}$ to show that
when $G$ is discrete, all (or one) of the universal completions of $L^1(G)$ are
amenable as a Banach algebras if and only if $G$ is amenable.
  Finally, we exhibit a family of examples showing that the characterizations
of group amenability mentioned above cannot be extended to $L^p$-operator
crossed products of topological spaces.

of algebras of $p$-pseudofunctions of locally compact groups. We focus on the
functoriality properties of these objects. We show that $p$-pseudofunctions are
functorial with respect to homomorphisms that are either injective, or whose
kernel is amenable and has finite index. We also show that the universal
completion of the group algebra with respect to representations on
$L^p$-spaces, is functorial with respect to quotient maps.
  As an application, we show that the algebras of $p$- and $q$-pseudofunctions
on $\mathbb{Z}$ are (abstractly) isometrically isomorphic as Banach algebras if

interesting problem. It is well known that a five-dimensional free massless
fermion $\Psi$ minimally coupled to gravity cannot be localized on the
Randall-Sundrum braneworld. In order to trap such a fermion, the coupling
between the fermion and bulk scalar fields should be introduced. In this paper,
localization and quasilocalization of a bulk fermion on the thick braneworld
generated by two scalar fields (a kink scalar $\phi$ and a dilaton scalar
$\pi$) are investigated. Two types of couplings between the fermion and two
scalars are considered. One coupling is the usual Yukawa coupling
$-\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi\Psi$ between the fermion and kink scalar, another one is
$\lambda\bar{\Psi}\Gamma^{M}\partial_{M}\pi\gamma^{5}\Psi$ between the fermion
and dilaton scalar. The left-chiral fermion zero mode can be localized on the
brane, and both the left- and right-chiral fermion massive Kaluza-Klein modes
may be localized or quasilocalized. Hence the four-dimensional massless
left-chiral fermion and massive Dirac fermions, whose lifetime is infinite or
finite, can be obtained on the brane.

vehicles (UAVs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing
{\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these
strategies, periodic adjustments would be made in the airspeed and/or heading
angle command for the UAV to minimize a projected power requirement at some
future time. In this paper, UAV flights are described by a three-dimensional
dynamic point-mass. Onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow
airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback
linearization. A generic wind field model is assumed that consists of a
constant term plus terms that vary sinusoidally with respect to the location.
To evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing UAV flight endurance,
a reference strategy is introduced in which the UAV would seek to follow the
desired airspeed in a steady level flight under zero wind. A performance
measure is defined as the average power consumption both over a specified time
interval and over different initial heading angles of the UAV. A relative
benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement of the
performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy.
Extensive numerical simulations are conducted. Results demonstrate the benefits
and trends of power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies.
