that the local symmetries are reducible in the sense that the parameters also
have a local symmetry. Using reducibility we get an action which has two scalar

action and equations of motion are related to previously proposed formulations
for continuous spin particles and higher spin theories. We also discuss the
physical contents of each formulation to reveal the physical degrees of

computed as averages over the time history of a stochastic process described by
a Langevin equation. Complex stochastic quantisation, though theoretically not
rigorously established, extends this idea to cases where the action is
complex-valued by complexifying the basic degrees of freedom, all observables
and allowing the stochastic process to probe the complexified configuration
space. We review the method for a previously studied one-dimensional toy model,
the U(1) one link model. We confirm that complex Langevin dynamics only works
for a certain range of parameters, misestimating observables otherwise. A
curious effect is observed where all moments of the basic stochastic variable
are misestimated, although these misestimated moments may be used to construct,
by a Taylor series, other observables that are reproduced correctly. This
suggests a subtle but not completely resolved relationship between the original
complex integration measure and the higher-dimensional probability distribution
in the complexified configuration space, generated by the complex Langevin

lower limits, there are hints that the two populations may be more similar

metallicity seems to decline at a shallower rate than the QSO-DLAs: GRB-DLA
hosts may be polluted with metals at least as far as $\sim 2$kpc from the GRB
explosion site, probably due to previous star-formation episodes and/or
supernovae explosions. This shallow metallicity trend, extended now up to
$z\sim5$, confirms previous results that GRB hosts are star-forming and have,
on average, higher metallicity than the general QSO-DLA population. Finally,
our metallicity measurements are broadly consistent with the hypothesis of two
channels of GRB progenitors, one of which is mildly affected by a metallicity
bias. The metallicity evolution of modeled GRB hosts agrees reasonably well
with our data up to intermediate redshift, while more data are needed to
constrain the models at $z\gtrsim 4$.

  Difference",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rank similarity measures provide a method for quantifying differences between
search engine results without the need for relevance judgments. For example,
the providers of a search service might use such measures to estimate the
impact of a proposed algorithmic change across a large number of queries -
perhaps millions - identifying those queries where the impact is greatest. In
this paper, we propose and validate a family of rank similarity measures, each
derived from an associated effectiveness measure. Each member of the family is
based on the maximization of effectiveness difference under this associated
measure. Computing this maximized effectiveness difference (MED) requires the
solution of an optimization problem that varies in difficulty, depending on the
associated measure. We present solutions for several standard effectiveness
measures, including nDCG, MAP, and ERR. Through an experimental validation, we
show that MED reveals meaningful differences between retrieval runs.
Mathematically, MED is a metric, regardless of the associated measure. Prior
work has established a number of other desiderata for rank similarity in the
context of search, and we demonstrate that MED satisfies these requirements.
Unlike previous proposals, MED allows us to directly translate assumptions
about user behavior from any established effectiveness measure to create a
corresponding rank similarity measure. In addition, MED cleanly accommodates
partial relevance judgments, and if complete relevance information is
available, it reduces to a simple difference between effectiveness values.

fundamental) theorem of invariant theory provides a finite spanning set for
this algebra, whereas a a second main theorem describes the linear relations
between those basic invariants.
  We use diagrammatic methods to carry Weyl's programme a step further,
providing explicit bases for the subspace of the r-th tensor powers of V
invariant under the action of G, that are additionally preserved by the action
of the long cycle of the symmetric group on r letters. The representations we
study are essentially those that occur in Weyl's book: the defining
representations of the symplectic groups, the defining representations of the
symmetric groups considered as linear representations, and the adjoint
representations of the linear groups.
  In particular, we present a transparent, combinatorial proof of a second
fundamental theorem for the defining representation of the symplectic groups
Sp(2n). Our formulation is explicit and provides a very precise link to
(n+1)-noncrossing perfect matchings, going beyond a dimension count. Extending
our argument to the k-th symmetric powers of these representations, the
combinatorial objects involved turn out to be (n+1)-noncrossing k-regular
graphs. As corollaries we obtain instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon for
these objects and the natural rotation action.
  In general, we derive branching rules for the diagram algebras corresponding
to the representations in a uniform way. We also compute the Frobenius
characteristics of modules of the diagram algebras restricted to the action of

($\alpha$-phase) of iron disilicide. Measurements of the magnetic
susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity and resistivity were performed on
well characterized single crystals. With a nominal iron $d^6$ configuration,
and a quasi-two dimensional crystal structure that strongly resembles that of
LiFeAs, $\alpha$-FeSi$_2$ is a potential candidate for unconventional
superconductivity. Akin to LiFeAs, $\alpha$-FeSi$_2$ does not develop any
magnetic order, and we confirm its metallic state down to the lowest
temperatures ($T$=1.8 K). However, our experiments reveal that paramagnetism
and electronic correlation effects in $\alpha$-FeSi$_2$ are considerably weaker
than in the pnictides. Band theory calculations yield small Sommerfeld
coefficients of the electronic specific heat $\gamma=C_e/T$ that are in
excellent agreement with experiment. Additionally, realistic many-body
calculations further corroborate that quasi-particle mass enhancements are only
modest in $\alpha$-FeSi$_{2}$ .
  Remarkably, we find that the natural tendency to vacancy formation in the
iron sublattice has little influence on the iron valence and the density of
states at the Fermi level. Moreover, Mn doping does not significantly change
the electronic state of the Fe ion. This suggests that the iron valence is
protected against hole doping, and indeed the substitution of Co for Fe causes
a rigid-band like response of the electronic properties. As a key difference
from the pnictides, we identify the smaller inter-iron layer spacing, which
causes the active orbitals near the Fermi level to be of a different symmetry
in $\alpha$-FeSi$_2$. This change in orbital character might be responsible for
the lack of superconductivity in this system, providing constraints on pairing
theories in the iron based pnictides and chalcogenides.

front-side of the Sun during the rise to peak phase of cycle 24 (first 62
months) in order to understand the key factors affecting the occurrence of
large solar energetic particle events (SEPs) and the ground levels enhancement
(GLE) events. The eruptions involve major flares with soft X-ray peak flux >/=
5.0 x10-5 Wm-2 (i.e., flare size >/= M5.0) and accompanying coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). The selection criterion was based on the fact that the only
front-side GLE in cycle 24 (GLE 71) had a flare size of M5.1. Only ~37% of the
major eruptions from the western hemisphere resulted in large SEP events.
Almost the same number of large SEP events was produced in weaker eruptions
(flare size <M5.0), suggesting that the soft X-ray flare is not a good
indicator of SEP or GLE events. On the other hand, the CME speed is a better
indicator of SEP and GLE events because it is consistently high supporting the
shock acceleration mechanism for SEPs and GLEs. We found the CME speed,
magnetic connectivity to Earth, and ambient conditions as the main factors that
contribute to the lack of high energy particle events during cycle 24. Several
eruptions poorly connected to Earth (eastern-hemisphere or behind-the-west-limb
events) resulted in very large SEP events detected by the STEREO spacecraft.
Some very fast CMEs, likely to have accelerated particles to GeV energies, did
not result in a GLE event because of poor latitudinal connectivity. The
stringent latitudinal requirement suggests that the highest energy particles
are likely accelerated in the nose part of shocks. There were also
well-connected fast CMEs, which did not seem to have accelerated high energy
particles due to possible unfavorable ambient conditions (high Alfven speed,
overall reduction in acceleration efficiency in cycle 24).

of the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bootes II from Keck/HIRES high-resolution

(stat.) +/- 0.17 (sys.) this star chemically resembles metal-poor halo field
stars and the signatures of other faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies at the same
metallicities in that it shows enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, Solar Fe-peak
element abundances, and low upper limits on the neutron-capture element Ba.
Moreover, this star shows no chemical peculiarities in any of the eight
elements we were able to measure. This implies that the chemical outliers found
in other systems remain outliers pertaining to the unusual enrichment histories
of the respective environments, while Bootes II appears to have experienced an
enrichment history typical of its very low mass. We also re-calibrated previous
measurements of the galaxy's metallicity from the calcium triplet (CaT) and
find a much lower value than reported before. The resulting broad metallicity
spread, in excess of one dex, the very metal poor mean, and the chemical
abundance patterns of the present star imply that Bootes II is a low-mass, old,
metal poor dwarf galaxy and not an overdensity associated with the Sagittarius
Stream as has been previously suggested based on its sky position and
kinematics. The low, mean CaT metallicity of -2.7 dex falls right on the
luminosity-metallicity relation delineated over four orders of magnitude from
the more luminous to the faintest galaxies. Thus Bootes II's chemical
enrichment appears representative of the galaxy's original mass, while tidal
stripping and other mass loss mechanisms were probably not significant as for
other low-mass satellites.

line (BAL) quasars. These targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the optically
brightest and most luminous BAL quasars known at z<1.3. However, their
rest-frame 2 keV luminosities are 14 to >330 times weaker than expected for
typical quasars. Our results from a pilot NuSTAR study of two low-redshift BAL
quasars, a Chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift BAL quasars,
and a NuSTAR spectral analysis of the local BAL quasar Mrk 231 have already
suggested the existence of intrinsically X-ray weak BAL quasars, i.e., quasars
not emitting X-rays at the level expected from their optical/UV emission. The
aim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinary
objects. Three of the six new targets are weakly detected by NuSTAR with <45
counts in the 3-24 keV band, and the other three are not detected. The hard
X-ray (8-24 keV) weakness observed by NuSTAR requires Compton-thick absorption
if these objects have nominal underlying X-ray emission. However, a soft
stacked effective photon index ({\Gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavors
Compton-thick absorption in general. The uniform hard X-ray weakness observed
by NuSTAR for this and the pilot samples selected with <10 keV weakness also
suggests that the X-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.
We conclude that the NuSTAR observations have likely discovered a significant
population (>33%) of intrinsically X-ray weak objects among the BAL quasars
with significantly weak <10 keV emission. We suggest that intrinsically X-ray
weak quasars might be preferentially observed as BAL quasars.

removal of the gaseous envelope in a few Gyr, and leaving behind an exposed
rocky core (""hot super-Earth""). Final orbital periods are quite sensitive to
the details of the planet's mass-radius relation, and to the effects of

intermediate masses (""hot Neptunes"") that should be found precisely at their
Roche limit and in the process of losing mass through Roche lobe overflow. The
observed excess of small single-planet candidate systems observed by Kepler may
also be the result of this process. If so, the properties of their host stars

mass-loss via evaporative outflows from exoplanets that experience UV

stellar magnetic fields, along with mass-loss from both the star and planet. We
then conduct series of numerical simulations for gas giant planets, and vary
the planetary field strength, background stellar field strength, UV heating
flux, and planet mass. These simulations show that the flow is magnetically
controlled for moderate field strengths and even the highest UV fluxes, i.e.,
planetary surface fields $B_P\gtrsim 0.3$ gauss and fluxes $F_{UV}\sim10^{6}$
erg s$^{-1}$. We thus conclude that outflows from all hot Jupiters with
moderate surface fields are magnetically controlled. The inclusion of magnetic
fields highly suppresses outflow from the night-side of the planet. Only the
magnetic field lines near the pole are open and allow outflow to occur. The
fraction of open field lines depends sensitively on the strength (and geometry)
of the background magnetic field from the star, along with the UV heating rate.
The net effect of the magnetic field is to suppress the mass loss rate by
(approximately) an order of magnitude. Finally, some open field lines do not
allow the flow to pass smoothly through the sonic point; flow along these
streamlines does not reach steady-state, resulting in time-variable mass-loss.

in A$_2$IrO$_3$ includes both isotropic and anisotropic Kitaev-type

and that the magnitude of the Kitaev interaction between next-nearest neighbor
Ir magnetic moments is comparable with nearest neighbor interactions. We also
find that, while the Heisenberg and the Kitaev interactions between nearest
neighbors are correspondingly antiferro- and ferromagnetic, they both change
sign for the next-nearest neighbors. Using classical Monte Carlo simulations we
examine the magnetic phase diagram of the derived super-exchange model.
Zigzag-type antiferromagnetic order is found to occupy a large part of the
phase diagram of the model and, for ferromagnetic next-nearest neighbor
Heisenberg interaction relevant for Na$_2$IrO$_3$, it can be stabilized even in
the absence of third nearest neighbor coupling. Our results suggest that a
natural physical origin of the zigzag phase experimentally observed in

modeling the dynamics of trade-time returns and trade arrivals. Our main
contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the distributional behavior

We show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time
returns of the highly liquid near-month E-mini S&P 500 futures contract are
well characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second,
we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns by
subordinating a trade-time Gaussian distribution with a trade arrival process
that is associated with a modified Markov-Switching Multifractal Duration
(MSMD) model. This model provides an excellent characterization of
high-frequency inter-trade durations. Over-dispersion in this distribution of
inter-trade durations leads to leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in
clock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we use
our model to extrapolate the empirical relationship between trade rate and
volatility in an effort to understand conditions of market failure. Our model
suggests that the 1,200 km physical separation of financial markets in Chicago
and New York/New Jersey provides a natural ceiling on systemic volatility and
may contribute to market stability during periods of extremely heavy trading.

increasing information on average likely holds for every successful line of
descent, but it is not clear whether this increase is due to a general law, or
whether it is a secondary effect linked to an overall increase in fitness.
Here, we use ""digital life"" evolution experiments to study whether information
is under selection if treated as an organismal trait, using the Price equation.
By measuring both sides of the equation individually in an adapting population,
the strength of selection on a trait appears as a ""gap"" between the two terms
of the right-hand-side of the Price equation. We find that information is
strongly selected (as it encodes all fitness-producing traits) by comparing the
strength of selection on information to a weakly selected trait (sequence
length), as well as to a neutral marker. We observe that while strength of
selection on arbitrary traits can vary during an experiment (including
reversing sign), information is a selectable trait that must increase in a
fixed environment.

receiver with practically feasible complexity. Sparse code multiple access
(SCMA) is a multi-dimensional codebook-based non-orthogonal spreading

spectral analyses which fit to average pitch angles for whole galaxies. The new
analysis is based on a correlation between pieces of a galaxy in circular
windows of $(\ln R, \theta)$ space and logarithmic spirals with various pitch
angles. The diameter of the windows is varied to study different scales. The
result is a best-fit pitch angle to the spiral structure as a function of
position and scale, or a distribution function of pitch angles as a function of

distribution of pitch angles in the arm and interarm regions of these two

main spirals on a large scale, but also shows higher pitch angles on smaller
scales resulting from dust feathers. For the interarms, there is a broad
distribution of pitch angles representing the continuation and evolution of the
spiral arm feathers as the flow moves into the interarm regions. Our method
shows a multiplicity of spiral structures on different scales, as expected from
gas flow processes in a gravitating, turbulent and shearing interstellar

parameters leads to a more strongly coupled system of phase field equations, in
contrast to that with certain special choice of the order parameters. However,
the general form enables one to compute the N-phase mixing energy density
coefficients in an explicit fashion in terms of the pairwise surface tensions.
From the simulation perspective, the increased complexity in the form of the
phase field equations with general order parameters in actuality does not cause
essential computational difficulties. Our numerical algorithm reformulates the
($N-1$) strongly-coupled phase field equations for general order parameters
into $2(N-1)$ Helmholtz-type equations that are completely de-coupled from one
another, leading to a computational complexity essentially the same as that of
the simpler phase field equations associated with special choice of order

to be at most 2 bits independent of the number of competing users. Motivated by
the small savings in the lossless case, simple achievable schemes for both the

their host stars -- is a long-standing puzzle. Planet formation theories
suggest that such planets are unlikely to have formed in-situ but instead may
have formed at large orbital separations beyond the snow line and migrated
inward to their present orbits. Two competing hypotheses suggest that the
planets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during
their formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions
with a third body. Observations of eccentricities and spin-orbit misalignments
of hot Jupiter systems have been unable to differentiate between the two
hypotheses. In the present work, we suggest that chemical depletions in hot
Jupiter atmospheres might be able to constrain their migration mechanisms. We
find that sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances in Jovian-mass hot Jupiters
around Sun-like stars are hard to explain by disk migration. Instead, such
abundances are more readily explained by giant planets forming at large orbital
separations, either by core accretion or gravitational instability, and
migrating to close-in orbits via disk-free mechanisms involving dynamical
encounters. Such planets also contain solar or super-solar C/O ratios. On the
contrary, hot Jupiters with super-solar O and C abundances can be explained by
a variety of formation-migration pathways which, however, lead to solar or
sub-solar C/O ratios. Current estimates of low oxygen abundances in hot Jupiter
atmospheres may be indicative of disk-free migration mechanisms. We discuss
open questions in this area which future studies will need to investigate.

U' = Y$ for each two different elements $U$ and $U'$ in ${\cal B}$. The
well-known sunflower lemma states that a given family ${\cal F}$ of sets, each
of cardinality at most $s$, includes a sunflower of cardinality $k$ if $|{\cal
F}|> (k-1)^s s!$. Since Erd\""os and Rado proved it in 1960, it has not been
known for more than half a century whether the sunflower bound $(k-1)^s s!$ can
be improved asymptotically for any $k$ and $s$. It is conjectured that it can
be reduced to $c_k^s$ for some real number $c_k>0$ depending only on $k$, which
is called the sunflower conjecture. This paper shows that the general sunflower
bound can be indeed reduced by an exponential factor: We prove that ${\cal F}$
includes a sunflower of cardinality $k$ if \[
  |{\cal F|} \ge \left( \sqrt{10} -2 \right)^2 \left[ k \cdot \min \left(
\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}-2}, \frac{c}{\log \min(k, s)} \right) \right]^s s!, \] for a
constant $c>0$, and any $k \ge 2$ and $s \ge 2$. For instance, whenever $k \ge
s^\epsilon$ for a given constant $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, the sunflower bound is
reduced from $(k-1)^s s!$ to $(k-1)^s s! \cdot \left[ O \left( \frac{1}{\log s}
\right) \right]^s$, achieving the reduction ratio of $\left[ O \left(
\frac{1}{\log s} \right) \right]^s$. Also any ${\cal F}$ of cardinality at
least $\left(\sqrt{10}-2 \right)^2 \left( \frac{k}{\sqrt{10}-2} \right)^s s!$
includes a sunflower of cardinality $k$, where
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}-2}=0.8603796\ldots$. Our result demonstrates that the
sunflower bound can be improved by a factor of less than a small constant to
the power $s$, giving hope for further update.

Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) using Configuration Interaction
(CI)-type trial wavefunctions. To keep the number of determinants reasonable
(the first and second derivatives of the trial wavefunction need to be
calculated at each step of FN-DMC), the CI expansion is restricted to those
determinants that contribute the most to the total energy. The selection of the
determinants is made using the so-called CIPSI approach (Configuration
Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively). Quite remarkably,
the nodes of CIPSI wavefunctions are found to be systematically improved when
increasing the number of selected determinants. To reduce the non-parallelism
error of the potential energy curve a scheme based on the use of a
$R$-dependent number of determinants is introduced. Numerical results show that
improved FN-DMC energy curves for the F$_2$ molecule are obtained when
employing CIPSI trial wavefunctions. Using the Dunning's cc-pVDZ basis set the
FN-DMC energy curve is of a quality similar to that obtained with FCI/cc-pVQZ.
A key advantage of using selected CI in FN-DMC is the possibility of improving
nodes in a systematic and automatic way without resorting to a preliminary
multi-parameter stochastic optimization of the trial wavefunction performed at
the Variational Monte Carlo level as usually done in FN-DMC.

earthquakes, or due to long-term environmental degradation, usually occurs in
localized areas of a structure. A new sparse Bayesian probabilistic framework
for computing the probability of localized stiffness reductions induced by
damage is presented that uses noisy incomplete modal data from before and after
possible damage. This new approach employs system modal parameters of the
structure as extra variables for Bayesian model updating with incomplete modal
data. A specific hierarchical Bayesian model is constructed that promotes
spatial sparseness in the inferred stiffness reductions in a way that is
consistent with the Bayesian Ockham razor. To obtain the most plausible model
of sparse stiffness reductions together with its uncertainty within a specified
class of models, the method employs an optimization scheme that iterates among
all uncertain parameters, including the hierarchical hyper-parameters. The
approach has four important benefits: (1) it infers spatially-sparse stiffness
changes based on the identified modal parameters; (2) the uncertainty in the
inferred stiffness reductions is quantified; (3) no matching of model and
experimental modes is needed, and (4) solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem
of a structural model is not required. The proposed method is applied to two
previously-studied examples using simulated data: a ten-story shear-building
and the three-dimensional braced-frame model from the Phase II Simulated
Benchmark problem sponsored by the IASC-ASCE Task Group on Structural Health
Monitoring. The results show that the occurrence of false-positive and
false-negative damage detection is clearly reduced in the presence of modeling
error. Furthermore, the identified most probable stiffness loss ratios are
close to their actual values.

sufficiently far away from the camera to be approximately invariant to depth
changes and their reflectance does not vary with the viewing direction. We
introduce a highly parallelizable model for light field motion blur that is
computationally and memory efficient. We then adapt a regularized blind

non-relativistic contraction of a specific class of canonical $r$-matrices
associated with the Drinfel'd double structure of the (2+1) (anti)-de Sitter
Lie algebra. The full quantum group structure associated with such (2+1)
Galilean and Newton-Hooke Drinfel'd doubles is presented, and the corresponding
noncommutative spacetimes are shown to contain a commuting 'absolute time'
coordinate ${\hat x}_0$ together with two noncommutative space coordinates
$({\hat x}_1,{\hat x}_2)$, whose commutator is a function of the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ and of the (central) 'quantum time' coordinate ${\hat x}_0$.
Thus, the Chern-Simons approach to Galilean (2+1) gravity can be consistently
understood as the appropriate non-relativistic limit of the Lorentzian theory,
and their associated quantum group symmetries (which do not fall into the
family of so-called kappa-deformations) can also be derived from the (anti)-de
Sitter quantum doubles through a well-defined quantum group contraction
procedure.

  of the GSL",,,,"gr-qc physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the early 1970s it is was realized that there is a striking formal analogy
between the Laws of black-hole mechanics and the Laws of classical
thermodynamics. Before the discovery of Hawking radiation, however, it was
generally thought that the analogy was only formal, and did not reflect a deep
connection between gravitational and thermodynamical phenomena. It is still
commonly held that the surface gravity of a stationary black hole can be
construed as a true physical temperature and its area as a true entropy only
when quantum effects are taken into account; in the context of classical
general relativity alone, one cannot cogently construe them so. Does the use of
quantum field theory in curved spacetime offer the only hope for taking the
analogy seriously? I think the answer is `no'. To attempt to justify that
answer, I shall begin by arguing that the standard argument to the contrary is
not physically well founded, and in any event begs the question. Looking at the
various ways that the ideas of ""temperature"" and ""entropy"" enter classical
thermodynamics then will suggest arguments that, I claim, show the analogy
between classical black-hole mechanics and classical thermodynamics should be
taken more seriously, without the need to rely on or invoke quantum mechanics.
In particular, I construct an analogue of a Carnot cycle in which a black hole
""couples"" with an ordinary thermodynamical system in such a way that its
surface gravity plays the role of temperature and its area that of entropy.
Thus, the connection between classical general relativity and classical
thermodynamics on their own is already deep and physically significant,
independent of quantum mechanics.

wishes to publicly release data that is correlated with his private data, in
the hope of getting some utility. Our approach relies on a general statistical
inference framework that captures the privacy threat under inference attacks,
given utility constraints. Under this framework, data is distorted before it is
released, according to a privacy-preserving probabilistic mapping. This mapping
is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes
information leakage under a distortion constraint. We address practical
challenges encountered when applying this theoretical framework to real world
data. On one hand, the design of optimal privacy-preserving mechanisms requires
knowledge of the prior distribution linking private data and data to be
released, which is often unavailable in practice. On the other hand, the
optimization may become untractable and face scalability issues when data
assumes values in large size alphabets, or is high dimensional. Our work makes
three major contributions. First, we provide bounds on the impact on the
privacy-utility tradeoff of a mismatched prior. Second, we show how to reduce
the optimization size by introducing a quantization step, and how to generate
privacy mappings under quantization. Third, we evaluate our method on three
datasets, including a new dataset that we collected, showing correlations
between political convictions and TV viewing habits. We demonstrate that good
privacy properties can be achieved with limited distortion so as not to
undermine the original purpose of the publicly released data, e.g.

optical response than the Nb-junction, which is as expected since Al electrode
has a smaller superconducting gap energy. The minimum detectable radiation

However the performance of ICP relies heavily on the initial conditions. Hence,
it is necessary to provide an initial registration, which will be improved
iteratively and finally converge to the best alignment possible. Once the faces
are registered, the occlusions are automatically extracted by thresholding the
depth map values of the 3D image. After the occluded regions are detected,
restoration is done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The restored images,
after the removal of occlusions, are then fed to the recognition system for
classification purpose. Features are extracted from the reconstructed
non-occluded face images in the form of face normals. The experimental results
which were obtained on the occluded facial images from the Bosphorus 3D face

metamaterial absorber as a sensor is the sensitive shift in the absorber
resonance frequency along with the sharp change in the amplitude of the
resonance due to strong interaction of the analyte with the electric and the
magnetic fields at resonant perfect absorption frequency. We compare the
sensing performance of the perfect metamaterial absorber with its complementary
structural design and planar metasurface with identical structure. The best FoM
values obtained for the absorber sensor here is 2.67 which we found to be
significantly higher than the identical planar metamaterial resonator design.
We further show that the sensitivity of the sensor depends on the analyte
thickness with the best sensitivity values obtained for thicknesses approaching
{\lambda}/4n, with {\lambda} being the free space resonance wavelength and n
being the refractive index of the analyte. Application of metamaterial

over several hundreds sight lines sampling the diffuse interstellar medium
(ISM) in both the Solar neighbourhood and the inner Galactic disk. They provide
unprecedented statistics on the first steps of chemistry in the diffuse gas.
Aims. These new data confirm the limitations of the traditional chemical
pathways driven by the UV photons and the cosmic rays (CR) and the need for
additional energy sources, such as turbulent dissipation, to open highly
endoenergetic formation routes. The goal of the present paper is to further
investigate the link between specific species and the properties of the
turbulent cascade in particular its space-time intermittency. Methods. We have
analysed ten different atomic and molecular species in the framework of the
updated model of turbulent dissipation regions (TDR). We study the influence on
the abundances of these species of parameters specific to chemistry (density,
UV field, and CR ionisation rate) and those linked to turbulence (the average
turbulent dissipation rate, the dissipation timescale, and the ion neutral
velocity drift in the regions of dissipation). Results. The most sensitive
tracers of turbulent dissipation are the abundances of CH+ and SH+, and the
column densities of the J = 3, 4, 5 rotational levels of H2 . The abundances of
CO, HCO+, and the intensity of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] emission line are
significantly enhanced by turbulent dissipation. The vast diversity of chemical
pathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never
estimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate,
$\overline{\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20
cm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity
drift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a
range of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+
abundance ratio. For the first time, we reproduce the large abundances of CO
observed on diffuse lines of sight, and we show that CO may be abundant even in
regions with UV-shieldings as low as $5 \times 10^{-3}$ mag. The best range of
parameters also reproduces the abundance ratios of OH, C2H, and H2O to HCO+ and
are consistent with the known properties of the turbulent cascade in the
Galactic diffuse ISM. Conclusions. Our results disclose an unexpected link
between the dissipation of turbulence and the emergence of molecular richness
in the diffuse ISM. Some species, such as CH+ or SH+, turn out to be unique
tracers of the energy trail in the ISM. In spite of some degeneracy, the
properties of the turbulent cascade, down to dissipation, can be captured
through specific molecular abundances.

finite volume scheme on unstructured triangular meshes that is high order
accurate in space and time and that also allows for time-accurate local time
stepping (LTS). The new scheme uses the following basic ingredients: a high
order WENO reconstruction in space on unstructured meshes, an element-local
high-order accurate space-time Galerkin predictor that performs the time
evolution of the reconstructed polynomials within each element, the computation
of numerical ALE fluxes at the moving element interfaces through approximate
Riemann solvers, and a one-step finite volume scheme for the time update which
is directly based on the integral form of the conservation equations in
space-time. The inclusion of the LTS algorithm requires a number of crucial
extensions, such as a proper scheduling criterion for the time update of each
element and for each node; a virtual projection of the elements contained in
the reconstruction stencils of the element that has to perform the WENO
reconstruction; and the proper computation of the fluxes through the space-time
boundary surfaces that will inevitably contain hanging nodes in time due to the
LTS algorithm. We have validated our new unstructured Lagrangian LTS approach
over a wide sample of test cases solving the Euler equations of compressible
gasdynamics in two space dimensions, including shock tube problems, cylindrical
explosion problems, as well as specific tests typically adopted in Lagrangian
calculations, such as the Kidder and the Saltzman problem. When compared to the
traditional global time stepping (GTS) method, the newly proposed LTS algorithm
allows to reduce the number of element updates in a given simulation by a
factor that may depend on the complexity of the dynamics, but which can be as
large as 4.7.

C60(NO2)12 disintegrates, increasing temperature and pressure by thousands of
Kelvins and bars within tens of picoseconds. The explosion starts with NO2
group isomerization into C-O-N-O, followed by emission of NO molecules and
formation of CO groups on the buckyball surface. NO oxidizes into NO2, and C60
falls apart liberating CO2. At highest temperatures, CO2 gives rise to diatomic
carbon. The study shows that the initiation temperature and released energy
depend strongly on the chemical composition and density of the material. The
established explosion mechanism provides guidelines for control of combustion
and detonation on the nanoscale.

nuclei (AGNs) peaks at higher redshifts than that of faint AGNs. This
downsizing trend in the AGN evolution seems to be contradictory to the
hierarchical structure formation scenario. In this study, we present the AGN
space density evolution predicted by a semi-analytic model of galaxy and AGN
formation based on the hierarchical structure formation scenario. We
demonstrate that our model can reproduce the downsizing trend of the AGN space
density evolution. The reason for the downsizing trend in our model is a
combination of the cold gas depletion as a consequence of star formation, the
gas cooling suppression in massive halos and the AGN lifetime scaling with the
dynamical timescale. We assume that a major merger of galaxies causes a
starburst, spheroid formation, and cold gas accretion onto a supermassive black
hole (SMBH). We also assume that this cold gas accretion triggers AGN activity.
Since the cold gas is mainly depleted by star formation and gas cooling is
suppressed in massive dark halos, the amount of cold gas accreted onto SMBHs
decreases with cosmic time. Moreover, AGN lifetime increases with cosmic time.
Thus, at low redshifts, major mergers do not always lead to luminous AGNs.
Because the luminosity of AGNs is correlated with the mass of accreted gas onto
SMBHs, the space density of luminous AGNs decreases more quickly than that of
faint AGNs. We conclude that the anti-hierarchical evolution of the AGN space
density is not contradictory to the hierarchical structure formation scenario.

electromagnetic interactions between particles can dominate the behavior so
that the mass and charge of the individual particles becomes irrelevant; the
induced fields are then comparable to the inducing fields and energy goes into

for image processing, many use image patches to form dictionaries. This paper
focuses on whole-image recovery from corrupted linear measurements. We address
the open issue of representing an image by overlapping patches: the overlapping
leads to an excessive number of dictionary coefficients to determine. With very
few exceptions, this issue has limited the applications of image-patch methods
to the local kind of tasks such as denoising, inpainting, cartoon-texture
decomposition, super-resolution, and image deblurring, for which one can
process a few patches at a time. Our focus is global imaging tasks such as
compressive sensing and medical image recovery, where the whole image is
encoded together, making it either impossible or very ineffective to update a
few patches at a time.
  Our strategy is to divide the sparse recovery into multiple subproblems, each
of which handles a subset of non-overlapping patches, and then the results of
the subproblems are averaged to yield the final recovery. This simple strategy
is surprisingly effective in terms of both quality and speed. In addition, we
accelerate computation of the learned dictionary by applying a recent block
proximal-gradient method, which not only has a lower per-iteration complexity
but also takes fewer iterations to converge, compared to the current
state-of-the-art. We also establish that our algorithm globally converges to a
stationary point. Numerical results on synthetic data demonstrate that our
algorithm can recover a more faithful dictionary than two state-of-the-art
methods.
  Combining our whole-image recovery and dictionary-learning methods, we
numerically simulate image inpainting, compressive sensing recovery, and
deblurring. Our recovery is more faithful than those of a total variation

perturbed magnet's electrostatic charge distribution and the motion of the
magnet's charges. This internal electromagnetic momentum does not seem to be
recognized as distinct from the familiar external electromagnetic momentum
associated with the electric field of the external charge and the magnetic
field of the unperturbed magnet. In the multiparticle limit, the hidden
mechanical momentum becomes negligible while the internal electromagnetic
momentum provides the compensating linear momentum required by the relativistic
conservation law connecting the total linear momentum to motion of the center
of energy. Whereas the changes in the external electromagnetic momentum are
often associated with magnetic forces of order $1/c^{2},$ changes in the
internal electromagnetic momentum are associated with the electrical forces of
order $1/c^{2}$. These electrical forces are relevant to the Shockley-James
paradox and to the experimentally observed Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher
phase shifts.

discussion of the Shockly-James paradox by designating relativistic hidden
mechanical momentum as the basis for resolution of the paradox. This blunder
has had a wide influence in the current physics literature, including erroneous
work on the Shockley-James paradox, on Mansuripur's paradox, on the motion of a
magnetic moment, on the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift, and on the Aharonov-Casher
phase shift. Although hidden mechanical momentum is indeed dominant for
non-interacting particles moving in a closed orbit under the influence of an
external electric field, the attention directed toward hidden mechanical
momentum represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the classical
electromagnetic interaction between a multiparticle magnet and an external
point charge. In the interacting multiparticle situation, the external charge
induces an electrostatic polarization of the magnet which leads to an internal
electromagnetic momentum in the magnet where both the electric and magnetic
fields for the momentum are contributed by the magnet particles. This internal
electromagnetic momentum for the interacting multiparticle situation is equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction compared to the familiar external
electromagnetic momentum where the electric field is contributed by the
external charged particle and the magnetic field is that due to the magnet. In
the present article, the momentum balance of the Shockley-James situation for a
system of a magnet and a point charge is calculated in detail for a magnet
model consisting of two interacting point charges which are constrained to move
in a circular orbit on a frictionless ring with a compensating negative charge
at the center.

used as a pedagogical example for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.
We introduce and illustrate some methods, approximations, and phenomena related
to dissipation and nonlinearity in many-particle physics. We start our analysis
from the dynamical Sudarshan-Lindblad quantum master equation for the density
operator of a system $\mathcal{S}$ interacting with a thermal reservoir
$\mathcal{R}$. We derive the quantum version of the so-called
Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) equations such that the master
equation can be decomposed in a hierarchical set of $N-1$ equations ($N>1$).
The hierarchy is broken by introducing the mean-field approximation and
reducing the problem to a nonlinear single particle system. In this scenario,
the Hamiltonian is nonlinear (i.e., it depends on the state of $\mathcal{S}$),
although the superoperator responsible for the dissipation and decoherence of
$\mathcal{S}$ remains unaffected. To provide a useful tool to students: (1) we
discuss the physical approximations involved, (2) we derive the analytical
solution to the mean values equations of motion resulting from the Hamiltonian,
(3) we solve analytically the master equation in the stationary regime, (4) we
obtain and discuss the solution of the nonlinear master equation, numerically,
and finally, (5) we discuss the master equation beyond the mean-field
approximation and show how to introduce higher order quantum correlations that
have been previously neglected.

In a control experiment, similar manipulations that do not reduce the number of

In individual cycles, the work to erase can be below the Landauer limit,
consistent with the Jarzynski equality.

homogeneity and isotropy restrict the form of the coordinate transformations
from one inertial frame to another to being Lorentz-like. The equations contain
a free parameter, $k$ (equal to $c^{-2}$ in special relativity), which value is
claimed to be merely an empirical matter, so that special relativity does not
need the postulate of constancy of the speed of light. I analyze this claim and
argue that the distinction between the cases $k = 0$ and $k \neq 0$ is on the
level of a postulate and that until we assume one or the other, we have an
incomplete structure that leaves many fundamental questions undecided,
including basic prerequisites of experimentation. I examine an analogous case
in which isotropy is the postulate dropped and use it to illustrate the
problem. Finally I analyze two attempts by Sfarti, and Behera and Mukhopadhyay
to derive the constancy of the speed of light from the principle of relativity.
I show that these attempts make hidden assumptions that are equivalent to the
second postulate.
