10^{-19}m, corresponding to energy scales at the level of a few TeV. In order
to reach even higher resolutions before the advent of future high-energy
colliders, it is necessary to consider indirect probes of New Physics (NP), a
prime example being Delta F=2 neutral meson mixing processes, which are
sensitive to much shorter distance scales. However Delta F=2 processes alone
cannot tell us much about the structure of NP beyond the LHC scales. To
identify for instance the presence of new quark flavour-changing dynamics of a
left-handed (LH) or right-handed (RH) nature, complementary results from Delta
F=1 rare decay processes are vital. We therefore address the important question
of whether NP could be seen up to energy scales as high as 200 TeV,
corresponding to distances as small as 10^{-21}m -- the Zeptouniverse -- in
rare K and B_{s,d} decays, subject to present Delta F=2 constraints and
perturbativity. We focus in particular on a heavy Z' gauge boson. If restricted
to purely LH or RH Z' couplings to quarks, we find that rare K decays, in
particular KL-> pi^0 nu nubar and K^+->pi^+ nu nubar, allow us to probe the
Zeptouniverse. On the other hand rare B_s and B_d decays, which receive
stronger Delta F=2 constraints, allow us to reach about 15 TeV. Allowing for
both LH and RH couplings a loosening of the Delta F=2 constraints is possible,
and we find that the maximal values of M_Z' at which NP effects that are
consistent with perturbative couplings could be found are approximately 2000
TeV for K decays and 160 TeV for rare B_{s,d} decays. Finally we present a
simple idea for an indirect determination of M_Z' that could be realised at the
next linear e^+e^- or mu^+ mu^- collider and with future precise flavour data.

days 3 and 732. To model the bolometric lightcurve before day 400 we use a grid
of hydrodynamical SN models and a bolometric correction determined with
steady-state NLTE modelling. Using this method we find a helium core mass of
3.1 (+0.7-0.4) solar masses for SN 2011dh, consistent within error bars with
previous results. We present bolometric and broad-band lightcurves between days
100 and 500 for the Jerkstrand et al. (2014) steady-state NLTE models, and the
preferred 12 solar masses (initial mass) model shows a good overall agreement
with the observed lightcurves. We find an excess in the K and the MIR bands
developing between days 100 and 250, during which an increase in the optical
decline rate is also observed. A local origin of the excess is suggested by the
depth of the HeI 2.058 micron absorption. Steady-state NLTE models with a
modest dust opacity in the core, turned on during this period, reproduce the
observed behaviour, but an additional excess in the Spitzer 4.5 micron band
remains. CO first-overtone band emission is detected at day 206, and possibly
at day 89, and assuming the additional excess to be dominated by CO fundamental
band emission, we find fundamental to first-overtone band ratios considerably
higher than observed in SN 1987A. This paper concludes our extensive

model calculations with data on the three best observed Type IIb SNe to-date -
SN 1993J, SN 2008ax, and SN 2011dh. Oxygen nucleosynthesis depends sensitively
on the main-sequence mass of the star and modeling of the [O I] 6300, 6364
lines constrains the progenitors of these three SNe to the M_ZAMS=12-16 M_sun
range (ejected oxygen masses 0.3-0.9 M_sun), with SN 2011dh towards the lower
end and SN 1993J towards the upper end of the range. The high ejecta masses
from M_ZAMS >= 17 M_sun progenitors give rise to brighter nebular phase
emission lines than observed. Nucleosynthesis analysis thus supports a scenario
of low/moderate mass progenitors for Type IIb SNe, and by implication an origin
in binary systems. We demonstrate how oxygen and magnesium recombination lines
may be combined to diagnose the magnesium mass in the SN ejecta. For SN 2011dh,
a magnesium mass of of 0.02-0.14 M_sun is derived, which gives a Mg/O
production ratio consistent with the solar value. Nitrogen left in the He
envelope from CNO-burning gives strong [N II] 6548, 6583 emission lines that
dominate over H-alpha emission in our models. The hydrogen envelopes of Type
IIb SNe are too small and dilute to produce any noticeable H-alpha emission or
absorption after ~150 days, and nebular phase emission seen around 6550 A is in
many cases likely caused by [N II] 6548, 6583. Finally, the influence of
radiative transport on the emergent line profiles is investigated...(abridged)

1806-20 are often interpreted as global magneto-elastic oscillations of the
neutron star. There is, however, a large discrepancy between theoretical
models, which predict that the highest frequency oscillations should die out
rapidly, and the observations, which suggested that the highest-frequency
signals persisted for ~100s in X-ray data from two different spacecraft. This
discrepancy is particularly important for the high-frequency QPO at ~625 Hz.
However, previous analyses did not systematically test whether the signal could
also be there in much shorter data segments, more consistent with the
theoretical predictions. Here, we test for the presence of the high-frequency
QPO at 625 Hz in data from both the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) systematically both in
individual rotational cycles of the neutron star, as well as averaged over
multiple successive rotational cycles at the same phase. We find that the QPO
in the RXTE data is consistent with being only present in a single cycle, for a
short duration of ~0.5s, whereas the RHESSI data are as consistent with a
short-lived signal that appears and disappears as with a long-lived QPO. Taken
together, this data provides evidence for strong magnetic interaction between
the crust and the core.

gyrokinetic calculations, using GS2 have been performed over a range of radial
surfaces, x, and for ballooning phase angle, p, in the range -${\pi} {\leq} p
{\leq\pi}$, to map out the complex local mode frequency, ${\Omega_0(x, p) =
\omega_0(x, p) + i\gamma_0(x, p)}$. Assuming a quadratic radial profile for the
drive, namely ${\eta_i = L_n/L_T}$, (holding constant all other equilibrium
profiles such as safety factor, magnetic shear etc.), ${\Omega_0(x, p)}$ has a
stationary point. The reconstructed global mode then sits on the outboard mid
plane of the tokamak plasma, and is known as a conventional or isolated mode,
with global growth rate, ${\gamma}$ ~ Max[${\gamma_0(x, p)}$], where
${\gamma_0(x, p)}$ is the local growth rate. Taking the radial variation in
other equilibrium profiles (e.g safety factor q(x)) into account, removes the
stationary point in ${\Omega_0(x, p)}$ and results in a mode that peaks
slightly away from the outboard mid-plane with a reduced global growth rate.
Finally, the influence of flow shear has also been investigated through a
Doppler shift, ${\omega_0 \rightarrow \omega_0 + n\Omega^{\prime}x}$, where n
is the toroidal mode number and ${\Omega^{\prime}}$ incorporates the effect of
flow shear. The equilibrium profile variation introduces an asymmetry to the
growth rate spectrum with respect to the sign of ${\Omega^{\prime}}$,
consistent with recent global gyrokinetic calculations.

the context of Flavored Gauge Mediation (FGM). Within FGM, the messenger sector
couples directly to the MSSM matter fields with couplings controlled by the
same dynamics that explains the hierarchies in the SM Yukawas. Although the
pattern of flavor violation depends on the particular underlying flavor model,
FGM provides a built-in flavor suppression similar to wave function
renormalization or SUSY Partial Compositeness. Moreover, in contrast to these
models, there is an additional suppression of left-right (LR) flavor
transitions by third-generation Yukawas that in particular provides an extra
protection against flavor-blind phases. We exploit the consequences of this
setup for lepton flavor phenomenology, assuming that the new couplings are
controlled by simple U(1) flavor models that have been proposed to accommodate
large neutrino mixing angles. Remarkably, it turns out that in the context of
FGM these models can pass the impressive constraints from LFV processes and
leptonic EDMs even for light superpartners, therefore offering the possibility
of resolving the longstanding muon g-2 anomaly.

namely altered glucose metabolism and immune evasion, may in fact be
fundamentally linked (Kareva and Hahnfeldt, 2013). This connection comes from
up-regulation of glycolysis by tumor cells, which can lead to active
competition for resources in the tumor microenvironment between tumor and
immune cells. Here it is further proposed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) can
circumvent the anti-tumor immune response by creating a 'protective shield' of
non-stem cancer cells around them. This shield can protect the CSCs both by
creating a physical barrier between them and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and
by promoting competition for the common resources, such as glucose, between
non-stem cancer cells and CTLs. The implications of this hypothesis are
investigate using an agent-based model, leading to a prediction that relative
CSC to non-CSC ratio will vary with the strength of the host immune response,
with the highest occurring at an intermediate state of immune activation. A
discussion of possible therapeutic approaches concludes the paper, suggesting
that a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of regular pulsed doses, i.e.,
metronomic chemotherapy, would yield the best clinical outcome by allowing CTLs
to most effectively reach and eliminate CSCs.

other. This model is preferred over the Y-shaped string model with a quark at
each endpoint. We show how the model follows from a stringy model of the
holographic baryon which includes a baryonic vertex connected with N_c strings
to flavor probe branes. From fitting to baryonic data we find that there is no
clear evidence for a non-zero baryonic vertex mass, but if there is such a mass
it should be located at one of the string endpoints. The available baryon
trajectories in the angular momentum plane (J,M^2), involving light, strange,
and charmed baryons, are rather well fitted when adding masses to the string
endpoints, with a single universal slope of 0.95 GeV^-2. Most of the results
for the quark masses are then found to be consistent with the results extracted
from the meson spectra in a preceding paper, where the value of the slope
emerging from the meson fits was found to be 0.90 GeV^-2. In the plane of
quantum radial excitations, (n,M^2), we also find a good agreement between the
meson and baryon slopes. The flavor structure of the diquark is examined, where
our interest lies in particular on baryons composed of more than one quark
heavier than the u and d quarks. For these baryons we present a method of

two gauge-theory factors; one originating from pure N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory

non-abelian vector interactions in the supergravity theory. As a demonstration
of the power of this structure, we present explicit computations at tree-level

static line source, represented by a form of the Levi-Civita metric. The
perturbations are restricted to axial symmetry but break the cylindrical
symmetry of the background metric. We analyze the gauge issues that arise in
setting up the appropriate form of the perturbed metric and show that it is
possible to restrict to diagonal terms, but that this does not fix the gauge
completely. We derive the perturbation equations and show that they can be
solved by solving a third order ordinary differential equation for an
appropriately chosen function of the perturbed metric coefficients. The set of
solutions of this equation contains gauge trivial parts, and we show how to
extract the gauge non trivial components. We introduce appropriate boundary
conditions on the solutions and show that these lead to a boundary value
problem that determines the allowed functional forms of the perturbation modes.
The associated eigenvalues determine a sort of ""dispersion relation"" for the
frequencies and corresponding ""wave vector"" components. The central result of
this analysis is that the spectrum of allowed frequencies contains one unstable
(imaginary frequency) mode for every possible choice of the background metric.
The completeness of the mode expansion in relation to the initial value problem
and to the gauge problem is discussed in detail, and we show that the
perturbations contain an unstable component for generic initial data, and,
therefore, that the Levi-Civita space times are gravitationally unstable. We
also include, for completeness, a set of approximate eigenvalues, and examples
of the functional form of the solutions.

understanding of many processes, from heavy-ion collisions to neutron stars
structure. While the total nuclear symmetry energy at nuclear saturation
density (\rho_0) is relatively well determined, its value at supranuclear
densities is not. The latter can be better constrained by separately examining
its kinetic and potential terms and their density dependencies. The kinetic
term of the symmetry energy, E_sym^kin(\rho_0), equals the difference in the
per-nucleon kinetic energy between pure neutron matter (PNM) and symmetric
nuclear matter (SNM), often calculated using a simple Fermi gas model. However,
experiments show that tensor force induced short-range correlations (SRC)
between proton-neutron pairs shift nucleons to high-momentum in SNM, but have
almost no effect in PNM. We present an approximate analytical expression for
E_sym^kin(\rho) of correlated nucleonic matter. In our model, E_sym^kin(\rho_0)
= -10 MeV, which differs significantly from +12.5 MeV for the widely-used free
Fermi gas model. This result is consistent with our analysis of recent data on
the free proton-to-neutron ratios measured in intermediate energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as with microscopic many-body calculations,
and previous phenomenological extractions. We then use our calculated
E_sym^kin(\rho) in combination with the known total symmetry energy and its
density dependence at saturation density to constrain the value and density
dependence of the potential part and to extrapolate the total symmetry energy

differentiating between continuous, infinitesimal movements of players, and
discrete events such as shot attempts and turnovers. Transition kernels are
estimated using hierarchical spatiotemporal models that share information
across players while remaining computationally tractable on very large data
sets. In addition to estimating EPV, these models reveal novel insights on

will be subject to a flux of infalling matter and radiation, which will cause
the outer apparent horizon (a marginal trapping surface) to be spacelike
\cite{ellisetal14}. As a consequence the radiation emitted close to the
apparent horizon no longer arrives at infinity with a diverging redshift.
Standard calculations of the emission of Hawking radiation then indicate that
no blackbody radiation is emitted to infinity by the black hole in these
circumstances, hence there will also then be no black hole evaporation process
due to emission of such radiation as long as the matter flux is significant.
The essential adiabatic condition (eikonal approximation) for black hole
radiation gives a strong limit to the black holes that can emit Hawking
radiation. We give the mass range for the black holes that can radiate,
according to their cosmological redshift, for the special case of the cosmic
blackbody radiation (CBR) influx (which exists everywhere in the universe). At
a very late stage of black hole formation when the CBR influx decays away, the
black hole horizon becomes first a slowly evolving horizon and then an isolated
horizon; at that stage, black hole radiation will start. This study suggests
that the primordial black hole evaporation scenario should be revised to take
these considerations into account.

a mixing matrix from $S_4$ family symmetry and generalized CP symmetry
$H_{CP}$. Supposing that $S_4\rtimes H_{CP}$ is broken down to
$Z^{ST^2SU}_2\times H^{\nu}_{CP}$ in the neutrino sector and
$Z^{TST^{2}U}_4\rtimes H^{l}_{CP}$ in the charged lepton sector, one column of
the PMNS matrix would be of the form $\left(1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, 1/2\right)^{T}$ up
to permutations, both Dirac CP phase and Majorana CP phases are trivial in
order to accommodate the observed lepton mixing angles. The phenomenological
implications of the remnant symmetry $K^{(TST^2, T^2U)}_4\rtimes H^{\nu}_{CP}$
in the neutrino sector and $Z^{SU}_{2}\times H^{l}_{CP}$ in the charged lepton
sector are studied. One row of PMNS matrix is determined to be $\left(1/2, 1/2,
-i/\sqrt{2}\right)$, and all the three leptonic CP phases can only be trivial
to fit the measured values of the mixing angles. Two models based on $S_4$
family symmetry and generalized CP are constructed to implement these model
independent predictions enforced by remnant symmetry. The correct mass
hierarchy among the charged leptons is achieved. The vacuum alignment and
higher order corrections are discussed.

oscillation modes (both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric) in accretion discs
around black holes using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The
turbulent viscosity is modeled by the $\alpha$-ansatz, with different equations
of state. We consider both discs with transonic radial inflows across the
innermost stable circular orbit, and stationary discs truncated by a reflecting
wall at their inner edge, representing a magnetosphere. In transonic discs,
viscosity can excite several types of global oscillation modes. These modes are
either axisymmetric with frequencies close to multiples of the maximum radial
epicyclic frequency $\kappa_\mathrm{max}$, non-axisymmetric with frequencies
close to multiples of of the innermost stable orbit frequency
$\Omega_\mathrm{ISCO}$, or hybrid modes whose frequencies are linear
combinations of these two frequencies. Small values of the viscosity parameter
$\alpha$ primarily produce non-axisymmetric modes, while axisymmetric modes
become dominant for large $\alpha$. The excitation of these modes may be
related to an instability of the sonic point, at which the radial infall speed
is equal to the sound speed of the gas. In discs with a reflective inner
boundary, we explore the effect of viscosity on trapped $p$-modes which are
intrinsically overstable due to the corotation resonance effect. The effect of
viscosity is either to reduce the growth rates of these modes, or to completely
suppress them and excite a new class of higher frequency modes. The latter
requires that the dynamic viscosity scales positively with the disc surface
density, indicating that it is a result of the classic viscous overstability
effect.

that if the lowest eigenvalue of this operator is less than the critical value
$-1/4$ ( called ""effective BF-bound""), then the black hole is linearly

insulator Sr2IrO4---and exciton dressed with magnons---that propagates with the
canonical characteristics of a QP: a finite QP residue and a lifetime longer
than the hopping time scale. The dynamics of this charge-neutral bosonic
excitation mirrors the fundamental process of the analogous one-hole
propagation in the background of ordered spins, for which a well-defined QP has
never been observed. The much narrower linewidth of the exciton reveals the
same intrinsic dynamics that is obscured for the hole and is intimately related
to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.

disjoint edges from $E$ that include all vertices in $V$. The perfect matching
problem is to decide if $G$ has such a matching. Recently Rothvo{\ss} proved
the striking result that the Edmonds' matching polytope has exponential
extension complexity. Here for each $n=|V|$ we describe a perfect matching
polytope that is different from Edmonds' polytope and define a weaker notion of
extended formulation. We show that the new polytope has a weak extended
formulation (WEF) $Q$ of polynomial size. For each graph $G$ with $n$ vertices
we can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting
linear program over $Q$ decides whether or not $G$ has a perfect matching. The
construction is uniform in the sense that, for each $n$, a single polytope is
defined for the class of all graphs with $n$ nodes. The method extends to solve
poly time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem. In this
case a logarithmic (in the weight of the optimum solution) number of
optimizations are made over the constructed WEF.
  The method described in the paper involves construction of a compiler that
converts an algorithm given in a prescribed pseudocode into a polytope. It can
therefore be used to construct a polytope for any decision problem in {\bf P}
which can be solved by a given algorithm. Compared with earlier results of
Dobkin-Lipton-Reiss and Valiant our method allows the construction of explicit
linear programs directly from algorithms written for a standard register model,
without intermediate transformations. We apply our results to obtain polynomial
upper bounds on the non-negative rank of certain slack matrices related to

(PA=7.4+/-11.3 degrees) appears in the final reduced L' image. At the distance
of the star (~145 pc), this angular separation corresponds to a physical
separation of 22.7+/-4.7 AU, locating the source within the recently resolved
inner cavity of the transition disk. The source has a brightness of
L'=12.2+/-0.5 mag, whereas it is not detected in the J band (J>13.8 mag). If
its L' brightness arose solely from the photosphere of a companion and given
the J-L' color constraints, it would correspond to a 28-32 MJupiter object at
the age of the star, according to the COND models. Ongoing accretion activity
of the star suggests, however, that gas is left in the inner disk cavity from
which the companion could also be accreting. In this case the object could be
lower in mass and its luminosity enhanced by the accretion process and by a
circumplanetary disk. A lower mass object is more consistent with the observed
cavity width. Finally, the observations enable us to place an upper limit on
the L'-band flux of a second companion candidate orbiting in the disk annular
gap at ~50 AU, as suggested by millimeter observations. If the second companion

z>1 shows a large spread in star formation efficiency (SFE), such that SFE
extend beyond the low values of local spirals and overlap the distribution of
z>1 sub-mm galaxies. We find that the spread in SFE (or equivalently in
molecular gas depletion timescale) is due to primarily the specific star
formation rate, but also stellar mass and redshift. Correlations of SFE with
the offset from the main-sequence and the compactness of the starburst are less
clear. The increase of the molecular gas depletion timescale with M* now
revealed by low M* SFGs at z>1 and observed at z=0 is in contrast to the
admitted constant molecular gas depletion timescale and the linear
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We confirm an increase of the molecular gas
fraction (fgas) from z~0.2 to z~1.2, followed by a very mild increase toward

dependence of fgas on M*, producing a gradient of increasing fgas with

been made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, and
to compare them to theoretical predictions. We use a probabilistic method to
compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the
power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the
granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations
between them. We establish that a depression in power at about \nu_{max}/2,
known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically
significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two
components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader
vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific
choice of the background model can affect the determination of \nu_{max},
introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random
uncertainties. We find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude to
tightly scale with \nu_{max} for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a mass
dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions, we
computed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them to
approximately scale as \tau_{eff} \propto g^{-0.85}\,T^{-0.4} and A_{gran}

the fundamental relations between the thermal conductivity and thermal
stability of polymer nanofibers and their molecular characteristics by studying
the temperature-induced phase transitions and thermal transport of a series of
polymer nanofibers. Ten different polymer nanofibers with systematically chosen
molecular structures are studied using large scale molecular dynamics
simulations. We found that high thermal conductivity and good thermal stability
can be achieved in polymers with rigid backbones, exemplified by
{\pi}-conjugated polymers, due to suppressed segmental rotations and large
phonon group velocities. The low probability of segmental rotation does not
only prevent temperature-induced phase transition but also enables long phonon
mean free paths due to reduced disorder scattering. Although stronger
inter-chain interactions can also improve the thermal stability, polymers with
such a feature usually have heavier atoms, weaker backbone bonds, and segments
vulnerable to random rotations, which lead to low thermal conductivities. This
work elucidates the underlying linkage between the molecular nature and
macroscopic thermal properties of polymer nanofibers, which is instrumental to
the design of thermally conductive polymer nanofibers with high temperature
stabilities.

distorts the input, which can degrade the overall system performance.
Signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) is a common metric to quantify the
performance degradation. One way to mitigate nonlinear distortions is by
maximizing the SNDR. In this paper, we analyze how to maximize the SNDR of the
nonlinearities in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. Specifically,
we answer the question of how to optimally predistort a double-sided
memory-less nonlinearity that has both a ""turn-on"" value and a maximum
""saturation"" value. We show that the SNDR-maximizing response given the
constraints is a double-sided limiter with a certain linear gain and a certain
bias value. Both the gain and the bias are functions of the probability density
function (PDF) of the input signal and the noise power. We also find a lower
bound of the nonlinear system capacity, which is given by the SDNR and an upper
bound determined by dynamic signal-to-noise ratio (DSNR). An application of the
results herein is to design predistortion linearization of nonlinear devices
like light emitting diodes (LEDs).

systems along quasar sight lines as natural coronagraphs to directly study the
far-UV (FUV) radiation from the host galaxies of luminous background quasars.
We have stacked the spectra of $\sim$2,000 DLA systems (N_HI>10^{20.6} cm^{-2})
with a median absorption redshift < z > = 2.6 selected from quasars observed in
the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We detect residual flux
in the dark troughs of the composite DLA spectra. The level of this residual
flux significantly exceeds systematic errors in the SDSS fiber sky subtraction;
furthermore, the residual flux is strongly correlated with the continuum
luminosity of the background quasar, while uncorrelated with DLA column density
or metallicity. We conclude that the flux could be associated with the average
FUV radiation from the background quasar host galaxies (with medium redshift <
z > = 3.1) that is not blocked by the intervening DLA. Assuming all of the
detected flux originates from quasar hosts, for the highest quasar luminosity

full-close coupling (CC) calculations when spin, hyperfine and external field

molecule-molecule scattering that includes the simplicity of MQDT while
treating the short-range interaction explicitly using CC calculations. This
hybrid approach, demonstrated for H$_2$-H$_2$ collisions in
full-dimensionality, is shown to adequately reproduce cross sections for
quasi-resonant rotational and vibrational transitions in the ultracold

further shown that an energy-independent short-range $K$-matrix evaluated in
the ultracold regime (1$\mu$K) can adequately characterize cross sections in
the mK-K regime when no shape resonances are present. The hybrid CC-MQDT
formalism provides an alternative approach to full CC calculations at
considerably less computational expense for cold and ultracold molecular

ordering temperatures in semiconducting Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.5}$S$_2$ and
K$_{0.81}$Fe$_{1.58}$Se$_2$, we argue that the in-plane antiferromagnetic order
arises from strong coupling between local moments. Superconductivity,
previously observed in the $A_{0.8}$Fe$_{y}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$ system, is absent
in Rb$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.5}$S$_2$, which has a semiconducting ground state. The
implied relationship between stripe/block antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity in these materials as well as a strategy for further
investigation is discussed in this paper.

and width of the initial pulses on the wave propagation and reflection. Our
model of the solar atmosphere is constructed by adopting the temperature
distribution based on the semi-empirical VAL-C model and specifying the curved

propagation and reflection of Alfv\'en waves in this arcade is described by
2.5D magnetohydrodynamic equations that are numerically solved by the FLASH

decreases as a result of a partial reflection of Alfv\'en waves in the solar
transition region, and that the waves which are not reflected leak through the
transition region and reach the solar corona. We also find the decrement of the
attenuation time of Alfv\'en waves for wider initial pulses. Moreover, our
results show that the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in the arcade is affected
by spatial dependence of the Alfv\'en speed, which leads to phase-mixing that
is stronger for more curved and larger magnetic arcades. We discuss processes
that affect the Alfv\'en wave propagation in an asymmetric solar arcade and
conclude that besides phase-mixing in the magnetic field configuration, plasma

also longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative
gravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides
possible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the
nucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.
To provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we
investigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by
terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy
and spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)
theory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following
parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the
incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of
symmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of
symmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or
the high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the
binding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more
constrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the
GR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is
significantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the
symmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the
EOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar
measurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the
compactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy.

d yz orbitals per iron atom are included, with no hybridization between the
two. After tuning the Hund coupling to a putative quantum critical point (QCP)
that separates a commensurate spin-density wave from a hidden-order
antiferromagnet at half filling, we find an s-wave hole-pair groundstate and a
d-wave hole-pair excited state. Near the QCP, both alternate in sign between
hole Fermi surface pockets at the Brillouin zone center and emergent electron
Fermi surface pockets at momenta that correspond to commensurate spin-density
waves (cSDW). The dependence of the energy splitting with increasing Hund
coupling yields evidence for a true QCP in the thermodynamic limit near the
putative one, at which the s-wave and d-wave Cooper pairs are degenerate. A
collective s-to-d-wave oscillation of the macroscopic superconductor that
couples to orthorhombic shear strain is also identified. Its resonant frequency
is predicted to collapse to zero at the QCP in the limit of low hole
concentration. This implies degeneracy of Cooper pairs with s, d and s+id
symmetry in the corresponding quantum critical state. We argue that the
critical state describes Cooper pairs in hole-doped iron superconductors at the
Lifshitz transition, where electron bands first rise above the Fermi level. We
thereby predict that the s-to-d-wave collective mode observed by Raman
spectroscopy in Ba1-xKxFe2As2 at optimal doping should also be observed at
higher doping near the Lifshitz transition.

work on the formulation of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics within the

thermodynamics as well as the relativistic Boltzmann equation to obtain the
dissipative evolution equations.
  We present a new derivation of the dissipative hydrodynamic equations using
the second law of thermodynamics wherein all the second-order transport
coefficients get determined uniquely within a single theoretical framework. An
alternate derivation of the dissipative equations which does not make use of
the two major approximations/assumptions namely, Grad's 14-moment approximation
and second moment of Boltzmann equation, inherent in the Israel-Stewart theory,
is also presented. Moreover, by solving the Boltzmann equation iteratively in a
Chapman-Enskog like expansion, we have derived the form of second-order viscous
corrections to the distribution function. Furthermore, a novel third-order
evolution equation for shear stress tensor is derived. Finally, we generalize
the collision term in the Boltzmann equation to include non-local effects. We
find that the second-order dissipative equations derived using this modified
Boltzmann equation contains all possible terms allowed by symmetry.
  In the case of one-dimensional scaling expansion, we demonstrate the
numerical significance of these formulations on the evolution of the hot and
dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We also study
the effect of these new formulations on particle (hadron and thermal dilepton)

attention. Unlike conventional electrons, Dirac electrons are described in the
form of two-component wave functions. In the surface state of topological
insulators, these two components are associated with the spin degrees of
freedom, hence governing the magnetic properties. Therefore, the observation of
the two-component wave function provides a useful clue for exploring the novel
spin phenomena. Here we show that the two-component nature is manifested in the
Landau levels (LLs) whose degeneracy is lifted by a Coulomb potential. Using
spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we visualize energy and
spatial structures of LLs in a topological insulator Bi2Se3. The observed
potential-induced LL splitting and internal structures of Landau orbits are
distinct from those in a conventional electron system and are well reproduced
by a two-component model Dirac Hamiltonian. Our model further predicts
non-trivial energy-dependent spin-magnetization textures in a potential
variation. This provides a way to manipulate spins in the topological surface
state.

covariates are shown to have Fisher information volumes which are bounded below
by $\pi^q$ and above by ${n \choose q} \pi^q$. This is proved with a novel
generalization of the classical theorems of Pythagoras and de Gua, which is of
independent interest. The finding that the volume is always finite is new, and
it implies that the volume can be directly interpreted as a measure of model
complexity. The volume is shown to be a continuous function of the design
matrix $X$ at generic $X$, but to be discontinuous in general. This means that
models with sparse design matrices can be significantly less complex than
nearby models, so the resulting model-selection criterion prefers sparse
models. This is analogous to the way that $\ell^1$-regularisation tends to
prefer sparse model fits, though in our case this behaviour arises
spontaneously from general principles. Lastly, an unusual topological duality
is shown to exist between the ideal boundaries of the natural and expectation

develop a nonparametric mapping from a high dimensional space to a continuous
one-dimensional numerical field. These numerical values, called contextual

similar high dimensional states. Further, as these numbers can be treated
similarly to usual continuous numbers, they can be replaced with their

probability is the class of L\'evy processes. Generally, such processes are not
simulatable especially for those with infinite activity. In practice, it is
common to approximate them by truncating the jumps at some cut-off size
$\varepsilon$ ($\varepsilon\searrow 0$). This procedure leads us to consider a
simulatable compound Poisson process. This paper first introduces, for this
setting, the statistical Romberg method to improve the complexity of the
classical Monte Carlo one. Roughly speaking, we use many sample paths with a
coarse cut-off $\varepsilon^{\beta},$ $\beta\in(0,1)$, and few additional
sample paths with a fine cut-off $\varepsilon$. Central limit theorems of
Lindeberg-Feller type for both Monte Carlo and statistical Romberg method for
the inferred errors depending on the parameter $\varepsilon$ are proved. This
leads to an accurate description of the optimal choice of parameters with
explicit limit variances. Afterwards, the authors propose a stochastic
approximation method of finding the optimal measure change by Esscher transform
for L\'evy processes with Monte Carlo and statistical Romberg importance
sampling variance reduction. Furthermore, we develop new adaptive Monte Carlo
and statistical Romberg algorithms and prove the associated central limit
theorems. Finally, numerical simulations are processed to illustrate the
efficiency of the adaptive statistical Romberg method that reduces at the same
time the variance and the computational effort associated to the effective
computation of option prices when the underlying asset process follows an

protein-protein interaction networks: Let $\mathcal G = (G_n)_{n=n_0,
n_0+1,...}$ be a sequence of random graphs, where $G_n = (V_n, E_n)$ is a graph
with $|V_n|=n$ vertices, $n=n_0,n_0+1,...$ In state $G_n = (V_n, E_n)$, a
vertex $v\in V_n$ is chosen from $V_n$ uniformly at random and is partially
duplicated. Upon such an event, a new vertex $v'\notin V_n$ is created and
every edge $\{v,w\} \in E_n$ is copied with probability~$p$, i.e.\ $E_{n+1}$
has an edge $\{v',w\}$ with probability~$p$, independently of all other edges.
Within this graph, we study several aspects for large~$n$. (i) The frequency of
isolated vertices converges to~1 if $p\leq p^* \approx 0.567143$, the unique
solution of $pe^p=1$. (ii) The number $C_k$ of $k$-cliques behaves like
$n^{kp^{k-1}}$ in the sense that $n^{-kp^{k-1}}C_k$ converges against a
non-trivial limit, if the starting graph has at least one $k$-clique. In
particular, the average degree of a vertex (which equals the number of edges --
or 2-cliques -- divided by the size of the graph) converges to $0$ iff $p<0.5$
and we obtain that the transitivity ratio of the random graph is of the order
$n^{-2p(1-p)}$. (iii) The evolution of the degrees of the vertices in the
initial graph can be described explicitly. Here, we obtain the full
distribution as well as convergence results.

superior conductivity and unusual optical properties, promises many novel
applications in electronics, photonics and optoelectronics. For applications in
electronics, patterning and modification of electrical properties is very
desirable since pristine graphene has no band gap. Here we demonstrate a simple
all-optical patterning method for graphene, based on laser induced two-photon
oxidation. By tuning the intensity of irradiation and the number of pulses the
level of oxidation can be controlled to high precision and, therefore, a band
gap can be introduced and electrical and optical properties can be continuously
tuned. Arbitrary complex patterning can be performed for air-suspended
monolayer graphene or for graphene on substrates. The method works at room
temperature in ambient air and no additional processing step is needed. The
presented concept allows development of all-graphene electronic and
optoelectronic devices and complex circuits with an all-optical method.

non-Abelian T-duality transformation on the Type IIA dual of ABJM. The analysis
of probe and particle-like branes suggests a dual CFT in which each of the
gauge groups is doubled. A common feature of non-Abelian T-duality is that in
the absence of any global information coming from String Theory it gives rise
to non-compact dual backgrounds, with coordinates living in the Lie algebra of
the Lie group involved in the dualization. In backgrounds with CFT duals this
poses obvious problems to the CFTs. In this paper we show that for the new
AdS_4 background the gauge groups of the associated dual CFT undergo a spectral
flow as the non-compact internal direction runs from 0 to infinity, which
resembles Seiberg duality in N=1. This phenomenon, very reminiscent of the
cascade, provides an interpretation in the CFT for the running of the
non-compact coordinate, and suggests that at the end of the flow the extra
charges disappear and the dual CFT is described by a 2-node quiver very similar
to ABJM, albeit with reduced supersymmetry.

models as reaction networks between distinct mechanochemical states with
energetically determined transition rates. For each network architecture, we
compare predictions for velocity and run length to a subset of experimentally

routine. Finally we determine which experimental trends are replicated by the

crucially depends on the analysis of multivariate time series. While a wide
range of tools and techniques for time series analysis already exist, the
increasing availability of massive data structures calls for new approaches for
multidimensional signal processing. We present here a non-parametric method to
analyse multivariate time series, based on the mapping of a multidimensional
time series into a multilayer network, which allows to extract information on a
high dimensional dynamical system through the analysis of the structure of the
associated multiplex network. The method is simple to implement, general,
scalable, does not require ad hoc phase space partitioning, and is thus
suitable for the analysis of large, heterogeneous and non-stationary time
series. We show that simple structural descriptors of the associated multiplex
networks allow to extract and quantify nontrivial properties of coupled chaotic
maps, including the transition between different dynamical phases and the onset
of various types of synchronization. As a concrete example we then study
financial time series, showing that a multiplex network analysis can
efficiently discriminate crises from periods of financial stability, where
standard methods based on time-series symbolization often fail.

a manner compatible with W3C PROV, and how the provenance information can be

Image Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to detect multi-TeV gamma-ray
sources. The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central
telescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)
cosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1
to 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA
CT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air
showers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).
PeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and
illustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.
  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new
time-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two
adjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps
mitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time
cleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered. These
levels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic
centre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning
cut improves results when a high level of night sky background is present. For
a Galactic centre level of night sky background there is a factor of 1.5
improvement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a
time cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut.

their circular shape in order to release the compression. By applying this
wrinkling criterion to the solutions of the axisymmetric models, we can
calculate the critical volume for the secondary buckling transition. Using the
Pogorelov approach, we also obtain an analytical expression for the critical
volume at the secondary buckling transition: The critical volume difference
scales linearly with the bending stiffness, whereas the critical volume
reduction at the classical axisymmetric buckling transition scales with the
square root of the bending stiffness. These results are confirmed by another
stability analysis in the framework of Donnel, Mushtari and Vlasov (DMV) shell
theory, and by numerical simulations available in the literature.

another massive and brighter component A. The mass ratio of the inner system
must be low since we were unable to find any traces of the secondary spectrum.
The mass ratio A/(Ba+Bb) is 0.89. The outer system has recently been resolved
using long-baseline interferometry on three occasions. The interferometry
confirms the spectroscopic results and specifies elements of the system. Our
orbital solutions, including the combined radial-velocity and interferometric

stellar masses of 20.4 and 22.8 solar masses. We also disentangled the spectra

satisfactory and we postpone a better determination of the system properties
for a future study, after obtaining observations during the periastron passage

quantization and local scattering centers in armchair graphene nanoribbons, as
seen in the conductance. The scattering property of a local scattering center
is dependent on if it is located on one sublattice (A-site impurity) or both
(impurity situated at neighboring carbon atoms, A-B-site impurity). The A-site
impurity scatters in a similar way as a localized impurity in a one-dimensional
channel made from a two-dimensional electron gas. On the other hand, the
A-B-site impurity introduces A- to B-sublattice scattering, which knows about
the chirality of Dirac electrons, and heavily influence the conductance. For
A-site impurities, interplay between evanescent waves at the impurity and the
propagating modes contributing to the conductance, leads to scattering
resonances that generate either dips in the conductance or render the impurity
completely transparent. The latter occurs at subband bottom energies where the
wave vector of the opening mode is zero. The conductance of defect free
graphene therefore remains at these energies. This is analagous to the case of
a scattering center in a quantum channel made from a two-dimensional electron
gas. The conductance dips occur at energies $\Delta E$ away from the
conductance steps and their location depend directly on the impurity strength.
In particular, for repulsive impurities the dips occur for hole-doping, while
for attractive impurities for electron doping. For an A-B-site impurity, the A-
to B-sublattice scattering interferes with the transmission resonance at the
energies of the subband bottoms and the impurity is never transparent and the
conductance steps of defect free graphene ribbons are always lost. We derive a
generalized Fisher-Lee formula for graphene leads that holds for arbitrary
scattering region and arbitrary number of leads.

environments, from typical competitive analysis to the one with resource
augmentation, from convex relaxations to non-convex relaxations.

photodetectors have relatively poor sensitivities at the nanometer scale. It is
generally believed that a large electrodes spacing in photodetectors is
required to absorb sufficient light to maintain high photoresponsivity and
reduce the dark current. However, this will limit the optoelectronic
integration density. Through spatially resolved photocurrent investigation, we
find that the photocurrent in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors
based on layered GaSe is mainly generated from the photoexcited carriers close
to the metal-GaSe interface and the photocurrent active region is always close
to the Schottky barrier with higher electrical potential. The photoresponsivity
monotonically increases with shrinking the spacing distance before the direct
tunneling happen, which was significantly enhanced up to 5,000 AW-1 for the
bottom contacted device at bias voltage 8 V and wavelength of 410 nm. It is
more than 1,700-fold improvement over the previously reported results. Besides
the systematically experimental investigation of the dependence of the
photoresponsivity on the spacing distance for both the bottom and top contacted
MSM photodetectors, a theoretical model has also been developed to well explain
the photoresponsivity for these two types of device configurations. Our
findings realize shrinking the spacing distance and improving the performance
of 2D semiconductor based MSM photodetectors simultaneously, which could pave
the way for future high density integration of 2D semiconductor optoelectronics
with high performances.

defined by a general function $K(\chi)$ of the kinetic terms. The fifth force
is screened by the nonlinear K-mouflage mechanism if $K'(\chi)$ grows
sufficiently fast for large negative $\chi$. In the general non-spherically
symmetric case, the fifth force is not aligned with the Newtonian force. For
spherically symmetric static matter density profiles, the results depend on the
potential function $W_{-}(y) = y K'(-y^2/2)$, which must be monotonically
increasing to $+\infty$ for $y \geq 0$ to guarantee the existence of a single
solution throughout space for any matter density profile. Small radial
perturbations around these static profiles propagate as traveling waves with a
velocity greater than the speed of light. Starting from vanishing initial
conditions for the scalar field and for a time-dependent matter density
corresponding to the formation of an overdensity, we numerically check that the
scalar field converges to the static solution. If $W_{-}$ is bounded, for
high-density objects there are no static solutions throughout space, but one
can still define a static solution restricted to large radii. Our dynamical
study shows that the scalar field relaxes to this static solution at large
radii, whereas spatial gradients keep growing with time at smaller radii. If
$W_{-}$ is not bounded but non-monotonic, there is an infinite number of
discontinuous static solutions but they are not physical and these models are
not theoretically sound. Such K-mouflage scenarios provide an example of
theories that can appear viable at the cosmological level, for the cosmological
background and perturbative analysis, while being meaningless at a nonlinear
level for small-scale configurations. This shows the importance of small-scale
nonlinear analysis of screening models.

$D^0{\bar D}^*{}^0$, $D^+D^{*-}$, $J/\psi\rho$, and $J/\psi\omega$ channels.
The energy-dependent decay widths of the $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons are
introduced. The $D$-${\bar D}^*$ interaction is taken to be consistent with a
lack of the $B{\bar B}^*$ bound state. The coupling between the $D{\bar D}^*$
and $J/\psi\rho$ or the $D{\bar D}^*$ and $J/\psi\omega$ channels is obtained
from a quark model. The $c{\bar c}$-$D{\bar D}^*$ coupling is taken as a
parameter to fit the $X$(3872) mass. The spectrum is calculated up to 4 GeV.
  It is found that very narrow $J/\psi\rho$ and $J/\psi\omega$ peaks appear
around the $D^0{\bar D}^*{}^0$ threshold. The size of the $J/\psi\pi^3$ peak we
calculated is 1.29-2.38 times as large as that of the $J/\psi\pi^2$. The
isospin symmetry breaking in the present model comes from the mass difference
of the charged and neutral $D$ and $D^*$ mesons, which gives a sufficiently
large isospin mixing to explain the experiments. It is also found that values
of the ratios of the transfer strengths can give the information on the
$X$(3872) mass or the size of the $c{\bar c}$-$D{\bar D}^*$ coupling.

collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0$\mbox{fb}^{-1}$

J/\psi K^{*0}$ and $B^+ \rightarrow J/\psi K^{+}$ are used to account for
detection and production asymmetries. The measurements are made in several
intervals of $\mu^+ \mu^-$ invariant mass squared, with the $\phi(1020)$ and
charmonium resonance regions excluded. Under the hypothesis of zero $C\!P$
asymmetry in the control modes, the average values of the asymmetries are
\begin{align}
  {\cal A}_{C\!P}(B^0 \rightarrow K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-) &= -0.035 \pm 0.024 \pm

the second are due to systematic effects. Both measurements are consistent with
the Standard Model prediction of small $C\!P$ asymmetry in these decays.

challenging. Exploiting the concurrency that is often present is one way to
address this problem. Here we study a restricted class of asynchronous
distributed probabilistic systems in which the synchronizations determine the
probability distribution for the next moves of the participating agents. The
key restriction we impose is that the synchronizations are deterministic, in
the sense that any two simultaneously enabled synchronizations must involve
disjoint sets of agents. As a result, this network of agents can be viewed as a
succinct and distributed presentation of a large global Markov chain. A rich
class of Markov chains can be represented this way.
  We define an interleaved semantics for our model in terms of the local
synchronization actions. The network structure induces an independence relation
on these actions, which, in turn, induces an equivalence relation over the
interleaved runs in the usual way. We construct a natural probability measure
over these equivalence classes of runs by exploiting Mazurkiewicz trace theory
and the probability measure space of the associated global Markov chain.
  It turns out that verification of our model, called DMCs (distributed Markov
chains), can often be efficiently carried out by exploiting the partial order
nature of the interleaved semantics. To demonstrate this, we develop a
statistical model checking (SMC) procedure and use it to verify two large
distributed probabilistic networks.

Gemini South (GMOS). Spatial profiles of oxygen abundance in the gaseous phase
along galaxy disks were obtained using calibrations based on strong
emission-lines (N2 and O3N2). We found oxygen gradients signifi- cantly flatter
for all the studied galaxies than those in typical isolated spiral galaxies.
Four objects in our sample, AM1219A, AM1256B, AM 2030A and AM2030B, show a
clear break in the oxygen abundance at galactocentric radius R/R25 between 0.2
and 0.5. For AM1219A and AM1256B we found negative slopes for the inner
gradients, and for AM2030B we found a positive one. In all these three cases
they show a flatter behaviour to the outskirts of the galaxies. For AM2030A, we
found a positive-slope outer gradient while the inner one is almost compatible
with a flat behaviour. A decrease of star forma- tion efficiency in the zone
that corresponds to the oxygen abundance gradient break for AM1219A and AM2030B
was found. For the former, a minimum in the estimated metallicities was found
very close to the break zone that could be associated with a corotation radius.
On the other hand, AM1256B and AM2030A, present a SFR maximum but not an
extreme oxygen abundance value. All the four interacting systems that show
oxygen gradient breakes the extreme SFR values are located very close to break
zones. Hii regions lo- cated in close pairs of galaxies follow the same
relation between the ionization parameter and the oxygen abundance as those
regions in isolated galaxies.

that the HMCA with the 2MNI is an efficient algorithm for parameter estimations

In order to
understand the physics underlying speech production, in this work we
empirically analyse the statistics of large human speech datasets ranging
several languages. We first show that during speech the energy is unevenly
released and power-law distributed, reporting a universal robust
Gutenberg-Richter-like law in speech. We further show that such earthquakes in
speech show temporal correlations, as the interevent statistics are again
power-law distributed. Since this feature takes place in the intra-phoneme
range, we conjecture that the responsible for this complex phenomenon is not
cognitive, but it resides on the physiological speech production mechanism.
Moreover, we show that these waiting time distributions are scale invariant
under a renormalisation group transformation, suggesting that the process of
speech generation is indeed operating close to a critical point. These results
are put in contrast with current paradigms in speech processing, which point
towards low dimensional deterministic chaos as the origin of nonlinear traits
in speech fluctuations. As these latter fluctuations are indeed the aspects
that humanize synthetic speech, these findings may have an impact in future
speech synthesis technologies. Results are robust and independent of the
communication language or the number of speakers, pointing towards an universal
pattern and yet another hint of complexity in human speech.

constrain stellar models using individual mode frequencies. However, current
stellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic
difference that must be corrected. We introduce and evaluate two
parametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough
(1990). The first we call a cubic term proportional to $\nu^3/\mathcal{I}$ and
the second has an additional inverse term proportional to
$\nu^{-1}/\mathcal{I}$, where $\nu$ and $\mathcal{I}$ are the frequency and
inertia of an oscillation mode. We first show that these formulae accurately
correct model frequencies of two different solar models ... We then incorporate
the parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the
surface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this
pipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar
observations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations
of the well-studied CoRoT target HD52265. For comparison, we also run the
pipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al.
(2008). The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is
unbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input
models and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for HD52265 are consistent
with previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is
similar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is
significantly worse but yields consistent parameters ... We find that the cubic
term alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to
implement in an existing pipeline. ... This parametrization is thus a useful
new way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode
frequencies can be exploited.

partition. The number of vertices in each level of the distance partition is
shown to be related to an established upper bound for the order of Abelian
Cayley graphs. Furthermore these graphs are all found to have odd girth which
is maximal for their diameter. Therefore the type of each vertex in a level may
be well-defined by the number of adjacent vertices in the preceding level. With
this definition the number of vertices of each type in each level is also shown
to be related to the same Abelian Cayley graph upper bound. Finally some

Klimontovich equation for the $N$ particle system, we evaluate, neglecting
correlations of density fluctuations, the scalings with $N$ of the terms
describing the corrections to the Vlasov equation for the coarse-grained one
particle phase space density. Considering a generic interaction with radial
pair force $F(r)$, with $F(r) \sim 1/r^\gamma$ at large scales, and regulated
to a bounded behaviour below a ""softening"" scale $\varepsilon$, we find that
there is an essential qualitative difference between the cases $\gamma < d$ and
$\gamma > d$, i.e., depending on the integrability at large distances of the

directly regulated by $\varepsilon$, and thus by the small scale properties of

the predictability of threshold exceedance events of certain observables. The
likelihood of such binary events -- the cornerstone also for the categoric (as
opposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedences -- is established
from long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The
prediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates
the hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest
that exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words:
rare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent
typical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning
time series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be
viewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual)
statement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive
stochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general
it may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a
sufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill
of a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences
approximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming
strictly no model errors. Furthermore, we show that a quantity commonly
regarded as a measure of predictability, the finite-time maximal Lyapunov
exponent, does not correspond directly to the ROC-based measure of prediction
skill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the
threshold level. This points to the fact that even if the Lyapunov exponent as
an intrinsic property of the system, measuring the instability of trajectories,
determines predictability, it does that in a nontrivial manner.

novel drug targets and treatments by means of systems biological methods, our
fundamental systems level understanding of why certain treatments succeed and
others fail is still lacking. We here advocate a novel methodological framework

cellular signalling entropy (or uncertainty), as a novel means of analysing and
interpreting omic data, and more fundamentally, as a means of elucidating
systems-level principles underlying basic biology and disease. We describe the
power of signalling entropy to discriminate cells according to differentiation
potential and cancer status. We further argue the case for an empirical
cellular entropy-robustness correlation theorem and demonstrate its existence
in cancer cell line drug sensitivity data. Specifically, we find that high
signalling entropy correlates with drug resistance and further describe how
entropy could be used to identify the achilles heels of cancer cells. In
summary, signalling entropy is a deep and powerful concept, based on rigorous
statistical mechanical principles, which, with improved data quality and

concentrations. The detailed analysis of these equations gives insight into the
single cell dynamics. On the other hand, the inclusion of diffusion and noisy
conditions allows simulating the formation of heterocysts patterns in
cyanobacteria strains. The time evolution of relevant component concentrations
are calculated allowing for a comparison with experiments. Finally, we discuss
the validity and the possible improvements of the model.

under strongly confined and degenerate conditions. For a rectangular
confinement domain, thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas are
expressed in their exact summation forms. For 1D, 2D and 3D nano domains,
variations of both number of particles and internal energy per particle with
chemical potential are examined. It is shown that their relation with chemical
potential exhibits a discrete nature which allows them to take only some
definite values. Furthermore, quasi-irregular oscillatory-like sharp peaks are
observed in heat capacity. New nano devices can be developed based on these
behaviors.

electromagnetism in an early phase of a Machian universe with a very small and
uniform electrical charge density $\rho_q$ are explored. A form of the Strong
Equivalence Principle for unified electrogravity is first formulated, and it
immediately leads to (i) the empirical Schuster-Blackett law relating the
magnetic moments and angular momenta of neutral astronomical bodies, (ii) an
analogous relation between the linear acceleration of neutral massive bodies
and associated electric fields, (iii) gravitational lensing in excess of
Einstein gravity, and, with the additional assumption of scaling, to (iv) the
Wesson relation between the angular momentum and the square of the mass of
astronomical bodies. Incorporation of Sciama's version of Mach's principle
leads to a new post-Newtonian dynamics (in the weak field limit of gravity
alone without electromagnetism) that predicts flat rotation curves of galaxies
without the need of dark matter haloes. Finally, it is shown that the unified
theory with a broken symmetry predicts a flat expanding universe with a
cosmological term intimately related to electrogravity unification, and can
explain WMAP data with a single free parameter. WMAP data require $\rho_q
=6.1\times 10^{-43}$ C/cc which is too small to be detected at

effective for the case of curves belonging to the Koch family. The present
paper extends the investigation to more complex curves, namely randomly
generated curves and the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot curve. The analysis is focused
on numerical experiments. The results obtained with the numerical analysis
allow advancing some interesting proposition concerning the fine fractal
structure of plane curves. The method uses the dynamical response of
appropriate harmonic oscillators built up according to the geometry of the
fractal set. For the plane motion three fundamental periods are determined.
Each period plotted against the characteristic length of the corresponding
curve in a log-log scale estimates the fractal dimension. It is shown that each
degree of freedom corresponds to a distinct energy covering associate to a
certain topological property. Using this technique it is possible to
distinguish the fine fractal structure of plane curves. The dynamic technique
is proved to work also for the identification problem, that is, to determine
the fractal characteristics embedded in some sample of a given fractal set. It
is proposed the classification of fractal structures into at least two
categories, perfectly fractal and partially fractal. The affine similarity can
be precisely detected using this method.

transported vector in a Weyl space to the original one is the product of a
multiplicative gauge transformation and a proper orthochronous Lorentz
transformation. Such a Lorentz transformation admits a spinor representation,
which is obtained and used to deduce the transportation properties of a Weyl
spinor, which are then expressed in terms of a composite gauge group defined as
the product of a multiplicative gauge group and the spinor group. These
properties render a spinor amenable to its treatment as a particle coupled to a
multidimensional gauge field in the framework of the Kaluza-Klein formulation
extended to multidimensional gauge fields. In this framework, a fiber bundle is
constructed with a horizontal, base space and a vertical, gauge space, which is
a Lie group manifold, termed its structure group. For the present, the base is
the Minkowski spacetime and the vertical space is the composite gauge group
mentioned above. The fiber bundle is equipped with a Riemannian structure,
which is used to obtain the classical description of motion of a spinor. In its
classical picture, a Weyl spinor is found to behave as a spinning charged
particle in translational motion. The corresponding quantum description is
deduced from the Klein-Gordon equation in the Riemann spaces obtained by the
methods of path-integration. This equation in the present fiber bundle reduces
to the equation for a spinor in the Weyl geometry, which is close to but
differs somewhat from the squared Dirac equation.
