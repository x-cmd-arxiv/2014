long-range coupled harmonic oscillators that have well-defined continuum limit
field theories. We first introduce a method to calculate the entanglement
evolution in generic coupled harmonic oscillators after quantum quench. Then we
study the entanglement evolution after quantum quench in harmonic systems that
the couplings decay effectively as $1/r^{d+\alpha}$ with the distance $r$.
After quenching the mass from non-zero value to zero we calculate numerically
the time evolution of von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies. We show that for
$1<\alpha<2$ we have a linear growth of entanglement and then saturation
independent of the initial state. For $0<\alpha<1$ depending on the initial
state we can have logarithmic growth or just fluctuation of entanglement. We
also calculate the mutual information dynamics of two separated individual
harmonic oscillators. Our findings suggest that in our system there is no
particular connection between having a linear growth of entanglement after
quantum quench and having a maximum group velocity or generalized Lieb-Robinson
bound.

  error in Eq. (75)",,,,"physics.class-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new classical electromagnetic analysis is presented suggesting that the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is overwhelmingly likely to arise from a classical
lag effect based upon classical electromagnetic forces. The analysis makes use
of several aspects of classical electromagnetic theory which are unfamiliar to
most physicists, including the Darwin Lagrangian, acceleration-based electric
fields, internal electromagnetic momentum in a magnet, and a magnet model
involving at least three mutually-interacting particles. Only when the
acceleration-based electric forces acting on the passing charge are included do
we find consistency with all the relativistic conservation laws: energy, linear
momentum, angular momentum, and constant center-of-mass velocity. The electric
forces on the passing charge lead to a lag effect which accounts quantitatively
for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. Thus the classical analysis strongly
suggests that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift (observed when electrons pass a
long solenoid which corresponds to a line of magnetic dipoles) is the analogue
of the Matteucci-Pozzi phase shift (observed when electrons pass a line of
electric dipoles). The classical electromagnetic analysis suggests experiments
to distinguish the proposed classical-based lag effect from the presently
accepted view that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is a quantum topological
effect arising from magnetic fluxes in the absence of classical electromagnetic
forces.

deterministic characterization in time independent media, aside from a small

faded and smeared as described mathematically by a convolution kernel
determined by the autocorrelation of the random fluctuations of the wave speed.
The main result of this paper is the extension of the pulse stabilization
results to time dependent randomly layered media. When the media change slowly,
on time scales that are longer than the pulse width and the time it takes the
waves to traverse a correlation length, the pulse is not affected by the time
fluctuations. In rapidly changing media, where these time scales are similar,
both the pulse shape and the random component of the arrival time are affected
by the statistics of the time fluctuations of the wave speed. We obtain an
integral equation for the wave front, that is more complicated than in time
independent media, and cannot be solved analytically, in general. We also give
examples of media where the equation simplifies, and the wave front can be
analyzed explicitly. We illustrate with these examples how the time
fluctuations feed energy into the pulse.

The nature of non-stationary demands disables the optimality of static (s,S)

which coincides the traditional optimality sense under certain conditions and

complexity of general SO methods by orders of magnitude in solving a class of

Much has been said about quantum corrections to general relativity, but much
less in the opposite direction. It is therefore crucial to examine possible
corrections to quantum mechanics due to gravity. Indeed, the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle is one profound feature of quantum mechanics, which
nevertheless may receive correction when gravitational effects become
important. Such generalized uncertainty principle [GUP] has been motivated from
not only quite general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity, but
also string theoretic arguments. We examine the role of GUP in the context of
black hole complementarity. We find that while complementarity can be violated
by large N rescaling if one assumes only the Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle, the application of GUP may save complementarity, but only if certain
N-dependence is also assumed. This raises two important questions beyond the
scope of this work, i.e., whether GUP really has the proposed form of
N-dependence, and whether black hole complementarity is indeed correct.

couplings, the network can be made a metric space by defining a distance
(satisfying the triangle inequality) that quantifies the lack of transmission
fidelity between two nodes. It is shown that transfer fidelities and transfer
times can be improved significantly by means of simple controls taking the form
of non-dynamic, spatially localized bias fields, opening up the possibility for
intelligent design of spin networks and dynamic routing of information encoded
in them, while being more flexible than engineering fixed couplings to favor
some transfers, and less demanding than control schemes requiring fast dynamic
controls.

coherence are associated with a tendency toward charge ordering, a phenomenon
found recently in hole-doped cuprates. We simulate the appearance of these
regions by a conserved order parameter dynamics, and perform self-consistent
superconducting calculations using the Bogoliubov-deGennes method. Within this
context we explore two possible scenarios: (i) The magnetic field is
diamagnetically screened by the sum of varying shielding currents of isolated
small-sized superconducting domains. (ii) These domains become increasingly
correlated by Josephson coupling as the temperature is lowered and the main
response to the applied magnetic field is from the sum of all varying tunneling
currents. The results indicate that these two approaches may be used to
simulate the TF-$\mu$SR data but case (ii) yields better agreement.

tensile strength of doubly convex tablets under diametrical compression. This
approach is based on the observation that tensile strength is directly
proportional to the breaking force and inversely proportional to a non-linear
function of geometric parameters and materials properties. This generalization
reduces to the analytical expression commonly used for flat faced tablets,
i.e., Hertz solution, and to the empirical relationship currently used in the
pharmaceutical industry for convex-faced tablets, i.e., Pitt's equation. Under
proper parametrization, optimal tensile strength relationship can be determined
from experimental results by minimizing a figure of merit of choice. This
optimization is performed under the first-order approximation that a flat faced
tablet and a doubly curved tablet have the same tensile strength if they have
the same relative density and are made of the same powder, under equivalent
manufacturing conditions. Furthermore, we provide a set of recommendations and
best practices for assessing the performance of optimal tensile strength
relationships in general. Based on these guidelines, we identify two new
models, namely the general and mechanistic models, which are effective and
predictive alternatives to the tensile strength relationship currently used in
the pharmaceutical industry.

major advantages of our work are: 1) as opposed to a fixed resource allocation,
we consider load demand at each access point (AP) when allocating spectrum; 2)
to prevent overloaded APs, our scheme is dynamic in the sense that as the users
move from one AP to the other, so do the allocated resources, if necessary, and
such considerations generally result in huge computational complexity, which
brings us to the third advantage: 3) we tackle complexity by introducing a
hierarchical scheme comprising four phases: user association, load estimation,
interference management via graph coloring, and scheduling. We provide
mathematical analysis for the first three steps modeling the user and AP

agents based on their self-reported types. One objective in mechanism design is
to design a strategyproof process so that no agent will have an incentive to
misreport its type. However, typical analyses of the incentives properties of
mechanisms operate under strong, usually untestable assumptions. Empirical,
data-oriented approaches are, at best, under-developed. Furthermore,
mechanism/policy evaluation methods usually ignore the dynamic nature of a
multi-agent system and are thus inappropriate for estimating long-term effects.
We introduce the problem of estimating the causal effects of mechanisms on
incentives and frame it under the Rubin causal framework \citep{rubin74,
rubin78}. This raises unique technical challenges since the outcome of interest
(agent truthfulness) is confounded with strategic interactions and,
interestingly, is typically never observed under any mechanism. We develop a
methodology to estimate such causal effects that using a prior that is based on
a strategic equilibrium model. Working on the domain of kidney exchanges, we
show how to apply our methodology to estimate causal effects of kidney
allocation mechanisms on hospitals' incentives. Our results demonstrate that
the use of game-theoretic prior captures the dynamic nature of the kidney
exchange multiagent system and shrinks the estimates towards long-term effects,
thus improving upon typical methods that completely ignore agents' strategic
behavior.

cellular processes, including metabolism, signaling, and regulation of gene
expression. These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's
chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or
when genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the
importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we
investigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the
fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise
to evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding
strength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these
protein traits can emerge as evolutionary ""spandrels"" even if they do not
confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve
strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to
stabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins
may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending
on random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of
apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in
high-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding
and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of
biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra
folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is
developed. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of
fundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.

obvious dependence on the equation of state (EOS), EOS-insensitive universal
formulas relating these parameters remarkably exist. In the present paper, we
explore the interrelationship between two such formulas, namely the $f$-$I$
relation connecting the $f$-mode quadrupole oscillation frequency $\omega_2$
and the moment of inertia $I$, and the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations relating $I$, the
quadrupole tidal deformability $\lambda_2$, and the quadrupole moment $Q$,
which have been proposed by Lau, Leung, and Lin [Astrophys. J. {\bf 714}, 1234
(2010)] and Yagi and Yunes [Science {\bf 341}, 365 (2013)], respectively. A
relativistic universal relation between $\omega_l$ and $\lambda_l$ with the
same angular momentum $l=2,3,\ldots$, the so-called ""diagonal $f$-Love
relation"" that holds for realistic compact stars and stiff polytropic stars, is
unveiled here. An in-depth investigation in the Newtonian limit is further
carried out to pinpoint its underlying physical mechanism and hence leads to a
unified $f$-$I$-Love relation. We reach the conclusion that these
EOS-insensitive formulas stem from a common physical origin --- compact stars
can be considered as quasiincompressible when they react to slow time
variations introduced by $f$-mode oscillations, tidal forces and rotations.

quantify the fluctuations in a gene product, we undertake an analytical scheme
for studying few naturally abundant linear as well as branched chain network
motifs. We solve the Langevin equations associated with each motif under the
purview of linear noise approximation and quantify Fano factor and mutual
information. Both quantifiable expressions exclusively depend on the relaxation
time (decay rate constant) and steady state population of the network
components. We investigate the effect of relaxation time constraints on Fano
factor and mutual information to indentify a time scale domain where a network
can recognize the fluctuations associated with the input signal more reliably.
We also show how input population affects both quantities. We extend our
calculation to long chain linear motif and show that with increasing chain
length, the Fano factor value increases but the mutual information processing
capability decreases. In this type of motif, the intermediate components are
shown to act as a noise filter that tune up input fluctuations and maintain
optimum fluctuations in the output. For branched chain motifs, both quantities
vary within a large scale due to their network architecture and facilitate
survival of living system in diverse environmental conditions.

there is a need for a robust method for human pose estimation. This paper

the polylogarithm. As a central result we construct the logarithm sheaves of
rational abelian schemes in terms of the birigidified Poincar\'e bundle with
universal integrable connection on the product of the abelian scheme and the
universal vectorial extension of its dual. This is achieved essentially by
restricting the mentioned data of the Poincar\'e bundle along the infinitesimal
neighborhoods of the zero section of the universal extension. We also clarify
how these constructions naturally express within the language of the
Fourier-Mukai transformation for $\mathcal D$-modules on abelian schemes. Our
geometric perspective moreover permits an interpretation of fundamental formal
properties of the logarithm sheaves within the standard theory of the
Poincar\'e bundle. For a relative elliptic curve we additionally present a
related viewpoint on the first logarithm extension via $1$-motives. Having
developed in detail the outlined geometric understanding of the logarithm
sheaves, we then exploit it systematically for an investigation of the
polylogarithm for the universal family of elliptic curves with level $N$
structure. A main theorem of the work gives an explicit analytic description
for a variant of the small elliptic polylogarithm via the coefficient functions
appearing in the Laurent expansion of a meromorphic Jacobi form defined by
Kronecker in the 19th century. Furthermore, using the previous result, we
determine the specialization of the modified polylogarithm along torsion
sections concretely in terms of certain algebraic Eisenstein series. From this
we regain in particular the known expressions of the de Rham Eisenstein classes
by algebraic modular forms.

that, the result of jet clustering is process-independent and hence logically
consistent, for softer subjets the inclusion cone is larger to conform with the

larger opening angle, and that the cone size cannot be too large in order to
avoid mixing up neighboring jets, we derive constraints on the jet function

the filling time essentially reduces to that of a single layer, and the
interaction matrix has a Toeplitz structure. Numerical results are provided for

surveys. Recently, Shi & Komatsu developed an analytical model for predicting
the radius, mass, and redshift dependence of the non-thermal pressure
contributed by the kinetic random motions of intracluster gas sourced by the
cluster mass growth. In this paper, we compare the predictions of this
analytical model to a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation.
As different mass growth histories result in different non-thermal pressure, we
perform the comparison on 65 simulated galaxy clusters on a cluster-by-cluster
basis. We find an excellent agreement between the modelled and simulated
non-thermal pressure profiles. Our results open up the possibility of using the
analytical model to correct the systematic bias in the mass estimation of
galaxy clusters. We also discuss tests of the physical picture underlying the
evolution of intracluster non-thermal gas motions, as well as a way to further
improve the analytical modeling, which may help achieve a unified understanding
of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters.

electron-positron pair creation, a general precondition of radio-pulsar
activity, relies on the existence of magnetic spots, i.e., local concentrations
of strong and small scale magnetic field structures at the surface of neutron
stars. They have a strong impact on the surface temperature, which is
potentially observable. Here we reinforce the idea that such magnetic spots can
be formed by extracting magnetic energy from the toroidal field that resides in
deep crustal layers, via Hall drift. We study and discuss the magneto-thermal
evolution of qualitatively different neutron star models and initial magnetic
field configurations that lead to the creation of magnetic spots. We find that
magnetic spots can be created on a timescale of $10^4$ years with magnetic
field strengths $\gtrsim 5\times 10^{13}$ G, provided almost the whole magnetic
energy is stored in its toroidal component, and that the conductivity in the
inner crust is not too large. The lifetime of the magnetic spots is at least
$\sim$one million of years, being longer if the initial field permeates both
core and crust.

important task because the sensor nodes are limited in the resource energy. The
best way to improve a WSN lifetime is the clustering based algorithms in which
each cluster is managed by a leader called Cluster Head. Each other node must
communicate with this CH to send the data sensing. The nearest base station
nodes must also send their data to their leaders, this causes a loss of energy.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to ameliorate a threshold distributed
energy efficient clustering protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks
by excluding closest nodes to the base station in the clustering process. We
show by simulation in MATLAB that the proposed approach increases obviously the
number of the received packet messages and prolongs the lifetime of the network
compared to TDEEC protocol.

convexity. Our method uses a judicious application of Steigmann's polyconvexity
criteria based on the representation of the energy in terms of the principal
invariants of the stretch tensor $U$. These energies also satisfy suitable
growth and coercivity conditions. We formulate the equilibrium equations and we
prove the existence of minimizers by the direct methods of the calculus of
variations.

literature based on sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA). To efficiently
use them, sparsity of linear classifiers is a prerequisite. However, this might
not be readily available in many applications, and rotations of data are
required to create the needed sparsity. In this paper, we propose a family of
rotations to create the required sparsity. The basic idea is to use the
principal components of the sample covariance matrix of the pooled samples and
its variants to rotate the data first and to then apply an existing high
dimensional classifier. This rotate-and-solve procedure can be combined with
any existing classifiers, and is robust against the sparsity level of the true
model. We show that these rotations do create the sparsity needed for high
dimensional classifications and provide theoretical understanding why such a
rotation works empirically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated by a number of simulated and real data examples, and the
improvements of our method over some popular high dimensional classification
rules are clearly shown.

cleaves bases (mononucleotides) from a strand of DNA for identification inside
a nanopore. It has two nanopores and three compartments with the structure
[cis1, upstream nanopore (UNP), trans1=cis2, downstream nanopore (DNP),
trans2]. The exonuclease is attached to the exit side of UNP in trans1/cis2. A
cleaved base cannot regress into cis1 because of the remaining DNA strand in
UNP. A profiled electric field over DNP with positive and negative components
slows down base translocation through DNP. The proposed structure is modeled
with a Fokker-Planck equation and a piecewise solution presented. Results from
the model indicate that with probability approaching 1 bases enter DNP in their
natural order, are detected without any loss, and do not regress into DNP after
progressing into trans2. Sequencing efficiency with a tandem cell would then be
determined solely by the level of discrimination among the base types inside
DNP.
