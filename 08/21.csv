progression. Given a 3-free set $A$ of integers $0=a_0<a_1<\cdots<a_t$, the
\emph{Stanley sequence} $S(A)=\{a_n\}$ is defined using the greedy algorithm:
For each successive $n>t$, we pick the smallest possible $a_n$ so that
$\{a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is 3-free and increasing. Work by Odlyzko and Stanley
indicates that Stanley sequences may be divided into two classes. Sequences of
Type 1 are highly structured and satisfy $\alpha n^{\log_2 3}/2\le a_n\le
\alpha n^{\log_2 3}$, for some constant $\alpha$, while those of Type 2 are
chaotic and satisfy $\Theta(n^2/\log n)$. In this paper, we consider the
possible values for $\alpha$ in the growth of Type 1 Stanley sequences. Whereas
Odlyzko and Stanley assumed $\alpha=1$, we show that $\alpha$ can be any
rational number which is at least 1 and for which the denominator, in lowest
terms, is a power of 3.

  Furthermore, we show that the problem of minimizing a homogeneous polynomial

polynomials that can be translated into homogeneous polynomials, even when the

will be referring to as Average MTL. However, a more general framework,
referred to as Conic MTL, can be formulated by considering conic combinations
of the objective functions instead; in this framework, Average MTL arises as a
special case, when all combination coefficients equal 1. Although the advantage
of Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works,
no theoretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we
derive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that
the tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination
coefficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice,
and it is important to consider Conic MTL. As a byproduct of the generalization
bound, it also theoretically explains the good experimental results of previous
relevant works. Finally, we propose a new Conic MTL model, whose conic
combination coefficients minimize the generalization bound, instead of choosing
them heuristically as has been done in previous methods. The rationale and
advantage of our model is demonstrated and verified via a series of experiments
by comparing with several other methods.

the nature of the spiral state is still not clear. The spiral cannot be
explained via relativistic effects due to the short pitch of the spiral and the
weakness of the spin-orbit interaction in Mn, and another common mechanism,
nesting, is ruled out as direct calculations show no features at the relevant
wave vector. We propose that the spiral state is induced by a competition
between the short-range antiferromagnetic exchange and a long-range interaction
induced by the polarization of Au bands, similar to double exchange. We find
that, contrary to earlier reports, the ground state in standard density
functional theory is ferromagnetic, \emph{i.e.}, the latter interaction
dominates. However, an accounting for Coulomb correlations via a Hubbard $U$
suppresses the Schrieffer-Wolff type $s-d$ magnetic interaction between Mn and
Au faster than the superexchange interaction, favoring a spin-spiral state. For
realistic values of $U$ the resulting spiral wave vector is in close agreement
with experiment.

contrast of $\sim-0.1$ aligned with the Cold Spot direction has been recently
reported. It has been argued that, although the first-order integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect of such a void on the CMB is small, the second-order
Rees-Sciama (RS) contribution exceeds this by an order of magnitude and can
entirely explain the observed Cold Spot temperature profile. In this paper we
examine this surprising claim using both an exact calculation with the
spherically symmetric Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi metric, and perturbation theory
about a background Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. We show that both
approaches agree well with each other, and both show that the dominant
temperature contribution of the postulated void is an unobservable dipole
anisotropy. If this dipole is subtracted, we find that the remaining
temperature anisotropy is dominated by the linear ISW signal, which is orders
of magnitude larger than the second-order RS effect, and that the total
magnitude is too small to explain the observed Cold Spot profile. We calculate
the density and size of a void that would be required to explain the Cold Spot,
and show that the probability of existence of such a void is essentially zero
in $\Lambda$CDM. We identify the importance of \emph{a posteriori} selection
effects in the identification of the Cold Spot, but argue that even after
accounting for them, a supervoid explanation of the Cold Spot is always
disfavoured relative to a random statistical fluctuation on the last scattering

imaging where processing at multiple scales, based on the concept of Gaussian
and Laplacian image pyramids, is a well-known technique. It is often applied to
reduce noise while preserving image detail on different levels of granularity
without modifying the filter kernel. In scientific computing, multigrid methods
are a popular choice, as they are asymptotically optimal solvers for elliptic
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). As such algorithms have a very high
computational complexity that would overwhelm CPUs in the presence of real-time
constraints, application-specific processors come into consideration for
implementation. Despite of huge advancements in leveraging productivity in the
respective fields, designers are still required to have detailed knowledge
about coding techniques and the targeted architecture to achieve efficient
solutions. Recently, the HIPAcc framework was proposed as a means for automatic
code generation of image processing algorithms, based on a Domain-Specific
Language (DSL). From the same code base, it is possible to generate code for
efficient implementations on several accelerator technologies including
different types of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as well as reconfigurable
logic (FPGAs). In this work, we demonstrate the ability of HIPAcc to generate

low dimensional physics. Taking the example of SrRuO$_3$ which is ferromagnetic
and metallic at the bulk limit, one finds that it becomes antiferromagnetic and
insulating at the three monolayers limit when grown on SrTiO$_3$. The origin of
the insulating state is traced to strongly orbital dependent exchange
splittings. A modest compressive strain of 1% of the SrTiO$_3$ substrate is
then found to drive the system into a highly confined two-dimensional 100% spin

double quantum dots via capacitive interactions. In contrast to prior work,
here we focus on a regime with strong interactions between the qubits. The
interplay of the interaction energy and simultaneous large detunings for both
double dots gives rise to the double charge resonant regime, in which the
unpolarized (1111) and fully polarized (0202) four-electron states in the
absence of interqubit tunneling are near degeneracy, while being energetically
well-separated from the partially polarized (0211 and 1102) states. A rapid
controlled-phase gate may be realized by combining time evolution in this
regime in the presence of intraqubit tunneling and the interqubit Coulomb
interaction with refocusing ${\pi}$ pulses that swap the singly occupied
singlet and triplet states of the two qubits via, e.g., magnetic gradients. We
calculate the fidelity of this entangling gate, incorporating models for two
types of noise -- charge fluctuations in the single-qubit detunings and charge
relaxation within the low-energy subspace via electron-phonon interaction --
and identify parameter regimes that optimize the fidelity. The rates of
phonon-induced decay for pairs of GaAs or Si double quantum dots vary with the
sizes of the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions and are several orders of
magnitude smaller for Si, leading to high theoretical gate fidelities for
coupled singlet-triplet qubits in Si dots. We also consider the dependence of
the capacitive coupling on the relative orientation of the double dots and find
that a linear geometry provides the fastest potential gate.

We find that the 90% confidence contours of CFHTLenS and Planck+WP do not

the full tomographic information in the weak lensing data and marginalize over

the 8-dimensional 64% contours to overlap, mainly due to the extra effective
number of neutrino species, which we find to be 0.84 $\pm$ 0.35 (68%) greater

supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the underluminous cores of galaxies. Such
black holes are typically accompanied by flat-spectrum radio cores indicating
the presence of moderately relativistic jets. One of the best constrained RIAFs
is associated with the SMBH in the Galactic center, Sgr A*. Since the plasma in
RIAFs is only weakly collisional, the dynamics and the radiative properties of
these systems are very uncertain. Here we want to study the impact of varying
electron temperature on the appearance of accretion flows and jets. Using 3-D
GRMHD accretion flow simulations, we use ray tracing methods to predict spectra
and radio images of RIAFs allowing for different electron heating mechanisms in
the in- and outflowing parts of the simulations. We find that small changes in
the electron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relative
dominance of jets and accretion flows. Application to Sgr A* shows that radio
spectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a model where
electrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. The X-ray emission is
sensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and disk and therefore
X-ray observations put strong constraints on electron temperatures and geometry
of the accretion flow and jet. For Sgr A*, the jet model also predicts a
significant frequency-dependent core shift which could place independent
constraints on the model once measured accurately. We conclude that more
sophisticated models for electron distribution functions are crucial for
constraining GRMHD simulations with actual observations. For Sgr A*, the radio
appearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. Nonetheless, at the
highest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should still be
detectable with future Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations.

much attention in the last fifteen years. About their relative strength with
respect to ""bounded width in one measure implies bounded width in the other""
many problems remain unsolved. Only some results separating directed width
measures are known. We give an almost complete picture of this relation. For
this, we consider the cops and robber games characterising DAG-width and
directed tree width (up to a constant factor). For DAG-width games, it is an
open question whether the robber-monotonicity cost (the difference between the
minimal numbers of cops capturing the robber in the general and in the monotone
case) can be bounded by any function. Examples show that this function (if it
exists) is at least $f(k) > 4k/3$ (Kreutzer, Ordyniak 2008). We approach a
solution by defining weak monotonicity and showing that if $k$ cops win weakly
monotonically, then $O(k^2)$ cops win monotonically. It follows that bounded
Kelly-width implies bounded DAG-width, which has been open since the definition
of Kelly-width by Hunter and Kreutzer in 2008. For directed tree width games we
show that, unexpectedly, the cop-monotonicity cost (no cop revisits any vertex)
is not bounded by any function. This separates directed tree width from D-width
defined by Safari in 2005, refuting his conjecture.

qualitatively like 2D Euler for times t \lesssim Re^(1/3), and in particular
exhibits inviscid damping (e.g. the vorticity weakly approaches a shear flow).
For times t \gtrsim Re^(1/3), which is sooner than the natural dissipative time
scale O(Re), the viscosity becomes dominant and the streamwise dependence of
the vorticity is rapidly eliminated by an enhanced dissipation effect.
Afterward, the remaining shear flow decays on very long time scales t \gtrsim
Re back to the Couette flow. When properly defined, the dissipative
length-scale in this setting is L_D \sim Re^(-1/3), larger than the scale L_D

X-ray emitting gas, $T_{\mathrm{X}}$. Their masses may be underestimated if it
is assumed that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium, by an amount
$b^{\mathrm{hyd}}\sim(20\pm10)$ % suggested by simulations. We have previously
found consistency between a sample of observed \textit{Chandra} X-ray masses
and independent weak lensing measurements. Unfortunately, uncertainties in the
instrumental calibration of {\em Chandra} and {\em XMM-Newton} observatories
mean that they measure different temperatures for the same gas. In this paper,
we translate that relative instrumental bias into mass bias, and infer that
\textit{XMM-Newton} masses of $\sim 10^{14}\,\mbox{M}_{\odot}$ ($> 5\cdot
10^{14} \mbox{M}_{\odot}$) clusters are unbiased ($\sim 35$ % lower) compared
to WL masses. For massive clusters, \textit{Chandra}'s calibration may thus be
more accurate. The opposite appears to be true at the low mass end. We observe
the mass bias to increase with cluster mass, but presence of Eddington bias
precludes firm conclusions at this stage. Nevertheless, the systematic
\textit{Chandra} -- \textit{XMM-Newton} difference is important because {\em
Planck}'s detections of massive clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect
are calibrated via {\em XMM-Newton} observations. The number of detected SZ
clusters are inconsistent with {\em Planck}'s cosmological measurements of the
primary Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Given the \textit{Planck} cluster
masses, if an (unlikely) uncorrected $\sim 20$ % calibration bias existed, this
tension would be eased, but not resolved.

effects on the free energy functions of varying the channel diameter D and
length L, as well as the polymer length N and bending rigidity, kappa. For
infinitely long cylinders, F is a maximum at lambda=0, and decreases with
lambda until the polymers are no longer in contact. For flexible chains, the
polymers overlap along the cylinder for low lambda, while above some critical
value of lambda they are longitudinally compressed and non-overlapping while
still in contact. We find that the free energy barrier height, scales as Delta
F/k_BT~ND^{-1.93+/-0.01}. In addition, the overlap free energy scales as
F/k_BT=Nf(lambda/N;D), where f is a function parameterized by D. For channels
of finite L, the free energy barrier height increases with increasing
confinement aspect ratio L/D at fixed volume fraction phi, and it decreases
with increasing phi at fixed L/D. Increasing the polymer bending rigidity kappa
monotonically reduces the overlap free energy. For strongly confined systems, F
varies linearly with lambda with a slope that scales as F'(lambda)~-k_BT

backgrounds possessing a generalized planar symmetry and to certain classes of

a bulk surface and determine the appropriate family of boundary intervals by
considering extremal surfaces tangent to the given surface in the bulk.
Alternatively, one can begin with a family of boundary intervals; as we show,
the differential entropy then equals the gravitational entropy of a bulk

class of chemical reaction networks, regardless of the kinetic details, sets a
limit on the dynamical properties that a particular network can potentially
admit; the structure of a network predetermines the dynamic capacity of the
network. We note that stochastic fluctuations can possibly confer a new
dynamical capability to a network. Thus, it is of tremendous value to
understand and be able to control the landscape of stochastic dynamical
behaviors of a biochemical reaction network as a function of network
architecture. Here we investigate such a case where stochastic fluctuations can
give rise to the new capability of noise-induced oscillation in a subset of
biochemical reaction networks, the networks with only three biochemical species
whose reactions are governed by mass action kinetics and with the coupling of
positive and negative feedback loops. We model the networks with the master
equations and approximate them, using the linear noise approximation. For each
network, we read the signal-to-noise ratio value, an indicator of amplified and
coherent noise-induced oscillation, off from the analytically derived power
spectra. We classify the networks into three performance groups based on the
average values of the signal-to-noise ratio and the robustness. We identify the
common network architecture among the networks belonging to the same
performance group, from which we learn that the coupling of negative and
positive feedback loops generally enhance the noise-induced oscillation
performance better than the negative feedback loops alone. The performance of
networks also depends on the relative size of the positive and negative
feedback loops; the networks with the bigger positive and smaller negative
feedbacks are much worse oscillators than the networks with only negative
feedback loops.

core of the 30 Doradus nebula, including the central R136 cluster, in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Observations at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,
obtained with the WFC3 camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope, show that
the stars belonging to the red giant clump are spread across the
colour-magnitude diagrams because of the considerable and uneven levels of
extinction in this region. Since these stars share very similar physical
properties and are all at the same distance, they allow us to derive the
absolute extinction in a straightforward and reliable way. Thus we have
measured the extinction towards about 180 objects and the extinction law in the
range 0.3 - 1.6 micron. At optical wavelengths, the extinction curve is almost
parallel to that of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. Taking the latter
as a template, the value of Rv = 4.5 +/- 0.2 that we measure indicates that in
the optical there is an extra grey component due to a larger fraction of large
grains. At wavelengths longer than ~1 micron, the contribution of this
additional component tapers off as lambda^-1.5, like in the Milky Way,
suggesting that the nature of the grains is otherwise similar to those in our
Galaxy, but with a ~2.2 times higher fraction of large grains. These results
are consistent with the addition of ""fresh"" large grains by supernova
explosions, as recently revealed by Herschel and ALMA observations of SN 1987A.

then one can compute the hitting densities for the SAW in a half-space and in a
sphere. The ensembles of SAW's used to define these hitting densities involve
walks of arbitrary lengths, and so these ensembles cannot be directly studied
by the pivot Monte Carlo algorithm for the SAW. We show that these mixed length
ensembles should have the same scaling limit as certain weighted ensembles that
only involve walks with a single length, thus providing a fast method for
simulating these ensembles. Preliminary simulations which found good agreement
between the predictions and Monte Carlo simulations for the SAW were reported
in [14]. In this paper we present more accurate simulations testing the
predictions and find even stronger support for the prediction that the SAW is
conformally invariant in three dimensions.

one of the most difficult energy to predict accurately, due to the widely

techniques have been widely used to create wind power models, they have shown
limited accuracy in forecasting, as well as difficulty in determining the
correct parameters for an optimized AR model. In this paper, Constriction
Factor Particle Swarm Optimization (CF-PSO) is employed to optimally determine
the parameters of an Autoregressive (AR) model for accurate prediction of the
wind power output behaviour. Appropriate lag order of the proposed model is
selected based on Akaike information criterion. The performance of the proposed
PSO based AR model is compared with four well-established approaches;
Forward-backward approach, Geometric lattice approach, Least-squares approach
and Yule-Walker approach, that are widely used for error minimization of the AR
model. To validate the proposed approach, real-life wind power data of
\textit{Capital Wind Farm} was obtained from Australian Energy Market Operator.
Experimental evaluation based on a number of different datasets demonstrate
that the performance of the AR model is significantly improved compared with
benchmark methods.

constructed perturbatively in terms of the propagators and structures defined
with respect to the free theory. The detailed form of the initial state in this
picture is fixed by imposing suitable `renormalization conditions' on the

periodic Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, focusing on its ability to drive
large-scale horizontal flow that is vertically sheared. For the Prandtl numbers
($Pr$) between 1 and 10 simulated here, this large-scale shear can be induced
by raising the Rayleigh number ($Ra$) sufficiently, and we explore the
resulting convection for $Ra$ up to $10^{10}$. When present in our simulations,
the sheared mean flow accounts for a large fraction of the total kinetic
energy, and this fraction tends towards unity as $Ra\to\infty$. The shear helps
disperse convective structures, and it reduces vertical heat flux; in parameter
regimes where one state with large-scale shear and one without are both stable,
the Nusselt number of the state with shear is smaller and grows more slowly
with $Ra$. When the large-scale shear is present with $Pr\lesssim2$, the
convection undergoes strong global oscillations on long timescales, and heat
transport occurs in bursts. Nusselt numbers, time-averaged over these bursts,
vary non-monotonically with $Ra$ for $Pr=1$. When the shear is present with
$Pr\gtrsim3$, the flow does not burst, and convective heat transport is
sustained at all times. Nusselt numbers then grow roughly as powers of $Ra$,
but the growth rates are slower than any previously reported for
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection without large-scale shear. We find the Nusselt
numbers grow proportionally to $Ra^{0.077}$ when $Pr=3$ and to $Ra^{0.19}$ when
$Pr=10$. Analogies with tokamak plasmas are described.

abundance of this matter is found to be significantly sub-solar (Z~0.4Zsun), an
unusual finding for powerful AGN but in line with the idea that this quasar is

soft excess that can be described phenomenologically (with an additional black

resulting RG equations, represented by ""fixed rays"" along which ratios of the
coupling constants remain constant and map out the leading instabilities of the

by two parallel conducting plates placed equidistant from the electron. We find
that some of the fixed rays on the ""target plane"" found in the zero-field case
are no longer valid fixed rays, but that all four of the isolated rays are
still valid. We also find five additional fixed rays that are not present in
the zero-field case. We then construct maps of the leading instability (or
instabilities) of the system for the screened Coulomb-like interaction as a
function of the overall interaction strength and interaction range for four
values of the applied electric field. We find that the pattern of leading
instabilities is the same as that found in the zero-field case, namely that the
system is unstable to a layer antiferromagnetic state for short-ranged
interactions, to a nematic state for long-ranged interactions, and to both for
intermediate-ranged interactions. However, if the interaction becomes too
long-ranged or too weak, then the system will exhibit no instabilities. The
ranges at which the nematic instability first appears, the antiferromagnetic
instability disappears, and the nematic instability disappears all decrease

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is achieved through a careful balance
between strong light-trapping in a photonic band gap (PBG) and large exciton
density enabled by a multiple quantum-well (QW) structure with moderate
dielectric constant. This enables the formation of long-lived, dense 10~$\mu$m
- 1~cm scale cloud of exciton-polaritons with vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) that
is roughly 7\% of the bare exciton recombination energy. We introduce a
woodpile photonic crystal made of Cd$_{0.6}$Mg$_{0.4}$Te with a 3D PBG of 9.2\%
(gap to central frequency ratio) that strongly focuses a planar guided optical
field on CdTe QWs in the cavity. For 3~nm QWs with 5~nm barrier width the
exciton-photon coupling can be as large as $\hbar\Ome=$55~meV (i.e., vacuum
Rabi splitting $2\hbar\Ome=$110~meV). The exciton recombination energy of
1.65~eV corresponds to an optical wavelength of 750~nm. For $N=$106 QWs
embedded in the cavity the collective exciton-photon coupling per QW,
$\hbar\Ome/\sqrt{N}=5.4$~meV, is much larger than state-of-the-art value of
3.3~meV, for CdTe Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. The maximum BEC temperature is
limited by the depth of the dispersion minimum for the lower polariton branch,
over which the polariton has a small effective mass $\sim 10^{-5}m_0$ where
$m_0$ is the electron mass in vacuum. By detuning the bare exciton
recombination energy above the planar guided optical mode, a larger dispersion
depth is achieved, enabling room-temperature BEC.

related to galaxy structure. Here we propose a new mechanism to explain the
physical origin of this correlation. We assume that while quiescent galaxies
are maintained quenched by a feedback mechanism, cooling flows in the hot halo
gas can still develop intermittently. We study cooling flows in a large suite
of around 90 hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated galaxy group, and find
that the flow development depends significantly on the gravitational potential
well in the central galaxy. If the galaxy's gravity is not strong enough,
cooling flows result in a central cooling catastrophe, supplying cold gas and
feeding star formation to galactic bulges. When the bulge grows prominent
enough, compressional heating starts to offset radiative cooling and maintains
cooling flows in a long-term hot mode without producing cooling catastrophe.
Our model thus describes a self-limited growth channel for galaxy bulges, and
naturally explains the connection between quenching and bulge prominence. In
particular, we explicitly demonstrate that $M_{*}/R_{\rm eff}^{1.5}$ is a good
structural predictor of quenching. We further find that the gravity from the
central supermassive black hole also affects the bimodal fate of cooling flows,
and predict a more general quenching predictor to be $M_{\rm
bh}^{1.6}M_{*}/R_{\rm eff}^{1.5}$, which may be tested in future observational
studies.

In these three manifolds, we also find codimension two I_2-fibers supporting
matter charged only under these discrete gauge groups. Their 6D matter
multiplicities are computed employing ideal techniques and the associated
Jacobian fibrations. We also show that the Jacobian of the biquadric fibration
has one rational section, yielding one U(1)-gauge field in F-theory.
Furthermore, the elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifold based on dP_1 has a

distortion of the oxygen octahedra within a purely nearest neighbour model.
Using a combination classical analysis and exact diagonalization we show that
near the ferromagnetic Kitaev limit a small amount of trigonal distortion, as
found in Na2IrO3, stabilizes a zigzag phase. Decreasing the distortion
destabilizes the zigzag phase toward a spiral phase that may be relevant for

be used and communicated? What are the obstacles to their use in practice? I
review experience with five problems where probabilistic forecasting played an
important role. This leads me to identify five types of potential users: Low
Stakes Users, who don't need probabilistic forecasts; General Assessors, who
need an overall idea of the uncertainty in the forecast; Change Assessors, who
need to know if a change is out of line with expectatations; Risk Avoiders, who
wish to limit the risk of an adverse outcome; and Decision Theorists, who
quantify their loss function and perform the decision-theoretic calculations.
This suggests that it is important to interact with users and to consider their
goals. The cognitive research tells us that calibration is important for trust
in probability forecasts, and that it is important to match the verbal
expression with the task. The cognitive load should be minimized, reducing the
probabilistic forecast to a single percentile if appropriate. Probabilities of
adverse events and percentiles of the predictive distribution of quantities of
interest seem often to be the best way to summarize probabilistic forecasts.
Formal decision theory has an important role, but in a limited range of
applications.

observed in bacterial membranes. We assume that the size dynamics of TatA
clusters are affected by substrate binding, unbinding, and translocation to
associated TatBC clusters, where clusters with bound translocation substrates
favour growth and those without associated substrates favour shrinkage. With a
stochastic model of substrate binding and cluster dynamics, we numerically
determine the TatA cluster size distribution. We include a proportion of
targeted but non-translocatable (NT) substrates, with the simplifying
hypothesis that the substrate translocatability does not directly affect
cluster dynamical rate constants or substrate binding or unbinding rates. This
amounts to a translocation model without specific quality control.
Nevertheless, NT substrates will remain associated with TatA clusters until
unbound and so will affect cluster sizes and translocation rates. We find that
the number of larger TatA clusters depends on the NT fraction $f$. The
translocation rate can be optimized by tuning the rate of spontaneous substrate
unbinding, $\Gamma_U$. We present an analytically solvable three-state model of

by the eccentric companion can result in collisional destruction (rather than
growth) of 1-100 km objects, giving rise to the ""fragmentation barrier"" for
planet formation. We revise this issue using a novel description of secular
dynamics of planetesimals in binaries, which accounts for the gravity of the
eccentric, coplanar protoplanetary disk, as well as gas drag. By studying
planetesimal collision outcomes we show, in contrast to many previous studies,
that planetesimal growth and subsequent formation of planets (including gas
giants) in AU-scale orbits within ~20 AU separation binaries may be possible,
provided that the protoplanetary disks are massive (>10^{-2}M_\odot) and only
weakly eccentric (disk eccentricity <0.01). These requirements are compatible
with both the existence of massive (several M_J) planets in gamma Cep-like
systems and the results of recent simulations of gaseous disks in eccentric
binaries. Terrestrial and Neptune-like planets can also form in lower-mass
disks at small (sub-AU) radii. We find that fragmentation barrier is less of a
problem in eccentric disks which are apsidally aligned with the binary orbit.
Alignment gives rise to special locations, where (1) relative planetesimal
velocities are low and (2) the timescale of their drag-induced radial drift is
long. This causes planetesimal pileup at such locations in the disk and
promotes their growth.

a tree-level $Z^\prime$ or $G^\prime$ exchanges with masses in the reach of the

understand the physics behind recent numerical results obtained in lattice QCD

reported in detail. In the spirit of the Yukawa-approach to the nuclear force
problem, the interactions are studied from the meson-exchange picture

meson-pair-exchange (MPE). The OBE- and MPE-vertices are regulated by gaussian
form factors producing potentials with a soft behavior near the origin. The
assignment of the cut-off masses for the BBM-vertices is dependent on the
SU(3)-classification of the exchanged mesons for OBE, and a similar scheme for
MPE. The simultaneous fit of the ESC-models to the NN- and YN-scattering data
achieved excellent results for the NN, YN, and favorable properties for the

fitted very nicely. (iii) The YN-data are described also very well with
$\chi^/N_{data} = 1.09$. (iv) The model predicts a bound $\Xi N(^3S_1,I=1)$

both result in the generation of irreversible entropy (related to dissipative
processes) in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. To consider such effects,
the general cosmological equations are reformulated, focusing on a spatially
flat matter-dominated universe. A phenomenological entropic-force model is
examined that includes constant terms as a function of the dissipation rate
ranging from $\tilde{\mu} =0$, corresponding to a nondissipative $\Lambda$CDM
(lambda cold dark matter) model, to $\tilde{\mu} =1$, corresponding to a
fully-dissipative CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) model. A time evolution
equation is derived for the matter density contrast, in order to characterize
density perturbations in the present entropic-force model. It is found that the
dissipation rate affects the density perturbations even if the background
evolution of the late universe is equivalent to that of a fine-tuned pure
$\Lambda$CDM model. With increasing dissipation rate $\tilde{\mu}$, the
calculated growth rate for the clustering gradually deviates from observations,
especially at low redshifts. However, the growth rate for low $\tilde{\mu}$
(less than 0.1) is found to agree well with measurements. A low-dissipation
model predicts a smaller growth rate than does the pure $\Lambda$CDM model (for
which $\tilde{\mu} =0$). More detailed data are needed to distinguish the
low-dissipation model from the pure $\Lambda$CDM one.

Thus, it first needs to harvest energy from the signals broadcast by the AP

transmitting the information to the AP in the uplink (UL). The hybrid relay can
not only help to forward information in the UL but also charge the source with

We show that the measure problem is caused by the countable additivity axiom

This is a serious problem if the bulk space-time is treated as a sample space
which is thought to be effectively countably infinite due to local quantum
uncertainties. However, in semiclassical description of eternal inflation the
physical space expands exponentially which makes the sample space of infinite
trajectories uncountable and the (future) boundary space effectively
continuous. Then the measure problem can be solved by defining a probability
measure on the continuum of trajectories or holographically on the future
boundary. We argue that the probability measure which is invariant under the
symmetries of the tree-like structure of eternal inflation can be generated
from the Lebesgue measure on unit interval. According to Vitali theorem the
Lebesgue measure leaves some sets without a measure which means that there are
certain probabilistic questions in eternal inflation that cannot be answered.

simulations of fully developed turbulence, with a large range of sonic and
Alfvenic Mach numbers, to produce synthetic observations of velocity centroids

addition, we investigate how the resulting anisotropy-Alfven Mach number
dependency found in Esquivel & Lazarian (2011) might change when taking the
second moment of the position-position-velocity cube or when using different
expressions to calculate the velocity centroids. We find that the degree of
anisotropy is related primarily to the magnetic field strength (i.e. Alfven
Mach number) and the line-of-sight orientation, with a secondary effect on
sonic Mach number. If the line-of-sight is parallel to up to ~45 deg off of the
mean field direction, the velocity centroid anisotropy is not prominent enough
to distinguish different Alfvenic regimes. The observed anisotropy is not
strongly affected by including radiative transfer, although future studies
should include additional tests for opacity effects. These results open up the
possibility of studying the magnetic nature of the ISM using statistical

this paper, we investigate detailed cosmological predictions of this scenario

compute the Higgs one-loop effective potential including the Higgs portal
scalar dark matter, with the two-loop renormalization group equations and find
a constraint on the coupling between Higgs and dark matter depending on the
inflationary parameters.

Incorporating multiple pumps, mixers and discrete valve based control of

additional required external components has remained elusive. Combining the
idea of punch card programming with arbitrary fluid control, here we describe a
self-contained, hand-crank powered, multiplex and robust programmable
microfluidic platform. A paper tape encodes information as a series of punched
holes. A mechanical reader/actuator reads these paper tapes and correspondingly
executes a series of operations onto a microfluidic chip coupled to the
platform in a plug-and-play fashion. Enabled by the complexity of codes that
can be represented by a series of holes in punched paper tapes, we demonstrate
independent control of fifteen on-chip pumps with enhanced mixing, on-off
valves and a novel on-demand impact-based droplet generator. We demonstrate
robustness of operation by encoding a string of characters representing the
word ""PUNCHCARD MICROFLUIDICS"" using the droplet generator. Multiplexing is
demonstrated by implementing an example water quality test utilizing
colorimetric assays for pH, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate content in different
water samples. With its portable and robust design, low cost and ease-of-use,
we envision punch card programmable microfluidics will bring complex control of
microfluidic chips into field-based applications in low-resource settings and
in the hands of children around the world bringing microfluidics and
low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics to everyday classrooms.

total strength equaling 2.4 $\pm$ 0.3. The placement of GT centroid at 5.6 MeV
by the pn-QRPA model is in reasonable agreement with the shell model centroid
at 5.1 MeV whereas the measured GT centroid was placed at 4.4 $\pm$ 0.3 MeV in
the (n, p) experiment. Fuller, Fowler and Newman (FFN) \cite{FFN80, FFN82,
FFN82b}, placed the GT centroid at too low excitation energy of 2.0 MeV in the
daughter nucleus $^{59}$Fe, and this misplacement led to the enhancement of FFN
rates. The suppressed pn-QRPA and shell model electron capture rates are in
good agreement with each other. The rates are suggestive of higher value of
$Y_{e}$ (electron-to-baryon ratio) and may contribute to a more massive
homologously collapsing core resulting in a more energetic shock. It might be
interesting for the simulators to check the effect of these suppressed rates on
the fine-tuning of the time rate of $Y_{e}$, the concomitant heavy element

significantly improves the performance of SM and pn-QRPA models. Incorporation
of pp force leads to pinning down the centroid value in the PM. The calculated
GT strength functions using the pn-QRPA (C) and SM (C) models are in reasonable

van der Pol via his eponymous paper (Philosophical Magazine, 1926) in which he
apparently introduced this terminology to describe the nonlinear oscillations
produced by self-sustained oscillating systems such as a triode circuit. Our
aim is to investigate how relaxation oscillations were actually discovered.
Browsing the literature from the late 19th century, we identified four
self-oscillating systems in which relaxation oscillations have been observed:
i) the series dynamo machine conducted by G\'erard-Lescuyer (1880), ii) the
musical arc discovered by Duddell (1901) and investigated by Blondel (1905),
iii) the triode invented by de Forest (1907) and, iv) the multivibrator
elaborated by Abraham and Bloch (1917). The differential equation describing
such a self-oscillating system was proposed by Poincar\'e for the musical arc
(1908), by Janet for the series dynamo machine (1919), and by Blondel for the
triode (1919). Once Janet (1919) established that these three self-oscillating
systems can be described by the same equation, van der Pol proposed (1926) a
generic dimensionless equation which captures the relevant dynamical properties
shared by these systems. Van der Pol's contributions during the period of
1926-1930 were investigated to show how, with Le Corbeiller's help, he
popularized the ""relaxation oscillations"" using the previous experiments as
examples and, turned them into a concept.

large amount of X-ray emitting gas at the virial temperature, as well as a
significant amount of warm OVI absorbing gas. We consider the SZ distortion
from the hot gas in those galactic halos in which the gas cooling time is
longer than the halo destruction time scale. We show that the SZ distortion
signal from the hot gas in these galactic halos at redshifts $z\approx
1\hbox{--}8$ can be significant at small angular scales ($\ell\sim 10^4$), and
dominate over the signal from galaxy clusters. The estimated SZ signal for most
massive galaxies (halo mass $\ge 10^{12.5}$ M$_\odot$) is consistent with the
marginal detection by {\it Planck} at these mass scales. We also consider the
SZ effect from warm circumgalactic gas. The integrated Compton distortion from
the warm OVI absorbing gas is estimated to be $y\sim 10^{-8}$, which could
potentially be detected by experiments planned for the near future. Finally, we
study the detectability of the SZ signal from circumgalactic gas in two types
of surveys, a simple extension of the SPT survey and a more futuristic cosmic
variance-limited survey. We find that these surveys can easily detect the kSZ
signal from CGM. With the help of a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that it
will be possible for these surveys to constrain the gas fraction in CGM, after
marginalizing over cosmological parameters, to $\le 33$\%, in case of no
redshift evolution of the gas fraction.

allocated portion of the cost of an optimal tour. The Shapley value is one of
the most important normative division schemes in cooperative games, giving a
principled and fair allocation both for the TSG and more generally. We consider
a number of direct and sampling-based procedures for calculating the Shapley

are equal to those carried by the parental light structure. The rapid collapse
imposes a severe limitation on the propagation of multidimensional waves in

of light from the leading, most intense peak into neighboring peaks and
consequently strongly postpones the collapse. The dependence of the critical

are previously defined in the circuit design. The result is a robust and
flexible circuit without inductors, which is able to reproduce a rich variety
of dynamical behaviors. The proposed analogue circuit is successfully designed

pairwise relationships in a data set with many variables (Reshef et al., 2011).
MIC is useful because it gives similar scores to equally noisy relationships of
different types. This property, called {\em equitability}, is important for
analyzing high-dimensional data sets.
  Here we formalize the theory behind both equitability and MIC in the language
of estimation theory. This formalization has a number of advantages. First, it
allows us to show that equitability is a generalization of power against
statistical independence. Second, it allows us to compute and discuss the
population value of MIC, which we call MIC_*. In doing so we generalize and
strengthen the mathematical results proven in Reshef et al. (2011) and clarify
the relationship between MIC and mutual information. Introducing MIC_* also
enables us to reason about the properties of MIC more abstractly: for instance,
we show that MIC_* is continuous and that there is a sense in which it is a
canonical ""smoothing"" of mutual information. We also prove an alternate,
equivalent characterization of MIC_* that we use to state new estimators of it
as well as an algorithm for explicitly computing it when the joint probability
density function of a pair of random variables is known. Our hope is that this
paper provides a richer theoretical foundation for MIC and equitability going
forward.
  This paper will be accompanied by a forthcoming companion paper that performs
extensive empirical analysis and comparison to other methods and discusses the
practical aspects of both equitability and the use of MIC and its related
statistics.

spectral and temperature-dependent photoconductivity (PC) and their
magnetoresistance (MR) behaviour under photoexcitation. While as-grown films
were insensitive to optical excitation, oxygen reduction appeared to be an
effective way to decrease the film resistance, but the film thickness was found
to play a minor role. However, from the evaluation of the spectral behaviour of
the PC and the comparison of the MR of the LCeMO/substrate-samples with a bare
substrate under illumination we find that the photoconductivity data reflects
not only contributions from (i) photogenerated charge carriers in the film and
(ii) carriers injected from the photoconductive substrate (as concluded from
earlier works), but also (iii) a decisive parallel photoconduction in the
SrTiO$_3$ substrate. Furthermore -- also by analyzing the MR characteristics --
the unexpected occurence of a strong electroresistive effect in the sample with
the highest degree of CeO$_2$ segregation and oxygen deficiency could be
attributed to the electroresistance of the SrTiO$_3$ substrate as well. The
results suggest a critical reconsideration and possibly a reinterpretation of

telescope is fundamental for the adaptive optics systems dimensioning and
performance prediction, as well as for the operational aspects of instruments.
This study attempts to take advantage of multiwavelength long exposure images
to instantaneously and simultaneously derive the turbulence outer scale and
seeing from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of seeing-limited images
taken at the focus of a telescope. These atmospheric parameters are commonly
measured in most observatories by different methods located away from the
telescope platform, and thus differing from the effective estimates at the
focus of a telescope, mainly because of differences in pointing orientation,
height above the ground, or local seeing bias (dome contribution). Long
exposure images can either directly be provided by any multiwavelength
scientific imager or spectrograph, or alternatively from a modified active
optics Shack-Hartmann sensor (AOSH). From measuring simultaneously the AOSH
sensor spot point spread function FWHMs at different wavelengths, one can
estimate the instantaneous outer scale in addition to seeing. Although AOSH
sensors are specified to measure not spot sizes but slopes, real-time r0 and L0
measurements from spot FWHMs can be obtained at the critical location where
they are needed with major advantages over scientific instrument images:
insensitivity to the telescope field stabilization, and being continuously
available. Assuming an alternative optical design allowing simultaneous
multiwavelength images, AOSH sensor gathers all the advantages for real-time
seeing and outer scale monitoring. With the substantial interest in the design
of extremely large telescopes, such a system could have a considerable
importance.

that is the basis of many glass-forming materials. In particular we focus on
the question how boron is embedded into the local structure of the silicate
network liquid. From the partial structure factors we conclude that there is a
weak nanoscale phase separation between silicon and boron and that the sodium
atoms form channel-like structures as they have been found in previous studies
of sodo-silicate glass-formers. Our results for the X-ray and neutron structure
factor show that this feature is basically unnoticeable in the former but
should be visible in the latter as a small peak at small wave-vectors. At high
temperatures we find a high concentration of three-fold coordinated boron atoms
which decreases rapidly with decreasing T, whereas the number of four-fold
coordinated boron atoms increases. Therefore we conclude that at the
experimental glass transition temperature most boron atoms will be four-fold
coordinated. We show that the transformation of [3]B into [4]B with decreasing
T is not just related to the diminution of non-bridging oxygen atoms as claimed
in previous studies, but to a restructuration of the silicate matrix. The
diffusion constants of the various elements show an Arrhenius behavior and we
find that the one for boron has the same value as the one of oxygen and is
significantly larger than the one of silicon. This shows that these two network
formers have rather different dynamical properties, a result that is also
confirmed from the time dependence of the van Hove functions. Finally we show
that the coherent intermediate scattering function for the sodium atoms is very
different from the incoherent one and that it tracks the one of the matrix
atoms.

adjustable parameter in our method is the truncation threshold of the localized

studied through absorption lines in their X-ray spectra. A recurring feature of
these outflows is their broad ionization distribution, including essentially
all ionization levels (e.g., Fe^0+ to Fe^25+). This characteristic feature can
be quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the
distribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.
Observed AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in
different objects. Power-law fits (|dN /dlog xi| ~ N_1 xi^a) yield N_1 =
3x10^{21} cm^-2 +- 0.4 dex and a = 0 -- 0.4. What is the source of this broad
ionization distribution, and what sets the small range of observed $N_1$ and
$a$? A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas
densities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation
pressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and
therefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab. We show
that this compression of the gas by the radiation pressure leads to an AMD with
|dN / dlog xi| = 8x10^21 xi^0.03 cm^-2, remarkably similar to that observed.
The calculated values of $N_1$ and $a$ depend weakly on the gas metallicity,
the ionizing spectral slope, the distance from the nucleus, the ambient
density, and the total absorber column. Thus, radiation pressure compression
(RPC) of the photoionized gas provides a natural explanation for the observed
AMD. RPC predicts that the gas pressure increases with decreasing ionization,
which can be used to test the validity of RPC in ionized AGN outflows.

gas with typical velocities of 3000 - 10,000 km/s. If the outflowing gas fills
a significant fraction of the volume where it resides, then it will be highly
ionized by the quasar due to its low density, and will not produce the observed
UV absorption. The suggestion that the outflow is shielded from the ionizing
radiation was excluded by recent observations. The remaining solution is a
dense outflow with a filling factor $f<10^{-3}$. What produces such a small
$f$? Here we point out that radiation pressure confinement (RPC) inevitably
leads to gas compression and the formation of dense thin gas sheets/filaments,
with a large gradient in density and ionization along the line of sight. The
total column of ionized dustless gas is a few times $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$,
consistent with the observed X-ray absorption and detectable P V absorption.
The predicted maximal columns of various ions show a small dependence on the
system parameters, and can be used to test the validity of RPC as a solution
for the overionization problem. The ionization structure of the outflow implies
that if the outflow is radiatively driven, then broad absorption line quasars
should have $L/L_{\rm Edd} \gtrsim 0.1$.

problem with penalties (CapFLPP) paid per unit of unserved demand. In case of
uncapacitated FLP with penalties demands of a client are either entirely met or
are entirely rejected and penalty is paid. In the uncapacitated case, there is
no reason to serve a client partially. Whereas, in case of CapFLPP, it may be
beneficial to serve a client partially instead of not serving at all and, pay
the penalty for the unmet demand. Charikar et. al.
\cite{charikar2001algorithms}, Jain et. al. \cite{jain2003greedy} and Xu- Xu
\cite{xu2009improved} gave $3$, $2$ and $1.8526$ approximation, respectively,
for the uncapacitated case . We present $(5.83 + \epsilon)$ factor for the case
of uniform capacities and $(8.532 + \epsilon)$ factor for non-uniform
capacities.

successfully applied for getting state-of-the-art accuracies in the problem of
extracting pathways from metabolic networks. We also provide a guideline to
illustrate how to use our method for classification problems, and discuss
important details of its implementation. In particular, we present a simple
dimensionality reduction technique that lowers the computational cost of
classifying diffusion vectors, while leaving the predictive power of the
classification process substantially unaltered. Although the method has very
few parameters, the results we obtain show its flexibility and power. This
should make it helpful in many other contexts.

tokamak parameters. Our results are consistent with known scalings and
experimental evidence that alpha particles are generally well-confined: on the
order of several seconds. It is also confirmed that the effect of alphas on the
turbulence is negligible at realistically low concentrations, consistent with
linear theory. It is demonstrated that the usual practice of using a
high-temperature Maxwellian gives incorrect estimates for the radial alpha
particle flux, and a method of correcting it is provided. Furthermore, we see
that the timescales associated with collisions and transport compete at
moderate energies, calling into question the assumption that alpha particles

process by following the evolution of a disky dwarf orbiting a Milky Way-like
host. We focus on the effect of the orientation of the dwarf galaxy disk's
angular momentum with respect to the orbital one. We find a strong dependence
of the efficiency of the transformation from a disk to a spheroid on the disk
orientation. The effect is strongest for the exactly prograde and weakest for
the exactly retrograde orbit. In the prograde case the stellar component forms
a strong bar and remains prolate until the end of the evolution, while its
rotation is very quickly replaced by random motions of the stars. In the
retrograde case the dwarf remains oblate, does not form a bar and loses
rotation very slowly. Our results suggest that resonant effects are the most
important mechanism underlying the evolution while tidal shocking plays only a
minor role.

the resulting saw-tooth profile of the measured mean force $< f >$ vs height
$D$ of the end-segment over the plane is analyzed for a broad variety of

f >$-$D$ profile depend on the bending and not on the torsional stiffness of
the detached chains. Allowing for the presence of hydrodynamic interactions
(HI) in a setup with explicit solvent and DPD-thermostat, rather than the case
of Langevin thermostat, one finds that HI have little effect on the $< f >$-$D$

solvophilic to solvophobic is found to play negligible role in the desorption
process. In contrast, a changing ratio $\epsilon_s^A / \epsilon_s^B$ of the
binding energies of $A$- and $B$-segments in the detachment of an
$AB$-copolymer from adhesive surface strongly changes the $< f >$-$D$ profile

is a possible constituent of the core of neutron stars. To assess its impact on
the observable behavior of the star one must analyze transport properties,
which in 2SC matter are controlled by the scattering of gapless fermionic modes
by each other and possibly also by color-magnetic flux tubes. Purpose: We
determine the electrical and thermal conductivities and the shear viscosity of
2SC matter. Methods: We use a variational formulation of transport theory,
treating the strong and electromagnetic interactions via a weak coupling
expansion. Results: We provide the leading order scaling of the transport
coefficients with temperature and chemical potential as well as accurate fits
to our numerical results. We also find that the scattering of fermions by
color-magnetic flux tubes is insignificant for thermal conductivity, but may
contribute to the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity in the limit of
very low temperature or high magnetic field. We also estimate the transport
coefficients in unpaired quark matter. Conclusions: Our calculation has set the
stage for exploration of possible signatures of the presence of 2SC quark
matter in neutron stars.

particles moving through a fluid. Strictly speaking they cannot in general be
described by an effective lagrangian; rather the appropriate `low-energy' limit
is instead a Lindblad equation describing the evolution of the density matrix
of the slow degrees of freedom. We derive the equation relevant to super-Hubble
modes of quantum fields in near-de Sitter spacetimes and derive two
implications. We show the evolution of the diagonal density-matrix elements
quickly approaches the Fokker-Planck equation of Starobinsky's stochastic
inflationary picture. This provides an alternative first-principles derivation
of this picture's stochastic noise and drift, as well as its leading
corrections. (An application computes the noise for systems with a sub-luminal
sound speed.) We argue that the presence of interactions drives the
off-diagonal density-matrix elements to zero in the field basis. This shows why
the field basis is the `pointer basis' for the decoherence of primordial
quantum fluctuations while they are outside the horizon, thus allowing them to
re-enter as classical fluctuations, as assumed when analyzing CMB data. The
decoherence process is efficient, occurring after several Hubble times even for
interactions as weak as gravitational-strength. Crucially, the details of the
interactions largely control only the decoherence time and not the nature of
the final late-time stochastic state, much as interactions can control the
equilibration time for thermal systems but are largely irrelevant to the
properties of the resulting equilibrium state.

deviation of theta_{23} from 45^\circ and that of delta from 270^\circ in the
standard parametrization of U are therefore a natural consequence of small
mu-tau symmetry breaking via the renormalization-group equations (RGEs) running
from Lambda_{mu tau} down to the electroweak scale Lambda_{EW} \sim 10^2 GeV.

(e.g. actin) have been studied extensively due to their significant role in
biological cell motility and in maintaining the cell's structural integrity.
Microrheology is the natural method of choice for such studies due to its
economy in sample volume, its wide frequency range, and its spatial
sensitivity. In microrheology, the thermal motion of tracer particles embedded
in a complex fluid is used to extract the fluid's viscoelastic properties.
Comparing the motion of a single particle to the correlated motion of particle
pairs, it is possible to extract viscoelastic properties at different length
scales. In a recent study, a crossover between intermediate and bulk response
of complex fluids was discovered in microrheology measurements of reconstituted
actin networks. This crossover length was related to structural and mechanical
properties of the networks, such as their mesh size and dynamic correlation
length. Here we capitalize on this result giving a detailed description of our
analysis scheme, and demonstrating how this relation can be used to extract the
dynamic correlation length of a polymer network. We further study the relation
between the dynamic correlation length and the structure of the network, by
introducing a new length scale, the average filament length, without altering
the network's mesh size. Contrary to the prevailing assumption, that the
dynamic correlation length is equivalent to the mesh size of the network, we
find that the dynamic correlation length increases once the filament length is
reduced below the crossover distance.

investigate how these outflows compare to the well studied jets from young
stellar objects. A key point of comparison is the relationship between outflow
and accretion activity and in particular the ratio between the mass outflow and
accretion rates ($\dot{M}_{out}$/$\dot{M}_{acc}$). The brown dwarf candidate
ISO-ChaI 217 was discovered by our group, as part of a spectro-astrometric
study of brown dwarfs, to be driving an asymmetric outflow with the
blue-shifted lobe having a position angle of $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$. The aim here
is to further investigate the properties of ISO-ChaI 217, the morphology and
kinematics of its outflow, and to better constrain
($\dot{M}_{out}$/$\dot{M}_{acc}$). The outflow is spatially resolved in the
$[SII]\lambda \lambda 6716,6731$ lines and is detected out to $\sim$ 1\farcs6
in the blue-shifted lobe and ~ 1"" in the red-shifted lobe. The asymmetry
between the two lobes is confirmed although the velocity asymmetry is less
pronounced with respect to our previous study. Using thirteen different
accretion tracers we measure log($\dot{M}_{acc}$) [M$_{sun}$/yr]= -10.6 $\pm$
0.4. As it was not possible to measure the effect of extinction on the ISO-ChaI
217 outflow $\dot{M}_{out}$ was derived for a range of values of A$_{v}$, up to
a value of A$_{v}$ = 2.5 mag estimated for the source extinction. The logarithm
of the mass outflow ($\dot{M}_{out}$) was estimated in the range -11.7 to -11.1
for both jets combined. Thus $\dot{M}_{out}$/$\dot{M}_{acc}$ [\Msun/yr] lies
below the maximum value predicted by magneto-centrifugal jet launching models.
Finally, both model fitting of the Balmer decrements and spectro-astrometric
analysis of the H$\alpha$ line show that the bulk of the H I emission comes
from the accretion flow.

broadening of the first peak in the radial distribution functions g_BO(r) and
g_BNa(r) is due to the presence of trigonal and tetrahedral boron units as well
as to non-bridging oxygen atoms connected to BO_3 units. In agreement with
experimental results we find that the [3]B units involve a significant number
of non-bridging oxygens whereas the vast majority of [4]B have only bridging
oxygens. We determine the three dimensional distribution of the Na atoms around
the [3]B and [4]B units and use this information to explain why the sodium
atoms associated to the latter share more oxygen atoms with the central boron
atoms than the former units. From the distribution of the electrons we
calculate the total electronic density of states as well its decomposition into
angular momentum contributions. The vibrational density of states shows at high
frequencies a band that originates from the motion of the boron atoms.
Furthermore we show that the [3]B and [4]B units give rise to well defined
features in the spectrum which thus can be used to estimate the concentration
of these structural entities. The contribution of [3]B can be decomposed
further into symmetric and asymmetric parts that can also be easily identified
in the spectrum. We show that certain features in the spectrum can be used to
obtain information on the type of atom that is the second nearest neighbor of a
boron in the [4]B unit. We calculate the average Born charges on the bridging
and non-bridging oxygen atoms and show that these depend linearly on the angle
between the two bonds and the distance from the connected cation, respectively.
Finally we have calculated the frequency dependence of the dielectric function

evolved from the interaction of AGN jets with the intracluster medium (ICM) and
providing compelling evidence for the importance of jet-mode AGN feedback. Here
we argue for the physical importance of the cavity shape, which we characterize
with two geometric parameters: radial elongation $\tau$ and top wideness $b$.
We study the cavity shape with 16 hydrodynamic jet simulations in two
representative clusters, and find that the shapes of young cavities are mainly
determined by various jet properties. Our simulations successfully reproduce
two observed types of young cavities elongated along either the jet ($\tau>1$;
type-II) or perpendicular ($\tau\leq1$; type-I) direction. Bottom-wide type-I
cavities are produced by very light internally-subsonic jets, while top-wide
type-II cavities are produced by heavier, internally-supersonic jets, which may
also produce center-wide cavities with $\tau\sim 1$ if the jets are only
slightly supersonic. Bottom-wide type-II cavities can be produced by very light
jets with very long durations and cylindrical cavities are produced by very
light internally-supersonic jets. While not appreciably affecting the shapes of
young cavities, viscosity significantly affects the long-term cavity evolution,
suppressing both interface instabilities and the formation of torus-like
morphology. We encourage observers to study the shapes of young and old X-ray
cavities separately, the former probing the properties of AGN jets and the
latter potentially probing the ICM viscosity level.

Scattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect the
center-to-limb variations of the intensity (CLVI) and the linear polarization
(CLVP) of stellar radiation. Aims. There are several theoretical and
observational studies of CLVI using different stellar models, however, most
studies of CLVP have concentrated on the solar atmosphere and have not
considered the CLVP in cooler non-gray stellar atmospheres at all. In this
paper, we present a theoretical study of the CLV of the intensity and the
linear polarization in continuum spectra of different spectral type stars.
Methods. We solve the radiative transfer equations for polarized light
iteratively assuming no magnetic field and considering a plane-parallel model
atmospheres and various opacities. Results. We calculate the CLVI and the CLVP
for Phoenix stellar model atmospheres for the range of effective temperatures
(4500K - 6900K), gravities (log g = 3.0 - 5.0), and wavelengths (4000 - 7000
{\AA}), which are tabulated and available at the Strasbourg astronomical Data
Center (CDS). In addition, we present several tests of our code and compare our
results with measurements and calculations of CLVI and the CLVP for the Sun.
The resulting CLVI are fitted with polynomials and their coefficients are
presented in this paper. Conclusions. For the stellar model atmospheres with
lower gravity and effective temperature the CLVP is larger.

couple-stress elastic materials and structured Rayleigh beams on a Winkler

underlying equations appear to be similar, and hence mathematical models have a
lot in common. In the present work, our main focus is on the analysis of
dispersive waves, band-gaps and localized waveforms in structured Rayleigh
beams. The Rayleigh beam theory includes the effects of rotational inertia
which are neglected in the Euler--Bernoulli beam theory. This makes the
approach applicable to higher frequency regimes. Special attention is given to
waves in pre-stressed Rayleigh beams on elastic foundations.

molecules freeze out on surfaces of small dust particles to form ices. On dust
surfaces, water is the main constituent of the icy mantle in which a complex
chemistry is taking place. We aim to study the formation pathways and the
composition of the ices throughout the evolution of diffuse clouds. For this
purpose, we use time-dependent rate equations to calculate the molecular
abundances in both gas phase and on solid surfaces (onto dust grains). We fully
consider the gas-dust interplay by including the details of freeze-out,
chemical and thermal desorption, as well as the most important photo-processes
on grain surfaces. The difference in binding energies of chemical species on
bare and icy surfaces is also incorporated into our equations. Using the
numerical code FLASH, we perform a hydrodynamical simulation of a
gravitationally bound diffuse cloud and follow its contraction. We find that
while the dust grains are still bare, water formation is enhanced by grain
surface chemistry which is subsequently released into the gas phase, enriching
the molecular medium. The CO molecules, on the other hand, tend to freeze out
gradually on bare grains. This causes CO to be well mixed and strongly present
within the first ice layer. Once one monolayer of water ice has formed, the
binding energy of the grain surface changes significantly and an immediate and
strong depletion of gas-phase water and CO molecules occur. While hydrogenation
converts solid CO into formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH), water
ice becomes the main constituent of the icy grains. Inside molecular clumps
formaldehyde is more abundant than water and methanol in the gas phase owing
its presence in part to chemical desorption.

stratified water: continuous stratification, where the density is smooth
throughout the fluid, and layer-wise continuous stratification, where the fluid
consists of multiple immiscible strata. The former is the more physically
accurate description, but the latter is frequently more amenable to analysis
and computation. By the conservation of mass, the density is constant along the
streamlines of the flow; the stratification can therefore be specified by
prescribing the value of the density on each streamline. We call this the
streamline density function.
  Our main result states that, for every smoothly stratified periodic traveling
wave in a certain small-amplitude regime, there is an $L^\infty$ neighborhood
of its streamline density function such that, for any piecewise smooth
streamline density function in that neighborhood, there is a corresponding
traveling wave solution. Moreover, the mapping from streamline density function
to wave is Lipschitz continuous in a certain function space framework. As this
neighborhood includes piecewise smooth densities with arbitrarily many jump
discontinues, this theorem provides a rigorous justification for the ubiquitous
practice of approximating a smoothly stratified wave by a layered one. We also
discuss some applications of this result to the study of the qualitative
features of such waves.

that the renormalised DMRG states are eigenvalues of $S^2$ , and the use of the
Wigner-Eckart theorem to greatly reduce the overall storage and computational

greatest for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement the
singlet-embedding strategy of Nishino et al [Phys. Rev. E61, 3199 (2000)] which
allows us to target high spin states as a component of a mixed system which is
overall held in a singlet state. We evaluate our algorithm on benchmark
calculations on the Fe$_2$S$_2$ and Cr$_2$ transition metal systems. By
calculating the full spin ladder of Fe$_2$S$_2$ , we show that the spin-adapted
DMRG algorithm can target very closely spaced spin states. In addition, our
calculations of Cr$_2$ demonstrate that the spin-adapted algorithm requires
only roughly half the number of renormalised DMRG states as the
non-spin-adapted algorithm to obtain the same accuracy in the energy, thus
yielding up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency.

necessity for computing systems. Furthermore, for embedded systems, low power
consumption should be generally considered together with high computing
performance. FPGAs, as programmable logic devices able to support different
types of fine-grained parallelisms, their power and performance advantages were
recognized widely. However, designing applications on FPGA-based systems is
traditionally far from a task can be carried out by software programmers.
Generally, hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers have
more hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application
knowledge. Thus, it is critical for computing systems to allow
application-level programmers to realize their idea conveniently, which is
popular in computing systems based on the general processor. In this paper, the
OpenHEC (Open Framework for High-Efficiency Computing) framework is proposed to
provide a design framework for application-level software programmers to use
FPGA-based platforms. It frees users from hardware and architectural details to
let them focus more on algorithms/applications. This framework was integrated
with the commercial Xilinx ISE/Vivado to make it to be used immediately. After
implementing a widely-used feature detection algorithm on OpenHEC from the
perspective of software programmers, it shows this framework is applicable for
application programmers with little hardware knowledge.

sunlight is systematically examined. For a closed system, the excited state
coherence induced by the sunlight oscillates with an average amplitude that is
inversely proportional to the excitonic gap, and reaches a stationary amplitude
that depends on the temperature and coherence time of the radiation field. For
an open system, the light-induced dynamical coherence relaxes to a static
coherence determined by the non-canonical thermal distribution resulting from
the entanglement with the phonon bath. The decay of the excited state
population to the common ground state establishes a non-equilibrium
steady-state flux driven by the sunlight, and it defines a time window to
observe the transition from dynamical to static coherence. For the parameters
relevant to photosynthetic systems, the exciton dynamics initiated by the
sunlight exhibits a non-negligible amount of dynamical coherence (quantum
beats) on the sub-picosecond timescale; however, this sub-picosecond time-scale
is long enough for light-harvesting systems to establish static coherence,
which plays a crucial role in efficient energy transfer. Further, a
relationship is established between the non-equilibrium steady-state induced by
the sunlight and the coherent dynamics initiated from the ground state by a
laser $\delta$-pulse, thereby making a direct connection between incoherent
sunlight excitation and ultrafast spectroscopy.

process writing restructured code. This reduces the benefits of implementing
the application at a higher level of abstraction and limits the impact of HLS
