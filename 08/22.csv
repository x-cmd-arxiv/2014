deformation to identify, dissect, and quantify the relevant deformation
mechanisms in nanocrystalline $\mathrm{Pd}_{90}\mathrm{Au}_{10}$ in the
limiting case of grain sizes at or below 10 nm. We could identify lattice and
grain boundary elasticity, shear shuffling operating in the core region of
grain boundaries, stress driven grain boundary migration, and dislocation shear
along lattice planes to contribute, however, with significantly different and
nontrivial stress-dependent shares to overall deformation. Regarding lattice
elasticity, we find that Hookean linear elasticity prevailed up to the maximal
stress value of $\approx$ 1.6 GPa. Shear shuffling that propagates strain
at/along grain boundaries increases progressively with increasing load to carry
about two thirds of the overall strain in the regime of macroplasticity. Stress
driven grain boundary migration requires overcoming a threshold stress slightly
below the yield stress of $\approx$ 1.4 GPa and contributes a share of
$\approx$ 10% to overall strain. Appreciable dislocation activity begins at a
stress value of $\approx$ 0.9 GPa to then increase and eventually propagate a
maximal share of $\approx$ 15% to overall strain. In the stress regime below
0.9 GPa, which is characterized by a markedly decreasing tangent modulus, shear
shuffling and lattice- and grain boundary elasticity operate exclusively. The
material response in this regime seems indicative of nonlinear viscous behavior
rather than being correlated with work- or strain hardening as observed in
conventional fcc metals.

frequencies (~1e-3 Hz) in this source show a clear soft lag, as previously
presented for the first 300 ks observation, but no clear iron K lag is detected

reverberation interpretation, where the soft, reflected emission is delayed
with respect to the hard powerlaw component. These spectral timing results
suggest that two distinct variability mechanisms are important in this source:
intrinsic coronal variations (which lead to correlated variability in the
reprocessed emission), and geometrical changes in the corona. Variability due
to geometrical changes does not result in correlated variability in the
reflection, and therefore inhibits the clear detection of an iron K lag.

electrical conductance $G$ when the background temperature $T$ and the dot gate
are tuned. We distinguish two transport regimes in which $L$ displays different
features: the weak- $(\Gamma_{m} < T_{K})$ and strong-coupling $(\Gamma_{m} >
T_{K})$ regimes, where $\Gamma_{m}$ and $T_{K}$ are the Majorana-dot coupling
and the Kondo temperature, respectively. For an ideal (infinitely long)
nanowire where the Majorana end states do not overlap $(\epsilon_{m} = 0)$, the
thermoelectrical conductance $L$ in the weak-coupling regime exhibits a peak at
$T \sim \Gamma_{m}$. This peak is ascribed to the anti-Fano resonance between
the asymmetric Kondo resonance and the zero-energy MF mode. Interestingly, in
the strong-coupling regime, the Kondo-induced peak in $L$ is shifted due to the
MF-induced Zeeman splitting in the dot. For finite but small $\epsilon_{m} >
0$, the interference between two MFs restores the Kondo effect in the dot in a
smaller energy scale $\Gamma^{\prime}_{m}$ and gives rise to an additional peak
in $L$ at $T \sim \Gamma^{\prime}_{m}$, whose sign is opposite to that at
$T\sim\Gamma_{m}$. In the strong-coupling regime this additional peak can cause
a non-monotonic behavior of $L$ with respect to the dot gate. Finally, we
examine the case in which an ordinary spin-polarized fermion is coupled to the

luminous mass} of stars, based on empirically established mass-to-light ratio
which seems to be only applicable to a special class of stars---the
main-sequence stars---with still considerable uncertainties. Another basic tool
to determine the mass of a system of stars or galaxies comes from the study of
their motion, as Newton demonstrated with his law of gravitation, which yields
the {\em gravitational mass}. Because the luminous mass can at best only
represent a portion of the gravitational mass, finding the luminous mass to be
different or less than the gravitational mass should not be surprising. Using
such an apparent discrepancy as a compelling evidence for the so-called dark
matter, which has been believed to possess mysterious nonbaryonic properties
and present a dominant amount in galaxies and the universe, seems to be too far
a stretch when seriously examining the facts and uncertainties in the
measurement techniques. In our opinion, a galaxy with star type distribution
varying from its center to edge may have a mass-to-light ratio varying
accordingly. With the thin-disk model computations based on measured rotation
curves, we found that most galaxies have a typical mass density profile that
peaks at the galactic center and decreases rapidly within $\sim 5%$ of the
cut-off radius, and then declines nearly exponentially toward the edge. The
predicted mass density in the Galactic disk is reasonably within the reported
range of that observed in interstellar medium. This leads us to believe that
ordinary baryonic matter can be sufficient for supporting the observed galactic
rotation curves; speculation of large amount of non-baryonic matter may be
based on an ill-conceived discrepancy between gravitational mass and luminous
mass which appears to be unjustified.

respect covariance of the curved spacetime, we derive the deformed
model-independent KG/Dirac and Hamilton-Jacobi equations using the methods of
effective field theory. We then find that, to all orders of the effective
theories, the deformed Hamilton-Jacobi equations can be obtained from the
original ones by simply replacing the mass of emitted particles $m$ with a
parameter $m_{eff}$ that includes all the quantum gravity corrections.
Therefore, in this scenario, there will be no corrections to the Hawking
temperature of a black hole from the quantum gravity effects if its original
Hawking temperature is independent of the mass of emitted particles. As a
consequence, our results show that breaking covariance in quantum gravity
effective models is a key for a black hole to have the remnant left in the

takes into account all excitations of the metric that can potentially drive an
instability. There are some subtleties in identifying these modes, as a
non-local field theory contains dynamical fields which yet do not correspond to
degrees of freedom. Since some of them are ghost-like, we clarify the impact of
such modes on the stability of the solutions of interest that are the flat
space-time and cosmological solutions. We then find that flat space-time is
unstable under scalar perturbations, but the instability manifests itself only
at cosmological scales, i.e. out of the region of validity of this solution. It
is therefore the stability of the FLRW solution which is relevant there, in
which case the scalar perturbations are known to be well-behaved by numerical
studies. By finding the analytic solution for the late-time behaviour of the
scale factor, which leads to a big rip singularity, we argue that the linear
perturbations are bounded in the future because of the domination of Hubble
friction. In particular, this effect damps the scalar ghost perturbations which
were responsible for destabilizing Minkowski space-time. Thus, the model
remains phenomenologically viable.

superconductivity but P- and T-invariant and generalizable to any dimension.
While the original anyon superconductivity mechanism was based on
incompressible quantum Hall fluids as average field states, our mechanism
involves topological insulators as average field states. In D space dimensions
it involves a (D-1)-form fictitious pseudovector gauge field which originates
from the condensation of topological defects in compact low-energy effective BF
theories. In the average field approximation, the corresponding uniform
emergent charge creates a gap for the (D-2)-dimensional branes via the Magnus
force, the dual of the Lorentz force. One particular combination of intrinsic
and emergent charge fluctuations that leaves the total charge distribution
invariant constitutes an isolated gapless mode leading to superfluidity. The
remaining massive modes organise themselves into a D-dimensional charged,
massive vector. There is no massive Higgs scalar as there is no local order
parameter. When electromagnetism is switched on, the photon acquires mass by
the topological BF mechanism. Although the charge of the gapless mode (2) and
the topological order (4) are the same as those of the standard Higgs model,
the two models of superconductivity are clearly different since the origins of
the gap, reflected in the high-energy sectors are totally different. In 2D this
type of superconductivity is explicitly realized as global superconductivity in
Josephson junction arrays. In 3D this model predicts a possible phase
transition from topological insulators to Higgsless superconductors.

can be used to derive a weak sufficient condition to achieve connectivity in
DC-WSN. To find a stronger result, we define a new vertex-based random

of Penrose (1991) we prove that when the density of the nodes approaches
infinity then a finite component of size greater than 1 exists with probability
0 in this model. We use this result to obtain an optimal condition on node
transmission radius which is both necessary and sufficient to achieve
connectivity and is hence optimal. The optimality of such a radius is also
tested via simulation for two specific duty-cycle schemes, called the
contiguous and the random selection duty-cycle scheme. Finally, we design a
minimum-radius duty-cycling scheme that achieves connectivity with a
transmission radius arbitrarily close to the one required in Random Geometric
Graphs. The overhead in this case is that we have to spend some time computing
the schedule.

formation, and their vast luminosity in gamma rays pin-points regions of star
formation independent of galaxy mass. As such, GRBs provide a unique tool for
studying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. Most of
our understanding of the properties of GRB hosts (GRBHs) comes from optical and
near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relatively
little knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resides
within GRBHs. Currently ~20% of GRBs show evidence of significant amounts of
dust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, and
these GRBs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than GRBs
with optically bright afterglows. In this paper we present Herschel
observations of five GRBHs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted to
understand the dust attenuation properties within GRBs better. Despite the
sensitivity of our Herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample was
detected (GRBH 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate (SFR)
of ~100Mstar/yr, and which had a relatively high stellar mass
(log[Mstar]=10.34+0.09/-0.04). Nevertheless, when considering a larger sample
of GRBHs observed with Herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the only
factor contributing to a Herschel detection, and significant dust extinction
along the GRB sightline (A_{V,GRB}>1.5~mag) appears to be a considerably better
tracer of GRBHs with high dust mass. This suggests that the extinguishing dust
along the GRB line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ISM, and
thus those GRBs with A_{V,GRB}>1~mag but with no host galaxy Herschel
detections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within an
intervening dense cloud.

we find flux-closure domain structures whose morphology is thickness dependent.
A critical value of 20 unit cells is observed: thinner films show structures
with 90$^\circ$ domain loops, whereas thicker ones develop, in addition,
180$^\circ$ domain walls, giving rise to structures of the Landau-Lifshitz
type. When a local and compressive strain gradient at the top surface is
imposed, the gradient is able to switch the polarization of the downward
domains, but not to the opposite ones. The evolution of the domain pattern as a
function of the strain gradient strength consequently depends on the film
thickness. Our simulations indicate that in thinner films, first the 90$^\circ$
domain loops migrate towards the strain-gradient region, and then the
polarization in that zone is gradually switched. In thicker films, instead, the
switching in the strain-gradient region is progressive, not involving
domain-wall motion, which is attributed to less mobile 180$^\circ$ domain
walls. The ferroelectric switching is understood based on the knowledge of the
local atomic properties, and the results confirm that mechanical

non-cryogenic instrument based on specially designed operational amplifiers and
resistor networks. It involves two stages, the first providing a 1000-fold
current gain and the second performing a current-to-voltage conversion via an
internal 1 MOhm reference resistor or, optionally, an external standard
resistor. The ULCA's transfer coefficient is extremely stable versus time,
temperature and current amplitude within the full dynamic range of +/-5 nA. A
low noise level of 2.4 fA/sqrt(Hz) helps to keep averaging times low at small
input currents. A cryogenic current comparator is used to calibrate both input
current gain and output transresistance, providing traceability to the quantum
Hall effect. Typically, within one day after calibration, the uncertainty
contribution from short-term fluctuations of the transresistance is below one
part in 10^7. The long-term stability is expected to be better than one part in
10^5 over a year. A high-precision variant is available that shows a
substantially improved stability at the expense of a higher noise level of 7.5
fA/sqrt(Hz). The ULCA also allows the traceable generation of small electrical
currents or the calibration of high-ohmic resistors.

heterogeneous networks (HetNets) from a novel perspective, motivated by and
generalizing the idea of fractional frequency reuse. By treating the multi-cell
multi-user resource allocation as resource partitioning among multiple reuse
patterns, we propose a unified framework to analyze and compare a wide range of
user association and resource allocation strategies for HetNets, and provide an
optimal benchmark for network performance. The enabling mechanisms are a novel
formulation to consider all possible interference patterns or any pre-defined
subset of patterns, and efficient sparsity-pursuit algorithms to find the
solution. A notable feature of this formulation is that the patterns remain
fixed during the resource optimization process. This creates a favorable
opportunity for convex formulations while still considering interference
coupling. More importantly, in view of the fact that multi-cell resource
allocation is very computational demanding, our framework provides a systematic
way to trade off performance for the reduction of computational complexity by
restricting the candidate patterns to a small number of feature patterns.
Relying on the sparsity-pursuit capability of the proposed algorithms, we
develop a practical guideline to identify the feature patterns. Numerical
results show that the identified feature patterns can significantly improve the
existing strategies, and jointly optimizing the user association and resource
allocation indeed brings considerable gain.

Point and interval estimations are calculated numerically for frequentist and

  Under observational conditions, the true DOP and AOP are unknown, so that
classical statistical considerations - based on true values - are not directly

and produces point and interval estimations for DOP and AOP, directly. Using a
Bayesian approach, we show how to choose DOP point estimations based on the

differences in the limit of low signal-to-noise ratios between the classical

problems. For linear regression, a small, manageable set of data rows can be
randomly selected to approximate a tall, skinny data matrix, improving
processing time significantly. For theoretical performance guarantees, each row
must be sampled with probability proportional to its statistical leverage
score. Unfortunately, leverage scores are difficult to compute.
  A simple alternative is to sample rows uniformly at random. While this often
works, uniform sampling will eliminate critical row information for many
natural instances. We take a fresh look at uniform sampling by examining what
information it does preserve. Specifically, we show that uniform sampling
yields a matrix that, in some sense, well approximates a large fraction of the
original. While this weak form of approximation is not enough for solving
linear regression directly, it is enough to compute a better approximation.
  This observation leads to simple iterative row sampling algorithms for matrix
approximation that run in input-sparsity time and preserve row structure and
sparsity at all intermediate steps. In addition to an improved understanding of
uniform sampling, our main proof introduces a structural result of independent
interest: we show that every matrix can be made to have low coherence by
reweighting a small subset of its rows.

dominat structures present at the initial stage of the evolution get smoothen
out. However, the energy dependence of the fluctuations remain preserved till
the freezeout. The hydrodynamic evolution of the model with chiral equation of

used spectral density of normalized Laplacian matrix for comparing the
structure of networks. The eigenvalues of this matrix reflect not only the
global architecture of a network but also the local topologies that are
produced by different graph evolutionary processes like motif duplication or
joining. A divergence measure on spectral densities is used to quantify the
distances between various metabolic networks, and a split network is
constructed to analyze the phylogeny from these distances. In our analysis, we
focus on the species, which belong to different classes, but appear more
related to each other in the phylogeny. We tried to explore whether they have
evolved under similar environmental conditions or have similar life histories.
With this focus, we have obtained interesting insights into the phylogenetic
commonality between different organisms.

most important applications of information theory, and well understood when the
channel is accurately modelled by classical physics. However, when quantum
effects are involved, we do not know how to compute channel capacities. The
capacity to transmit quantum information is essential to quantum cryptography
and computing, but the formula involves maximising the coherent information
over arbitrarily many channel uses. This is because entanglement across channel
uses can increase the coherent information, even from zero to non-zero!
However, in all known examples, at least to detect whether the capacity is
non-zero, two channel uses already suffice. Maybe a finite number of channel
uses is always sufficient? Here, we show this is emphatically not the case: for
any n, there are channels for which the coherent information is zero for n

Its most immediate consequence is that the amount of information is bounded by
the average thermodynamic entropy produced by the process. At equilibrium no
entropy is produced and therefore the memory device does not add any
information about the environment to the sensory component. Consequently, if
the system operates at equilibrium the addition of a memory component is
superfluous. Such device can be used to model the sensing process of a cell

GW polarizations and then carry out an optimal search for GW signals on these
data streams. Since no statistically significant GWs were detected, we place
upper limits on the intrinsic GW strain amplitude $h_0$ for a range of GW

is to investigate how the polarization degree and angle correlate with the
cloud and core gas. We use optical, near infrared and submillimeter
polarization observations toward the starless object Pipe-109 in the Pipe
nebula. Our data cover a physical scale range of 0.08 to 0.4 pc, comprising the
dense gas, envelope and the surrounding cloud. The cloud polarization is well
traced by the optical data. The near infrared polarization is produced by a
mixed population of grains from the core border and the cloud gas. The optical
and near infrared polarization toward the cloud reach the maximum possible
value and saturate with respect to the visual extinction. The core polarization
is predominantly traced by the submillimeter data and have a steep decrease
with respect to the visual extinction. Modeling of the submillimeter
polarization indicates a magnetic field main direction projected onto the
plane-of-sky and loss of grain alignment for densities higher than
$6\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ (or $A_V > 30$ mag). Pipe-109 is immersed in a
magnetized medium, with a very ordered magnetic field. The absence of internal
source of radiation significantly affects the polarization efficiencies in the
core, creating a polarization hole at the center of the starless core. This
result supports the theory of dust grain alignment via radiative torques.

phenomenon occurs when the charge density becomes highly concentrated over only

is even more complex, with a competition between edge and bulk effects for the

extended X-ray emission associated with normal star forming galaxies. The
presence of such emission is a direct test of whether AGN outflows
significantly interact with the ISM of their host galaxy. We further show that
even radio quiet quasars should have a radio luminosity comparable to or in
excess of the far infrared-radio correlation of normal star forming galaxies.
This radio emission directly constrains the total kinetic energy flux in
AGN-powered galactic winds. Radio emission from AGN wind shocks can also

total radiated energy and peak X-ray luminosity, and between total radiated

an outburst is the primary initial condition that sets up the outburst
properties seen later. We also found that the outbursts of two transient
stellar-mass ULXs in M31 also roughly follow the correlations, which indicate
that the same outburst mechanism works for the brighter outbursts of these two

requires the existence of a Lyapunov function which decreases over each
sampling interval. To enforce this constraint, we use a form of slack variable

allows the Lyapunov function to be temporarily increasing. The resulting
conditions are enforced using a new method of convex optimization of polynomial

binary coalescence events relies on accurate waveform templates in the
frequency domain. The stationary phase approximation (SPA) can be used to
compute closed-form frequency-domain waveforms for non-precessing,
quasi-circular binary inspirals. However, until now, no fast frequency-domain
waveforms have existed for generic, spin-precessing quasi-circular compact
binary inspirals. Templates for these systems have had to be computed via a
discrete Fourier transform of finely sampled time-domain waveforms, which is
far more computationally expensive than those constructed directly in the
frequency-domain, especially for those systems that are dominated by the
inspiral part. There are two obstacles to deriving frequency-domain waveforms
for precessing systems: (i) the spin-precession equations do not admit
closed-form solutions for generic systems; (ii) the SPA fails catastrophically.
Presently there is no general solution to the first problem, so we must resort
to numerical integration of the spin precession equations. This is not a
significant obstacle, as numerical integration on the slow precession timescale
adds very little to the computational cost of generating the waveforms. Our
main result is to solve the second problem, by providing an alternative to the
SPA that we call the method of Shifted Uniform Asymptotics, or SUA, that cures
the divergences in the SPA. The construction of frequency-domain templates
using the SUA can be orders of magnitude more efficient than the time-domain
ones obtained through a discrete Fourier transform. Moreover, this method is
very faithful to the discrete Fourier transform, with mismatches on the order
of $10^{-5}$.

AGN-ionized gas projected >10 kpc from the nucleus, and significant shortfall
of ionizing radiation between the distant gas and the AGN, indicating fading
AGN on ~50,000-year timescales. Every system shows evidence of ongoing or past
interactions; a similar sample of obscured AGN with extended ionized clouds
shares this incidence of disturbances. Several systems show multiple dust lanes
in different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks of
accreted material ~1.5 Gyr after initial arrival. The gas has lower metallicity
than the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar,
consistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, while
some systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signatures
as multiple Doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas by
outflows within the host galaxies themselves. These aspects are consistent with
a tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gas
and stellar tidal features do not always match closely. In contrast to clouds
near radio-loud AGN, these are dominated by rotation, in some cases in warped
disks. Outflows are important only in localized regions near some of the AGN.
In UGC 7342 and UGC 11185, luminous star clusters are seen within projected
ionization cones, potentially triggered by outflows. As in the discovery
example Hanny's Voorwerp/IC 2497, some clouds lack a strong correlation between
H-alpha surface brightness and ionization parameter, indicating unresolved fine
structure. Together with thin coherent filaments spanning several kpc,
persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a role
for magnetic confinement. (Abridged)

counterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal

evidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be
high enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable
planets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in
binaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric
activity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism
(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or
better than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these
cases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We
find that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do
exist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For
a given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of
period and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite
well suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water
and sufficient light for photosynthetic life. We speculate that, as a direct
result of BHM, conditions may be suitable for life on several planets and
possibly even moons of giant planets orbiting some binaries. Lower mass
combinations, while more restrictive in parameter space, provide niches lasting
many billions of years and are rich suppliers of photosynthetic photons. We

loss of coherence without energy exchange. When acting on composite quantum
systems, dephasing reservoirs can lead to a radically different behavior.
Transport of energy between two pure-dephasing markovian reservoirs is
predicted in this work. They are connected through a chain of coupled sites.
The baths are kept in thermal equilibrium at distinct temperatures. Quantum
coherence between sites is generated in the steady-state regime and results in
the underlying mechanism sustaining the effect. A quantum model for the
reservoirs is a necessary condition for the existence of stationary energy
transport. A microscopic derivation of the non-unitary system-bath interaction
is employed, valid in the ultrastrong inter-site coupling regime. The model
assumes that each site-reservoir coupling is local.

disk. Mid-infrared observations show that the disk is rich in molecular gas and
radially extended. To study the properties of this disk, we re-analyzed a set
of near-infrared observations at high spectral resolution obtained with
Gemini-Phoenix. These data cover absorption lines originating from the first
overtone of CO and from \hoh in the 2.3 $\mu$m region as well as more complex
emission-absorption profiles from \hoh and the fundamental mode of CO near 4.6
$\mu$m. By using an excitation diagram and from modeling the spectrum, we find
that most of the CO overtone and \hoh absorption originates from hot gas
($T_{\rm ex} \approx 1000$~K) with high column densities, consistent with the
mid-infrared data. The strong emission in the wavelength range of the CO
fundamental furthermore suggests that there is a significant quantity of gas in
the inner cavity of the disk. In addition, there is a much colder component in
the line of sight to the disk. A detailed analysis of the overtone line
profiles reveals variations in the line widths which are consistent with a
radially extended disk in Keplerian rotation with hotter gas closer to the
central star. We estimate the mass of the primary to be $\sim 0.34$~M$_{\odot}$

conductance, thermopower, I-V characteristics and related transport properties.
In molecular junctions where off-resonance coherent tunneling dominates
transport, resonance peaks in the transmission function are often assumed to be
Lorentzian functions with an energy-independent broadening parameter $\Gamma$.
Here we define a new energy-dependent resonance broadening function,
$\Gamma(E)$, based on diagonalization of non-Hermitian matrices, which can
describe resonances of a more complex, non-Lorentzian nature and can be
decomposed into components associated with the left and right lead,

Green's function approach based on density functional theory for both symmetric
and asymmetric molecular junctions, and show that our definition of
$\Gamma(E)$, when combined with Breit-Wigner formula, reproduces the

Our main result is that networks with certain realistic structural properties
avoid information cascades and enable a population to effectively aggregate
information. In our model, each individual in a network holds a private,
independent opinion about a product or idea, biased toward a ground truth.
Individuals declare their opinions asynchronously, can observe the stated
opinions of their neighbors, and are free to update their declarations over
time. Supposing that individuals conform with the majority report of their
neighbors, we ask whether the population will eventually arrive at consensus on
the ground truth. We show that the answer depends on the network structure:
there exist networks for which consensus is unlikely, or for which declarations
converge on the incorrect opinion with positive probability. On the other hand,
we prove that for networks that are sparse and expansive, the population will
converge to the correct opinion with high probability.

(e.g., Fe, Mg, and Ca) through radiation-driven dust wind in a galaxy is
assumed to depend both on the dust depletion level of the element in
interstellar medium and the total luminosity of the galaxy in the new model. We
particularly focus on the time evolution of [alpha/Fe] and its dependence on
model parameters for dust wind in this study. The principal results are as
follows. The time evolution of [Ca/Fe] is significantly different between
models with and without dust wind in the sense that [Ca/Fe] can be
systematically lower in the models with dust wind. The time evolution of
[Mg/Fe], on the other hand, can not be so different between the models with and
without dust wind owing to the lower level of dust depletion for Mg. As a
result of this, [Mg/Ca] can be systematically higher in the models with dust
wind. We compare these results with the observed elemental features of stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), because a growing number of observational
studies on [alpha/Fe] for the LMC have been recently accumulated for a detailed

transits probe smaller-scale starspot features on the stellar surface along a

out-of transit light curve features, allowing us to break fundamental
degeneracies between spot size, latitude, and contrast. With continuous
monitoring from Kepler we are able to observe small changes in the positions
and sizes of spots from many transits, spanning 4 years of data. Additionally,
for stars without transiting planets like GJ 1243, we are able to recover
subtle, long term changes in spot sizes and longitudes, leading to some of the
slowest differential rotation rates yet measured. These studies constrain key
physical parameters including rotation period, differential rotation, and
diffusion timescales, and open the door to ensemble studies of detailed spot

alternating optimization solution of the problem of minimizing the weighted sum

stopping height of a layer of grains on an inclined surface. Using an existing

quantitatively to existing experimental data for glass beads. This provides a
stringent test of the model, whose previous validations focused on driven

understanding the long-run relationships, which are footstones in building
human society. Recent works have revealed a new set of ""zero-determinant (ZD)""
strategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy
player can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular
he can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear
relationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an
advantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD
strategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when
the game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general
model of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies
have high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy
under noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's
expected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability
declines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by
noise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the
opponent's, which implies strong extortions do not exist even under low noise.
While we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of
extortions, named weak extortions, where any increase of his own payoff always
exceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under
which the weak extortions can be realized are more stringent as the noise
becomes stronger.

L1-minimization when correction box constraints are available. And also many
practical L1-minimization models indeed involve box constraints because they
take certain values from some interval. In this paper, we propose an efficient
iteration scheme, namely projected shrinkage (ProShrink) algorithm, to solve a
class of box-constrained L1-minimization problems. A key contribution in our
technique is that a complicated proximal point operator appeared in the
deduction can be equivalently simplified into a projected shrinkage operator.
Theoretically, we prove that ProShrink enjoys a convergence of both the primal
and dual point sequences. On the numerical level, we demonstrate the benefit of
adding box constraints via sparse recovery experiments.

vanishing of this element is equivalent to the existence of a vertex algebra

existence, the structure is unique up to isomorphism. The homological
obstruction reduces to an ""evenness"" problem that naturally vanishes for
2-divisible groups, so simple currents organized into odd order abelian groups
always produce vertex algebras. Furthermore, in cases most relevant to
conformal field theory (i.e., when we have well-behaved contragradients and
tensor products), we obtain our spaces of intertwining operators naturally, and
the evenness obstruction reduces to the question of whether the contragradient
bilinear form on certain order 2 currents is symmetric or skew-symmetric. We
show that if we are given a simple regular VOA and integral-weight modules

admits the structure of a simple regular VOA, called the simple current

system. Modeling the system either as a gas in thermal equilibrium, or as a
fluid in hydrostatical equilibrium, we obtain the field equation of correlation
function $\xi(r)$ of the mass density fluctuation itself. It can apply to the
study of galaxy clustering on Universe large scales. The observed $\xi(r)\simeq
(r_0/r)^{1.7}$ follows from first principle.
  The equation tells that $\xi(r)$ depends on the point mass $m$ and Jeans
wavelength scale $\lambda_{0}$, which are different for galaxies and clusters.
It explains several longstanding, prominent features of the observed
clustering: the profile of $\xi_{cc}(r)$ of clusters is similar to
$\xi_{gg}(r)$ of galaxies but with a higher amplitude and a longer correlation
length, the correlation length increases with the mean separation between
clusters $r_0\simeq 0.4d$ as the observed scaling, and on very large scales
$\xi_{cc}(r)$ exhibits periodic oscillations with a characteristic wavelength
$\sim 120$Mpc. With a set of fixed model parameters, the solution $\xi(r)$ for
galaxies and for clusters, the power spectrum, the projected, and the angular
correlation function, simultaneously agree with the observational data from the
surveys, such as Automatic Plate Measuring (APM), Two-degree-Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), etc.

discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to
""explain"" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in
the course of time. First, we show that the fairly common idea according to
which this pattern is decaying in ""modern"" societies is not altogether true.
For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or
Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European
countries) in the late 19th century. The method that we use in order to make
some progress in our understanding is the time-honoured Cartesian approach of
breaking up the problem under consideration ""into as many parts as might be
necessary to solve it"". More specifically, we try two decompositions of monthly
suicides: (i) according to suicide methods (ii) according to age-groups.
  The first decomposition points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The
second shows the crucial role of the $ 15-20 $ and $ 65+ $ age-groups. Then, we
present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate
predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work
are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect
which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations. Finally, in the
light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the
theory proposed by Emile Durkheim.

with the explosive data increase in cellular networks due to its high data
transmission rate and low requirement on devices. In this paper, we investigate
the mobile data offloading problem through a third-party WiFi access point (AP)
for a cellular mobile system. From the cellular operator's perspective, by
assuming a usage-based charging model, we formulate the problem as a utility
maximization problem. In particular, we consider three scenarios: (i)
successive interference cancellation (SIC) available at both the base station
(BS) and the AP; (ii) SIC available at neither the BS nor the AP; (iii) SIC
available at only the BS. For (i), we show that the utility maximization
problem can be solved by considering its relaxation problem, and we prove that
our proposed data offloading scheme is near-optimal when the number of users is
large. For (ii), we prove that with high probability the optimal solution is
One-One-Association, i.e., one user connects to the BS and one user connects to
the AP. For (iii), we show that with high probability there is at most one user
connecting to the AP, and all the other users connect to the BS. By comparing
these three scenarios, we prove that SIC decoders help the cellular operator
maximize its utility. To relieve the computational burden of the BS, we propose
a threshold-based distributed data offloading scheme. We show that the proposed
distributed scheme performs well if the threshold is properly chosen.

drag, as a result of scattering or absorption and re-emission. The resulting
friction-like drag, also known as Poynting-Robertson effect, has been recently
studied in the general relativistic background of the Schwarzschild and Kerr
metric, under the assumption that all photons in the radiation field possess
the same angular momentum. We calculate here the signal produced by an emitting
point-like specific source moving in a Schwarzschild spacetime under the
influence of such a radiation field. We derive the flux, redshift factor and
solid angle of the hot spot as a function of (coordinate) time, as well as the
time-integrated image of the hot spot as seen by an observer at infinity. The
results are then compared with those for a spot moving on a circular geodesic
in a Schwarzschild metric.

Deviations from geodesic motion are analyzed as a function of the parameter

the interaction with the fluid distribution leads to capture (escape) of the

of about 10 {\AA} which is nearly null in terms of energy and such a salt
bridge is not observed in their work. But, from the 3O79.pdb X-ray file of the

analyses the NMR and X-ray structures and gives an answer to the above
question: the salt bridge presents at pH 6.5 in the X-ray structure is simply
gone at pH 4.5 in the NMR structure is simply due to the different pH values

stable states: a Bright (B) and Quiet (Q) mode, each with different
characteristic brightness, profile morphology, and single-pulse properties. We
model the average profile evolution both in frequency and time from the onset
of each mode, and highlight the differences between the two modes. In both
modes, the profile evolution can be well explained by radius-to-frequency
mapping at altitudes within a few hundred kilometres of the stellar surface. If
both B and Q-mode emission originate at the same magnetic latitude, then we
find that the change of emission height between the modes is less than 6%. We
also find that, during B-mode, the average profile is gradually shifting
towards later spin phase and then resets its position at the next Q-to-B
transition. The observed B-mode profile delay is frequency-independent (at
least from 25-80 MHz) and asymptotically changes towards a stable value of
about 0.004 in spin phase by the end of mode instance, much too large to be due
to changing spin-down rate. Such a delay can be interpreted as a gradual
movement of the emission cone against the pulsar's direction of rotation, with
different field lines being illuminated over time. Another interesting
explanation is a possible variation of accelerating potential inside the polar
gap. This explanation connects the observed profile delay to the gradually
evolving subpulse drift rate, which depends on the gradient of the potential
across the field lines.

around a close binary star system. These so-called circumbinary planets will
experience non-trivial spatial and temporal distributions of radiative flux on
their surfaces, with features not seen in their single-star orbiting
counterparts. Earthlike circumbinary planets inhabited by photosynthetic
organisms will be forced to adapt to these unusual flux patterns.
  We map the flux received by putative Earthlike planets (as a function of
surface latitude/longitude and time) orbiting the binary star systems Kepler-16
and Kepler-47, two star systems which already boast circumbinary exoplanet
detections. The longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of flux is sensitive
to the centre of mass motion of the binary, and the relative orbital phases of
the binary and planet. Total eclipses of the secondary by the primary, as well
as partial eclipses of the primary by the secondary add an extra forcing term
to the system. We also find that the patterns of darkness on the surface are
equally unique. Beyond the planet's polar circles, the surface spends a
significantly longer time in darkness than latitudes around the equator, due to
the stars' motions delaying the first sunrise of spring (or hastening the last
sunset of autumn). In the case of Kepler-47, we also find a weak longitudinal
dependence for darkness, but this effect tends to average out if considered
over many orbits.
  In the light of these flux and darkness patterns, we consider and discuss the
prospects and challenges for photosynthetic organisms, using terrestrial
analogues as a guide.

J1641-463, by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in the very-high
energy (VHE) domain. HESS J1641-463 remained unnoticed by the usual analysis
techniques due to confusion with the bright nearby source HESS J1640-465. It
emerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restricting
the analysis to events with energies above 4 TeV. It shows a moderate flux
level of F(E > 1 TeV) = (3.64 +/- 0.44_stat +/- 0.73_sys) x 10^-13 cm^-2s-1,
corresponding to 1.8% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy, and a hard
spectrum with a photon index of Gamma = 2.07 +/- 0.11_stat +/- 0.20_sys. It is
a point-like source, although an extension up to Gaussian width of sigma = 3
arcmin cannot be discounted due to uncertainties in the H.E.S.S. PSF. The VHE
gamma-ray flux of HESS J1641-463 is found to be constant over the observed
period when checking time binnings from year-by-year to the 28 min exposures
timescales. HESS J1641-463 is positionally coincident with the radio supernova
remnant SNR G338.5+0.1. No X-ray candidate stands out as a clear association,
however Chandra and XMM-Newton data reveal some potential weak counterparts.
Various VHE gamma-ray production scenarios are discussed. If the emission from
HESS J1641-463 is produced by cosmic ray protons colliding with the ambient
gas, then their spectrum must extend close to 1 PeV. This object may represent
a source population contributing significantly to the galactic cosmic ray flux
around the knee.

powerful, large-scale radio jets, but appear as Seyfert 1 galaxies in their
optical spectra. In the X-ray band, BLRGs also appear like Seyfert galaxies,
but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. One explanation for
these properties is that the X-ray continuum is diluted by emission from the
jet. Here, we present two NuSTAR observations of the BLRG 3C 382 that show
clear evidence that the continuum of this source is dominated by thermal
Comptonization, as in Seyfert 1 galaxies. The two observations were separated
by over a year and found 3C 382 in different states separated by a factor of
1.7 in flux. The lower flux spectrum has a photon-index of
$\Gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the higher flux
spectrum is $\Gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. Thermal and anisotropic
Comptonization models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show that
the coronal plasma cooled from $kT_e=330\pm 30$ keV in the low flux data to
$231^{+50}_{-88}$ keV in the high flux observation. This cooling behavior is
typical of Comptonizing corona in Seyfert galaxies and is distinct from the
variations observed in jet-dominated sources. In the high flux observation,
simultaneous Swift data are leveraged to obtain a broadband spectral energy
distribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim 10$% of the optical
and ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3C 382 exhibits very weak reflection
features, with no detectable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line, that may be best
explained by an outflowing corona combined with an ionized inner accretion
disk.

the broad field of computational intelligence. Accordingly, a wide repertoire
of pattern recognition tools, such as classifiers and knowledge discovery
procedures, are nowadays available and tested for various datasets of labeled
graphs. However, the design of effective learning procedures operating in the
space of labeled graphs is still a challenging problem, especially from the
computational complexity viewpoint. In this paper, we present a major
improvement of a general-purpose classifier for graphs, which is conceived on
an interplay between dissimilarity representation, clustering,
information-theoretic techniques, and evolutionary optimization algorithms. The
improvement focuses on a specific key subroutine devised to compress the input
data. We prove different theorems which are fundamental to the setting of the
parameters controlling such a compression operation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the resulting classifier by benchmarking the developed
variants on well-known datasets of labeled graphs, considering as distinct
performance indicators the classification accuracy, computing time, and
parsimony in terms of structural complexity of the synthesized classification
models. The results show state-of-the-art standards in terms of test set
accuracy and a considerable speed-up for what concerns the computing time.

minimum risk equivariant estimator, plug-in estimators, and plug-in type
estimators with expanded scale. For the multivariate normal case, we make use
of a duality result with a point estimation problem bringing into play
reflected normal loss. In three of more dimensions (i.e., $p \geq 3$), we show
that the MRE estimator is inadmissible under $L_2$ loss and provide dominating
estimators. This brings into play Stein-type results for estimating a
multivariate normal mean with a loss which is a concave and increasing function
of $\|\hat{\mu}-\mu\|^2$. We also study the phenomenon of improvement on the
plug-in density estimator of the form $q_Y(\|y-aX\|^2)\,, 0<a \leq 1\,,$ by a
subclass of scale expansions $\frac{1}{c^p} \, q_Y(\|(y -aX)/c \|^2)$ with

(e.g., grain size, shape, internal structure, the surface roughness). After an
atmospheric correction by the Multi-angle Approach for Retrieval of the Surface
Reflectance from CRISM Observations, the surface reflectances at different
geometries are analyzed by inverting the Hapke photometric model depending on
the single scattering albedo, the 2-term phase function, the macroscopic
roughness and the 2-term opposition effects. Surface photometric maps are
created to observe the spatial variations of surface scattering properties as a
function of geological units at the CRISM spatial resolution (200m/pixel). An

the Higgs potential becomes unstable at approximately $10^{11}$ GeV. However,
calculations of the lifetime of the SM vacuum have shown that it vastly exceeds
the age of the Universe. It was pointed out by two of us (VB,EM) that these
calculations are extremely sensitive to effects from Planck scale
higher-dimensional operators and, without knowledge of these operators, firm
conclusions about the lifetime of the SM vacuum cannot be drawn. The previous
paper used analytical approximations to the potential and, except for Higgs
contributions, ignored loop corrections to the bounce action. In this work, we
do not rely on any analytical approximations and consider all contributions to
the bounce action, confirming the earlier result. It is surprising that the
Planck scale operators can have such a large effect when the instability is at
$10^{11}$ GeV. There are two reasons for the size of this effect. In typical
tunneling calculations, the value of the field at the center of the critical
bubble is much larger than the point of the instability; in the SM case, this
turns out to be numerically within an order of magnitude of the Planck scale.
In addition, tunneling is an inherently non-perturbative phenomenon, and may
not be as strongly suppressed by inverse powers of the Planck scale. We include
effective $\Phi^6$ and $\Phi^8$ Planck-scale operators and show that they can
have an enormous effect on the tunneling rate.

We also complement this with a mean field approximation that captures the

observable craters on the ancient lunar highlands were derived from the main
asteroid belt in such a way that preserved their size-frequency distribution. A
more limited version of this hypothesis, dubbed the E-belt hypothesis,
postulates that a destabilized contiguous inner extension of the main asteroid
belt produced a bombardment limited to those craters younger than Nectaris
basin. We investigate these hypotheses with a Monte Carlo code called the
Cratered Terrain Evolution Model (CTEM). We find that matching the observed
number of lunar highlands craters with Dc~100 km requires that the total number
of impacting asteroids with Di>10 km be no fewer than 4x10-6 km-2. However,
this required mass of impactors has <1% chance of producing only a single basin
larger than the ~1200 km Imbrium basin; instead, these simulations are likely
to produce more large basins than are observed on the Moon. This difficulty in
reproducing the lunar highlands cratering record with a main asteroid belt SFD
arises because the main belt is relatively abundant in the objects that produce
these ""megabasins"" that are larger than Imbrium. We also find that the main
asteroid belt SFD has <16% chance of producing Nectarian densities of Dc>64 km
craters while not producing a crater larger than Imbrium, as required by the
E-belt hypothesis. These results suggest that the lunar highlands were unlikely
to have been bombarded by a population whose size-frequency distribution
resembles that of the currently observed main asteroid belt. We suggest that
the population of impactors that cratered the lunar highlands had a somewhat
similar size-frequency distribution as the modern main asteroid belt, but had a
smaller ratio of objects capable of producing megabasins compared to objects
capable of producing ~100 km craters.

free-space or fiber-optic links. More generally, phase-insensitive bosonic
channels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifying
processes. Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these
channels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds
for the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number
constraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of
second-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest
one, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of
communication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to
understand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite
number of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code
size for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for
its capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by
proving a general ""one-shot"" coding theorem for channels with classical inputs
and pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The
theorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel
output is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine
whether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.

chameleon-type modified gravity theories, which was previously studied by
Clampitt, Cai and Li (2013). We focus on properly accounting for the
void-in-cloud effect, i.e., the growth of those voids sitting in over-dense
regions may be restricted by the evolution of their surroundings. This effect
may change the distribution function of voids hence affect predictions on the
differences between modified gravity and GR. We show that the thin-shell
approximation usually used to calculate the fifth force is qualitatively good
but quantitatively inaccurate. Therefore, it is necessary to numerically solve
the fifth force in both over-dense and under-dense regions. We then generalise
the Eulerian void assignment method of Paranjape, Lam and Sheth (2012) to our
modified gravity model. We implement this method in our Monte Carlo simulations
and compare its results with the original Lagrangian methods. We find that the
abundances of small voids are significantly reduced in both modified gravity
and GR due to the restriction of environments. However, the change in void
abundances for the range of void radii of interest for both models is similar.
Therefore, the difference between models remains similar to the results from
the Lagrangian method, especially if correlated steps of the random walks are
used. As Clampitt, Cai and Li (2013), we find that the void abundance is much
more sensitive to modified gravity than halo abundances. Our method can then be
a faster alternative to N-body simulations for studying the qualitative
behaviour of a broad class of theories. We also discuss the limitations and
other practical issues associated with its applications.

These estimators require the construction of admissible stress fields verifying
the equilibrium exactly. This article focuses on a recent method, based on a
flux-equilibration procedure and called the element equilibration + star-patch
technique (EESPT), that provides for such stress fields. The standard version
relies on a strong prolongation condition in order to calculate equilibrated
tractions along finite element boundaries. Here, we propose an enhanced
version, which is based on a weak prolongation condition resulting in a local
minimization of the complementary energy and leads to optimal tractions in
selected regions. Geometric and error estimate criteria are introduced to
select the relevant zones for optimizing the tractions. We demonstrate how this
optimization procedure is important and relevant to produce sharper estimators
at affordable computational cost, especially when the error estimate criterion
is used. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficiency of the improved technique.
