Access to websites is typically secured via TLS. However, this security model
does not account for prefix hijacking on the network layer, which may lead to
traffic blackholing or transparent interception. Thus, to achieve comprehensive
security and service availability, additional protective mechanisms are
necessary such as the RPKI, a recently deployed Resource Public Key
Infrastructure to prevent hijacking of traffic by networks. This paper argues
two positions. First, that modern web hosting practices make route protection
challenging due to the propensity to spread servers across many different
networks, often with unpredictable client redirection strategies, and, second,
that we need a better understanding why protection mechanisms are not deployed.
To initiate this, we empirically explore the relationship between web hosting
infrastructure and RPKI deployment. Perversely, we find that less popular
websites are more likely to be secured than the prominent sites. Worryingly, we
find many large-scale CDNs do not support RPKI, thus making their customers
vulnerable. This leads us to explore business reasons why operators are
hesitant to deploy RPKI, which may help to guide future research on improving
Internet security.

for the quantum Hall effect in graphene with [0001] tilt grain boundaries

5-7 ring complexes that host defect states that hybridize to form bands with
varying degree of metallicity depending on grain boundary defect density. In a
magnetic field, edge states on opposite sides of the Hall bar can be connected
by the defect states along the grain boundary. This destroys Hall resistance
quantization and leads to non-zero longitudinal resistance. Anderson disorder
can partly recover quantization, where current instead flows along returning
paths along the grain boundary depending on defect density in the grain
boundary and on disorder strength. Since grain sizes in graphene made by

been an increasing need for photometric and spectroscopic models to
characterize these systems. While imaging has been used extensively for Solar
System bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of
typical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them.
Spatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or
spectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on
photometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number
of phenomena that can be exploited for characterization.
  First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and
characterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We
demonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and
orbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example,
radial velocity measurements.
  Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter,
using the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic
errors from the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to
look for the very faint light reflected by the planet.
  We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility
of transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars
in galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the
supermassive black hole in the galactic center.
  Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits.
This method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation
or orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 to
learn more about stellar rotation and to investigate the size and contrast of
the spots themselves.

in the 14nm logic node and beyond. Conventional LELELE type TPL technology
suffers from native conflict and overlapping problems. Recently, as an
alternative process, triple patterning lithography with end cutting (LELE-EC)
was proposed to overcome the limitations of LELELE manufacturing. In LELE-EC
process the first two masks are LELE type double patterning, while the third
mask is used to generate the end-cuts. Although the layout decomposition
problem for LELELE has been well-studied in the literature, only few attempts
have been made to address the LELE-EC layout decomposition problem. In this
paper we propose the comprehensive study for LELE-EC layout decomposition.
Conflict graph and end-cut graph are constructed to extract all the geometrical
relationships of both input layout and end-cut candidates. Based on these
graphs, integer linear programming (ILP) is formulated to minimize the conflict
number and the stitch number. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

subsequent to the failure of a single vertex, the surviving part of $H$ still
contains an \emph{additive} spanner for (the surviving part of) $G$, satisfying

also describe two constructions for {\em fault-tolerant multi-source additive

formation of other more interesting and difficult molecules to be studied at

with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) around 140 MHz and here report on the
first low-frequency fast-radio burst limit and the discovery of two new
pulsars. The first survey, the LOFAR Pilot Pulsar Survey (LPPS), observed a
large fraction of the northern sky, ~1.4 x 10^4 sq. deg, with 1-hr dwell times.
Each observation covered ~75 sq. deg using 7 independent fields formed by
incoherently summing the high-band antenna fields. The second pilot survey, the
LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS), spanned ~600 sq. deg, with roughly a 5-fold
increase in sensitivity compared with LPPS. Using a coherent sum of the 6 LOFAR
""Superterp"" stations, we formed 19 tied-array beams, together covering 4 sq.
deg per pointing. From LPPS we derive a limit on the occurrence, at 142 MHz, of
dispersed radio bursts of < 150 /day/sky, for bursts brighter than S > 107 Jy
for the narrowest searched burst duration of 0.66 ms. In LPPS, we re-detected
65 previously known pulsars. LOTAS discovered two pulsars, the first with LOFAR
or any digital aperture array. LOTAS also re-detected 27 previously known
pulsars. These pilot studies show that LOFAR can efficiently carry out all-sky
surveys for pulsars and fast transients, and they set the stage for further
surveying efforts using LOFAR and the planned low-frequency component of the
Square Kilometer Array.

pleasant---but seemingly unexploited---property that each interval
$s_k:=\{p_k^2, \dots,p_{k+1}^2-1\}$ is fully sieved by the $k$ first primes.
Here we take advantage of this essential characteristic and present evidence
for the conjecture that $\pi_k \sim |s_k|/ \log p_{k+1}^2$, where $\pi_k$ is
the number of primes in $s_k$; or even stricter, that $y=x^{1/2}$ is both
necessary and sufficient for the prime number theorem to be valid in intervals
of length $y$. In addition, we propose and substantiate that the prime counting
function $\pi(x)$ is best understood as a sum of correlated random variables
$\pi_k$. Under this assumption, we derive the theoretical variance of
$\pi(p_{k+1}^2)=\sum_{j=1}^k \pi_j$, from which we are led to conjecture that
$|\pi({x})-\textrm{li}(x)| =O(\sqrt{\textrm{li}(x)})$. Emerging from our
investigations is the view that the intervals between consecutive primes
squared hold the key to a furthered understanding of the distribution of
primes; as evidenced, this perspective also builds strong support in favour of
the Riemann hypothesis.

equipotential lines in a region confined by two interfaces: a cathode with an
irregular interface and a distant flat anode. Both boundaries, which are
maintained at distinct and constant potential values, are assumed to be
conductors. The morphology of the cathode interface results from the deposit of
$2 \times 10^{4}$ monolayers that are produced using a single competitive
growth model based on the rules of the Restricted Solid on Solid and Ballistic
Deposition models, both of which belong to the Kadar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class. At each time step, these rules are selected with
probability $p$ and $q = 1 - p$. For several irregular profiles that depend on
$p$, a family of equipotential lines is evaluated. The lines are characterized
by the skewness and kurtosis of the height distribution. The results indicate
that the skewness of the equipotential line increases when they approach the
flat anode, and this increase has a non-trivial convergence to a delta
distribution that characterizes the equipotential line in a uniform electric
field. The morphology of the equipotential lines is discussed; the discussion
emphasizes their features for different ranges of $p$ that correspond to
positive, null and negative values of the coefficient of the non-linear term in
the KPZ equation.

heating are in highly non-equilibrium states not only between the electron
sub-system and the phonon sub-system but also within the electron sub-system.
An electrohydrodynamics model consisting of the balance equations of electron
density, energy density of electrons, and energy density of phonons is derived
from the coupled non-equilibrium electron and phonon Boltzmann transport
equations to study the nonlinear transport phenomena, such as the electron
density fluctuation and the transient electrical current in metal films, after
ultra-short pulse laser heating. The time-dependent temperature distributions
is calculated by the coupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations,
the electrohydrodynamics model derived in this work, and the two-temperature
model for different laser pulse durations, film thicknesses, and laser
fluences. We find that the two-temperature model overestimates the electron
temperature at the frontsurface of the film and underestimates the damage
threshold when the nonlinear thermal transport of electrons is important. The
electrohydrodynamics model proposedin this work could be a more accurate
prediction tool to study the non-equilibrium electron phonon transport process
than the two-temperature model and it is much easier to be solved than the
coupled electron and phonon Boltzmann transport equations.

frequency of serendipitous human encounters, we conducted experiments to
collect long-term data on human contact using short-range wireless
communication devices which many people frequently carry in daily life. By
analyzing the data we showed that the majority of human encounters occur
once-in-an-experimental-period: they are Ichi-go Ichi-e. We also found that the
remaining more frequent encounters obey a power-law distribution: they are
scale-free. To theoretically find the origin of these properties, we introduced
as a minimal human mobility model, Homesick L\'evy walk, where the walker
stochastically selects moving long distances as well as L\'evy walk or
returning back home. Using numerical simulations and a simple mean-field
theory, we offer a theoretical explanation for the properties to validate the
mobility model. The proposed model is helpful for evaluating long-term
performance of routing protocols in delay tolerant networks and mobile
opportunistic networks better since some utility-based protocols select nodes
with frequent encounters for message transfer.

equation, that is as the effect of diffusion in the turbulent magnetic of an
expanding solar wind. Calculations performed with this method that do not
include a description of the regular magnetic field in the heliosphere predict,
in disagreement with the observations, equal modulations for particles and
antiparticles. The effects of the regular heliospheric field, that break the
the particle/anti-particle symmetry, have been included in the Parker equation
adding convection terms associated to the magnetic drift velocity of charged
particles moving in non--homogeneous magnetic field. In this work we take a
completely different approach and study the propagation of charged particles in
the heliosphere assuming only the presence of the regular magnetic field, and
completely neglecting the random component. Assuming that the field is purely
magnetic in the wind frame, one can deduce the existence of a large scale
electric field, that results in important energy losses for charged particles
that traverse the heliosphere and reach the Earth. The energy loss (Delta E)
due to the large scale regular electric field depends on the particle electric
charge, is proportional to the absolute value of the electric charge, and to a
good approximation is independent from the particle energy and direction. We
speculate that this deterministic energy loss is an important, or perhaps even
the leading contribution to the solar modulation effects.

of the star-forming cluster NGC 2264 (3 Myr). We performed a deep u,g,r,i
mapping and a simultaneous u+r monitoring of the region with CFHT/MegaCam in
order to directly probe the accretion process from UV excess measurements.
Photometric properties and stellar parameters are determined homogeneously for
about 750 monitored young objects, spanning the mass range 0.1-2 Mo. About 40%
are classical (accreting) T Tauri stars, based on various diagnostics (H_alpha,
UV and IR excesses). The remaining non-accreting members define the
(photospheric+chromospheric) reference UV emission level over which flux excess
is detected and measured. We revise the membership status of cluster members
based on UV accretion signatures and report a new population of 50 CTTS
candidates. A large range of UV excess is measured for the CTTS population,
varying from a few 0.1 to 3 mag. We convert these values to accretion
luminosities and obtain mass accretion rates ranging from 1e-10 to 1e-7 Mo/yr.
Taking into account a mass-dependent detection threshold for weakly accreting
objects, we find a >6sigma correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar
mass. A power-law fit, properly accounting for upper limits, yields M_acc
$\propto$ M^{1.4+/-0.3}. At any given stellar mass, we find a large spread of
accretion rates, extending over about 2 orders of magnitude. The monitoring of
the UV excess on a timescale of a couple of weeks indicates that its
variability typically amounts to 0.5 dex, much smaller than the observed
spread. We suggest that a non-negligible age spread across the cluster may
effectively contribute to the observed spread in accretion rates at a given
mass. In addition, different accretion mechanisms (like, e.g., short-lived
accretion bursts vs. more stable funnel-flow accretion) may be associated to
different M_acc regimes.

we developed a new photoemission-based technique that directly probes the

the gap edge to the Fermi energy by pair-breaking processes. While real, this

due to Buscall & White (1987) ignores the possibility that the particulate

is justifiable when the ratio of the shear to compressive strength is small,
which it can be for many systems away from the gel-point, but never very near
it. The errors arising from neglect of adhesion are investigated theoretically
and quantified by synthesising equilibrium sediment height versus acceleration

$C_w(n)$ increases by 1 with each $n$ on some interval of length $r$, then
$C_w(n)$ is constant on some interval of length $s$, and finally $C_w(n)$
decreases by 1 with each $n$ on an interval of the same length $r$. Necessarily
$C_w(1)=2$ (since there is one factor of length $0$, namely the empty word), so
any trapezoidal word is on a binary alphabet. Trapezoidal words were first
introduced by de Luca (1999) when studying the behaviour of the factor
complexity of finite Sturmian words, i.e., factors of infinite ""cutting
sequences"", obtained by coding the sequence of cuts in an integer lattice over
the positive quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^2$ made by a line of irrational slope.
Every finite Sturmian word is trapezoidal, but not conversely. However, both
families of words (trapezoidal and Sturmian) are special classes of so-called
""rich words"" (also known as ""full words"") - a wider family of finite and
infinite words characterized by containing the maximal number of palindromes -
studied in depth by the first author and others in 2009.
  In this paper, we introduce a natural generalization of trapezoidal words
over an arbitrary finite alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, called generalized trapezoidal
words (or GT-words for short). In particular, we study combinatorial and
structural properties of this new class of words, and we show that, unlike the
binary case, not all GT-words are rich in palindromes when $|\mathcal{A}| \geq
3$, but we can describe all those that are rich.

smaller in the non-axisymmetric potential, as compared with those in the

the radius in the two nuclei. A similar variation in the radius is obtained in

senescence, i.e. they do not show signs of functional decline or any increase
of mortality with age, and do not have measurable reductions in reproductive
capacity with age. Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea
urchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than
in other organisms. These phenotypic observations correlate well with
exceptional endurance of NMR tissues to various genotoxic stresses. Therefore,
the lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant
of longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,
stress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a
simple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of
external and endogenous factors. We demonstrate that under most common
circumstances a gene network is inherently unstable and suffers from
exponential accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.
However, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective, the gene network
can stabilize so that gene damage remains constrained along with mortality of
the organism, which may then enjoy a remarkable degree of stability over very
long times. We clarify the relation between stress-resistance and aging and
suggest that stabilization of the genetic network may provide a mathematical
explanation of the Gompertz equation describing the relationship between age
and mortality in many species, and of the apparently negligible senescence
observed in exceptionally long-lived animals. The model may support a range of
applications, such as systematic searches for therapeutics to extend lifespan
and healthspan.

transmission seeking minimal total power consumption by considering both
transmission and operational powers. While the large scale nature of the
problem entails to find distributed solutions, game theory appears to be a
natural tool. We propose a novel distributed algorithm based on group formation
games, called \textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. This formalism is
constructive: a new class of group formation games is introduced where the
utility of players within a group is separable and symmetric being a
generalized version of parity-affiliation games. The proposed hedonic decision
algorithm is also suitable for any set-covering problem. To evaluate the
performance of our algorithm, we propose other approaches to which our
algorithm is compared. We first develop a centralized recursive algorithm
called \textit{the hold minimum} being able to find the optimal assignments.
However, because of the NP-hard complexity of the mobile assignment problem, we
propose a centralized polynomial-time heuristic algorithm called \textit{the
column control} producing near-optimal solutions when the operational power
costs of base stations are taken into account. Starting from this efficient
centralized approach, a \textit{distributed column control algorithm} is also
proposed and compared to \textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. We also
implement the nearest base station algorithm which is very simple and intuitive
and efficiently manage fast-moving users served by macro BSs. Extensive
simulation results are provided and highlight the relative performance of these
algorithms. The simulated scenarios are done according to Poisson point
processes for both mobiles and base stations.

the gauge invariance of the graviton. Interaction is written in terms of gauge
invariant and generally covariant field strength tensors. The basic idea is to
work in Riemann normal coordinates and covariantize the final equation. It
turns out that the equations for massive modes are gauge invariant only if the
space time curvature of the (arbitrary) background is zero. The exact RG
equations give quadratic equations of motion for all the modes {\em including}
the physical graviton. The level $(2,\bar 2)$ massive field equations are used

sending a bright pulse from the quantum channel into the system and analyzing
the back-reflected pulses. Such Trojan-horse attacks can breach the security of
the QKD system if appropriate safeguards are not installed or if they can be
fooled by Eve. We present a risk analysis of such attacks based on extensive
spectral measurements, such as transmittance, reflectivity, and detection
sensitivity of some critical components used in typical QKD systems. Our
results indicate the existence of wavelength regimes where the attacker gains
considerable advantage as compared to launching an attack at 1550 nm. We also
propose countermeasures to reduce the risk of such attacks.

instances of a computational problem that may reduce the computational
complexity of solving that instance or instances. In this paper, we study the
value of help bits in the settings of randomized and average-case complexity.
  Amir, Beigel, and Gasarch (1990) show that for constant $k$, if $k$ instances
of a decision problem can be efficiently solved using less than $k$ bits of
help, then the problem is in P/poly. We extend this result to the setting of
randomized computation: We show that the decision problem is in P/poly if using
$\ell$ help bits, $k$ instances of the problem can be efficiently solved with
probability greater than $2^{\ell-k}$. The same result holds if using less than
$k(1 - h(\alpha))$ help bits (where $h(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function),
we can efficiently solve $(1-\alpha)$ fraction of the instances correctly with
non-vanishing probability. We also extend these two results to non-constant but
logarithmic $k$. In this case however, instead of showing that the problem is
in P/poly we show that it satisfies ""$k$-membership comparability,"" a notion
known to be related to solving $k$ instances using less than $k$ bits of help.
  Next we consider the setting of average-case complexity: Assume that we can
solve $k$ instances of a decision problem using some help bits whose entropy is
less than $k$ when the $k$ instances are drawn independently from a particular
distribution. Then we can efficiently solve an instance drawn from that
distribution with probability better than $1/2$.
  Finally, we show that in the case where $k$ is super-logarithmic, assuming
$k$-membership comparability of a decision problem, one cannot prove that the
problem is in P/poly by a ""black-box proof.""

We demonstrate that a multicore server can process graphs with billions of
vertices and hundreds of billions of edges, utilizing commodity SSDs with
minimal performance loss. We do so by implementing a graph-processing engine on
top of a user-space SSD file system designed for high IOPS and extreme
parallelism. Our semi-external memory graph engine called FlashGraph stores
vertex state in memory and edge lists on SSDs. It hides latency by overlapping
computation with I/O. To save I/O bandwidth, FlashGraph only accesses edge
lists requested by applications from SSDs; to increase I/O throughput and
reduce CPU overhead for I/O, it conservatively merges I/O requests. These
designs maximize performance for applications with different I/O
characteristics. FlashGraph exposes a general and flexible vertex-centric
programming interface that can express a wide variety of graph algorithms and
their optimizations. We demonstrate that FlashGraph in semi-external memory
performs many algorithms with performance up to 80% of its in-memory
implementation and significantly outperforms PowerGraph, a popular distributed
in-memory graph engine.

approximation and estimation of additive functions of the form $\sum_{x} f({\rm
p}_x)$, we reduce the sample complexity for noninteger values of $\alpha$ by a
factor of $\log k$ compared to the empirical estimator. The estimators
achieving these bounds are simple and run in time linear in the number of
samples. Our lower bounds provide explicit constructions of distributions with
different R\'enyi entropies that are hard to distinguish.

of cardiac performance. Physicians observing heart motion on echocardiograms,
during cardiac catheterization, or in the operating room, are impressed by the
twisting or rotary motion of the left ventricle during systole. Conceptually,
the heart has been treated as a pressure chamber. The rotary or torsional
deformation has been poorly understood by basic scientists and has lacked
clinical relevance. The aim of this paper attempts to discuss about this
question: Is ventricular twisting related to ventricular fiber arrangement?
That is dependent to an assumed model of the left ventricular structure.

Therefore, according to Central Bank of Brazil requirements, a methodology is
