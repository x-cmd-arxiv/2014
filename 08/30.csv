present substantial dust clearing in their inner regions, most probably because
of the formation of one or more planets, although other explanations are still
viable. In transitional objects, accretion is found to be about an order of
magnitude smaller than in classical full disks. Since accretion is believed to
be correlated with outflow activity, centimeter free-free jets are expected to
be present in association with these systems, at weaker levels than in
classical protoplanetary (full) systems. We present new observations of the
centimeter radio emission associated with the inner regions of AB Aur and
conclude that the morphology, orientation, spectral index and lack of temporal
variability of the centimeter source imply the presence of a collimated,
ionized outflow. The radio luminosity of this radio jet is, however, about 20
times smaller than that expected for a classical system of similar bolometric
luminosity. We conclude that centimeter continuum emission is present in
association with stars with transitional disks, but at levels than are becoming
detectable only with the upgraded radio arrays. On the other hand, assuming
that the jet velocity is 300 km s$^{-1}$, we find that the ratio of mass loss
rate to accretion rate in AB Aur is $\sim$0.1, similar to that found for less

oxygen along various diffusion pathways. In this work, we investigate
interstitial-oxygen (Oi) diffusion in brownmillerite oxide SrCoO2.5, employing
a first-principles approach. Our calculations indicate highly anisotropic ionic
diffusion pathways, which result from its anisotropic crystal structure. The
one-dimensional-ordered oxygen vacancy channels are found to provide the
easiest diffusion pathway with an activation energy barrier height of 0.62 eV.
The directions perpendicular to the vacancy channels have higher energy
barriers for Oint diffusion. In addition, we have studied migration barriers
for oxygen vacancies that could be present as point defects within the
material. This in turn could also facilitate the transport of oxygen.
Interestingly, for oxygen vacancies, the lowest barrier height was found to
occur within the octahedral layer with an energy of 0.82 eV. Our results imply
that interstitial migration would be highly one-dimensional in nature. Oxygen
vacancy transport, on the other hand, could preferentially occur in the

through high-level quantum chemical comptuations that the global minima on the

a necessary intermediate in the Ar+ + H2 -> ArH+ + H formation reaction
proposed in the same work where ArH+ is first reported in the Crab nebula.
ArH2+ is also probably an intermediate in the alternative Ar + H+2 -> ArH+ + H
reaction. Additionally, it is shown that Ne+ + H2 -> NeH+2 will subsequently
most likely yield Ne + H+2 and not NeH+ + H offering a possible rationale as to
the absence of NeH+ in spectra obtained from the interstellar medium (ISM).
Following from this, spectroscopic data (both rotational and vibrational) are
provided for NeH2+ and ArH2+ through the use of highly-accurate quantum
chemical quartic and cubic force fields. All possible isotopologues are also
included for 20Ne, 22Ne, 36Ar, 38Ar, 40Ar, 1H, and D. The dipole moments for
these systems are quite large at 5.61 D for NeH2+ and 4.37 D for ArH2+. The

depends on ingredients such as the number of replicas $R$, reliable
determination of weight factors and the set of used temperatures, ${\mathcal
T}_R = \{T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_R\}$. For the simulated tempering (SP) in
particular -- useful due to its generality and conceptual simplicity -- the
latter aspect (closely related to the actual $R$) may be a key issue in
problems displaying metastability and trapping in certain regions of the phase
space. To determine ${\mathcal T}_R$'s leading to accurate thermodynamics
estimates and still trying to minimize the simulation computational time, here
it is considered a fixed exchange frequency scheme for the ST. From the
temperature of interest $T_1$, successive $T$'s are chosen so that the exchange
frequency between any adjacent pair $T_r$ and $T_{r+1}$ has a same value $f$.
By varying the $f$'s and analyzing the ${\mathcal T}_R$'s through relatively
inexpensive tests (e.g., time decay toward the steady regime), an optimal
situation in which the simulations visit much faster and more uniformly the
relevant portions of the phase space is determined. As illustrations, the
proposal is applied to three lattice models, BEG, Bell-Lavis, and Potts, in the
hard case of extreme first-order phase transitions, always giving very good
results, even for $R=3$. Also, comparisons with other protocols (constant
entropy and arithmetic progression) to choose the set ${\mathcal T}_R$ are
undertaken. The fixed exchange frequency method is found to be consistently
superior, specially for small $R$'s. Finally, distinct instances where the
prescription could be helpful (in second-order transitions and for the parallel
tempering approach) are briefly discussed.

corresponding to our ansatz, valid for any spin-mixture, within which we obtain

from the literature we find a detection rate of 43+-14%, comparable to the
detection rate for nearby radio galaxies, suggesting that group-dominant
ellipticals may be more likely to contain molecular gas than their non-central
counterparts. Those group-dominant galaxies which are detected typically
contain ~2x10^8 Msol of molecular gas, and although most have low star
formation rates (<1 Msol/yr) they have short depletion times, indicating that
the gas must be replenished on timescales ~100 Myr. Almost all of the galaxies
contain active nuclei, and we note while the data suggest that CO may be more
common in the most radio-loud galaxies, the mass of molecular gas required to
power the active nuclei through accretion is small compared to the masses
observed. We consider possible origin mechanisms for the gas, through cooling
of stellar ejecta within the galaxies, group-scale cooling flows, and gas-rich
mergers, and find probable examples of each type within our sample, confirming
that a variety of processes act to drive the build up of molecular gas in

for global continuous optimization with a limited budget of black-box function
evaluations. It is based on a statistical model of the function learned from
previous evaluations and an infill criterion - the expected improvement - used
to find a promising point for a new evaluation. The `expected improvement'
infill criterion takes into account the mean and variance of a predictive
multivariate Gaussian distribution.
  The expected improvement algorithm has recently been generalized to
multiobjective optimization. In order to measure the improvement of a Pareto
front quantitatively the gain in dominated (hyper-)volume is used. The
computation of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a
multidimensional integration of a step-wise defined non-linear function related
to the Gaussian probability density function over an intersection of boxes.
This paper provides a new algorithm for the exact computation of the expected
improvement to more than two objective functions. For the bicriteria case it
has a time complexity in $O(n^2)$ with $n$ denoting the number of points in the
current best Pareto front approximation. It improves previously known
algorithms with time complexity $O(n^3 \log n)$. For tricriteria optimization
we devise an algorithm with time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Besides discussing the
new time complexity bounds the speed of the new algorithm is also tested
empirically on test data. It is shown that further improvements in speed can be
achieved by reusing data structures built up in previous iterations. The
resulting numerical algorithms can be readily used in existing implementations
of hypervolume-based expected improvement algorithms.

the first type of combinations the Dirac as well as one Majorana phase are
trivial, whereas the other two ones predict in general all CP phases to be
non-trivial and also non-maximal. Already for small values of the index n of

through both quantum and thermal selection. In this paper we consider the
effect of substituting non-magnetic ions onto the magnetic sites in a
pyrochlore XY model with generally anisotropic exchange tuned by a single
parameter $J^{\pm\pm}/J^\pm$. The physics is controlled by two points in this
space of parameters $J^{\pm\pm}/J^\pm=\pm 2$ at which there are line modes in
the ground state and hence an $O(L^2)$ ground state degeneracy intermediate
between that of a conventional magnet and a Coulomb phase. At each of these
points, single vacancies seed pairs of line defects. Two line defects carrying
incompatible spin configurations from different vacancies can cross leading to
an effective one-dimensional description of the resulting spin texture. In the
thermodynamic limit at finite density, we find that dilution selects a state
""opposite"" to the state selected by thermal and quantum disorder which is
understood from the single vacancy limit. The latter finding hints at the
possibility that Er$_{2-x}$Y$_x$Ti$_2$O$_7$ for small $x$ exhibits a second
phase transition within the thermally selected $\psi_2$ state into a $\psi_3$

Although CFD--DEM solvers have become a mature technique that is widely used in

easy-to-implement coarse graining algorithm that can work with CFD solvers of
arbitrary meshes is still lacking. In this work, we proposed a new coarse
graining algorithm for continuum--discrete solvers for dense particle-laden
flows based on solving a transient diffusion equation. Via theoretical analysis
we demonstrated that the proposed method is equivalent to the statistical
kernel method with a Gaussian kernel, but the current method is much more
straightforward to implement in CFD--DEM solvers. \textit{A priori} numerical
tests were performed to obtain the solid volume fraction fields based on given
particle distributions, the results obtained by using the proposed algorithm
were compared with those from other coarse graining methods in the literature
(e.g., the particle centroid method, the divided particle volume method, and
the two-grid formulation). The numerical tests demonstrated that the proposed
coarse graining procedure based on solving diffusion equations is theoretically
sound, easy to implement and parallelize in general CFD solvers, and has
improved mesh-convergence characteristics compared with existing coarse
graining methods. The diffusion-based coarse graining method has been
implemented into a CFD--DEM solver, the results of which are presented in a

focus on a factorized picture of EWBG which separates the sources of a stronger
phase transition from those that provide new sources of CP violation. We then
construct a ""nightmare scenario"" that generates a strong first-order phase
transition as required by EWBG, but is very difficult to test experimentally.

collapse of massive stars. We investigate the red supergiant problem, which
concerns why red supergiants with masses $\sim16$-$30 M_\odot$ have not been
identified as progenitors of Type IIP supernovae, and the supernova rate
problem, which concerns why the observed cosmic supernova rate is smaller than
the observed cosmic star formation rate. We find key physics to solving these
in the compactness parameter, which characterizes the density structure of the
progenitor. If massive stars with compactness above $\xi_{2.5} \sim 0.2$ fail
to produce canonical supernovae, (i) stars in the mass range $16$-$30 M_\odot$
populate an island of stars that have high $\xi_{2.5}$ and do not produce
canonical supernovae, and (ii) the fraction of such stars is consistent with
the missing fraction of supernovae relative to star formation. We support this
scenario with a series of two- and three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
core-collapse simulations. Using more than 300 progenitors covering initial
masses $10.8$-$75 M_\odot$ and three initial metallicities, we show that high
compactness is conducive to failed explosions. We then argue that a critical
compactness of $\sim 0.2$ as the divide between successful and failed
explosions is consistent with state-of-the-art three-dimensional core-collapse
simulations. Our study implies that numerical simulations of core collapse need

smoking gun signals for annihilating dark matter. Here, we demonstrate that the
situation is particularly interesting for Kaluza-Klein dark matter because
resonant annihilation is generically expected for small, but not necessarily
vanishing relative velocities of the annihilating particles. We calculate the
contribution from those hitherto neglected resonances and show that the
annihilation rate into monochromatic photons can be significantly enhanced, in
a way that is much more pronounced than for the associated production of
continuum photons. For favorable astrophysical conditions, this leads to
promising prospects for the detection of TeV-scale Kaluza-Klein dark matter. We
also point out that the situation may be even more interesting in the vicinity
of black holes, like the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy,
where in principle center-of-mass energies much larger than the rest mass are
available. In this case, annihilating Kaluza-Klein dark matter may show the
striking and unique signature of several gamma ray lines, with an equidistant

formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these topics using
Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy
formation. Illustris reproduces the observed relation (the star formation main
sequence; SFMS) between SFR and stellar mass at redshifts z=0 and z=4, but at
intermediate redshifts of z~2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower
normalisation than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is
consistent with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above
the SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed. Galaxies
with halo masses of ~10^{12} solar masses dominate the SFR density of the
Universe, in agreement with the results of abundance matching. Furthermore,
more-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift,
which indicates that `downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star
formation histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal
component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass, galaxies
that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z=0, indicating that star
formation and black hole growth are tightly linked processes in Illustris.
While many of the properties of normal star-forming galaxies are
well-reproduced in the Illustris simulation, forming a realistic population of
starbursts will likely require higher resolution and probably a more
sophisticated treatment of star formation and feedback from stars and black
holes.

insights on the dynamics and formation history of such systems. Using a
technique called `frequency maps' as fast indicators for long-term stability,
we explore the stability of Kepler-11 system by analyzing the neighbourhood
space around its orbital parameters. Frequency maps provide a visual
representation of chaos and stability, and their dependence on orbital
parameters. We find that the current system is stable, but lies within a few
percent of several dynamically dangerous 2-body mean-motion resonances. Planet
eccentricities are restricted below a small value, $\sim 0.04$, for long-term
stability, but planet masses can be more than twice their reported values
(thus, allowing for the possibility of mass-loss by past photoevaporation).
Based on our frequency maps, we speculate on the origin for instability in
closely-packed systems. We then proceed to investigate how the system can have
been assembled. The stability constraints on Kepler-11 (mainly, eccentricity
constraints) suggest that if the system were assembled in-situ, a dissipation
mechanism must have been at work to neutralize eccentricity excitation. On the
other hand, if migration was responsible for assembling the planets, there has
to be little differential migration among the planets, to avoid them either
getting trapped into mean motion resonances, or crashing into each other.

MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) while adding new key components. The first
new feature is a dark matter fluid, in the form of a scalar field with small
equation of state and sound speed. This component is critical in reproducing
the success of cold dark matter for the expansion history and the growth of
linear perturbations, but does not cluster significantly on non-linear scales.
Instead, the missing mass problem on non-linear scales is addressed by a
modification of the gravitational force law. The force law approximates MOND at
large and intermediate accelerations, and therefore reproduces the empirical
success of MOND at fitting galactic rotation curves. At ultra-low
accelerations, the force law reverts to an inverse-square-law, albeit with a
larger Newton's constant. This latter regime is important in galaxy clusters
and is consistent with their observed isothermal profiles, provided the
characteristic acceleration scale of MOND is mildly varying with scale or mass,
such that it is ~12 times higher in clusters than in galaxies. We present an
explicit relativistic theory in terms of two scalar fields. The first scalar
field is governed by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action and behaves as a dark matter
fluid on large scales. The second scalar field also has single-derivative
interactions and mediates a fifth force that modifies gravity on non-linear
scales. Both scalars are coupled to matter via an effective metric that depends
locally on the fields. The form of this effective metric implies the equality
of the two scalar gravitational potentials, which ensures that lensing and
dynamical mass estimates agree. Further work is needed in order to make both
the acceleration scale of MOND and the fraction at which gravity reverts to an
inverse-square law explicitly dynamical quantities, varying with scale or mass.

function in this case, making use of the general formalism for treating light
propagation in inhomogeneous spacetimes which leads to the characterization of
distance matrices between main lens planes. Applying Fermat's principle, an
alternative form of the corresponding lens equation is derived, which connects
the impact vectors in three consecutive main lens planes, and we show that this
form of the lens equation is equivalent to the more standard one. For this,
some general relations for cosmological distance matrices are derived. The
generalized multi-plane lens situation admits a generalized mass-sheet
transformation, which corresponds to uniform isotropic scaling in each lens
plane, a corresponding scaling of the deflection angle, and the addition of a
tidal matrix (mass sheet plus external shear) to each main lens. We show that
the time delay for sources in all lens planes scale with the same factor under
this generalized mass-sheet transformation, thus precluding the use of
time-delay ratios to break the mass-sheet transformation.

development of turbulence from 0.2 AU up to about 1.5 AU. Starting with
isotropic spectra scaling as $k^{-1}$, we observe a steepening toward a
$k^{-5/3}$ scaling in the middle of the wavenumber range and formation of
spectral anisotropies. The advection of a plasma volume by the expanding solar
wind causes a non-trivial stretching of the volume in directions transverse to
radial and the selective decay of the components of velocity and magnetic
fluctuations. These two effects combine to yield the following results. (i)
Spectral anisotropy: gyrotropy is broken, and the radial wavevectors have most
of the power. (ii) Coherent structures: radial streams emerge that resemble the
observed microjets. (iii) Energy spectra per component: they show an ordering
in good agreement with the one observed in the solar wind at 1 AU. The latter
point includes a global dominance of the magnetic energy over kinetic energy in
the inertial and $f^{-1}$ range and a dominance of the
perpendicular-to-the-radial components over the radial components in the
inertial range. We conclude that many of the above properties are the result of

a companion paper based on solving diffusion equations is applied to CFD-DEM
simulations, where coarse graining is used to obtain solid volume fraction,
particle phase velocity, and fluid-particle interaction forces. By examining
the conservation requirements, the variables to solve diffusion equations for
in CFD-DEM simulations are identified. The algorithm is then implemented into a
CFD-DEM solver based on OpenFOAM and LAMMPS, the former being a
general-purpose, three-dimensional CFD solver based on unstructured meshes.
Numerical simulations are performed for a fluidized bed by using the CFD-DEM
solver with the diffusion-based coarse-graining algorithm. Converged results
are obtained on successively refined meshes, even for meshes with cell sizes
comparable to or smaller than the particle diameter. This is a critical
advantage of the proposed method over many existing coarse-graining methods,
and would be particularly valuable when small cells are required in part of the
CFD mesh to resolve certain flow features such as boundary layers in wall
bounded flows and shear layers in jets and wakes. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the overhead computational costs incurred by the proposed coarse-graining
procedure are a small portion of the total costs in typical CFD-DEM simulations
as long as the number of particles per cell is reasonably large, although
admittedly the computational overhead of the coarse graining often exceeds that
of the CFD solver. Other advantages of the present algorithm include more
robust and physically realistic results, flexibility and easy implementation in
almost any CFD solvers, and clear physical interpretation of the computational
parameter needed in the algorithm. In summary, the diffusion-based method is a
theoretically elegant and practically viable option for CFD-DEM simulations.

model of a simple trophic web with two herbivores and one predator. The studied
situations represent a common practice in the steppes of Argentine Patagonia,
where livestock are raised in a semi-wild state, either on the open range or
enclosed, coexisting with competitors and predators. In the present work, the
competing herbivores represent sheep and guanacos, while the predator is
associated with the puma. The proposed model combines the concepts of
metapopulations and patches dynamics, and includes an explicit hierarchical
competition between species, which affects their prospect to colonize an empty
patch when having to compete with other species. We perform numerical
simulations of spatially extended metapopulations assemblages of the system,
which allow us to incorporate the effects of habitat heterogeneity and
destruction. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from mean
field calculations. We find that the model provides a good theoretical
framework in several situations, including the control of the wild populations
that the ranchers exert to different extent. Furthermore, the present
formulation incorporates new terms in previously analyzed models, that help to
reveal the important effects due to the heterogeneous nature of the system.

magnetic fields is that they all are very slow rotators. This paper uses this
unique property to first demonstrate that the projected rotational speeds of
massive, hot stars, as derived using current standard spectroscopic techniques,
can be severely overestimated when significant ""macroturbulent"" line-broadening
is present. This may, for example, have consequences for deriving the
statistical distribution of rotation rates in massive-star populations, and for
the use of these rates in stellar evolution models. It is next shown how such
macroturbulence (seemingly a universal feature of hot, massive stars) is
present in all but one of the magnetic O-stars, namely NGC 1624-2. Assuming
then a simple model in which NGC 1624-2's exceptionally strong, large-scale
magnetic field suppresses atmospheric motions down to layers where the magnetic

depth of this enigmatic hot-star macroturbulence are derived. The results
suggest an origin in the thin sub-surface convection zone of massive stars,
consistent with a physical origin due to, e.g., stellar pulsations excited by
the convective motions.

interaction-free measurement setup, a quantum-physics based approach that might
significantly reduce sample damage in imaging and microscopy. With an emphasis
on applications in electron microscopy, we simulate the behavior of probe
particles in an interaction-free measurement setup with semitransparent
samples, and we show that the transparency of a sample can be measured in such
a setup. However, such a measurement is not possible without losing (i.e.,
absorbing or scattering) probe particles in general, which causes sample
damage. We show how the amount of lost particles can be minimized by adjusting
the number of round trips through the setup, and we explicitly calculate the
amount of lost particles in measurements which either aim at distinguishing two
transparencies or at measuring an unknown transparency precisely. We also
discuss the effect of the sample causing phase shifts in interaction-free
measurements. Comparing the resulting loss of probe particles with a classical
measurement of transparency, we find that interaction-free measurements only
provide a benefit in two cases: first, if two semitransparent samples with a
high contrast are to be distinguished, interaction-free measurements lose less
particles than classical measurements by a factor that increases with the
contrast. This implies that interaction-free measurements with zero loss are
possible if one of the samples is perfectly transparent. A second case where
interaction-free measurements outperform classical measurements is if three
conditions are met: the particle source exhibits Poissonian number statistics,
the number of lost particles cannot be measured, and the transparency is larger
than approximately 1/2. In all other cases, interaction-free measurements lose
as many probe particles as classical measurements or more.

deep inelastic electron-positron annihilation into a nucleon plus anything else

crossing symmetry and found that the structure functions satisfy a scaling
behavior analogous to the Bjorken limit for deep inelastic electron scattering.
We then find that massive lepton pair production in collisions of two high

behavior for the differential cross sections. This turns out to be the first

current in present-day tokamaks, they are predicted to strongly interact with
the energetic alpha particles born from fusion reactions in eventual tokamak
reactors. However, in the presence of the expected steep alpha particle birth
gradient, this interaction can produce wave amplification rather than wave
damping. Here, we identify the flexibilities and constraints in achieving this
amplification effect through a consideration of symmetries in the channeling
interaction, in the wave propagation, and in the tokamak field configuration.
Interestingly, for standard LH current drive that supports the poloidal
magnetic field, we find that wave amplification through alpha channeling is
fundamentally coupled to the poorly understood parallel wavenumber upshift. In
so doing, we show that wave launch from the tokamak high-field side is
favorable both for alpha-channeling and for achieving the parallel wavenumber
upshift.

form galaxies like the Milky Way; this complexity quantifies the amount of
initial data available to form the structure. We also speculate on how the
quantity changes with time. Because of dark-matter and baryonic collapse
processes, it likely decreases with time, i.e.\ information sinks dominate
sources. But sources of new random information do exist; e.g., a central black
hole with an accretion disk and jets could in principle broadcast small-scale
quantum fluctuations over a substantial portion of a galaxy.
  A speculative example of how this concept might be useful is in
differentiating between warm (WDM) and cold (CDM) dark matter. With WDM, the
initial patch that formed the Milky Way would have had few features, making the
present high degree of structure a curiosity. The primordial patch would have
had only several billion independent information-carrying `pixels' if the WDM
particle had a mass of 1 keV. This number of `pixels' is much less than even
the number of stars in the Milky Way. If the dark matter is proven to be warm,
the high degree of structure in the Milky Way could have arisen in two ways:
(1) from a high sensitivity to initial conditions, like an intricate fractal
arising from a relatively simple computer code; or (2) from random information
generated after the galaxy formed, i.e.\ not entirely deterministically from
the initial conditions.

images from five other ground-based telescopes. We measured the H-beta light
curve lag with respect to the V-band continuum light curve using both
cross-correlation techniques (CCF) and continuum light curve variability
modeling with the JAVELIN method, and found rest-frame lags of lag_CCF = 13.53

thin disk exhibits a significant warp ---shown both by gas and young stars---
bending down a few kpc below the formal Galactic plane (b=0). This warp shows
its maximum at 240, in the direction of the Canis Major constellation. In a
series of papers we have traced the detailed structure of this region using
open star clusters, putting particular emphasis on the spiral structure of the
outer disk. We noticed a conspicuous accumulation of young star clusters within
2-3 kpc from the Sun and close to b=0, that we interpreted as the continuation
of the Local (Orion) arm towards the outer disk. While most clusters (and young
stars in their background) follow closely the warp of the disk, our decade-old
survey of the spiral structure of this region led us to identify three
clusters, Haffner~18(1 and 2) and Haffner~19, which remain very close to b=0
and lie at distances (4.5, 8.0, and 6.4 kpc) where most of the material is
already significantly warped. Here we report on a search for clusters that
share the same properties as Haffner~18 and 19, and investigate the possible
reasons for such an unexpected occurrence. We present UBVRI photometry of
5~young clusters, namely NGC~2345, NGC~2374, Trumpler~9, Haffner~20, and
Haffner~21, which also lie close to the formal Galactic plane. With the
exception of Haffner~20, in the background of these clusters we detected young
stars that appear close to b=0, and are located at distances up to 8 kpc from
the Sun, thus deviating significantly from the warp. These populations define a
structure that distributes over almost the entire third Galactic quadrant. We
discuss this structure in the context of a possible thin disk flaring, in full
similarity with the Galactic thick disk.

movements. Most research dealing with the subject of urban mobility focuses on
passenger vehicles, not commercial vehicles hauling freight. However, in many
ways, urban freight transport contributes to congestion, air pollution, noise,
accident and more fuel consumption which raises logistic costs, and hence the
price of products. The main focus of this paper is to propose a new solution
for congestion in order to improve the distribution process of goods in urban
areas and optimize transportation cost, time of delivery, fuel consumption, and
environmental impact, while guaranteeing the safety of goods and passengers. A
novel technique for personalization in itinerary search based on city logistics
ontology and rules is proposed to overcome this problem. The integration of
personalization plays a key role in capturing or inferring the needs of each
stakeholder (user), and then satisfying these needs in a given context. The
proposed approach is implemented to an itinerary search problem for freight
transportation in urban areas to demonstrate its ability in facilitating
intelligent decision support by retrieving the best itinerary that satisfies

Their flavor of spatially independent computation accommodates massive

require massive supercomputing resources. Here we aim to ease that burden. We
study how predictive variance is reduced as local designs are built up for
prediction. We then observe how the exhaustive and discrete nature of an
important search subroutine involved in building such local designs may be
overly conservative. Rather, we suggest that searching the space radially,
i.e., continuously along rays emanating from the predictive location of
interest, is a far thriftier alternative. Our empirical work demonstrates that
ray-based search yields predictors with accuracy comparable to exhaustive

recognition tasks. Most existing techniques, however, perform this coding step
directly in image feature space, where the distributions of the different
classes are typically entangled. In contrast, here, we study the problem of
performing coding in a high-dimensional Hilbert space, where the classes are
expected to be more easily separable. To this end, we introduce a general
coding formulation that englobes the most popular techniques, such as bag of
words, sparse coding and locality-based coding, and show how this formulation
and its special cases can be kernelized. Importantly, we address several
aspects of learning in our general formulation, such as kernel learning,
dictionary learning and supervised kernel coding. Our experimental evaluation
on several visual recognition tasks demonstrates the benefits of performing
coding in Hilbert space, and in particular of jointly learning the kernel, the
dictionary and the classifier.

  Localization","17 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localization is one of the most important factor in wireless sensor networks
as many applications demand position information of sensors. Recently there is
an increasing interest on the use of mobile anchors for localizing sensors.
Most of the works available in the literature either looks into the aspect of
reducing path length of mobile anchor or tries to increase localization
accuracy. The challenge is to design a movement strategy for a mobile anchor
that reduces path length while meeting the requirements of a good range-free
localization technique. In this paper we propose two cost-effective movement
strategies i.e., path planning for a mobile anchor so that localization can be
done using the localization scheme \cite{Lee2009}. In one strategy we use a
hexagonal movement pattern for the mobile anchor to localize all sensors inside
a bounded rectangular region with lesser movement compared to the existing
works in literature. In other strategy we consider a connected network in an
unbounded region where the mobile anchor moves in the hexagonal pattern to
localize the sensors. In this approach, we guarantee localization of all
sensors within $r/2$ error-bound where $r$ is the communication range of the
mobile anchor and sensors. Our simulation results support theoretical results
along with localization accuracy.

the total mechanical energy, is derived for the time-averaged flows, and the
singular point possibly existing in the Navier-Stokes equation is exactly
found. Transition of a laminar flow to turbulence must be implemented via this
singular point. For pressure driven flows, this singular point corresponds to
the inflection point on the velocity profile. It is found that the stability of
a flow depends on the direction of the gradient of the total mechanical energy
for incompressible pressure-driven flow. When this direction is nearer the
normal direction of the streamline, the flow is more unstable. It is further
demonstrated that the existence of the singularity in the time-averaged
Navier-Stokes equation is the necessary and sufficient condition for the
turbulent transition. In turbulent transition, it is observed that the role of
disturbance is to promote the flow approaching to produce this singular point.
These results are the most important part of the energy gradient theory.

  June, 2014 W-PIN + NetEcon workshop in Austin, TX",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper models the temporal adoption dynamics of an abstracted Internet
technology or service, where the instantaneous net value of the service
perceived by each (current or potential) user / customer incorporates three key
features: i) user service affinity heterogeneity, ii) a network externality,
and iii) a subscription cost. Internet technologies and services with network
externalities face a ""chicken and egg"" adoption problem in that the service
requires an established customer base in order to attract new customers. In
this paper we study cost subsidization as a means to ""reach the knee"", at which
point the externality drives rapid service adoption, and thereby change the
equilibrium service fractional adoption level from an initial near-zero level
to a final near-one level (full adoption). We present three simple subsidy
models and evaluate them under two natural performance metrics: i) the duration
required for the subsidized service to reach a given target adoption level, and
ii) the aggregate cost of the subsidy born by the service provide. First, we
present a ""two target adoption subsidy"" (TTAS) that subsidizes the cost so as
to keep the fraction of users with positive net utility at a (constant) target
level until the actual adoption target is reached. Second, we study a special
case of the above where the target ensures all users have positive net utility,
corresponding to a ""quickest adoption"" subsidy (QAS). Third, we introduce an
approximation of QAS, called AQAS, that only requires the service provider
adjust the subsidy level a prescribed number of times. Fourth, we study
equilibria and their stability under uniformly and normally distributed user
service affinities, highlighting the unstable equilibrium in each case as the
natural target adoption level for the provider. Finally, we provide a fictional
case study to illustrate the results.

of nodes. The necessity for high-bandwidth data links has made optical
communication a critical constituent of modern information systems and silicon
the leading platform for creating the necessary optical components. While
silicon is arguably the most extensively studied material in history, one of
its most important attributes, an analysis of its capacity to carry optical
information, has not been reported. The calculation of the information capacity
of silicon is complicated by nonlinear losses, phenomena that emerge in optical
nanowires as a result of the concentration of optical power in a small
geometry. Nonlinear losses are absent in silica glass optical fiber and other
common communication channels. While nonlinear loss in silicon is well known,
noise and fluctuations that arise from it have never been considered. Here we
report sources of fluctuations that arise from two-photon absorption and
free-carrier plasma effects and use these results to investigate the
theoretical limit of the information capacity of silicon. Our results show that
noise and fluctuations due to nonlinear absorption become significant and limit
the information capacity well before nonlinear loss itself becomes dominant. We
present closed-form analytical expressions that quantify the capacity and
provide an intuitive understanding of the underlying interactions. Our results
provide the capacity limit and its origin, and suggest solutions for extending
it via coding and coherent signaling. The amount of information that can be
transmitted by light through silicon is the key element in future information
systems. Results presented here are not only applicable to silicon but also to
other semiconductor optical channels.

electronic properties (by measuring X-ray photoemission spectroscopy) of ZnV2O4
has been investigated by doping Mn and Co on the Zinc site of ZnV2O4. With Mn
doping the V-V distance increases and with Co doping it decreases. The
resistivity and thermoelectric power data indicate that as the V-V distance
decreases the system moves towards Quantum Phase Transition. The transport data
also indicate that the conduction is due to the small polaron hopping. The
chemical pressure shows the non-monotonous behaviour of charge gap and
activation energy. The XPS study also supports the observation that with
decrease of the V-V separation the system moves towards Quantum Phase
Transition. On the other hand when Ti is doped on the V-site of ZnV2O4 the
metal-metal distance decreases and at the same time the TN also increases.

along with the abundances and the density profile. The ionization transition
that happens around maximum sets a strict upper limit on the luminosity. Both
W7 and the WDD3 delayed detonation model are tested. WDD3 is found to provide
marginally better fits. In this model the core of the ejecta is dominated by
stable Fe with a mass of about 0.15 solar masses, as in most SNe Ia. The layer
above is mainly 56Ni up to v~10000 km/s (~0.78 solar masses). A significant
amount of 56Ni (~3 %) is located in the outer layers. A narrow layer between
10000 km/s and ~12000 km/s is dominated by intermediate mass elements (IME),
~0.18 solar masses. This is small for a SN Ia. The high luminosity and the
consequently high ionization, and the high 56Ni abundance at high velocities
explain the peculiar early-time spectra of SN 1991T. The outer part is mainly
of oxygen, ~0.3 solar masses. Carbon lines are never detected, yielding an
upper limit of 0.01 solar masses for C. The abundances obtained with the W7
density model are qualitatively similar to those of the WDD3 model. Different
elements are stratified with moderate mixing, resembling a delayed detonation.

multiple times, Xia et. al. proposed to use a generalized version of Chinese
remainder Theorem (CRT), where the moduli are $M_1, M_2, \cdots, M_k$ which are
not necessarily pairwise coprime. If the errors of the corrupted remainders are
within $\tau=\sds \max_{1\le i\le k} \min_{\stackrel{1\le j\le k}{j\neq i}}
\frac{\gcd(M_i,M_j)}4$, their schemes can be used to construct an approximation
of the solution to the generalized CRT with an error smaller than $\tau$.
Accurately finding the quotients is a critical ingredient in their approach. In
this paper, we shall start with a faithful historical account of the
generalized CRT. We then present two treatments of the problem of solving
generalized CRT with erroneous remainders. The first treatment follows the
route of Wang and Xia to find the quotients, but with a simplified process. The
second treatment considers a simplified model of generalized CRT and takes a
different approach by working on the corrupted remainders directly. This
approach also reveals some useful information about the remainders by
inspecting extreme values of the erroneous remainders modulo $4\tau$. Both of
our treatments produce efficient algorithms with essentially optimal
performance. Finally, this paper constructs a counterexample to prove the
sharpness of the error bound $\tau$.

approach demonstrates interrelations between prototype-based and class-based
component-oriented programming. The component model proposed can be used when
implementing user-defined types in declarative languages for event-driven
applications programming.

IIb supernova (SN) 2011dh in M51 performed at ~1161 rest-frame days after
explosion using the Wide Field Camera 3 and near-UV filters F225W and F336W. A
star-like object is detected in both bands and the photometry indicates it has
negative (F225W - F336W) color. The observed object is compatible with the
companion of the now-vanished yellow supergiant progenitor predicted in
interacting binary models. We consider it unlikely that the SN is undergoing
strong interaction and thus estimate that it makes a small contribution to the
observed flux. The possibilities of having detected an unresolved light echo or
an unrelated object are briefly discussed and judged unlikely. Adopting a
possible range of extinction by dust, we constrain parameters of the proposed
binary system. In particular, the efficiency of mass accretion onto the binary
companion must be below 50%, if no significant extinction is produced by newly
formed dust. Further multiband observations are required in order to confirm
the identification of the object as the companion star. If confirmed, the
companion star would already be dominant in the UV/optical regime, so it would
readily provide a unique opportunity to perform a detailed study of its
properties.

can be built and used according to computers' own criteria, i.e., computable
abstractions. It is analyzed how abstractions can be seen to serve as the
building blocks for the creation of one own's understanding of things, which is
essential in performing intellectual tasks. Thus, abstractional machines are
defined, which following a mechanical process can, based on computable
abstractions, build and use their own understanding of things. Abstractional
machines are illustrated through an example that outlines their application to
the task of natural language processing.

is shown, that the temperatures and pressures implemented in graphite are
sufficient for graphite-to-diamond transition under electron bombardment.

beams, e.g., ESS, FAIR and Project X, and their experiments, the event
generators of the MARS15 code have been recently improved. After thorough
analysis and benchmarking against data, including the newest ones by the HARP
collaboration, both the exclusive and inclusive particle production models were
further developed in the crucial for the above projects - but difficult from a
theoretical standpoint - projectile energy region of 0.7 to 12 GeV. At these
energies, modelling of prompt particle production in nucleon-nucleon and
pion-nucleon inelastic reactions is now based on a combination of phase-space
and isobar models. Other reactions are still modeled in the framework of the
Quark-Gluon String Model. Pion, kaon and strange particle production and
propagation in nuclear media are improved. For the alternative inclusive mode,
experimental data on large-angle (> 20 degrees) pion production in
hadron-nucleus interactions are parameterized in a broad energy range using a
two-source model. It is mixed-and-matched with the native MARS model that
successfully describes low-angle pion production data. Predictions of both new
models are - in most cases - in a good agreement with experimental data
obtained at CERN, JINR, LANL, BNL and KEK.

efficient method to calculate excitonic properties of aggregates composed of
organic chromophores, taking into account the coupling of electronic
transitions to vibrational modes of the chromophores. NMQSD is an open quantum
system approach that incorporates environmental degrees of freedom (the
vibrations in our case) in a stochastic way. We show in this paper that for
linear optical spectra (absorption, circular dichroism) no stochastics is
needed, even for finite temperatures. Thus, the spectra can be obtained by
propagating a single trajectory. To this end we map a finite temperature
environment to the zero temperature case using the so-called thermofield
method. The resulting equations can then be solved efficiently by standard
integrators.
