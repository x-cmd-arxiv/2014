  noise-tolerant quantum key distribution","15 pages, 11 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When implementing O-band quantum key distribution on optical fiber
transmission lines carrying C-band data traffic, noise photons that arise from
spontaneous Raman scattering or insufficient filtering of the classical data
channels could cause the quantum bit-error rate to exceed the security
threshold. In this case, a photon heralding scheme may be used to reject the
uncorrelated noise photons in order to restore the quantum bit-error rate to a
low level. However, the secure key rate would suffer unless one uses a heralded
photon source with sufficiently high heralding rate and heralding efficiency.
In this work we demonstrate a heralded photon source that has a heralding
efficiency that is as high as 74.5%. One disadvantage of a typical heralded
photon source is that the long deadtime of the heralding detector results in a
significant drop in the heralding rate. To counter this problem, we propose a
passively spatial-multiplexed configuration at the heralding arm. Using two
heralding detectors in this configuration, we obtain an increase in the
heralding rate by 37% and a corresponding increase in the heralded photon
detection rate by 16%. We transmitted the O-band photons over 10 km of noisy
optical fiber to observe the relation between quantum bit-error rate and
noise-degraded second-order correlation function of the transmitted photons.
The effects of afterpulsing when we shorten the deadtime of the heralding
detectors are also observed and discussed.

factor in the evolution of an asteroid's rotation state. It is complementary to
normal YORP, or NYORP, which used to be considered previously. While NYORP is
produced by non-symmetry in the large-scale geometry of an asteroid, TYORP is
due to heat conductivity in stones on the surface of the asteroid. Yet to date
TYORP has been studied only in a simplified 1-dimensional model, substituting
stones by high long walls.
  This article for the first time considers TYORP in a realistic 3-dimensional
model, also including shadowing and self-illumination effects via ray tracing.
TYORP is simulated for spherical stones lying on regolith. The model includes
only 5 free parameters, and the dependence of the TYORP on each of them is
studied. The TYORP torque appears to be smaller than previous estimates from
1-dimensional model, but still comparable to the NYORP torques.
  These results can be used to estimate TYORP of different asteroids, and also
as a basis for more sophisticated models of TYORP.

moment of inertia $\bar{I}$ and quadrupole moment $\bar{Q}$ for scalarized

is preserved in this regime and what are the deviations from general
relativity. Our results show that the $\bar{I}-\bar{Q}$ relation is nearly EOS
independent for scalarized rapidly rotating stars, but the differences with
pure Einstein's theory increase compared to the slowly rotating case. In
general, smaller negative values of the scalar field coupling parameters
$\beta$ lead to larger deviations, but these deviations are below the expected
accuracy of the future astrophysical observations if one considers values of
$\beta$ in agreement with the current observational constraint. An important
remark is that although the normalized $\bar{I}-\bar{Q}$ relation is quite
similar for scalar-tensor theories and general relativity, the unnormalized
moment of inertia and quadrupole moment can be very different in the two
theories. This demonstrates that although the $\bar{I}-\bar{Q}$ relations are
potentially very useful for some purposes, they might not serve us well when
trying to distinguish between different theories of gravity.

with NuSTAR and archival XMM-Newton data do not fit to a conventional
two-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectral
hardening above ~5 keV. We find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) a
blackbody (kT1 ~ 42 eV) with a broken power-law (Gamma1 ~ 2.0, Gamma2 ~ 1.4 and
Ebreak ~ 3.4 keV), and (2) two blackbody components (kT1 ~ 44 eV and kT2 ~ 195

of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the UV
data, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,
requiring a spectral flattening at E ~ 0.01 - 1 keV. While strong phase
variation of the power-law index is present below ~5 keV, our phase-resolved
spectroscopy with NuSTAR indicates that another hard non-thermal component with
Gamma ~ 1.3 emerges above ~5 keV. The spectral hardening in non-thermal X-ray

Numerical calculations of rigidly rotating neutron stars are performed using
the RNS code in the framework of general relativity by solving the Einstein
equations for stationary axis-symmetric spacetime. The crust structure of
compact stars is found to be a key factor to determine the maximum value of the
spin parameter $j_{\rm max}$. For the stars with inclusion of the crust,
$j_{\rm max}\sim 0.7$ is sustained for various kinds of compact stars with
$M>0.5 M_{\odot}$, and is found to be insensitive to the mass of star and
selected equations of state. For the traditional neutron stars, hyperonic
neutron stars and hybrid stars without crust structure, the value $j_{\rm max}$
lies in the range of $[0.7, 1.0]$. Thus, not $j>0.7$ but $j>1$ could be treated

other kinds of compact stars. Furthermore, a universal formula

provably holds for gapped one dimensional systems [2] and it was believed to be
violated by at most a factor of $\log\left(n\right)$ in physically reasonable
models such as critical systems.
  In this paper, we generalize the spin$-1$ model of Bravyi et al [3] to all
integer spin-$s$ chains, whereby we introduce a class of exactly solvable
models that are physical and exhibit signatures of criticality, yet violate the
area law by a power law. The proposed Hamiltonian is local and translationally
invariant in the bulk. We prove that it is frustration free and has a unique
ground state. Moreover, we prove that the energy gap scales as $n^{-c}$, where
using the theory of Brownian excursions, we prove $c\ge2$. This rules out the
possibility of these models being described by a conformal field theory. We
analytically show that the Schmidt rank grows exponentially with $n$ and that
the half-chain entanglement entropy to the leading order scales as $\sqrt{n}$

computing the exact posterior probabilities for all $n(n-1)$ edges with optimal
parallel space efficiency and nearly optimal parallel time efficiency. That is,
if $p=2^k$ processors are used, the run-time reduces to
$O(5(d+1)n2^{n-k}+k(n-k)^d)$ and the space usage becomes $O(n2^{n-k})$ per

an electron spin in a Si quantum dot. By considering both spin-valley and

phonon noise at low magnetic fields, which fits well with recent experiments.

applications ranging from semiconducting devices and molecular junctions to

treat transport using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and
non-equilibrium Green's functions. This is a static formalism, with dynamic
response properties accommodated only through complicated extensions. To
circumvent this limitation, the carrier density may be propagated using
real-time time-dependent DFT (RT-TDDFT), with boundary conditions corresponding
to an open quantum system. Complex absorbing potentials can emulate outgoing
particles at the simulation boundary, although these do not account for
introduction of charge density. It is demonstrated that the desired positive
particle flux is afforded by a class of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric generating
potentials that are characterized by anisotropic transmission resonances. These
potentials add density every time a particle traverses the cell boundary, and
may be used to engineer a continuous pulse train for incident packets. This is
a first step toward developing a complete transport formalism unique to
RT-TDDFT.

molecular simulations, especially in biology and chemistry where hydration
effects are critical. Yet, despite several decades of effort, these models are
still far from perfect. Presented here is an alternative approach to
constructing point charge water models - currently, the most commonly used
type. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry
constraints on the model other than symmetry. Instead, we optimize the
distribution of point charges to best describe the ""electrostatics"" of the
water molecule, which is key to many unusual properties of liquid water. The
search for the optimal charge distribution is performed in 2D parameter space
of key lowest multipole moments of the model, to find best fit to a small set
of bulk water properties at room temperature. A virtually exhaustive search is
enabled via analytical equations that relate the charge distribution to the
multipole moments. The resulting ""optimal"" 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model

more accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to
experiment is 0.76%. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of
temperatures, well outside the ambient conditions at which the fit to
experiment was performed. The improvements in the proposed water model extend
beyond bulk properties: compared to the common rigid models, predicted
hydration free energies of small molecules in OPC water are uniformly closer to

extract fine-grained structure from coarse-grained measurements. Here we are
interested in a popular mathematical abstraction of this problem that has been
widely studied in the statistics, signal processing and machine learning
communities. We exactly resolve the threshold at which noisy super-resolution
is possible. In particular, we establish a sharp phase transition for the
relationship between the cutoff frequency ($m$) and the separation ($\Delta$).
If $m > 1/\Delta + 1$, our estimator converges to the true values at an inverse
polynomial rate in terms of the magnitude of the noise. And when $m <
(1-\epsilon) /\Delta$ no estimator can distinguish between a particular pair of
$\Delta$-separated signals even if the magnitude of the noise is exponentially
small.
  Our results involve making novel connections between {\em extremal functions}
and the spectral properties of Vandermonde matrices. We establish a sharp phase
transition for their condition number which in turn allows us to give the first
noise tolerance bounds for the matrix pencil method. Moreover we show that our
methods can be interpreted as giving preconditioners for Vandermonde matrices,
and we use this observation to design faster algorithms for super-resolution.
We believe that these ideas may have other applications in designing faster
algorithms for other basic tasks in signal processing.

instances in which q cannot be treated as a constant.
  We present two distinct approaches for determining q depending on the form of
the equations of constraint for the particular system. In the first case the
equations of constraint for an operator O can be written as $Tr[F^{q}O]=C$,
where C may be an explicit function of the distribution function, F. In this
case one can solve an equivalent MAXENT problem which yields q as a function of
the corresponding Lagrange Multiplier. As an illustration the exact solutions
to the static Generalized Fokker-Planck Equation (GFP) are obtained from
MAXENT. As in the case where C is a constant if q is treated as a variable
within the MAXENT framework, the entropic measure is maximized for all values

photo-heating as a function of the spectral slope {\alpha}, assuming a
power-law spectrum in the energy range of 13.6 eV--100 keV. While Compton
heating is dominant only close to the black hole, it can reduce the accretion
rate to 0.1 % ($l \propto \dot{m}^2$ model)--0.01 % ($l \propto \dot{m}$ model)
of the Bondi accretion rate when the BH radiation is hard ({\alpha} ~ 1), where
$l$ and $\dot{m}$ are the luminosity and accretion rate normalised by Eddington
rates, respectively. The oscillatory behaviour otherwise typically seen in
simulations with {\alpha} > 1, become suppressed when {\alpha} ~ 1 only for the
$l \propto \dot{m}$ model. The relative importance of the Compton heating over
photo-heating decreases and the oscillatory behaviour becomes stronger as the
spectrum softens. When the spectrum is soft ({\alpha} > 1.5), photo-heating
prevails regardless of models making the effect of Compton heating negligible.
On the scale of the ionization front, where the gas supply into the Str\""omgren
sphere from large scale is regulated, photo-heating dominates. Our simulations
show consistent results with the advection-dominated accretion flow ($l \propto

zero-point of the bright end of the period-luminosity relation. But, at a
distance of about 2 kpc, RS Pup is too far away for measuring a direct
trigonometric parallax with a precision of a few percent with existing
instrumentation. RS Pup is unique in being surrounded by a reflection nebula,
whose brightness varies as pulses of light from the Cepheid propagate outwards.
We present new polarimetric imaging of the nebula obtained with HST/ACS. The
derived map of the degree of linear polarization pL allows us to reconstruct
the three-dimensional structure of the dust distribution. To retrieve the
scattering angle from the pL value, we consider two different polarization
models, one based on a Milky Way dust mixture and one assuming Rayleigh
scattering. Considering the derived dust distribution in the nebula, we adjust
a model of the phase lag of the photometric variations over selected nebular
features to retrieve the distance of RS Pup. We obtain a distance of 1910 +/-
80 pc (4.2%), corresponding to a parallax of 0.524 +/- 0.022 mas. The agreement
between the two polarization models we considered is good, but the final
uncertainty is dominated by systematics in the adopted model parameters. The
distance we obtain is consistent with existing measurements from the
literature, but light echoes provide a distance estimate that is not subject to
the same systematic uncertainties as other estimators (e.g. the Baade-Wesselink
technique). RS Pup therefore provides an important fiducial for the calibration

companion paper, we first review our argument and discuss it in more detail. We
then present actual black hole solutions in the simplest case of a theory with
the linear scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We generate exact solutions
numerically for a wide range of values of the coupling and also construct
analytic solutions perturbatively in the small coupling limit. Comparison of
the two types of solutions indicates that non-linear effects that are not
captured by the perturbative solution lead to a finite area, as opposed to a
central, singularity. Remarkably, black holes have a minimum size, controlled

provide a satisfactory fit to the XMM data. We estimate the expected flux of
the K XVIII lines and find that the measured line flux falls squarely within
the predicted range based on the brightness of other well-measured lines in the
energy range of interest and on detailed multi-temperature plasma models. We
then re-assess the evidence for excess emission from clusters of galaxies,
allowing for systematic uncertainty in the expected flux from known plasma
lines and additional uncertainty due to potential variation in the abundances
of different elements. We find that no conclusive excess line emission can be
advocated when considering systematic uncertainties in Perseus or in other
clusters. We also re-analyze the XMM data for M~31 and find no statistically
significant line emission near 3.5 keV to a level greater than one sigma.
Finally, we analyze the Tycho supernova remnant, which shows similar plasma
features to the sources above, but does not host any significant dark matter.
We detect a 3.55 keV line from Tycho, which points to possible systematic
effects in the flux determination of weak lines, or to relative elemental
abundances vastly different from theoretical expectations.

Such residual tunneling shortens the period and damps the oscillations, the
latter being visible in the Fermi-Bose experiment.

events. The color curves differ primarily by an offset, with the NUV-blue u-
color curves bluer than the NUV-red curves by 0.4 mag. For a sample of 23 low-z
SNe~Ia observed with Swift, the NUV-red group dominates by a ratio of 2:1. We
compare rest-frame UV/optical spectrophotometry of intermediate and high-z SNe
Ia with UVOT photometry and HST spectrophotometry of low-z SNe Ia, finding that
the same two color groups exist at higher-z, but with the NUV-blue events as
the dominant group. Within each red/blue group, we do not detect any offset in
color for different redshifts, providing insight into how SN~Ia UV emission
evolves with redshift. Through spectral comparisons of SNe~Ia with similar peak
widths and phase, we explore the wavelength range that produces the UV/OPT
color differences. We show that the ejecta velocity of NUV-red SNe is larger
than that of NUV-blue objects by roughly 12% on average. This velocity
difference can explain some of the UV/optical color difference, but differences
in the strengths of spectral features seen in meanspectra require additional
explanation. Because of the different b-v colors for these groups, NUV-red SNe
will have their extinction underestimated using common techniques. This, in
turn, leads to under-estimation of the optical luminosity of the NUV-blue
SNe~Ia, in particular, for the high-redshift cosmological sample. Not
accounting for this effect should thus produce a distance bias that increases

entries, called matrix completion, has gathered a lot of attention in the
recent years. Although the problem under the standard low rank assumption is
NP-hard, Cand\`es and Recht showed that it can be exactly relaxed if the number
of observed entries is sufficiently large. In this work, we introduce a novel
matrix completion model that makes use of proximity information about rows and
columns by assuming they form communities. This assumption makes sense in
several real-world problems like in recommender systems, where there are
communities of people sharing preferences, while products form clusters that
receive similar ratings. Our main goal is thus to find a low-rank solution that
is structured by the proximities of rows and columns encoded by graphs. We
borrow ideas from manifold learning to constrain our solution to be smooth on
these graphs, in order to implicitly force row and column proximities. Our
matrix recovery model is formulated as a convex non-smooth optimization
problem, for which a well-posed iterative scheme is provided. We study and
evaluate the proposed matrix completion on synthetic and real data, showing
that the proposed structured low-rank recovery model outperforms the standard
matrix completion model in many situations.

rate, when radiation's push balances gravity's pull. However, even exponential
growth at the Eddington-limited e-folding time t_E ~ few x 0.01 billion years,
is too slow to grow stellar-mass BH seeds into the supermassive luminous
quasars that are observed when the universe is 1 billion years old. We propose
a dynamical mechanism that can trigger supra-exponential accretion in the early
universe, when a BH seed is trapped in a star cluster fed by the ubiquitous
dense cold gas flows. The high gas opacity traps the accretion radiation, while
the low-mass BH's random motions suppress the formation of a slowly-draining
accretion disk. Supra-exponential growth can thus explain the puzzling
emergence of supermassive BHs that power luminous quasars so soon after the Big
Bang.

magnetic resonance angiography with limited spatial resolution and long

near-infrared regions (400-900 nm) is an alternative but currently requires
craniotomy, cranial windows and skull thinning techniques, and the penetration
depth is limited to 1-2 mm due to light scattering. Here, we report
through-scalp and through-skull fluorescence imaging of mouse cerebral
vasculature without craniotomy utilizing the intrinsic photoluminescence of
single-walled carbon nanotubes in the 1.3-1.4 micrometre near-infrared window.
Reduced photon scattering in this spectral region allows fluorescence imaging
reaching a depth of >2 mm in mouse brain with sub-10 micrometre resolution. An
imaging rate of ~5.3 frames/s allows for dynamic recording of blood perfusion
in the cerebral vessels with sufficient temporal resolution, providing
real-time assessment of blood flow anomaly in a mouse middle cerebral artery

fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates and geometric locality of
stabilizer codes. They consider locality-preserving operations which are
implemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus
fault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they shown that, for local
stabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are
restricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford
hierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions
and applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we
present a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we
prove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a
locality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a
macroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a
D-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th
level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with
non-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and
Terhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial
transversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such,
no family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of
the Clifford hierarchy may exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer
and subsystem codes, and is not restricted to geometrically-local codes. Fourth
we extend the result of Bravyi and K\""onig to subsystem codes. A technical
difficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not
apply to subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming the presence of
error threshold in a subsystem code, and the same conclusion as Bravyi-K\""onig
is recovered.

yields a representation of quantum spin and magnetic moments based on classical
nonrelativistic spinning top models, using Euler angle coordinates. The models
allow half-odd-integer spin and predict supraluminal speeds only for electrons
and other leptons, which must be treated relativistically. The spin operators
in the space-fixed frame satisfy the usual commutation rules, while those in
the rotating body-fixed frame satisfy ""left-handed"" rules. The commutation
rules are independent of the structure of the top, so all nonrelativistic
rigidly rotating objects must have integer or odd-half-integer spin. Physical
boundary conditions restrict all mixed spin states to involve only
half-odd-integer or only integer spin eigenstates. For spin 1/2, the theory
automatically yields a modified Pauli-Schr\""odinger equation. The Hamiltonian

the square of the magmetic field, as well as an interaction term having the
usual form in spherically symmetric and some cylindrically symmetric models,

lower-mass stars). Optical spectroscopy also identifies gas in about 2% of
systems but with no clear trend between the presence of dust and gas. Spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling of 18 sources with detections at optical
wavelengths through MIPS 24 $\mu m$ reveals a diverse set of disk evolutionary
states, including a high fraction of transitional disks, although similar data
for all disk-bearing members would provide better constraints. We combine our
results with those for other young clusters to study the global evolution of
dust/gas disks. For nominal cluster ages, the e-folding times ($\tau_{o}$) for
the frequency of warm dust and gas are 2.75 Myr and 1.75 Myr respectively.
Assuming a revised set of ages for some clusters (e.g. Bell et al. 2013), these

significantly longer typical protoplanetary disk lifetime. The transitional
disk duration, averaged over multiple evolutionary pathways, is $\sim$ 1 Myr.

study thermodynamics of the ideal gas in the polymer framework and show that

partition the problem for better data locality; (3) Ordering the MPI ranks in a
way that directs some of the traffic into faster communication channels; (4)
Using efficient peer-to-peer communication between Xeon Phi coprocessors based
on the InfiniBand fabric.
  With tuning, the application has 90% percent efficiency of parallel scaling
up to 8 Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors in 2 compute nodes. For larger problems,
scalability is even better, because of the greater computation to communication
ratio. However, problems of that size do not fit in the memory of one
coprocessor. The performance of the solver on one Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor
7120P exceeds the performance on a dual-socket Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 CPU by a
factor of 1.6x. In a 2-node cluster with 4 coprocessors per compute node, the
MIC architecture yields 5.8x more performance than the CPUs. Only one line of
legacy Fortran code had to be changed in order to achieve the reported
performance on the MIC architecture (not counting changes to the command-line
interface). The methodology discussed in this paper is directly applicable to
other bandwidth-bound stencil algorithms utilizing a hybrid OpenMP+MPI

describes the distribution of the power output in a wind-farm. The model
couples the traditional, industry-standard wake model approach with a
""top-down"" model for the overall wind-farm boundary layer structure. This wake
model captures the effect of turbine positioning, while the ""top-down"" portion
of the model adds the interactions between the wind-turbine wakes and the
atmospheric boundary layer. Each portion of the model requires specification of
a parameter that is not known a-priori. For the wake model, the wake expansion
coefficient is required, while the ""top-down"" model requires an effective
spanwise turbine spacing within which the model's momentum balance is relevant.
The wake expansion coefficient is obtained by matching the predicted mean
velocity at the turbine from both approaches, while the effective spanwise
turbine spacing depends on turbine positioning and thus can be determined from
the wake model. Coupling of the constitutive components of the CWBL model is
achieved by iterating these parameters until convergence is reached. We
illustrate the performance of the model by applying it to both developing
wind-farms including entrance effects and to fully developed (deep-array)
conditions. Comparisons of the CWBL model predictions with results from a suite
of large eddy simulations (LES) shows that the model closely represents the
results obtained in these high-fidelity numerical simulations. A comparison
with measured power degradation at the Horns Rev and Nysted wind-farms shows
that the model can also be successfully applied to real wind-farms.

with a test massless Dirac field, i.e. a ""neutrino field"". Evaluating the flux
integrals imposed by the energy momentum tensor for fermionic fields and the
Killing vectors of the space-time, we prove that this interaction can indeed
destroy the event horizon of the black hole and convert it to a naked
singularity. The classical process leads to a more generic violation of cosmic
censorship conjecture compared to quantum tunnelling processes which occur with
a low probability. The range of frequencies of the test neutrino field that can
be used to destroy the black hole turns out to be the superradiant range for
bosonic fields. We comment on back reaction and quantum effects. We argue that
the destruction of black holes by neutrino fields cannot be fixed by self-force
effects unlike similar attempts involving test bodies and bosonic fields.

analyses over thirty years ago left questions about the temperature and density
profiles unanswered. We have reanalyzed all six of the UVS occultations (three
solar and three stellar) to provide an up-to-date, pre-Cassini view of Saturn's
upper atmosphere. From the Voyager UVS data, we have determined vertical
profiles for H2, H, CH4, C2H2 , C2H4, and C2H6, as well as temperature. Our
analysis also provides explanations for the two different thermospheric

eddy diffusion coefficient as a function of latitude and/or time in Saturn's

of periodic (every 6 hours) all-sky scans from the radiometer. These data
provide unique insight into the spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric
conditions relevant for astronomical observations, particularly in the
infrared. We find the PWV over Paranal to be remarkably homogeneous across the
sky down to 27.5{\deg} elevation with a median variation of 0.32 mm (peak to
valley) or 0.07 mm (rms). The homogeneity is a function of the absolute PWV but
the relative variation is fairly constant at 10-15% (peak to valley) and 3%
(rms). Such variations will not be a significant issue for analysis of
astronomical data. Users at ESO can specify PWV - measured at zenith - as an
ambient constraint in service mode to enable, for instance, very demanding
observations in the infrared that can only be conducted during periods of very
good atmospheric transmission and hence low PWV. We conclude that in general it

give rise to an excitation spectrum of roton-maxon character. Using Bragg
spectroscopy we study a SO coupled Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms,
and show that the excitation spectrum in a ""magnetized"" phase clearly possesses
a two-branch and roton-maxon structure. As Raman coupling strength $\Omega$ is
decreased, a roton-mode softening is observed, as a precursor of the phase
transition to a stripe phase that spontaneously breaks spatially translational
symmetry. The measured roton gaps agree well with theoretical calculations.
Further, we determine sound velocities both in the magnetized and the
non-magnetized phase, and a phonon-mode softening is observed around the phase
transition in between. The validity of the $f$-sum rule is examined.

together with their mode shapes), and the global modes' receptivity to species
injection, sensitivity to base-state perturbations, and structural sensitivity
to advective-velocity perturbations. We then compare these with the Rayleigh
index. The receptivity analysis shows the regions of the flame where open-loop
injection of fuel or oxidizer will have most influence on the thermo-acoustic
oscillation. We find that the flame is most receptive at its tip. The
base-state sensitivity analysis shows the influence of each parameter on the
frequency/growth rate. We find that perturbations to the stoichiometric mixture
fraction, the fuel slot width, and the heat-release parameter have most
influence, while perturbations to the P\'eclet number have least influence.
These sensitivities oscillate: e.g. positive perturbations to the fuel slot
width either stabilizes or destabilizes the system, depending on the operating
point. This analysis reveals that, as expected from a simple model, the phase
delay between velocity and heat-release fluctuations is the key parameter in
determining the sensitivities. It also reveals that this thermo-acoustic system
is exceedingly sensitive to changes in the base state. The
structural-sensitivity analysis shows the influence of perturbations to the
advective flame velocity. The regions of highest sensitivity are around the
stoichiometric line close to the inlet, showing where velocity models need to

The experiment was carried out at the TallBo dewar facility at Fermilab using
prototype light guide detectors and electronics developed for the Deep
Underground Neutrino Experiment. Two models are presented for the time
structure of the scintillation light, a phenomenological model and a composite
model. Both models find $\tau_{\text{T}} = 1.52$ $\mu$s for the decay time
constant of the Ar$_2^*$ triplet state. These models also show that the
identification of the ""early"" light fraction in the phenomenological model,
$F_{\text{E}}\approx 25\%$ of the signal, with the total light from singlet
decays is an underestimate. The total fraction of singlet light is
$F_{\text{S}} \approx 36\%$, where the increase over $F_{\text{E}}$ is from
singlet light emitted by the wavelength shifter through processes with long
decay constants. The models were further used to compute the experimental
particle identification parameter $F_{\text{prompt}}$, the fraction of light
coming in a short time window after the trigger compared with the light in the
total recorded waveform. The models reproduce quite well the typical
experimental value $\sim0.3$ found by dark matter and double $\beta$-decay
experiments, which suggests this parameter provides a robust metric for
discriminating electrons and muons from more heavily ionizing particles.

multilayer thin film systems rolled up into compact quasi-one-dimensional

conductances depend strongly on the direction of an externally applied magnetic
field. This phenomenon originates from the curved open geometry of rolled-up
nanotubes, which leads to a tunability of the number of quasi-one-dimensional
magnetic subbands crossing the Fermi energy. The experimental significance of
this phenomenon is illustrated by a sizable anisotropy that scales with the
inverse of the winding number, and persists up to a critical temperature that
can be strongly enhanced by increasing the strength of the external magnetic
field or the characteristic radius of curvature, and can reach room
temperature.

It is known that accretion plays a fundamental role in active galactic nuclei
and in the evolution of black holes. Accretion of fundamental fields is often
related to the study of absorption cross section. Basically all black holes for
which absorption of fields has been studied so far present singularities.
However, even within general relativity, it is possible to construct regular
black holes: objects with event horizons but without singularities. Many
physically motivated regular black hole solutions have been proposed in the
past years, demanding the understanding of their absorption properties. We
study the absorption of planar massless scalar waves by Bardeen regular black
holes. We compare the absorption cross section of Bardeen and
Reissner--Nordstr\""om black holes, showing that the former always have a bigger
absorption cross section for fixed values of the field frequency and of the
normalized black hole charge. We also show that it is possible for a Bardeen
black hole to have the same high-frequency absorption cross section of a

mid-to-high-frequency regimes, regular black holes can have compatible
properties with black holes with singularities, as far as absorption is

kinematics can be used to understand the underlying mass distribution. However,
the inferred mass distribution depends sensitively upon assumptions made on the
density and the velocity anisotropy profiles of the tracers. Also, there is a
degeneracy between the parameters of the halo and that of the disk or bulge.
Here, we decompose the Galaxy into bulge, disk and dark matter halo and then
model the kinematic data of the halo BHB and K-giants from the SEGUE.
Additionally, we use the gas terminal velocity curve and the Sgr A$^*$ proper
motion. With $R_\odot = 8.5$kpc, our study reveals that the density of the
stellar halo has a break at $17.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ kpc, and an exponential
cut-off in the outer parts starting at $97.7^{+15.6}_{-15.8}$kpc. Also, we find
the velocity anisotropy is radially biased with $\beta_s= 0.4\pm{0.2}$ in the
outer halo. We measure halo virial mass $M_{\text{vir}} = 0.80^{+0.31}_{-0.16}
\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, concentration $c=21.1^{+14.8}_{-8.3}$, disk mass of

$4.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ kpc and bulge mass of $0.91^{+0.31}_{-0.38} \times 10^{10}
M_{\odot}$. The mass of halo is found to be small and this has important
consequences. The giant stars reveal that the outermost halo stars have low
velocity dispersion interestingly suggesting a truncation of the stellar halo
density rather than a small overall mass of the Galaxy. Our estimates of local
escape velocity $v_{\rm esc} = 550.9^{+32.4}_{-22.1}$ kms$^{-1}$ and dark
matter density $\rho^{\rm DM}_{\odot} = 0.0088^{+0.0024}_{-0.0018} M_{\odot}

synchronous or asynchronous) and also the introduction of extortion strategy
affect the collective outcome of the games. By means of Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations as well as dynamical cluster techniques, we find that the
involvement of extortioners facilitates the boom of cooperators in the
population (and whom can always dominate the population if the temptation to
defect is not too large) for both synchronous and asynchronous strategy
updating, in stark contrast to the otherwise case, where cooperation is
promoted for intermediate aspiration level with synchronous strategy updating,
but is remarkably inhibited if the strategy updating is implemented
asynchronously. We explain the results by configurational analysis and find
that the presence of extortion leads to the checkerboard-like ordering of
cooperators and extortioners, which enable cooperators to prevail in the
population with both strategy updating manners. Moreover, extortion itself is
evolutionary stable, and therefore acts as the incubator for the evolution of
cooperation.

exactly the values of $\alpha$ for which this holds as those exceeding the

through the non-local Jordan-Wigner transformation, following an idea of Hamza,

anomalous many-body transport.

interaction with the convective flows. Its local structure has a strong
influence on the profiles of spectral lines not only by virtue of the Zeeman
effect, but also through the modification of the thermodynamical structure
(e.g. line weakening in hot small-scale magnetic structures). Many stars harbor
surface magnetic fields comparable to or larger than the Sun at solar maximum.
Therefore, a strong influence of the field on the surface convection and on
spectral line profiles can be expected. We carried out 3D local-box MHD
simulations of unipolar magnetized regions (average fields of 20, 100, and
500G) with parameters corresponding to six main-sequence stars (spectral types
F3V to M2V). The influence of the magnetic field on the convection and the
local thermodynamical structure were analyzed in detail. For three spectral
lines, we determined the impact of the magnetic field on the disc-integrated
Stokes-I profiles. Line weakening has in many cases a stronger impact on the
spectral line profiles than the Zeeman effect. Moreover, for some stars, the
correlation between the magnetic field and the vertical velocity strongly
influences the line shapes. These effects can impair determinations of stellar
magnetic fields since currently used methods neglect the local structure of the
magnetic field and its interaction with the convective flows. The MHD
simulations presented can be used to quantify these effects and thus help to
improve magnetic field measurements of cool main-sequence stars.

ordinary mixed graphs are fundamentally insufficiently rich to capture the

structure that directly reflects the complex dynamics introduced by the
precession of the orbital plane, which poses a real challenge to the
development of generic waveform models. Recent progress in modelling these
signals relies on an approximate decoupling between the non-precessing secular
inspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in
general on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts
as well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex.
Here we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced
set of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single \emph{effective
precession spin} parameter, $\chi_p$, which is defined from the spin components
that lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral.
We test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral
configurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding
non-precessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin
components (anti-)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective
precession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an
overwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession
dynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent
configurations. Our results suggest that in the comparable-mass regime waveform
models with only three spin parameters faithfully represent generic waveforms,
which has practical implications for the prospects of GW searches, parameter
estimation and the numerical exploration of the precessing-binary parameter
space.

transferred to baryons via decays, generating a baryon asymmetry in our
Universe. We explore this idea in detail for a complex inflaton governed by an
observationally consistent -""flatter than quadratic""- potential with a weakly
broken global U(1) symmetry. We find that most of the inflaton asymmetry is
locked in non-topological soliton like configurations (oscillons) produced
copiously at the end of inflation. These solitons eventually decay into baryons
and generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry for a range of model
parameters. Through a combination of three dimensional lattice simulations and
a detailed linearized analysis, we show how the inflaton asymmetry depends on
the fragmentation, the magnitude of the symmetry breaking term and initial
conditions at the end of inflation. We discuss the final decay into baryons,

early phases of the evolution, when that shock is moderately relativistic. Our
models do not produce a classical afterglow because the quick deceleration of
the jet results primarily from the mass entrainment in the beam, and not from
the process of plowing mass from the external medium in front of the GRB
ejecta. The contribution of the reverse shock is of the same magnitude than
that of the forward shock during the first 80 min after the GRB. Later, it
quickly fades because the jet/environment interaction chocks the
ultrarelativistic jet beam and effectively dumps the reverse shock. In
agreement with observations, we obtain rather flat light curves during the
first 2 d after the GRB, and a spectral evolution consistent with the observed
reddening of the system.

Given an infinite measure preserving action $T$ of $\Gamma$ and a ""direction""
in $G$ (i.e. an element $\theta$ of the projective space $P(\goth g)$ of the
Lie algebra $\goth g$ of $G$), some notions of recurrence and rigidity for $T$
along $\theta$ are introduced. It is shown that the set of recurrent directions
$\Cal R(T)$ and the set of rigid directions for $T$ are both $G_\delta$. In the
case where $G=\Bbb R^d$ and $\Gamma=\Bbb Z^d$, we prove that (a) for each
$G_\delta$-subset $\Delta$ of $P(\goth g)$ and a countable subset
$D\subset\Delta$, there is a rank-one action $T$ such that $D\subset\Cal
R(T)\subset\Delta$ and (b) $\Cal R(T)=P(\goth g)$ for a generic infinite
measure preserving action $T$ of $\Gamma$. This answers partly a question from
a recent paper by A.~Johnson and A.~{\c S}ahin. Some applications to the
directional entropy of Poisson actions are discussed. In the case where $G$ is
the Heisenberg group $H_3(\Bbb R)$ and $\Gamma=H_3(\Bbb Z)$, a rank-one
$\Gamma$-action $T$ is constructed for which $\Cal R(T)$ is not invariant under

hyper luminous X-ray source ESO 243-49 HLX-1, currently the best intermediate
mass black hole (IMBH) candidate, showed an outburst in 2013 delayed by more
than a month. In Lasota et al. (2011), we proposed that the X-ray lightcurve is
the result of enhanced mass transfer episodes at periapsis from a donor star
orbiting the IMBH in a highly eccentric orbit. In this scenario, the delay can
be explained only if the orbital parameters can change suddenly from orbit to
orbit. To investigate this, we ran Newtonian smooth particle hydrodynamical
simulations starting with an incoming donor approaching an IMBH on a parabolic
orbit. We survey a large parameter space by varying the star-to-BH mass ratio
($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$) and the periapsis separation $r_p$ from 2.2 to $2.7~r_t$
with $r_t$, the tidal radius. To model the donor, we choose several polytropes
($\Gamma = 5/2,~n=3/2$; $\Gamma=3/2,~n=2$; $\Gamma=5/3,~n=2$ & $n=3$).
  Once the system is formed, the orbital period decreases until reaching a
minimum. Then, the period tends to increase over several periapsis passages due
to tidal effects and increasing mass transfer, leading ultimately to the
ejection of the donor. The development of stochastic fluctuations inside the
donor could lead to sudden changes in the orbital period from orbit to orbit
with the appropriate order of magnitude of what has been observed for HLX-1.
Given the constraints on the BH mass ($M_{\rm BH} > 10^4~M_\odot$) and assuming
that HLX-1 is currently near a minimum in period of $\sim 1$ yr, the donor has
to be a white dwarf or a stripped giant core. We predict that if HLX-1 is
indeed emerging from a minimum in orbital period, then the period would
generally increase with each passage, although substantial stochastic
fluctuations can be superposed on this trend.

Using the cosmic-ray diffusion formalism of Protheroe, et al. (2008), we
examine how cosmic rays diffuse into clouds exhibiting different density
structures, including a smoothed step-function, as well as Gaussian and
inverse-$r$ density distributions, which are well known to trace the structure
of star-forming regions. These density distributions were modelled as an
approximation to the Galactic centre cloud G0.216+0.016, a recently-discovered
massive dust clump that exhibits limited signs of massive star formation and
thus may be the best region in the Galaxy to observe synchrotron emission from
secondary electrons and positrons. Examination of the resulting synchrotron
emission, produced by the interaction of cosmic ray protons interacting with
ambient molecular matter producing secondary electrons and positrons reveals
that, due to projection effects, limb-brightened morphology results in all
cases. However, we find that the Gaussian and inverse-$r$ density distributions
show much broader flux density distributions than step-function distributions.
Significantly, some of the compact (compared to the $2.2''$ resolution, 5.3 GHz
JVLA observations) sources show non-thermal emission, which may potentially be
explained by the density structure and the lack of diffusion of cosmic rays
into the cloud. We find that we can match the 5.3 and 20 GHz flux densities of
the non-thermal source JVLA~1 and 6 from Rodr\'{\i}guez & Zapata (2014) with a
local cosmic ray flux density, a diffusion coefficient suppression factor of
$\chi=0.1-0.01$ for a coefficient of $3\times10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, and a

objects between oxygen-rich M-type stars and carbon-rich C-type stars. As such,
their circumstellar compositions of gas and dust are thought to be sensitive to
their precise C/O ratio, and it is therefore of particular interest to examine
their circumstellar properties.
  We present new Herschel HIFI and PACS sub-millimetre and far-infrared line
observations of several molecular species towards the S-type AGB star W Aql. We
use these observations, which probe a wide range of gas temperatures, to
constrain the circumstellar properties of W Aql, including mass-loss rate and
molecular abundances. We used radiative transfer codes to model the
circumstellar dust and molecular line emission to determine circumstellar
properties and molecular abundances. We assumed a spherically symmetric
envelope formed by a constant mass-loss rate driven by an accelerating wind.
Our model includes fully integrated H2O line cooling as part of the solution of
the energy balance. We detect circumstellar molecular lines from CO, H2O, SiO,
HCN, and, for the first time in an S-type AGB star, NH3. The radiative transfer
calculations result in an estimated mass-loss rate for W Aql of 4.0e-6 Msol
yr-1 based on the 12CO lines. The estimated 12CO/13CO ratio is 29, which is in
line with ratios previously derived for S-type AGB stars. We find an H2O
abundance of 1.5e-5, which is intermediate to the abundances expected for M and
C stars, and an ortho/para ratio for H2O that is consistent with formation at
warm temperatures. We find an HCN abundance of 3e-6, and, although no CN lines
are detected using HIFI, we are able to put some constraints on the abundance,
6e-6, and distribution of CN in W Aql's circumstellar envelope using
ground-based data. We find an SiO abundance of 3e-6, and an NH3 abundance of
1.7e-5, confined to a small envelope.

superconductor and a ferromagnet or a normal metal in the presence of a Zeeman
magnetic field, when the junction is taken out of equilibrium by applying a
voltage bias. We write down the most general form for the spin and charge
current in such junctions, taking into account all spin-resolved possible
tunneling processes. We make use of these forms to calculate the spin
accumulation in NS junctions subjected to a DC bias, and to an AC bias,
sinusoidal or rectangular. We observe that in the limit of negligeable changes
on the superconducting gap, the NS dynamical conductance is insensitive to spin
imbalance. Therefore to probe the spin accumulation in the superconductor, one
needs to separate the injection and detection point, i. e. the electrical spin
detection must be non-local. We address also the effect of the spin
accumulation induced in the normal leads by driving a spin current and its
effects on the detection of the spin accumulation in the superconductor.
Finally, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium spin susceptibility of the SC,
and we show that it deviates drastically from it's equilibrium value.

useful resource for many quantum information protocols. However, demonstrating
it in practice, by violating a Bell inequality, can be difficult. In
particular, standard experimental setups require the alignment of distant
parties' reference frames, which can be challenging or impossible in practice.
In this work we study the violation of certain Bell inequalities, namely the
Mermin, Mermin-Klyshko and Svetlichny inequalities, without shared reference
frames, when parties share a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.
Furthermore, we analyse how these violations demonstrate genuine multipartite
features of entanglement and nonlocality. For 3, 4 and 5 parties, we show that
it is possible to violate these inequalities with high probability, when the
parties choose their measurements from the three Pauli operators, defined only
with respect to their local frames. Moreover, the probability of violation, and
the amount of violation, are increased when each party chooses their
measurements from the four operators describing the vertices of a tetrahedron.
We also consider how many randomly chosen measurement directions are needed to
violate the Bell inequalities with high probability. We see that the obtained
levels of violation are sufficient to also demonstrate genuine multipartite
entanglement and nonseparability. Finally, we show analytically that choosing
from two measurement settings per party is sufficient to demonstrate the
maximum degree of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability with
certainty when the parties' reference frames are aligned in one direction so
that they differ only in rotations around one axis.

insulator with different ionic valencies, underlining the emerging structure of
the spin-orbital coupling between the impurity and the host sites and
demonstrate that it is qualitatively different from that encountered in the
host itself. This derivation shows that the interaction between the host and
the impurity depends in a crucial way on the type of doubly occupied $t_{2g}$
orbital. One finds that in some cases, due to the quench of the orbital degree
of freedom at the $3d$ impurity, the spin and orbital order within the host is
drastically modified by doping. The impurity acts either as a spin defect
accompanied by an orbital vacancy in the spin-orbital structure when the
host-impurity coupling is weak, or it favors doubly occupied active orbitals
(orbital polarons) along the $3d-4d$ bond leading to antiferromagnetic or
ferromagnetic spin coupling. This competition between different magnetic
couplings leads to quite different ground states. We find that magnetic
frustration and spin degeneracy can be lifted by the quantum orbital flips of
the host but they are robust in special regions of the incommensurate phase
diagram. The spin-orbit coupling can lead to anisotropic spin and orbital
patterns along the symmetry directions and cause a radical modification of the
order imposed by the spin-orbital superexchange. Our findings are expected to
be of importance for future theoretical understanding of experimental results
for doped $4d$ transition metal oxides doped with $3d^3$ ions. We suggest how
the local or global changes of the spin-orbital order induced by such

work, in the Hamiltonian formulation the phase space of a quantum system is the
Kahler manifold given by the complex projective space P(H) of the Hilbert space
H of the considered quantum theory. However the phase space of a bipartite
system must be given by the projective space of the tensor product of two
Hilbert spaces H and K and not simply by the cartesian product P(H)xP(K) as
suggested by the analogy with Classical Mechanics. A part of this paper is
devoted to manage this problem. In the second part of the work, a definition of
quantum entanglement and a proposal of entanglement measure are given in terms
of a geometrical point of view (a rather studied topic in recent literature).

([Fe/H]) stars while low-mass exoplanets do not show such an effect. This
so-called planet-metallicity correlation generally favors the idea that most
observed gas giants at $r<10$ AU are formed via a core accretion process. We
investigate the origin of this phenomenon using a semi-analystical model,
wherein the standard core accretion takes place at planet traps in protostellar
disks where rapid type I migrators are halted. We focus on the three major
exoplanetary populations - hot-Jupiters, exo-Jupiters located at $r \simeq 1$
AU, and the low-mass planets. We show using a statistical approach that the
planet-metallicity correlations are well reproduced in these models. We find
that there are specific transition metallicities with values [Fe/H]$=-0.2$ to
$-0.4$, below which the low-mass population dominates, and above which the
Jovian populations take over. The exo-Jupiters significantly exceed the
hot-Jupiter population at all observed metallicities. The low-mass planets
formed via the core accretion are insensitive to metallicity, which may account
for a large fraction of the observed super-Earths and hot-Neptunes. Finally, a
controlling factor in building massive planets is the critical mass of
planetary cores ($M_{c,crit}$) that regulates the onset of runaway gas
accretion. Assuming the current data is roughly complete at [Fe/H]$>-0.6$, our
models predict that the most likely value of the ""mean"" critical core mass of
Jovian planets is $\braket{M_{c,crit}} \simeq 5 M_{\oplus}$ rather than $10
M_{\oplus}$. This implies that grain opacities in accreting envelopes should
play an important role in lowering $M_{c,crit}$.

Zonal flows are large scale phenomena, hence multipoint measurements taken at

Biorthogonal Decomposition (or Singular Value Decomposition) is capable of
extracting the globally correlated component of the multipoint fluctuations. By
using a novel quadrature technique based on the Hilbert transform, propagating
global modes (such as MHD modes) can be distinguished from the non-propagating,
synchronous (zonal flow-like) global component. The combination of these
techniques with further information such as the spectrogram and the spatial
structure then allows an unambiguous identification of the zonal flow component
of the fluctuations. The technique is tested using gyro-kinetic simulations.
The first unambiguous identification of a zonal flow at the TJ-II stellarator

prominent in the SE component. During one night, this star developed a spectrum
unique among the T Tauri stars: extremely strong and broad redshifted
absorption components appeared in many lines of neutral and ionized metals, in
addition to those of hydrogen and helium. The absorption depths of cooler, low

peak absorption depths at high velocities. The different line profiles indicate
that the temperature and density of the accretion stream increase as material
approaches the star. We derive the physical conditions of the flow at several

that, in addition to the supernova remnant SNR B0543-68.9 reported in previous
studies, a superbubble also overlaps the SNR in projection. The position of the
SNR is clearly defined through the [SII]/H alpha flux ratio image. Moreover,
the optical images show a shell-like structure that is located farther to the
north and is filled with diffuse X-ray emission, which again indicates the
superbubble. Radio 21 cm line data show a shell around both objects. Radio
continuum data show diffuse emission at the position of DEM L299, which appears
clearly distinguished from the HII region N 164 that lies south-west of it. We
determined the spectral index of SNR B0543-68.9 to be alpha=-0.34, which
indicates the dominance of thermal emission and therefore a rather mature SNR.
We determined the basic properties of the diffuse X-ray emission for the SNR,
the superbubble, and a possible blowout region of the bubble, as suggested by
the optical and X-ray data. We obtained an age of 8.9 (3.5-18.1) kyr for the

We conclude that DEM L299 consists of a superposition of SNR B0543-68.9 and a

in the 4D calculation of the mass spectrum for excited fermion towers: the
obtained expression depends on the choice in ordering the limits, N->infinity
(infinite Kaluza-Klein tower) and epsilon->0 (epsilon being the parameter
introduced for regularizing the Higgs Dirac peak). This introduces the physical
question of which one is the correct order; we then show that the two possible
orders of regularization (called I and II) are physically equivalent, as both
can typically reproduce the measured observables, but that the one with less
degrees of freedom (I) could be uniquely excluded by future experimental
constraints. This conclusion is based on the exact matching between the 4D and
5D analytical calculations of the mass spectrum - via the regularizations of
type I and II. Beyond a deeper insight into the Higgs peak regularizations,
this matching also allows us to confirm the validity of the usual 5D
mixed-formalism and to clarify the UV cut-off procedure. All the conclusions,
deduced from regularizing the Higgs peak through a brane shift or a smoothed
square profile, are expected to remain similar in realistic models with a
warped extra-dimension.

identical systematics in excitation energy and half-lives. A constant and
particle number independent energy gap of $\sim$ 4 MeV between the $0^+$ ground
states and ${10}^+$ isomers and, the ${11/2}^-$ and ${27/2}^-$ isomers exists
before the mid-shell, which declines near the mid-shell, and then becomes
constant at $\sim$ 3 MeV after the mid-shell. Large scale shell model
calculations are carried out for the full chains of Sn-isotopes and $N=82$
isotones, which reproduce the observed energy systematics reasonably well. The
role of seniority, generalized seniority and alignment in the high-spin
isomeric states as well as in the states populating the high spin isomers has
been discussed. The empirical features suggest that the generalized seniority,
known to be valid in the low lying states of even-even nuclei before the
mid-shell, remains good up to the ${10}^+$ isomeric states; we further extend
this interpretation to the odd-A nuclei before the mid-shell, particularly the
${27/2}^-$ isomers. The seniority becomes good after the mid-shell. The change
in energy gap around the mid-shell, therefore, marks a transition from the
generalized seniority regime to the seniority regime. From the alignment
considerations, the high-spin isomers after the mid-shell emerge as maximally
aligned decoupled states. We also note that the similar features of the
isomeric half-lives in both the chains may be understood in terms of their
similar seniorities and configurations. An overview of the $0^+$ to ${10}^+$
yrast states in the full chain of even-even Sn-isotopes has also been
presented. We also make some predictions of possible new isomers based on the
empirical systematics.

principle, or is there statistical evidence for deviations from spatial
homogeneity on large scales? To address these questions, we developed a
flexible framework based on spherically symmetric, but radially inhomogeneous
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models with synchronous Big Bang. We expanded the
(local) matter density profile in terms of flexible interpolation schemes and
orthonormal polynomials. A Monte Carlo technique in combination with recent
observational data was used to systematically vary the shape of these profiles.
In the first part of this article, we reconsider giant LTB voids without dark
energy to investigate whether extremely fine-tuned mass profiles can reconcile
these models with current data. While the local Hubble rate and supernovae can
easily be fitted without dark energy, however, model-independent constraints
from the Planck 2013 data require an unrealistically low local Hubble rate,
which is strongly inconsistent with the observed value; this result agrees well
with previous studies. In the second part, we explain why it seems natural to
extend our framework by a non-zero cosmological constant, which then allows us
to perform general tests of the cosmological principle. Moreover, these
extended models facilitate explorating whether fluctuations in the local matter
density profile might potentially alleviate the tension between local and
global measurements of the Hubble rate, as derived from Cepheid-calibrated type
Ia supernovae and CMB experiments, respectively. We show that current data
provide no evidence for deviations from spatial homogeneity on large scales.
More accurate constraints are required to ultimately confirm the validity of
the cosmological principle, however.

functionals (mappings) and bounded linear functionals (operators), the concept
of dualizable (respectively, uniform) Lipschitz cross-norm on X\boxtimes E is
defined. We show that the Lipschitz injective norm epsilon, the Lipschitz
projective norm pi and the Lipschitz p-nuclear norm d_p (1<=p<=infty) are
uniform dualizable Lipschitz cross-norms on X\boxtimes E. In fact, epsilon is
the least dualizable Lipschitz cross-norm and pi is the greatest Lipschitz
cross-norm on X\boxtimes E. Moreover, dualizable Lipschitz cross-norms alpha on
X\boxtimes E are characterized by satisfying the relation epsilon<=alpha<=pi.
In addition, the Lipschitz injective (projective) norm on X\boxtimes E can be
identified with the injective (respectively, projective) tensor norm on the
Banach-space tensor product between the Lipschitz-free space over X and E. In
terms of the space X^#\boxast E^*, we describe the spaces of Lipschitz compact
(finite-rank, approximable) operators from X to E^$.

liquid with short-range interactions. At temperatures smaller than the impurity
scattering rate, i.e., in the diffusive regime, thermal conductivity acquires
non-analytic quantum corrections. When these quantum corrections become large
at low temperatures, the calculation of thermal conductivity demands a
theoretical approach that treats disorder and interactions on an equal footing.
In this paper, we develop such an approach by merging Luttinger's idea of using
gravitational potentials for the analysis of thermal phenomena with a
renormalization group calculation based on the Keldysh nonlinear sigma model.
The gravitational potentials are introduced in the action as auxiliary sources
that couple to the heat density. These sources are a convenient tool for
generating expressions for the heat density and its correlation function from
the partition function. Already in the absence of the gravitational potentials,
the nonlinear sigma model contains several temperature-dependent
renormalization group charges. When the gravitational potentials are introduced
into the model, they acquire an independent renormalization group flow. We show
that this flow preserves the phenomenological form of the correlation function,
reflecting its relation to the specific heat and the constraints imposed by
energy conservation. The main result of our analysis is that the
Wiedemann-Franz law holds down to the lowest temperatures even in the presence
of disorder and interactions and despite the quantum corrections that arise for
both the electric and thermal conductivities.

using a sample of 73 RL and 473 RQ BAL quasars selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). Each RQ quasar is individually matched to a RL quasar in
both redshift (over the range $1.5 < z < 3.5$) and continuum luminosity. We
compare several continuum, emission line, and absorption line properties, as
well as physical properties derived from these measurements. Most properties in
the samples are statistically identical, though we find slight differences in
the velocity structure of the BALs that cause apparent differences in CIV
emission line properties. Differences in the velocities may indicate an
interaction between the radio jets and the absorbing material. We also find
that UV FeII emission is marginally stronger in RL BAL quasars. All of these
differences are subtle, so in general we conclude that RL and RQ BAL QSOs are
not fundamentally different objects, except in their radio properties. They are

but not much above the transition temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC). In such a gas, a small proportion of the atoms may possess coherence
lengths longer than the mean neighboring-atomic distance, implying the
existence of quantum coherence more than that expected for thermal atoms.
Conjecturing that a part of this proportion of the atoms may lie in a BEC-type
state, some unexplained experimental results [Phys. Rev. A, 71, 043615 (2005)]
can be explained.

canonical-basis time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory (Cb-TDHFB) in the
three-dimensional coordinate space. Comparing results of the Cb-TDHFB and the
conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations, we study effects
of the pairing correlation on fusion reaction of $^{22}$O+$^{22}$O,
$^{52}$Ca+$^{52}$Ca, and $^{22}$O+$^{52}$Ca, using the Skyrme SkM$^*$
functional and a contact-type pairing energy functional. Although current
results are yet preliminary, they may suggest that the pairing correlation
could hinder the fusion probability at energies in the vicinity of the Coulomb
barrier height. We also perform a calculation for heavier nuclei,
$^{96}$Zn+$^{124}$Sn, which seems to suggest a similar hindrance effect.

apparatus (SFA) to a density distribution of a liquid on a surface of the SFA
probe. (We emphasize that the transform method is a theory for the experiment.)
In the method, two-body potential between the SFA probe and the solvent sphere
is modeled as the soft attractive potential with rigid wall. The model
potential is more realistic compared with the rigid potential applied in our
earlier work. The introduction of the model potential is the improved point of
the present transform method. The transform method is derived based on the
statistical mechanics of a simple liquid where the simple liquid is an ensemble
of small spheres. To derive the transform method, Kirkwood superposition
approximation is used. It is found that the transformation can be done by a
sequential computation. It is considered that the solvation structure can be
obtained more precisely by using the improved transform method.

it all of the major continuous-time stochastic processes that have been applied
to animal movement, including Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion,
integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion, a recently discovered hybrid of the
previous models, and a new model that describes central-place foraging. We are
also able to predict a further hierarchy of new models that will emerge as data
quality improves to better resolve the underlying continuity of animal
movement. Finally, we also show that Langevin equations must obey a
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generate processes that fall from this class
of maximum-entropy distributions.

  Estimation","13 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A distributed adaptive algorithm is proposed to solve a node-specific
parameter estimation problem where nodes are interested in estimating
parameters of local interest, parameters of common interest to a subset of
nodes and parameters of global interest to the whole network. To address the
different node-specific parameter estimation problems, this novel algorithm
relies on a diffusion-based implementation of different Least Mean Squares
(LMS) algorithms, each associated with the estimation of a specific set of
local, common or global parameters. Coupled with the estimation of the
different sets of parameters, the implementation of each LMS algorithm is only
undertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a specific set of local,
common or global parameters. The study of convergence in the mean sense reveals
that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically unbiased. Moreover, a
spatial-temporal energy conservation relation is provided to evaluate the
steady-state performance at each node in the mean-square sense. Finally, the
theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed technique are
validated through computer simulations in the context of cooperative spectrum
sensing in Cognitive Radio networks.

about a significant change in the characteristics of Internet video, but not
many studies on characterizing video have been done after this change. Video
characteristics such as video length, format, target bit rate, and resolution
provide valuable input to design Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) algorithms, sizing
playout buffers in Dynamic Adaptive HTTP streaming (DASH) players, model the
variability in video frame sizes, etc. This paper presents datasets collected
in 2013 and 2014 that contains over 130,000 videos from YouTube's most viewed
(or most popular) video charts in 58 countries. We describe the basic
characteristics of the videos on YouTube for each category, format, video
length, file size, and data rate variation, observing that video length and
file size fit a log normal distribution. We show that three minutes of a video
suffice to represent its instant data rate fluctuation and that we can infer
data rate characteristics of different video resolutions from a single given
one. Based on our findings, we design active measurements for measuring the
performance of Internet video.
