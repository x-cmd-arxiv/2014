the Landau-Ginzburg functional, with fluid-substrate couplings which correspond
to either first-order or critical wetting for a flat substrate. We investigate
the effect of the roughness of the substrate in the interfacial phenomenology,
paying special attention to filling and wetting phenomena, and compare the
results with the predictions of the macroscopic and interfacial Hamiltonian
theories. At bulk coexistence, for values of L much larger than the bulk
correlation, we observe first-order filling transitions between dry and
partially filled interfacial states, which extend off-coexistence, ending at a
critical point; and wetting transitions between partially filled and completely
wet interfacial states with the same order as for the flat substrate (if
first-order, wetting extends off-coexistence in a prewetting line). On the
other hand, if the groove height is of order of the correlation length, only
wetting transitions between dry and complete wet states are observed. However,
their characteristics depend on the order of the wetting transition for the
flat substrate. So, if it is first-order, the wetting transition temperature
for the rough substrate is reduced with respect to the wetting transition
temperature for a flat substrate, and coincides with the Wenzel law prediction
for very shallow substrates. On the contrary, if the flat substrate wetting
transition is continuous, the roughness does not change the wetting
temperature.

of interactions that is complex both in space and time. Yet inference methods
have mainly focused on reconstructing, from the network's activity, the spatial
structure, by assuming equilibrium conditions or, more recently, a
probabilistic dynamics with a single arbitrary time-step. Here we show that,
under this latter assumption, the inference procedure fails to reconstruct the
synaptic matrix of a network of integrate-and-fire neurons when the chosen time
scale of interaction does not closely match the synaptic delay or when no
single time scale for the interaction can be identified; such failure,
moreover, exposes a distinctive bias of the inference method that can lead to
infer as inhibitory the excitatory synapses with interaction time scales longer
than the model's time-step. We therefore introduce a new two-step method, that
first infers through cross-correlation profiles the delay-structure of the
network and then reconstructs the synaptic matrix, and successfully test it on
networks with different topologies and in different activity regimes. Although
step one is able to accurately recover the delay-structure of the network, thus
getting rid of any \textit{a priori} guess about the time scales of the
interaction, the inference method introduces nonetheless an arbitrary time
scale, the time-bin $dt$ used to binarize the spike trains. We therefore
analytically and numerically study how the choice of $dt$ affects the inference
in our network model, finding that the relationship between the inferred
couplings and the real synaptic efficacies, albeit being quadratic in both
cases, depends critically on $dt$ for the excitatory synapses only, whilst
being basically independent of it for the inhibitory ones.

the disc structure. In discs with an efficient radiative transport, the
migration can be directed outwards for planets with more than 3-5 Earth masses.
This is due to the entropy driven corotation torque, a process that extends the
lifetimes of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence on the
disc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity to
model a dead-zone structure in the disc. We focus on M-dot discs, which have a
constant net mass flux. Using the resulting disc structure, we investigate the
consequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions of
outward migration for proto-planets. We performed numerical hydrosimulations of
M-dot discs in the r-z-plane. We used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code
FARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as well
as a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the
flux-limited diffusion approximation. Viscosity transitions inside the disc
create transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planets
through the so-called ""planet trap"" mechanism. This mechanism also works for
planets down to M_P > 0.5M_E. Additionally, the viscosity transitions change
the pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation via
the streaming instability. However, a very steep transition in viscosity is
needed to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. The transition in viscosity
facilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-mass
planets (M_P>0.5M_E), but still does not halt inward migration of smaller
planets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag. A very steep, probably
unrealistic viscosity gradient is needed to trap planets of smaller masses and
halt gas-drag-driven planetesimal migration at a pressure bump.

strong interest in recent years, motivated in particular by applications in
finance, Internet traffic modeling and biomedicine. The aim of this work to
define and develop, using White Noise Theory, an anticipative stochastic
calculus with respect to a large class of Gaussian processes, denoted G, that
contains, among many other processes, Volterra processes (and thus fBm) and
also mBm. This stochastic calculus includes a definition of a stochastic
integral, It\^o formulas (both for tempered distributions and for functions
with sub-exponential growth), a Tanaka Formula as well as a definition, and a
short study, of (both weighted and non weighted) local times of elements of G .
In that view, a white noise derivative of any Gaussian process G of G is
defined and used to integrate, with respect to G, a large class of stochastic
processes, using Wick products. A comparison of our integral wrt elements of G
to the ones provided by Malliavin calculus in [AMN01] and by It\^o stochastic

some results given in [AMN01]. In addition, it offers alternative conditions to

scalability of parallel insertions in conjunction with the efficiency of
batched removals. Moreover, we present a new elimination algorithm suitable for
a priority queue, which further increases concurrency on balanced workloads

vary depending on the notion of size under consideration. For example, we
construct a compact set $B$ of Hausdorff dimension $1$ which contains the

prove that such a $B$ must have packing and lower box dimension at least
$\tfrac{7}{4}$, and show by example that this is sharp. For more general sets
of centers, the answers for packing and box counting dimensions also differ.
These problems are inspired by the analogous problems for circles that were

precision spectroscopy due to their narrow linewidths and precise frequency
spacing. Generation of such combs in the mid-infrared (IR) spectral region
(2-20 um) is of great interest due to the presence of a large number of gas
absorption lines in this wavelength regime. Recently, frequency combs have been
demonstrated in the MIR in several platforms, including fiber combs,
mode-locked lasers, optical parametric oscillators, and quantum cascade lasers.
However, these platforms are either relatively bulky or challenging to
integrate on-chip. An alternative approach using parametric mixing in
microresonators is highly promising since the platform is extremely compact and
can operate with relatively low powers. However, material and dispersion
engineering limitations have prevented the realization of a microresonator comb
source past 2.55 um. Although silicon could in principle provide a CMOS
compatible platform for on-chip comb generation deep into the mid-IR, to date,
silicon's linear and nonlinear losses have prevented the realization of a
microresonator-based comb source. Here we overcome these limitations and
realize a broadband frequency comb spanning from 2.1 um to 3.5 um and
demonstrate its viability as a spectroscopic sensing platform. Such a platform
is compact and robust and offers the potential to be versatile and durable for
use outside the laboratory environment for applications such as real-time
monitoring of atmospheric gas conditions.

image taken with the GALEX satellite of the well-known mass-losing carbon star
CIT 6 (RW LMi). The northern (southern) ring is brighter (fainter) with a
diameter of about 15 arcmin (18 arcmin). These structures most likely represent
the astrosphere resulting from the shock interaction of CIT 6's molecular wind
with the Warm Interstellar Medium, as it moves through the latter. These data
provide a direct estimate of the size of CIT 6's circumstellar envelope that is
a factor ~20 larger than previous estimates based on CO millimeter-wave line
data. We find that CIT 6 has been undergoing heavy mass-loss for at least
93,000 yr and the total envelope mass is 0.29 Msun or larger, assuming a
constant mass-loss rate of 3.2 x 10^(-6) Msun/yr. Assuming that the shock front
has reached a steady-state and CIT 6's motion relative to the ISM is in the
sky-plane, we measure the termination-shock standoff distance directly from the
image and find that CIT 6 is moving at a speed of about 39 (0.17
cm^(-3)/n_ISM)^(1/2) km/s through the interstellar medium around it. However,
comparisons with published numerical simulations and analytical modelling shows
that CIT 6's forward shock (the northern ring) departs from the parabolic shape
expected in steady-state. We discuss several possible explanations for this
departure.

belt sphere is null-bordant in the oriented bordism group $\Omega SO^*(W)$ of
any symplectically aspherical filling $W$, and in dimension five, it will even
be nullhomotopic. More generally, if the filling is not aspherical but is
semipositive, then the belt sphere will be trivial in $H^*(W)$. Using the same

axial direction are attached to the outer cylinder. We investigate angular
momentum transport and Ekman pumping in the Rayleigh-stable regime. The regime
is linearly stable and is characterized by radially increasing specific angular
momentum. We present several Rayleigh-stable profiles for shear Reynolds
numbers $Re_S \sim O(10^5) \,$, both for $\Omega_i > \Omega_o > 0$
(quasi-Keplerian regime) and $\Omega_o > \Omega_i > 0$ (sub-rotating regime)
where $\Omega_{i,o}$ is the inner/outer cylinder rotation rate. None of the
velocity profiles matches the non-vortical laminar Taylor-Couette profile. The
deviation from that profile increased as solid-body rotation is approached at
fixed $Re_S$. Flow super-rotation, an angular velocity greater than that of
both cylinders, is observed in the sub-rotating regime. The velocity profiles
give lower bounds for the torques required to rotate the inner cylinder that
were larger than the torques for the case of laminar Taylor-Couette flow. The
quasi-Keplerian profiles are composed of a well mixed inner region, having
approximately constant angular momentum, connected to an outer region in
solid-body rotation with the outer cylinder and attached axial boundaries.
These regions suggest that the angular momentum is transported axially to the
axial boundaries. Therefore, Taylor-Couette flow with closing plates attached
to the outer cylinder is an imperfect model for accretion disk flows,
especially with regard to their stability.

aggregation processes underlying several human diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's diseases). Determining the affinity and kinetic steps of such
interactions is challenging due to the competition between hydrophobic
self-aggregating forces and electrostatic binding forces. Kahalalide F (KF) is
an anticancer hydrophobic peptide which contains a single positive charge that
confers strong aggregative properties with polyanions. This makes KF an ideal
model to elucidate the mechanisms by which self-aggregation competes with
binding to a strongly charged polyelectrolyte such as DNA. We use optical
tweezers to apply mechanical forces to single DNA molecules and show that KF
and DNA interact in a two-step kinetic process promoted by the electrostatic
binding of DNA to the aggregate surface followed by the stabilization of the
complex due to hydrophobic interactions. From the measured pulling curves we
determine the spectrum of binding affinities, kinetic barriers and lengths of
DNA segments sequestered within the KF-DNA complex. We find there is a capture
distance beyond which the complex collapses into compact aggregates stabilized
by strong hydrophobic forces, and discuss how the bending rigidity of the
nucleic acid affects such process. We hypothesize that within an in vivo
context, the enhanced electrostatic interaction of KF due to its aggregation
might mediate the binding to other polyanions. The proposed methodology should
be useful to quantitatively characterize other compounds or proteins in which
the formation of aggregates is relevant.

Lukasiewicz sentential calculus"" (J. Funct. Anal. Vol. 65) D. Mundici extended
this result to arbitrary $MV$-algebras and $l$-groups with strong unit. He
takes the representation of $A$ as a sub-direct product of chains $A_i$, and
observes that $A \overset {} {\hookrightarrow} \prod_i G_i$ where $G_i =
A_i^*$. Then he let $A^*$ be the $l$-subgroup generated by $A$ inside $\prod_i
G_i$. He proves that this idea works, and establish an equivalence of
categories in a rather elaborate way by means of his concept of good sequences
and its complicated arithmetics. In this note, essentially self-contained
except for Chang's result, we give a simple proof of this equivalence taking
advantage directly of the arithmetics of the the product $l$-group $\prod_i
G_i$, avoiding entirely the notion of good sequence.

analytical results show how the charges are redistributed in the circular

negative ions accumulate close to the impurity leaving an excess of positive

cosmological parameter estimation and forecasts by treating $\delta_b$ as an
additional cosmological parameter enabling efficient exploration of its impact.
To test this approach, we consider here an idealized measurement of the matter
power spectrum itself in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology though our techniques can
readily be extended to more observationally relevant statistics or other
parameter spaces. Using sub-volumes of large-volume $N$-body simulations for
power spectra measured with respect to either the global or local mean density,
we verify that the minimum variance estimator of $\delta_b$ is both unbiased
and has the predicted variance. Parameter degeneracies arise since the response
of the matter power spectrum to $\delta_b$ and cosmological parameters share
similar properties in changing the growth of structure and dilating the scale
of features especially in the local case. For matter power spectrum
measurements, these degeneracies can lead in certain cases to substantial error
degradation and motivates future studies of specific cosmological observables
such as galaxy clustering and weak lensing statistics with these techniques.

model differs from $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ by having a lower late-time expansion
rate and an enhanced and time-dependent gravitational strength ($\sim 6\%$
larger today). Compared to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ today, in the nonlocal model,
massive haloes are slightly more abundant (by $\sim 10\%$ at $M \sim 10^{14}
M_{\odot}/h$) and concentrated ($\approx 8\%$ enhancement over a range of mass
scales), but their linear bias remains almost unchanged. We find that the
Sheth-Tormen formalism describes the mass function and halo bias very well,
with little need for recalibration of free parameters. The fitting of the halo
concentrations is however essential to ensure the good performance of the halo
model on small scales. For $k \gtrsim 1 h/{\rm Mpc}$, the amplitude of the
nonlinear matter and velocity divergence power spectra exhibits a modest
enhancement of $\sim 12\%$ to $15\%$, compared to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ today.
This suggests that this model might only be distinguishable from $\Lambda{\rm
CDM}$ by future observational missions. We point out that the absence of a
screening mechanism may lead to tensions with Solar System tests due to local
time variations of the gravitational strength, although this is subject to
assumptions about the local time evolution of background averaged quantities.

literature (six defined in the rest-frame and three defined in the observed
frame): $R_L=\log(L_{5GHz}/L_B)$, $q_{24}=\log(L_{24\mu m}/L_{1.4GHz})$,
$R_{uv}=\log(L_{5GHz}/L_{2500\AA})$, $R_{i}=\log(L_{1.4GHz}/L_i)$,

defined in the rest-frame, we find a low radio-loud fraction of $\lesssim 5\%$
in the XMM-COSMOS type 1 AGN sample, except for $R_{uv}$. Requiring that any
two criteria agree reduces the radio-loud fraction to $\lesssim 2\%$ for about
3/4 of the cases. The low radio-loud fraction cannot be simply explained by the
contribution of the host galaxy luminosity and reddening. The
$P_{5GHz}=\log(P_{5GHz}(W/Hz/Sr))$ gives the smallest radio-loud fraction. Two
of the three radio-loud fractions from the criteria defined in the observed

dusty, hyper-luminous galaxies, with infrared luminosities $L_{\rm IR} >
10^{13}~L_{\odot}$, and sometimes exceeding $10^{14}~L_{\odot}$. Previous work
has shown that their dust temperatures and overall far-IR SEDs are
significantly hotter than expected for star-formation. We present here an
analysis of the rest-frame optical through mid-IR SEDs for a large sample of
these so-called ""Hot, Dust-Obscured Galaxies"" (Hot DOGs). We find that the SEDs
of Hot DOGs are generally well modeled by the combination of a luminous, yet
obscured AGN that dominates the rest-frame emission at $\lambda > 1\mu\rm m$
and the bolometric luminosity output, and a less luminous host galaxy that is
responsible for the bulk of the rest optical/UV emission. Even though the
stellar mass of the host galaxies may be as large as
$10^{11}-10^{12}~M_{\odot}$, the AGN emission, with luminosities comparable to
those of the most luminous QSOs known, require that either Hot DOGs have black
hole masses significantly in excess of the local relations, or that they
radiate significantly above the Eddington limit. We show that, while rare, the
number density of Hot DOGs is comparable to that of equally luminous but
unobscured (i.e., Type 1) QSOs. This is inconsistent with the trend of a
diminishing fraction of obscured objects with increasing luminosity found for
less luminous QSOs, possibly indicating a reversal in this relation at high
luminosity, and that Hot DOGs are not the torus-obscured counterparts of the
known optically selected, largely unobscured Hyper-Luminous QSOs. Hot DOGs may
represent a different type of galaxy and thus a new component of the galaxy
evolution paradigm. Finally, we discuss the environments of Hot DOGs and show
that these objects are in regions as dense as those of known high-redshift
proto-clusters.(Abridged)

spectroscopy of Type Iax supernova 2012Z. The data set consists of both early
and late-time observations, including the first late phase NIR spectrum
obtained for a spectroscopically classified SN Iax. Simple model calculations
of its bolometric light curve suggest SN 2012Z produced ~0.3 M_sun of (56)Ni,
ejected about a Chandrasekhar mass of material, and had an explosion energy of
~10^51 erg, making it one of the brightest and most energetic SN Iax yet
observed. The late phase NIR spectrum of SN 2012Z is found to broadly resemble
similar epoch spectra of normal SNe Ia; however, like other SNe Iax,
corresponding visual-wavelength spectra differ substantially compared to all
supernova types. Constraints from the distribution of IMEs, e.g. silicon and
magnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixing
during or after burning, and the late phase NIR line profiles suggests most of
the (56)Ni is produced during high density burning. The various observational
properties of SN 2012Z are found to be consistent with the theoretical
expectations of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor that experiences a
pulsational delayed detonation, which produced several tenths of a solar mass
of (56)Ni during the deflagration burning phase and little (or no) (56)Ni
during the detonation phase. Within this scenario only a moderate amount of
Rayleigh-Taylor mixing occurs both during the deflagration and fallback phase
of the pulsation, and the layered structure of the IMEs is a product of the
subsequent denotation phase. The fact that the SNe Iax population does not
follow a tight brightness-decline relation similar to SNe Ia can then be
understood in the framework of variable amounts of mixing during pulsational
rebound and variable amounts of (56)Ni production during the early subsonic
phase of expansion.

of Fermi-liquids is revealed in entanglement entropy by a log-correction to the
typical boundary-law scaling of simpler quantum ground-states. In this paper, I
analyze the entanglement structure of a disordered, but delocalized diffusive

show that, despite having the same number of extended gapless excitations as a
clean Fermi-liquid, the diffusive metal exhibits only boundary-law entanglement

the finite density of gapless excitations, as the origin of the log-correction

  Available minimization algorithms include Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead

done using the standard chi^2 statistic (using either data or model values to
estimate per-pixel Gaussian errors, or else user-supplied error images) or
Poisson-based maximum-likelihood statistics; the latter approach is
particularly appropriate for cases of Poisson data in the low-count regime. I

kinematic data. Based on our ellipticity measurements from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 7, and additional imaging from the Isaac Newton
Telescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotators
under the assumption of axisymmetry. The so-obtained intrinsic shape
distribution for the fast rotators can be described with a Gaussian with a mean
flattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additional
tail towards rounder shapes. The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well
described with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. We then checked
that our results were consistent when applying a different and independent
method to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observed
ellipticity distributions directly using Gaussian parametrisations for the
intrinsic axis ratios. Although both fast and slow rotators are identified as
early-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shape
studies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions are
significantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. The
intrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with the
spiral galaxy population. Including the observed kinematic misalignment in our
intrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantly
axisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. For the slow rotators
though there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

traces their dark matter (DM) and baryonic assembly in four cosmologies: Cold
Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) with particle masses of $m_x =$
1.5, 3 and 5 ${\rm keV}$. We use the same astrophysical parameters regulating
star formation and feedback, chosen to match current observations of the
evolving ultra violet luminosity function (UV LF). We find that the assembly of
observable (with current and upcoming instruments) galaxies in CDM and $m_x
\geq 3 {\rm keV}$ WDM results in similar halo mass to light ratios (M/L),
stellar mass densities (SMDs) and UV LFs. However the suppression of
small-scale structure leads to a notably delayed and subsequently more rapid
stellar assembly in the $1.5 {\rm keV}$ WDM model. Thus galaxy assembly in $m_x
\leq 2 {\rm keV}$ WDM cosmologies is characterized by: (i) a dearth of
small-mass halos hosting faint galaxies; and (ii) a younger, more UV bright
stellar population, for a given stellar mass. The higher M/L ratio (effect ii)
partially compensates for the dearth of small-mass halos (effect i), making the
resulting UV LFs closer to CDM than expected from simple estimates of halo
abundances. We find that the redshift evolution of the SMD is a powerful probe
of the nature of DM. Integrating down to a limit of $M_{UV} =-16.5$ for the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the SMD evolves as $\log$(SMD)$\propto -0.63
(1+z)$ in $m_x = 1.5 {\rm keV}$ WDM, as compared to $\log$(SMD)$\propto -0.44
(1+z)$ in CDM. Thus high-redshift stellar assembly provides a powerful testbed
for WDM models, accessible with the upcoming JWST.

candidate. The most pronounced role of DM annihilations is in heating the IGM
earlier and more uniformly than astrophysical sources of X-rays. This leaves
several unambiguous, qualitative signatures in the redshift evolution of the
large-scale ($k\approx0.1$ Mpc$^{-1}$) 21 cm power amplitude: (i) the local
maximum (peak) associated with IGM heating can be lower than the other maxima;
(ii) the heating peak can occur while the IGM is in emission against the cosmic
microwave background (CMB); (iii) there can be a dramatic drop in power (a
global minimum) corresponding to the epoch when the IGM temperature is
comparable to the CMB temperature. These signatures are robust to astrophysical
uncertainties, and will be easily detectable with second generation
interferometers. We also briefly show that decaying warm dark matter has a
negligible role in heating the IGM.

spin, an internal quantum-mechanical degree of freedom, with its linear
momentum, an external property. Spin-orbit interaction, due to its relativistic
nature, is typically small in solids, and is often taken into account
perturbatively. It has been recently realized, however, that materials with
strong spin-orbit coupling can lead to novel states of matter such as
topological insulators and superconductors. This exciting development might
lead to a number of useful applications ranging from spintronics to quantum
computing. In particular, theory predicts that narrow band gap semiconductors
with strong spin-obit coupling are a suitable platform for the realization of
Majorana zero-energy modes, predicted to obey exotic non-Abelian braiding
statistics. The pursuit for realizing Majorana modes in condensed matter
systems and investigating their exotic properties has been a subject of
intensive experimental research recently. Here, we demonstrate the first
realization of gate-defined wires where one-dimensional confinement is created
using electrostatic potentials, on large area InAs two dimensional electron
systems (2DESs). The electronic properties of the parent 2DES are fully
characterized in the region that wires are formed. The strength of the
spin-orbit interaction has been measured and tuned while the high mobility of
the 2DES is maintained in the wire. We show that this scheme could provide new
prospective solutions for scalable and complex wire networks.

characterized by a non-positive definite quasi-probability distribution. This

with overlapping observational coverage for these two filter sets. The LVL
galaxy sample consists of normal, non-starbursting galaxies. We also examine
how well the LVL galaxy colors are described by previous transformations
derived from standard calibration stars and model-based galaxy templates. We
find significant galaxy color scatter around most of the previous
transformation relationships. In addition, the previous transformations show
systematic offsets between transformed and observed galaxy colors which are
visible in observed color-color trends. The LVL-based $galaxy$ transformations
show no systematic color offsets and reproduce the observed color-color galaxy
trends.

large energy supplies. We discuss some philosophical difficulties of SETI, and
how communication SETI circumvents them. We review ""Dysonian SETI"", the search
for artifacts of alien civilizations, and find that it is highly complementary
to traditional communication SETI; the two together might succeed where either
one, alone, has not. We discuss the argument of Hart (1975) that spacefaring
life in the Milky Way should be either galaxy-spanning or non-existent, and
examine a portion of his argument that we dub the ""monocultural fallacy"". We
discuss some rebuttals to Hart that invoke sustainability and predict long
Galaxy colonization timescales. We find that the maximum Galaxy colonization
timescale is actually much shorter than previous work has found ($< 10^9$ yr),
and that many ""sustainability"" counter-arguments to Hart's thesis suffer from
the monocultural fallacy. We extend Hart's argument to alien energy supplies,
and argue that detectably large energy supplies can plausibly be expected to
exist because life has potential for exponential growth until checked by
resource or other limitations, and intelligence implies the ability to overcome
such limitations. As such, if Hart's thesis is correct then searches for large
alien civilizations in other galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then
searches for civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to succeed than
Hart argued. We review some past Dysonian SETI efforts, and discuss the promise
of new mid-infrared surveys, such as that of WISE.

wide-field infrared surveys of WISE and Spitzer to search for these
civilizations' waste heat. We develop a formalism for translating mid-infrared
photometry into quantitative upper limits on extraterrestrial energy supplies.
We discuss the likely sources of false positives, how dust can and will
contaminate our search, and prospects for distinguishing dust from alien waste
heat. We argue that galaxy-spanning civilizations may be easier to distinguish
from natural sources than circumstellar civilizations (i.e., Dyson spheres),
although Gaia will significantly improve our capability to identify the latter.
We present a ""zeroth order"" null result of our search based on the WISE all-sky
catalog: we show, for the first time, that Kardashev Type III civilizations (as
Kardashev originally defined them) are very rare in the local universe. More
sophisticated searches can extend our methodology to smaller waste heat
luminosities, and potentially entirely rule out (or detect) both Kardashev Type
III civilizations and new physics that allows for unlimited ""free"" energy
generation.

can correctly predict trends of a typical human observer performance with the
viewing parameters of browsing speed, viewing distance and contrast. In this

After stCSF, contrast masking is the second most prominent property of HVS and
it refers to the fact that the presence of one signal affects the visibility

mesons containing a single charm or bottom quark. The four-quark wave functions
are constructed based on a diquark-antidiquark form under the constraint that
they form an antitriplet $\bar{\bf{3}}_f$ in $\mbox{SU(3)}_f$, which seems to
be realized in some of the excited states listed in Particle Data Group.
Depending on the structure of antidiquark, we construct two possible models for
its wave functions: Model I) the antidiquark is symmetric in flavor
($\bar{\bf{6}}_f$) and antisymmetric in color ($\bf{3}_c$) and Model II) the
antidiquark is antisymmetric in flavor ($\bf{3}_f$) and symmetric in color
($\bar{\bf{6}}_c$). To test phenomenological relevance of these wave functions,
we calculate the mass differences among the excited states of spin $J=0,1,2$
using color-spin interactions. The four-quark wave functions based on Model~I
is found to reproduce the observed mass of the excited states of heavy mesons.
Also, our four-quark model provides an interesting phenomenology relating to
the decay widths of the excited states. To further pursue the possibility of
the four-quark structure, we make a few predictions for open charm and open
bottom states that may be discovered in future experiments. Most of them are
expected to have broad widths, which would make them difficult to be identified
experimentally. However, one resonance with $J=1$ containing bottom and strange
quarks is expected to appear as a sharp peak with its mass around $B^{\bar
s}_{1N} \sim 5753$~MeV. Confirmation of the existence of such states in future
experiments will shed light on our understanding of the structure of heavy
meson excited states.

show that variations in semi-major axes can take place simultaneously between
three or four consecutive satellites. We find that the three-body Laplace angle
values are distributed unevenly and have histograms showing structure, if the
angle is associated with a resonant chain, with both pairs of bodies near
first-order two-body resonances. Estimated three-body resonance libration
frequencies can be only an order of magnitude lower than those of first-order
resonances. Their strength arises from a small divisor from the distance to the
first-order resonances and insensitivity to eccentricity, which make up for
their dependence on moon mass. Three-body resonances associated with
low-integer Laplace angles can also be comparatively strong due to the many
multiples of the angle contributed from Fourier components of the interaction
terms. We attribute small coupled variations in semi-major axis, seen
throughout the simulation, to ubiquitous and weak three-body resonant
couplings. We show that a system with two pairs of bodies in first-order
mean-motion resonance can be transformed to resemble the well-studied
periodically-forced pendulum with the frequency of a Laplace angle serving as a
perturbation frequency. We identify trios of bodies and overlapping pairs of
two-body resonances in each trio that have particularly short estimated
Lyapunov timescales.

sum of squared entries of a high-dimensional vector $p$ of relative

suggest a very high ($\ge 10^{16}\ GeV$) scale of a primordial (which motivated
this work initially) and may reflect effects of dust, we believe that
addressing these issues is nonetheless very useful. We recall the potential
difficulties with various topological defects - monopoles, strings and domain
walls generated at the SSB (spontaneous symmetry breaking) of various gauge
symmetries. The main part of the paper is devoted to discussing difficulties
with long-lived heavy particles, which could be dark matter but cannot
efficiently annihilate to the required residual density because of basic
S-Matrix unitarity/analyticity limits. We indicate in simple terms yet in some
detail how the WIMP miracle occurs at $M(X)\sim{TeV}$ and how the axiomatic
upper bound presently updated to $M(X) \le{110 TeV}$ was originally derived by
Greist and Kamionokowski. We also argue that generically we expect the stronger
$M(X)\le{20\ GeV}$ bound to hold. We then elaborate on the pure particle
physics approaches aiming to enhance the annihilation and evade the bounds. We
find that the only and in fact very satisfactory way of doing this requires
endowing the particles with gauge interactions with a confinement scale lower
than $M(X)$. We also comment on models with light $O(KeV)$ dark matter, which
was supposed to be frozen in via out-of equilibrium processes so as to have the
right relic densities pointing out that in many such cases \textit{very} low
reheat temperatures are indeed required and speculate on the large desert

These costs are prohibitive for large-scale problems with arbitrary length and
depth. In this contribution, we propose a new approximation technique that may
have the potential to achieve sub-cubic time complexity in length and linear
time depth, at the cost of some loss of quality. The idea is based on two
well-known methods: Gibbs sampling and Rao-Blackwellisation. We provide some
simulation-based evaluation of the quality of the RGBS with respect to run time
and sequence length.

of diverse goals in teaching beginning analysis courses. And students come to
the course with a varied background. Indeed, over the years we found that

used to study their roles in diseases. However, diseases such as cancer are a
result of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins
seldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes
performing dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of
individual genes (proteins) and can be used to gain a better understanding of
cancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in
their expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription
factors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into
cancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their
transcriptional regulation.
  Results: We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and
gene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes
in their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a
log-linear model to relate these changes to the differential regulation of
complexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving
pancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in
core cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome
stability and cell proliferation (e.g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show
considerable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and
countering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of compensatory
mechanisms coming into play in tumours; and (iii) TFs work in cooperative and
counteractive ways to regulate these mechanisms. Such aberrant complexes and
their regulating TFs play vital roles in the initiation and progression of
cancer.

that the SBHM previously applied to mono crystal system such as Silicon can
also be applied to an atomic cell containing two different atoms e.g. GaAs by
introducing an effective hyperpolarizability
$\alpha_{2GaAs}=\left(\alpha_{2Ga}-\alpha_{2As}\right)$ . Comparison with GT
yields the same third rank tensor for a $T_d$ point group corresponding to bulk
tetrahedral structure. Interestingly, SBHM gives good agreement with RASHG
experiment of GaAs using only one single fitting parameter when Fresnel
analysis is also incorporated in the model.

evolutionary phases, from Main-Sequence stars to white dwarfs and neutron
stars. The large scale ordered nature of these fields, often approximately
dipolar, and their scaling according to the flux conservation scenario favor
the model of a fossil field (Duez et al. 2010). We make some first estimates of
the magnetic coupling between the stellar cores and the outer layers in red
giants and supergiants. Analytical expressions of the truncation radius of the
field coupling are established for a convective envelope and for a rotating
radiative zone with horizontal turbulence. The timescales of the internal
exchanges of angular momentum are considered.
  Numerical estimates are made on the basis of recent model grids. The direct
magnetic coupling of the core to the extended convective envelope of red giants
and supergiants appears unlikely. However, we find that the intermediate
radiative zone is fully coupled to the core during the He-burning and later
phases. This coupling is able to produce a strong spin down of the core of red
giants and supergiants, also leading to relatively slowly rotating stellar
remnants, like white dwarfs and pulsars. Some angular momentum is also
transferred to the outer convective envelope of red giants and supergiants
during the He-burning phase and later.

function can be dynamically suppressed by fluctuations in the spacetime
geometry. These fluctuations represent the minimal uncertainty that is present
when one probes spacetime geometry with a quantum probe. Two similar models
have been proposed, one by Di\'osi [D-model] and one by Karolyhazy and
collaborators [K-model], based on apparently unrelated minimal spacetime
bounds. The two models arrive at somewhat different expressions for the
dependence of the localization coherence length on the mass and size of the
quantum object. In the present article we compare and contrast the two models
from three aspects: (i) comparison of the spacetime bounds, (ii) method of
calculating decoherence time, (iii) comparison of noise correlation. We show
that under certain conditions the minimal spacetime bounds in the two models
can be derived one from the other. We argue that the methods of calculating the
decoherence time are equivalent. We re-derive the two-point correlation for the
fluctuation potential in the K-model, and confirm the earlier result of Di\'osi
and Luk\'acs that it is non-white noise, unlike in the D-model, where the
corresponding correlation is white noise in time. This seems to be the origin
of the different results in the two models. We derive the non-Markovian master
equation for the K-model. We argue that the minimal spacetime bound cannot
predict the noise correlation uniquely, and additional criteria are necessary
to accurately determine the effects of gravitationally induced decoherence.

manifests itself through the mixing with nearby $q\overline q$ states.

otherwise have the same functional form as the moments stemming from spatial

characteristics through spin-dependent transmission and conductance, making
them directly accessible in experiments. Moreover, the Zeeman-type effects
appear without explicitly incorporating the Zeeman term in the models, i.e., by
using minimal coupling and Peierls substitution in continuum and the

found that stable harmonic mode locking regime can be accessed when we reduce
the input power after strong pumping even when we do not carefully adjust the
wavelength detuning. This is due to the bistable nature of the nonlinear cavity
system. The experiment agrees well with the numerical analysis, where we obtain
low-noise Kerr comb spectrum at low longitudinal mode spacing by gradually
reducing the pumping input after strong pumping. This finding clarifies the
procedure for generating harmonic mode locking in such high-Q microcavity
systems.

identifying the hydrogen-deficient (H-deficient) stars in the red giant sample
of the globular cluster Omega Cen are reported. Spectral analyses were carried
out on the basis of the strengths of (0,0) MgH band and the Mg b triplet. In
our sample, four giants were identified with weak/absent MgH bands in their
observed spectra not as expected for their well determined stellar parameters.
The Mg abundances for the program stars were determined from subordinate lines
of the MgH band to the blue of the Mg b triplet, using the spectral synthesis
technique. The derived Mg abundances for the program stars were as expected for
the red giants of Omega Cen (Norris & Da Costa 1995), except for the four
identified candidates. Determined Mg abundances of these four candidates are
much lower than that expected for the red giants of Omega Cen, and are
unacceptable based on the strengths of Mg b triplet in their observed spectra.
Hence, the plausible reason for the weak/absent MgH bands in the observed
spectra of these stars is a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their
atmospheres. These giants may belong to the group of helium enriched red giants
of Omega Cen.

a T4.5 dwarf companion at 6.3 arcmin (~9000 au) from HIP70849, a K7V star which

hypergraph representation of rank $k$ (in the sense defined by Abraham,
Babaioff, Dughmi and Roughgarden [EC 2012]) is in $\mathcal{MPH}$-$k$. Every
monotone function that has supermodular degree $k$ (in the sense defined by

additional results that demonstrate the expressiveness power of

  One can obtain good approximation ratios for some natural optimization
problems, provided that functions are required to lie in low levels of the
$\mathcal{MPH}$ hierarchy. We present two such applications. One shows that the
maximum welfare problem can be approximated within a ratio of $k+1$ if all
players hold valuation functions in $\mathcal{MPH}$-$k$. The other is an upper
bound of $2k$ on the price of anarchy of simultaneous first price auctions.
  Being in $\mathcal{MPH}$-$k$ can be shown to involve two requirements -- one
is monotonicity and the other is a certain requirement that we refer to as
$\mathcal{PLE}$ (Positive Lower Envelope). Removing the monotonicity
requirement, one obtains the $\mathcal{PLE}$ hierarchy over all non-negative
set functions (whether monotone or not), which can be fertile ground for
further research.

to send classical information between parties. Here, we study the amount of
information that can be sent using such correlations. To this aim, we first
provide a framework associating them with classical channels whose capacities
are then used to quantify the usefulness of these correlations in sending
information. Finally, we determine the minimal amount of information that can
be sent using signaling correlations violating the monogamy relation associated
to the chained Bell inequalities.

analyse this process taking into account the interaction with neighboring nodes

unknown variables, thereby yielding approximations of time average performance
measures, such as packet discard probabilities and average queueing delays. The
model incorporates packet generation at the sensor nodes and queues at the

extensive comparison with simulations. As an additional assessment of the
accuracy of the model, we utilize it in an algorithm for sensor network design

SATIRE-S ascribes variation in solar irradiance on timescales greater than a
day to photospheric magnetism. The solar spectrum is reconstructed from the
apparent surface coverage of bright magnetic features and sunspots in the daily
data using the modelled intensity spectra of these magnetic structures. We
cross-calibrated the various data sets, harmonizing the model input so as to
yield a single consistent time series as the output. The model replicates 92%
of the variability in the PMOD TSI composite including the secular decline
between the 1996 and 2008 solar cycle minima. The model also reproduces most of
the variability in observed Lyman-alpha irradiance and the Mg II index. The UV
solar irradiance measurements from the UARS and SORCE missions are mutually
consistent up to about 180 nm before they start to exhibit discrepant
rotational and cyclical variability, indicative of unresolved instrumental
effects. As a result, the agreement between model and measurement starts to
deteriorate above this wavelength. As with earlier similar investigations, the
reconstruction cannot reproduce the overall trends in SORCE/SIM SSI. We argue,
from the lack of clear solar cycle modulation in the SIM record and the
inconsistency between the total flux recorded by the instrument and TSI, that
unaccounted instrumental trends are present. The reconstruction is consistent
with observations from multiple sources, demonstrating its validity. It also
provides further evidence that photospheric magnetism is the prime driver of
variation in solar irradiance on timescales greater than a day.

equilibrium for a given finite n-player extensive form game of perfect recall
(EFGPR), where n >= 3. Our results apply to a number of well-studied
refinements, including sequential (SE), extensive-form perfect (PE), and
quasi-perfect equilibrium (QPE). These refine Nash and subgame-perfect
equilibrium. Of these, the most refined notions are PE and QPE. By classic
results, all these equilibria exist in any EFGPR. We show that, for all these
notions of equilibrium, approximating an equilibrium for a given EFGPR, to
within a given desired precision, is FIXP_a-complete. We also consider the
complexity of corresponding ""almost"" equilibrium notions, and show that they
are PPAD-complete. In particular, we define ""delta-almost
epsilon-(quasi-)perfect"" equilibrium, and show computing one is PPAD-complete.
We show these notions refine ""delta-almost subgame-perfect equilibrium"" for
EFGPRs, which is PPAD-complete. Thus, approximating one such (delta-almost)
equilibrium for n-player EFGPRs, n >= 3, is P-time equivalent to approximating
a (delta-almost) NE for a normal form game (NFG) with 3 or more players. NFGs
are trivially encodable as EFGPRs without blowup in size. Thus our results
extend the celebrated complexity results for NFGs to refinements of equilibrium
in the more general setting of EFGPRs. For 2-player EFGPRs, analogous
complexity results follow from the algorithms of Koller, Megiddo, and von
Stengel (1996), von Stengel, van den Elzen, and Talman (2002), and Miltersen

prediction accuracy not much worse than that of the best single model in terms
of mean squared error. It is known that if the models are misspecified, model
averaging is superior to model selection. Specifically, let $n$ be the sample
size, then the worst case regret of the former decays at a rate of $O(1/n)$
while the worst case regret of the latter decays at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$.
The recently proposed $Q$-aggregation algorithm \citep{DaiRigZhang12} solves
the model averaging problem with the optimal regret of $O(1/n)$ both in
expectation and in deviation; however it suffers from two limitations: (1) for
continuous dictionary, the proposed greedy algorithm for solving
$Q$-aggregation is not applicable; (2) the formulation of $Q$-aggregation
appears ad hoc without clear intuition. This paper examines a different
approach to model averaging by considering a Bayes estimator for deviation
optimal model averaging by using exponentiated least squares loss. We establish
a primal-dual relationship of this estimator and that of $Q$-aggregation and
propose new greedy procedures that satisfactorily resolve the above mentioned
limitations of $Q$-aggregation.

by a nonradiative channel between 10 and 300 K. Furthermore, bound and free
excitons in GaN NWs are strongly coupled even at low temperatures resulting in
a common lifetime of these states. By solving the rate equations for a coupled
two-level system, we show that one cannot, in practice, distinguish whether the
nonradiative decay occurs directly via the bound or indirectly via the free
state. The nanowire surface and coalescence-induced dislocations appear to be
the most obvious candidates for nonradiative defects, and we thus compare the
exciton decay times measured for a variety of GaN nanowire ensembles with
different surface-to-volume ratio and coalescence degrees. The data are found
to exhibit no correlation with either of these parameters, i. e., the
dominating nonradiative channel in the GaN nanowires under investigation is
neither related to the nanowire surface, nor to coalescence-induced defects for

  Neuron with Adaptive Kernels","In submission to Frontiers in Neuroscience",,,,"cs.NE q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  This paper describes the Synapto-dendritic Kernel Adapting Neuron (SKAN), a
simple spiking neuron model that performs statistical inference and
unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal spike patterns. SKAN is the first
proposed neuron model to investigate the effects of dynamic synapto-dendritic
kernels and demonstrate their computational power even at the single neuron
scale. The rule-set defining the neuron is simple there are no complex
mathematical operations such as normalization, exponentiation or even
multiplication. The functionalities of SKAN emerge from the real-time
interaction of simple additive and binary processes. Like a biological neuron,
SKAN is robust to signal and parameter noise, and can utilize both in its
operations. At the network scale neurons are locked in a race with each other
with the fastest neuron to spike effectively hiding its learnt pattern from its
neighbors. The robustness to noise, high speed and simple building blocks not
only make SKAN an interesting neuron model in computational neuroscience, but
also make it ideal for implementation in digital and analog neuromorphic
systems which is demonstrated through an implementation in a Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA).

One mechanism advanced to explain glitches in the youngest pulsars is that they
are caused by a starquake, a sudden rearrangement of the crust of the neutron
star. Starquakes have the potential to excite some of the oscillation modes of
the neutron star, which means that they are of interest as a source of
gravitational waves. These oscillations could also have an impact on radio
emission. In this paper we make upper estimates of the amplitude of the
oscillations produced by a starquake, and the corresponding gravitational wave
emission. We then develop a more detailed framework for calculating the
oscillations excited by the starquake, using a toy model of a solid,
incompressible star where all strain is lost instantaneously from the star at
the glitch. For this toy model, we give plots of the amplitudes of the modes
excited, as the shear modulus and rotation rate of the star are varied. We find
that for our specific model, the largest excitation is generally of a mode
similar to the $f$-mode of an incompressible fluid star, but that other modes
of the star are excited to a significant degree over small parameter ranges of
the rotation rate.

Bis(1,4-di-isopropyl-1,3-diazabutadienyl)nickel, Ni(iPr-DAD)2, was used as a Ni
precursor and ammonia plasma was used as a reactant. This was the first attempt
to deposit Ni thin film using Ni(iPr-DAD)2 as a precursor for the ALD process.
The RPALD Ni film was deposited with a growth rate of around 2.2{\AA}/cycle at
250 {\deg}C and showed significant low resistivity of 33 {\mu}{\Omega}cm with a
total impurity concentration of around 10 at. %.The impurities of the thin
film, carbon and nitrogen, were existent by the forms of C-C and C-N in a
bonding state. The impurities removal tendency was investigated by comparing of
experimental conditions, namely process temperature and pressure. Nitrogen
impurity was removed by thermal desorption during each ALD cycle and carbon
impurity was reduced by the optimizing of the process pressure which is
directly related with a mean free path of NH3 plasma. After Ni deposition,
nickel silicide was formed by RTA in a vacuum ambient for 1 minute. A nickel
silicide layer from ALD Ni and PVD Ni was compared at the annealing temperature
from 500 to 900 {\deg}C. NiSi from ALD Ni showed better thermal stability due
to the contribution of small amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the asdeposited
Ni thin film. Degradation of the silicide layer was effectively suppressed with
a use of ALD Ni.

from the direct collapse of hot primordial gas in $\gtrsim 10^4$ K haloes,
forming a supermassive or quasistar as an intermediate stage.
  Aims. We explore the formation of a protostar resulting from the collapse of
primordial gas in the presence of a strong Lyman-Werner radiation background.
Particularly, we investigate the impact of turbulence and rotation on the
fragmentation behaviour of the gas cloud. We accomplish this goal by varying
the initial turbulent and rotational velocities.
  Methods. We performed 3D adaptive mesh refinement simulations with a
resolution of 64 cells per Jeans length using the ENZO code, simulating the
formation of a protostar up to unprecedentedly high central densities of
$10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, and spatial scales of a few solar radii. To achieve this
goal, we employed the KROME package to improve modelling of the chemical and
thermal processes.
  Results. We find that the physical properties of the simulated gas clouds
become similar on small scales, irrespective of the initial amount of
turbulence and rotation. After the highest level of refinement was reached, the
simulations have been evolved for an additional ~5 freefall times. A single
bound clump with a radius of $2 \times 10^{-2}$ AU and a mass of ~$7 \times
10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ is formed at the end of each simulation, marking the onset
of protostar formation. No strong fragmentation is observed by the end of the
simulations, regardless of the initial amount of turbulence or rotation, and
high accretion rates of a few solar masses per year are found.
  Conclusions. Given such high accretion rates, a quasistar of $10^5$
M$_{\odot}$ is expected to form within $10^5$ years.

formalism, we consider a model including the geopotential contribution for
which we compute the secular and resonant expansions of the Hamiltonian.
  Within such model we are able to detect the equilibria and to study the main
features of the resonances in a very effective way. In particular, we analyze
the regular and chaotic behavior of the 1:1 and 2:1 resonant regions by
analytical methods and by computing the Fast Lyapunov Indicators, which provide
a cartography of the resonances. This approach allows us to detect easily the
location of the equilibria, the amplitudes of the libration islands and the
main dynamical stability features of the resonances, thus providing an overview
of the 1:1 and 2:1 resonant domains under the effect of Earth's oblateness.
  The results are validated by a comparison with a model developed in Cartesian
coordinates, including the geopotential, the gravitational attraction of Sun
and Moon and the solar radiation pressure.

Regular Expressions (PRE), which may include back references in addition to the
standard operations union, concatenation, and star.
  The following results are obtained:
  PRE can be simulated by the classical model of nondeterministic finite
automata with sensing one-way heads. The number of heads depends on the number
of different variables in the expressions.
  A space bound O(n log m) for matching a text of length m with a PRE with n
variables based on the previous simulation. This improves the bound O(nm) from
(C\^ampeanu and Santean 2009).
  PRE cannot be simulated by deterministic finite automata with at most three
sensing one-way heads or deterministic finite automata with any number of
non-sensing one-way heads.
  PRE with a bounded number of occurrences of variables in any match can be
simulated by nondeterministic finite automata with one-way heads.
  There is a tight hierarchy of PRE with a growing number of non-nested
variables over a fixed alphabet. A previously known hierarchy was based on
nested variables and growing alphabets (Larsen 1998).
  Matching of PRE without star over a single-letter alphabet is NP-complete.
This strengthens the corresponding result for expressions over larger alphabets
and with star (Aho 1990).
  Inequivalence of PRE without closure operators is Sigma^P_2-complete.
  The decidability of universality of PRE over a single letter alphabet is
linked to the existence of Fermat Primes.
  Greibach's Theorem applies to languages characterized by PRE.

is consistent with the $\phi^4$ theory with a finite scalar-curvature coupling.
It is found that the RG running induces a non-universal contribution for $n_s$

International Conference on Concurrency Theory.
  The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the
expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in
the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison
between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic
and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation
(such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and
rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS
workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus
has become broadly construed.
  The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future
investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the
specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the
concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and
practice of SOS. Reports on applications of SOS to other fields are also most
welcome, including: modelling and analysis of biological systems, security of
computer systems programming, modelling and analysis of embedded systems,
specification of middle-ware and coordination languages, programming language
semantics and implementation, static analysis software and hardware
verification, and semantics for domain-specific languages and model-based
engineering.

anonymized social networks which enables novel anonymization techniques to be
quickly evaluated. It uses machine learning (decision forests) to matching
pairs of nodes in disparate anonymized sub-graphs. The technique uncovers
artefacts and invariants of any black-box anonymization scheme from a small set
of examples. Despite a high degree of automation, classification succeeds with
significant true positive rates even when small false positive rates are
sought. Our evaluation uses publicly available real world datasets to study the
performance of our approach against real-world anonymization strategies, namely
the schemes used to protect datasets of The Data for Development (D4D)
Challenge. We show that the technique is effective even when only small numbers
of samples are used for training. Further, since it detects weaknesses in the
black-box anonymization scheme it can re-identify nodes in one social network
when trained on another.

materials that can be used without conventional liquid-helium cooling to 4.2 K.
Herein, we demonstrate that 40-K-class metallic HTS magnesium diboride (MgB2)
makes an excellent permanent bulk magnet, maintaining 3 T at 20 K for 1 week
with an extremely high stability (<0.1 ppm/h). The magnetic field trapped in
this magnet is uniformly distributed, as for single-crystalline
neodymium-iron-boron. Magnetic hysteresis loop of the MgB2 permanent bulk
magnet was detrmined. Because MgB2 is a simple-binary-line compound that does
not contain rare-earth metals, polycrystalline bulk material can be
industrially fabricated at low cost and with high yield to serve as strong
magnets that are compatible with conventional compact cryocoolers, making MgB2
bulks promising for the next generation of Tesla-class permanent-magnet
applications.

adding the Hilbert-Einstein term to the action, quantum corrections to the

undertaken through cognitive processing activities. Affects (emotions, moods,

productivity of individuals. SE research needs to incorporate affect
measurements to valorize human factors and to enhance management styles.
  Objective: analyze the affects dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance
of software developers and their real-time correlation with their self-assessed
productivity (sPR).
  Method: repeated measurements design with 8 participants (4 students, 4
professionals), conveniently sampled and studied individually over 90 minutes
of programming. The analysis was performed by fitting a linear mixed- effects
(LME) model.
  Results: valence and dominance are positively correlated with the sPR. The
model was able to express about 38% of deviance from the sPR. Many lessons were
learned when employing psychological measurements in SE and for fitting LME.

the ensemble is an $L$-cloned network constructed from $L$ copies of the
original network. The degree distribution of an $L$-cloned network and, more
importantly, the degree-degree correlation between and beyond nearest neighbors
are identical to those of the original network. The density of triangles in an
\LC network, and hence its clustering coefficient, is reduced by a factor of
$L$ compared to those of the original network. Furthermore, the density of
loops of any fixed length approaches zero for sufficiently large values of $L$.
Other variants of $L$-cloning allow us to keep intact the short loops of
certain lengths. As an application, we employ these network cloning methods to
investigate the effect of short loops on dynamical processes running on
networks and to inspect the accuracy of corresponding tree-based theories. We
demonstrate that dynamics on $L$-cloned networks (with sufficiently large $L$)

approximation methods, and the belief propagation algorithm used respectively
to study bond percolation, SI epidemics, and the Ising model.

  Binghamton, NY-13902, U.S.A.)",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have introduced two crossover operators, MMX-BLXexploit and
MMX-BLXexplore, for simultaneously solving multiple feature/subset selection
problems where the features may have numeric attributes and the subset sizes
are not predefined. These operators differ on the level of exploration and
exploitation they perform; one is designed to produce convergence controlled
mutation and the other exhibits a quasi-constant mutation rate. We illustrate
the characteristic of these operators by evolving pattern detectors to
distinguish alcoholics from controls using their visually evoked response
potentials (VERPs). This task encapsulates two groups of subset selection
problems; choosing a subset of EEG leads along with the lead-weights (features
with attributes) and the other that defines the temporal pattern that
characterizes the alcoholic VERPs. We observed better generalization
performance from MMX-BLXexplore. Perhaps, MMX-BLXexploit was handicapped by not
having a restart mechanism. These operators are novel and appears to hold
promise for solving simultaneous feature selection problems.

interval higher spin R$\acute{e}$nyi and entanglement entropy for two
dimensional conformal field theory with $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}(\lambda)$
symmetry. The system is at finite temperature and is deformed by higher spin
chemical potential. We manage to compute higher spin R$\acute{e}$nyi entropy
with various spin deformations up to order $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2)$. For spin 3
deformation, we calculate exact higher spin R$\acute{e}$nyi entropy up to
$\mathcal{O}(\mu^4)$. When $\lambda=3$, in the large $c$ limit, we find perfect
match with tree level holographic higher spin entanglement entropy up to order
$\mu^4$ obtained by the Wilson line prescription. We also find quantum
corrections to higher spin entanglement entropy which is beyond tree level
holographic results. The quantum correction is universal at order $\mu^4$ in
the sense that it is independent of $\lambda$. Our computation relies on a
multi-valued conformal map from $n$-sheeted Riemann surface $\mathcal{R}_n$ to
complex plane and correlation functions of primary fields on complex plane. The
method can be applied to general conformal field theories with $\mathcal{W}$
symmetry.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). It has been suggested that BBD-GRBs result from the
merger of a binary system formed by a neutron star and the helium core of an
evolved star. We have modelled the propagation of ultrarelativistic jets
through the environment left behind the merger by means of relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations. In this paper, the output of our numerical models is
post-processed to obtain the (thermal) radiative signature of the resulting
outflow. We outline the most relevant dynamical details of the jet propagation
and connect them to the generation of thermal radiation in GRB events akin to
that of GRB 101225A. A comprehensive parameter study of the jet/environment
interaction has been performed and synthetic light curves are confronted with
the observational data. The thermal emission in our models originates from the
interaction between the jet and the hydrogen envelope ejected during the
neutron star/He core merger. We find that the lack of a classical afterglow and
the accompanying thermal emission in BBD-GRBs can be explained by the
interaction of an ultrarelativistic jet with a toroidally shaped ejecta whose
axis coincides with the binary rotation axis. The spectral inversion and
reddening happening at about 2 d in GRB 101225A can be related to the time at
which the massive shell ejected in an early phase of the common envelope
evolution of the progenitor system is completely ablated by the
ultrarelativistic jet.

noticing that the corresponding Fermi energy is exactly the same as if one
directly polymerizes the momentum $p_F$. We also obtain the corresponding
expansion of thermodynamical variables for small values of the polymer length

major challenge in mathematical physics has been the derivation of macroscopic
evolution equations from the fundamental microscopic laws of classical or
quantum mechanics. Macroscopic transport equations lie at the heart of many
important physical theories, including fluid dynamics, condensed matter theory
and nuclear physics. The rigorous derivation of macroscopic transport equations
is thus not only a conceptual exercise that establishes their consistency with
the fundamental laws of physics: the possibility of finding deviations and
corrections to classical evolution equations makes this subject both
intellectually exciting and relevant in practical applications. The plan of
these lectures is to develop a renormalisation technique that will allow us to

a stroke-averaged dumbbell swimmer with prescribed dipolar force pairs. Using
both simulations and qualitative arguments, we show that, when the separation
between swimmers is comparable to their size, the swimmers' motions are
strongly affected by activity-induced hydrodynamic forces. To further
understand these effects, we investigate semidilute suspensions of swimmers in
the presence of thermal fluctuations. A direct comparison between simulations
with and without hydrodynamic interactions shows these to enhance the dynamic
clustering at a relatively small volume fraction; with our chosen model the key
ingredient for this clustering behavior is hydrodynamic trapping of one swimmer
by another, induced by the active forces. Furthermore, the density dependence
of the motility (of both the translational and rotational motions) exhibits
distinctly different behaviors with and without hydrodynamic interactions; we

unaffected; a key result is that the domain $v\_c^{L}=c$, where $c$ is the
sound velocity in the Fermi superfluid, is turned into a domain
$v\_c^{L}=c+c\_B$, where $c\_B$ is the sound velocity in the Bose superfluid,
with slightly shifted boundaries.

extragalactic radio sources, of unknown origin but extremely energetic. We
propose here a new explanation - not requiring an extreme release of energy -
involving a body (planet, asteroid, white dwarf) orbiting an extragalactic
pulsar. We investigate a theory of radio waves associated to such
pulsar-orbiting bodies. We focus our analysis on the waves emitted from the
magnetic wake of the body in the pulsar wind. After deriving their properties,
we compare them with the observations of various transient radio signals in
order to see if they could originate from pulsar-orbiting bodies. The analysis
is based on the theory of Alfv\'en wings: for a body immersed in a pulsar wind,
a system of two stationary Alfv\'en waves is attached to the body, provided
that the wind is highly magnetized. When destabilized through plasma
instabilities, Alfv\'en wings can be the locus of strong radio sources
convected with the pulsar wind. Assuming a cyclotron maser instability
operating in the Alfv\'en wings, we make predictions about the shape,
frequencies and brightness of the resulting radio emissions. Because of the
beaming by relativistic aberration, the signal is seen only when the companion
is perfectly aligned between its parent pulsar and the observer, as for
occultations. For pulsar winds with a high Lorentz factor, the whole duration
of the radio event does not exceed a few seconds, and it is composed of one to
four peaks lasting a few milliseconds each, detectable up to distances of
several Mpc. The Lorimer burst, the three isolated pulses of PSR J1928+15, and
the recently detected fast radio bursts are all compatible with our model.
According to it, these transient signals should repeat periodically with the
companion's orbital period. The search of pulsar-orbiting bodies could be an
exploration theme for new- or next-generation radio telescopes.

bounded, and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second, we propose a
deep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their
combinations, so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned
rules. This way, only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle
unconstrained face detection. Furthermore, we show that the NPD features can be
efficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template can be
easily scaled, making the proposed face detector very fast. Experimental
results on three public face datasets (FDDB, GENKI, and CMU-MIT) show that the
