  a Certification Authority","Study Thesis",,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Often, security is considered in an advanced stage of the implementation of a
system, rather than integrating it into the system design. This leads to less
secure systems, as the security mechanisms are only applied as an afterthought
and therefore do not integrate well with the rest of the design. Also, several
statistics about discovered vulnerabilities in existing systems suggest, that
most of the vulnerabilities of a system are not caused by errors in the
cryptographic primitives, but in other parts of the implementation. So
integrating security concerns early in the design process seems a promising
approach for increasing the security of the resulting system.
  This work evaluates how the choice of the architectural style affects the
security of the resulting system. The evaluation is done on the example of an
existing certification authority (CA). The requirements for the system are
gathered and multiple designs according to different architectural styles are
drafted and evaluated using a risk evaluation method. Then the evaluated
designs are compared to find out whether there are significant differences.

and shape its evolutionary trajectory. When a protein experiences a changed
environment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness
landscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic
interactions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is
known about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the
long-term evolution of a protein. Here we analyze the evolution of epistasis in
the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using protease
sequences collected for almost a decade from both treated and untreated
patients, to understand how epistasis changes and how those changes impact the
long-term evolvability of a protein. We use an information-theoretic proxy for
epistasis that quantifies the co-variation between sites, and show that
positive information is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that detects
epistasis in most cases. We analyze the ""fossils"" of the evolutionary
trajectories of the protein contained in the sequence data, and show that
epistasis continues to enrich under strong selection, but not for proteins
whose environment is unchanged. The increase in epistasis compensates for the
information loss due to sequence variability brought about by treatment, and
facilitates adaptation in the increasingly rugged fitness landscape of
treatment. While epistasis is thought to enhance evolvability via
valley-crossing early-on in adaptation, it can hinder adaptation later when the
landscape has turned rugged. However, we find no evidence that the HIV-1
protease has reached its potential for evolution after 9 years of adapting to a
drug environment that itself is constantly changing.

convex calibration dimension of a multiclass loss matrix, which measures the
smallest `size' of a prediction space in which it is possible to design a
convex surrogate that is calibrated with respect to the loss matrix. We derive
both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze
various loss matrices. In particular, we apply our framework to study various
subset ranking losses, and use the convex calibration dimension as a tool to
show both the existence and non-existence of various types of convex calibrated

$\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills with a level $k$ Chern-Simons term and an
adjoint hypermultiplet. As in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theories, one must
choose an integration contour to completely define the theory. Using
localization, we reduce the path integral to a matrix model with a cubic action
and compute its free energy in various scenarios. In the limit of infinite
Yang-Mills coupling and for particular choices of the contours, we find that
the free-energy scales as $N^{5/2}$ for $U(N)$ gauge groups with large values
of the Chern-Simons 't\,Hooft coupling, $\tilde\lambda\equiv N/k$. If we also
set the hypermultiplet mass to zero, then this limit is a superconformal fixed
point and the $N^{5/2}$ behavior parallels other fixed points which have known
supergravity duals. We also demonstrate that $SU(N)$ gauge groups cannot have
this $N^{5/2}$ scaling for their free-energy. At finite Yang-Mills coupling we
establish the existence of a third order phase transition where the theory
crosses over from the Yang-Mills phase to the Chern-Simons phase. The phase
transition exists for any value of $\tilde\lambda$, although the details differ
between small and large values of $\tilde\lambda$. For pure Chern-Simons
theories we present evidence for a chain of phase transitions as
$\tilde\lambda$ is increased.
  We also find the expectation values for supersymmetric circular Wilson loops
in these various scenarios and show that the Chern-Simons term leads to
different physical properties for fundamental and anti-fundamental Wilson
loops. Different choices of the integration contours also lead to different
properties for the loops.

phase transitions have been identified at 2.73 and 0.48 K. For the field, H,
applied along the a and b axes, a single boundary is identified that delineates
the transition from a low field, low temperature magnetically ordered regime to
a high field, high temperature paramagnetic phase. Several field-induced
transitions, however, have been observed with H || c. The measurements have
been used to map out the magnetic phase diagram of SrGd2O4, suggesting that it
is a complex system with several competing magnetic interactions. The
low-temperature magnetic behavior of SrGd2O4 is very different compared to the
other SrLn2O4 (Ln = Lanthanide) compounds, even though all of the SrLn2O4
compounds are isostructural, with the magnetic ions forming a low-dimensional
lattice of zigzag chains that run along the c axis. The differences are likely
to be due to the fact that in the ground state Gd3+ has zero orbital angular
momentum and therefore the spin-orbit interactions, which are crucial for other
SrLn2O4 compounds, can largely be neglected. Instead, given the relatively
short Gd3+-Gd3+ distances in SrGd2O4, dipolar interactions must be taken into
account for this antiferromagnet alongside the Heisenberg exchange terms.

channels giving support for the sheared arcade or weakly twisted flux rope

screening techniques in order to improve the forecasting of solar wind
high-speed streams from coronal hole observations in solar EUV images.

a constraint formulated in terms of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This
amounts to solving a linear problem. However, in its original formulation this
linear problem has a very large number of linear constraints, too many to be
enforced in practice. In the literature this is addressed by a reformulation of
the problem using so-called dummy variables. This reduces the large number of
constraints in the original linear problem at the cost of increasing the number
of variables. In the context of reinsurance portfolio optimization we observe
that the increase in variable count can lead to situations where solving the
reformulated problem takes a long time. Therefore we suggest a different
approach. We solve the original linear problem with cutting-plane method: The
proposed algorithm starts with the solution of a relaxed problem and then
iteratively adds cuts until the solution is approximated within a preset
threshold. This is a new approach. For a reinsurance case study we show that a
significant reduction of necessary computer resources can be achieved.

hyperspectral sensors. Spectral unmixing problem refers to decomposing mixed
pixels into a set of endmembers and abundance fractions. Due to nonnegativity
constraint on abundance fractions, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
methods have been widely used for solving spectral unmixing problem. In this
letter we proposed using multilayer NMF (MLNMF) for the purpose of
hyperspectral unmixing. In this approach, spectral signature matrix can be
modeled as a product of sparse matrices. In fact MLNMF decomposes the
observation matrix iteratively in a number of layers. In each layer, we applied
sparseness constraint on spectral signature matrix as well as on abundance
fractions matrix. In this way signatures matrix can be sparsely decomposed
despite the fact that it is not generally a sparse matrix. The proposed
algorithm is applied on synthetic and real datasets. Synthetic data is
generated based on endmembers from USGS spectral library. AVIRIS Cuprite
dataset has been used as a real dataset for evaluation of proposed method.
Results of experiments are quantified based on SAD and AAD measures. Results in
comparison with previously proposed methods show that the multilayer approach
can unmix data more effectively.

applications. Based on the type of routing for queries among their nodes, they
are classified into three groups: structured, unstructured and small-world P2P
networks. Each of these categories has its own applications and benefits.
Structured networks by using Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) can forward request
search queries more efficiently. These networks usually organize a specific
topology and make a geometrical shape. A circular topology is a prevalent
design which was first introduced by Chord. In this paper, we propose BSROne, a
circular structured P2P design which attempts to consider several shortcomings
in the current networks. In our proposed method, we want to achieve O(1)
routing time without requiring all of the nodes to know about each other. By
removing the real connections between nodes and tying all of them with
super-nodes, we could reduce the number of overheads that are essential to
maintain the connectivity between nodes in such networks. Furthermore, we gave
the network an ability to scale up by introducing one layer above super-nodes.
We achieved this by emulating the design of binary search algorithm for
supreme-nodes. In this paper, at first we introduce a design where fixed
super-nodes with unlimited resources are given to the distributed network. In
the next step, we explain how it can manage to work as a P2P application. We
finally discuss the possibility of removing the scalability issue in a P2P
environment for our design.

three orders of magnitude while the networks withstand relatively large
stresses without rupturing. Here, we perform an analytical and numerical study
on model networks in three dimensions. Our model consists of a collection of
randomly oriented rigid filaments connected by flexible crosslinks that are
modeled as wormlike chains. Due to zero probability of filament intersection in
three dimensions, our model networks are by construction prestressed in terms
of initial tension in the crosslinks. We demonstrate how the linear elastic
modulus can be related to the prestress in these network. Under the assumption
of affine deformations in the limit of infinite crosslink density, we show
analytically that the nonlinear elastic regime in 1- and 2-dimensional networks
is characterized by power-law scaling of the elastic modulus with the stress.
In contrast, 3-dimensional networks show an exponential dependence of the
modulus on stress. Independent of dimensionality, if the crosslink density is
finite, we show that the only persistent scaling exponent is that of the single
wormlike chain. We further show that there is no qualitative change in the
stiffening behavior of filamentous networks even if the filaments are
bending-compliant. Consequently, unlike suggested in prior work, the model
system studied here cannot provide an explanation for the experimentally
observed linear scaling of the modulus with the stress in filamentous networks.

written as a sum over terms which display the various propagator poles of

straightforward application of Feynman rules are not satisfying any particular
relations, typically. However, by reshuffling terms, it is known that one can
arrive at a set of numerators which satisfy the same Jacobi identity as the
corresponding color factors. By extending previous work by us we show how this
can be systematically accomplished within a Lagrangian framework. We construct
an effective Lagrangian which yields tree-level color-kinematic symmetric
numerators in Yang-Mills theories in a light-like gauge at five-points. The
five-point effective Lagrangian is non-local and it is zero by Jacobi identity.
The numerators obtained from it respect the original pole structure of the
color-ordered amplitude. We discuss how this procedure can be systematically
extended to higher order.

($W_R$) in a TeV-scale Left-Right seesaw model (LRSM) for neutrino masses. For
generic Dirac mass of the neutrinos, i.e. with all Yukawa couplings $\lesssim
10^{-5.5}$, it has been pointed out that successful leptogenesis requires a
lower bound of 18 TeV on the $W_R$ mass, pushing it beyond the reach of LHC.
Such TeV-scale LRSM must, however, be parity-asymmetric for type-I seesaw to
give the observed neutrino masses. This class of models can accommodate larger
Yukawa couplings, which give simultaneous fits to charged-lepton and neutrino
masses, by invoking either cancellations or specific symmetry-textures for
Dirac ($M_D$) and Majorana ($M_N$) masses in the seesaw formula. We show that
in this case, the leptogenesis bound on $M_{W_R}$ can be substantially weaker,
i.e. $M_{W_R}\gtrsim 3$ TeV for $M_N \lesssim M_{W_R}$. This happens due to
considerable reduction of the dilution effects from $W_R$-mediated decays and
scatterings, while the washout effects due to inverse decays are under control
for certain parameter ranges of the Yukawa couplings. We also show that this
model is consistent with all other low energy constraints, such as lepton
flavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. Thus, a discovery of the
right-handed gauge bosons alone at the LHC will not falsify leptogenesis as the
mechanism behind the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe.

constructed 2-D maps of the GC distribution. We present the clearest evidence
to date showing the difference in concentration between red and blue GCs over
the extent of the cluster, where the red (metal-rich) GCs are largely located
around the massive early-type galaxies, whilst the blue (metal-poor) GCs have a
more extended spatial distribution, with significant populations present beyond
83' (215 kpc) along the major axes of M49 and M87. The GC distribution around
M87 and M49 shows remarkable agreement with the shape, ellipticity and boxiness
of the diffuse light surrounding both galaxies. We find evidence for spatial
enhancements of GCs surrounding M87 that may be indicative of recent
interactions or an ongoing merger history. We compare the GC map to the
locations of Virgo galaxies and the intracluster X-ray gas, and find good
agreement between these baryonic structures. The Virgo cluster contains a total
population of 67300$\pm$14400 GCs, of which 35% are located in M87 and M49
alone. We compute a cluster-wide specific frequency S_N,CL=$2.8\pm0.7$,

inflation. Alternatively, the breaking of a U(1) symmetry induced by the FI
term can dynamically generate the quadratic potential of chaotic inflation. The
purpose of this note is to study the possible UV embedding of these schemes in
terms of the `field-dependent FI term' related to a string modulus field which
is stabilized by a non-perturbative superpotential. We find that in settings
where the FI term drives inflation, gauge invariance prevents a decoupling of
the modulus from the inflationary dynamics. The resulting inflation models
generically contain additional dynamical degrees of freedom compared to D-term

be obtained in complete analogy to the case of a constant FI term. We present a

Telescope which will be installed in around 2017. It is a multi-object
spectrograph fed by about 2400 fibers placed at the prime focus covering a
hexagonal field-of-view with 1.35 deg diagonals and capable of simultaneously
obtaining data of spectra with wavelengths ranging from 0.38 um to 1.26 um. The
spectrograph system is composed of four identical modules each receiving the
light from 600 fibers. Each module incorporates three channels covering the
wavelength ranges 0.38-0.65 mu (""Blue""), 0.63-0.97 mu (""Red""), and 0.94-1.26 mu
(""NIR"") respectively; with resolving power which progresses fairly smoothly
from about 2000 in the blue to about 4000 in the infrared. An additional
spectral mode allows reaching a spectral resolution of 5000 at 0.8mu (red). The
proposed optical design is based on a Schmidt collimator facing three Schmidt
cameras (one per spectral channel). This architecture is very robust, well
known and documented. It allows for high image quality with only few simple
elements (high throughput) at the expense of the central obscuration, which
leads to larger optics. Each module has to be modular in its design to allow
for integration and tests and for its safe transport up to the telescope: this
is the main driver for the mechanical design. In particular, each module will
be firstly fully integrated and validated at LAM (France) before it is shipped
to Hawaii. All sub-assemblies will be indexed on the bench to allow for their
accurate repositioning. This paper will give an overview of the spectrograph
system which has successfully passed the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2014
March and which is now in the construction phase.

affect the morphology of their bow shocks. We run two-dimensional axisymmetric
hydrodynamical simulations following the evolution of the circumstellar medium
of these stars in the Galactic plane from the main sequence to the red
supergiant phase. We find that thermal conduction is an important process
governing the shape, size and structure of the bow shocks around hot stars, and
that they have an optical luminosity mainly produced by forbidden lines, e.g.
[OIII]. The Ha emission of the bow shocks around hot stars originates from near
their contact discontinuity. The H$\alpha$ emission of bow shocks around cool
stars originates from their forward shock, and is too faint to be observed for
the bow shocks that we simulate. The emission of optically-thin radiation
mainly comes from the shocked ISM material. All bow shock models are brighter
in the infrared, i.e. the infrared is the most appropriate waveband to search
for bow shocks. Our study suggests that the infrared emission comes from near
the contact discontinuity for bow shocks of hot stars and from the inner region
of shocked wind for bow shocks around cool stars. We predict that, in the
Galactic plane, the brightest, i.e. the most easily detectable bow shocks are
produced by high-mass stars moving with small space velocities.

wide-field corrector developed for Hyper Suprime-Cam. The positioner contains
2400 fibers and covers a 1.3~degree hexagonal field of view.
  The spectrograph optical design consists of a Schmidt collimator, two
dichroic beamsplitters to split the light into three channels, and for each
channel a volume phase holographic (VPH) grating and a dual-corrector, modified
Schmidt reimaging camera. This design provides a 275~mm collimated beam

and good imaging performance at the fast f/1.05 focal ratio required from the
cameras to avoid oversampling the fibers. The three channels are designated as
the blue, red, and near-infrared (NIR), and cover the bandpasses 380--650~nm
(blue), 630--970~nm (red), and 0.94--1.26~\textmu m (NIR). A mosaic of two
Hamamatsu 2k$\times$4k, 15~\textmu m pixel CCDs records the spectra in the blue

substrate-removed HAWAII-4RG array from Teledyne, with 15~\textmu m pixels and
a 1.7~\textmu m wavelength cutoff.
  VPH gratings were an obvious choice for PFS and a set of three prototype VPH
gratings (one each of the blue, red, and NIR designs) was ordered and has been
recently delivered. In this paper we present the design and specifications for
the PFS gratings, the plan and setups used for testing both the prototype and
final gratings, and results from recent optical testing of the prototype

emergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitive
observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) for
a disk at D=100 pc. The models readily distinguish between high ionization
rates ($\zeta\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ per H$_2$) and below, but it becomes
difficult to distinguish between low ionization models when
$\zeta\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. We find that \htdp\ emission is not

\ntdp\ emission may be a more sensitive tracer of midplane ionization. HCO$^+$
traces X-rays and high CR rates ($\zeta_{\rm{CR}}\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),

radial region and samples a large gradient in temperature, can exhibit
ring-like emission as a consequence of low-lying rotational level de-excitation

the last 2 Myrs to examine whether the site of the fission can be revealed. We
studied the possibility that the sub-surface material, perhaps on one
hemisphere, has spectral characteristics differing from the original weathered
surface, by performing rotationally-resolved spectroscopic observations to look
for local variations as the asteroid rotates. We observed 11 asteroids in pairs
in the near-IR and visible range. Photometry was also conducted to determine
the rotational phases of a spectrum on the asteroid lightcurves. We do not
detect any rotational spectral variations within the signal-to-noise, which
allow us to constrain the extent of any existing surface heterogeneity.
  For each observed spectrum of a longitudinal segment of an asteroid, we
estimate the maximal size of an un-detected ""spot"" with a spectral signature
different than the average. For 5 asteroids the maximal diameter of such a spot
is smaller by a factor of two than the diameter of the secondary member.
Therefore, the site of the fission is larger than any area with a unique
spectral parameters and the site of the fission does not have a unique
spectrum. In the case of an S-complex asteroid, where the site of fission is
expected to present non-weathered spectra, a lack of a fission spot can be
explained if the rotational-fission process is followed by the spread of dust
that re-accumulates on the primary asteroid and covers it homogeneously. This
is demonstrated for the young asteroid 6070 that presents an Sq-type spectrum
while its inner material, that is presumably revealed on the surface of its
secondary member, 54827, has a fresher, Q-type spectrum. The spread of dust
observed in the disruption event of asteroid P/2013 R3, might be an example of
such a process and an indication that it was indeed formed in a

sleptons are strongly enhanced for a non-Bino-like LSP: the 95% C.L. limit for
$m_{\tilde\ell_L}$ extends from 300 GeV for a Bino-like LSP to about 370 GeV

the strongest (~ 490 GeV) for $M_1/M_2$ ~ $-\tan^2\theta_W$ and is the weakest
(~ 220 GeV) for $M_1/M_2$ ~ $\tan^2\theta_W$. We also calculate prospective

varies from 550 (670) GeV for a Bino-like (Wino-like) LSP to 900 (390) GeV for
a Higgsino-like LSP under the most optimistic (pessimistic) scenario. The reach
for the right-handed slepton is about 440 GeV. The corresponding 5$\sigma$
discovery sensitivity is about 100 GeV smaller. For 300 fb$^{-1}$ integrated

partial agreement with discovery paper. Analyzing transit times (T0s) covering
12 quarters of Kepler data, that we have found a new best-fit solution. This
solution outputs masses that are about 55% of the values proposed in the
discovery paper; this leads to a reduced semi-amplitude of the radial
velocities of about 12.80 m/s.

spectrograph is assured by a convex curved slit with a linear array of 616
optical fibers. In this paper we present a design of a slit that ensures the
right direction of the fibers by using masks of micro holes. This kind of mask
is made by a technique called electroforming, which is able to produce a nickel
plate with holes in a linear sequence. The precision error is around 1micron in
the diameter and 1 micron in the positions of the holes. This nickel plate may
be produced with a thickness between 50 and 200 microns, so it may be very
flexible. This flexibility allows the mask to be bent into the shape necessary
for a curved slit. The concept requires two masks, which we call Front Mask,
and Rear Mask, separated by a gap that defines the thickness of the slit. The
pitch and the diameter of the holes define the linear geometry of the slit; the
curvature of each mask defines the angular geometry of the slit. Obviously,
this assembly must be mounted inside a structure rigid and strong enough to be
supported inside the spectrograph. This structure must have a CTE optimized to
avoid displacement of the fibers or increased FRD of the fibers when the device
is submitted to temperatures around 3 degrees Celsius, the temperature of
operation of the spectrograph. We have produced two models. Both are mounted
inside a very compact Invar case, and both have their front surfaces covered by
a dark composite, to reduce stray light. Furthermore, we have conducted
experiments with two different internal structures to minimize effects caused
by temperature gradients.

suitability of GeoPass for widespread use. First, we performed a field study
over two months, in which users in a real-world setting remembered their
location-passwords 96% of the time and showed improvement with more login
sessions. Second, we conducted a study to test how users would fare with
multiple location-passwords and found that users remembered their
location-passwords in less than 70% of login sessions, with 40% of login
failures due to interference effects. Third, we conducted a study to examine
the resilience of GeoPass against shoulder surfing. Our participants played the
role of attackers and had an overall success rate of 48%. Based on our results,
we suggest suitable applications of GeoPass in its current state and identify
aspects of GeoPass that must be improved before widespread deployment could be

increase its the efficiency. The surface roughness measured in several samples
after high performance polishing was about 0.01 microns. Furthermore, the time
for obtaining a polished surface with this quality is about 10 times less than
the time required for polishing a brass, glass or ceramic surface of the same
size. In this paper, we describe the procedure developed for high quality
polishing of this type of slit. The cylindrical polishing described here, uses
cylindrical concave metal bases on which glass paper is based. The polishing
process consists to use grid sequences of 30 microns, 12 microns, 9 microns, 5
microns, 3 microns, 1 micron and, finally, a colloidal silica on a chemical
cloth. To obtain the maximum throughput, the surface of the fibers should be
polished in such a way that they are optically flat and free from scratches.
The optical fibers are inspected with a microscope at all stages of the
polishing process to ensure high quality. The efficiency of the process may be
improved by using a cylindrical concave composite base as a substrate suitable

CMF, named incremental compute-and-forward (ICMF), is proposed that performs
quite well in terms of the outage probability. We show that the distributed
ICMF scheme can even outperform the achievable rate of centralized optimal CMF
in strong enough inter relay links, with much less complexity. Then, as the
second scheme, amplify-forward and compute (AFC) is introduced in which the
equations are recovered in the destination rather than in the relays. Finally,
ICMF and AFC schemes are combined to present hybrid compute-amplify and forward
(HCAF) relaying scheme, which takes advantages of both ICMF, and AFC and
improves the performance of the ICMF considerably. We evaluate the performance
of the proposed strategies in terms of the outage probability and compare the
results with those of the conventional CMF strategy, the Decode and Forward
(DF) strategy, and also the centralized optimal CMF. The results indicate the
substantial superiority of the proposed schemes compared with the conventional

$\Lambda$CDM cosmology to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe. A
popular such model is $f(R)$ gravity, in which the Ricci scalar in the
Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by a general function of it. We study the
$f(R)$ model of Hu & Sawicki (2007), which recovers standard General Relativity
in high density regimes, while reproducing the desired late-time acceleration
at cosmological scales. We run a suite of high resolution zoom simulations
using the ECOSMOG code to examine the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the
properties of a halo that is analogous to the Virgo cluster. We show that the
velocity dispersion profiles can potentially discriminate between $f(R)$ models
and $\Lambda$CDM, and provide complementary analysis of lensing signal profiles
to explore the possibility to further distinguish the different $f(R)$ models.
Our results confirm the techniques explored by Cabre et al. (2012) to quantify
the effect of environment in the behavior of $f(R)$ gravity, and we extend them
to study halo satellites at various redshifts. We find that the modified
gravity effects in our models are most observable at low redshifts, and that
effects are generally stronger for satellites far from the center of the main
halo. We show that the screening properties of halo satellites trace very well
that of dark matter particles, which means that low-resolution simulations in
which subhalos are not very well resolved can in principle be used to study
satellite properties. We discuss observables, particularly for halo satellites,
that can potentially be used to constrain the observational viability of $f(R)$

of a community. Unfortunately, entropy-based diversity indices, or diversity
indices for short, suffer from three problems. First, when computing the
diversity for samples withdrawn from communities with different structures,
diversity indices can easily yield non-comparable and hard to interpret
results. Second, diversity indices impose weighting schemes on the species
distributions that unnecessarily emphasize low abundant rare species, or
erroneously identified ones. Third, diversity indices do not allow for
comparing distributions against each other, which is necessary when a community
has a well-known species' distribution.
  In this paper we propose a new general methodology based on information
theoretic principles to quantify the species diversity of a community. Our
methodology, comprised of two steps, naturally overcomes the previous mentioned
problems, and yields comparable and easy to interpret diversity values. We show
that our methodology retains all the functional properties of any diversity
index, and yet is far more flexible than entropy--based diversity indices. Our
methodology is easy to implement and is applicable to any community of
interest.

  Reduction of CO2 to Methanol",,,"10.1021/ja510131a",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We use quantum chemical calculations to elucidate a viable homogeneous
mechanism for pyridine-catalyzed reduction of CO2 to methanol. In the first
component of the catalytic cycle, pyridine (Py) undergoes a H+ transfer (PT) to
form pyridinium (PyH+) followed by an e- transfer (ET) to produce pyridinium
radical (PyH0). Examples of systems to effect this ET to populate the LUMO of
PyH+(E0calc ~ -1.3V vs. SCE) to form the solution phase PyH0 via highly
reducing electrons include the photo-electrochemical p-GaP system (ECBM ~ -1.5V
vs. SCE at pH= 5) and the photochemical [Ru(phen)3]2+/ascorbate system. We
predict that PyH0 undergoes further PT-ET steps to form the key closed-shell,
dearomatized 1,2-dihydropyridine (PyH2) species. Our proposed sequential
PT-ET-PT-ET mechanism transforming Py into PyH2 is consistent with the
mechanism described in the formation of related dihydropyridines. Because it is
driven by its proclivity to regain aromaticity, PyH2 is a potent recyclable
organo-hydride donor that mimics the role of NADPH in the formation of C-H
bonds in the photosynthetic CO2 reduction process. In particular, in the second
component of the catalytic cycle, we predict that the PyH2/Py redox couple is
kinetically and thermodynamically competent in catalytically effecting hydride
and proton transfers (the latter often mediated by a proton relay chain) to CO2
and its two succeeding intermediates, namely formic acid and formaldehyde, to
ultimately form CH3OH. The hydride and proton transfers for the first reduction
step, i.e. reduction of CO2, are sequential in nature; by contrast, they are
coupled in each of the two subsequent hydride and proton transfers to reduce
formic acid and formaldehyde.

components and ten narrow emission lines. Three ionized absorbing components
produce features in the soft X-ray band. The fourth ionization component
produces FeXXV-XXVI in the hard- energy band. We study the absorbers time
response to well detect changes in the X-ray luminosity of this source, only
two components show clear opacity changes consistent with gas close to
photoionization equilibrium. The other two components do not seem to respond to
continuum variations. This response time allows us to constrain their location.
One outflowing component must be located within the obscuring torus, at a
distance 2.7X10^17 cm from the central engine, likely originated in the
accretion disk. The three remaining outflowing components are at distances
larger than 10^{16-17} cm. Two of them have similar outflow velocities and
locations, these may be in pressure equilibrium, forming a multi-phase medium,
if the gas has metallicity larger than the solar one (5 times). We find no
correlation between the change in covering factor of the absorbers and the flux
of the source. This, in connection with the observed variability of the ionized
absorbers, suggests that the changes in flux are not produced by this material.
If the variations are indeed produced by obscuring clumps of gas, these must be
located much closer in to the central source.

perform this task it is usual to use information provided by a number of
available and observed vertices/edges. Then, a number of edge scoring methods
based on this information can be created. Usually, these methods assess local
structures of the observed graph, assuming that closer vertices in the original
period of observation will be more likely to form a link in the future. In this
paper we explore the combination of local and global features to conduct link

twofold: a) We evaluate a number of strategies that combines global and local

the performance of single classifiers by combining their outputs, and one of
the most important properties involved in the selection of the best EoC from a
pool of classifiers is considered to be classifier diversity. In general,
classifier diversity does not occur randomly, but is generated systematically
by various ensemble creation methods. By using diverse data subsets to train
classifiers, these methods can create diverse classifiers for the EoC. In this
work, we propose a scheme to measure data diversity directly from random
subspaces, and explore the possibility of using it to select the best data
subsets for the construction of the EoC. Our scheme is the first ensemble
selection method to be presented in the literature based on the concept of data
diversity. Its main advantage over the traditional framework (ensemble creation
then selection) is that it obviates the need for classifier training prior to
ensemble selection. A single Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Multi-Objective
Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) were evaluated to search for the best solutions for
the classifier-free ensemble selection. In both cases, objective functions
based on different clustering diversity measures were implemented and tested.
All the results obtained with the proposed classifier-free ensemble selection
method were compared with the traditional classifier-based ensemble selection
using Mean Classifier Error (ME) and Majority Voting Error (MVE). The
applicability of the method is tested on UCI machine learning problems and NIST
SD19 handwritten numerals.

diagram of traffic flow with minimal number of parameters. Our approach is
based on a mesoscopic viewpoint of the traffic system in terms of the dynamics
of vehicle speed transitions. A key feature of the present approach lies in its
stochastic nature which makes it possible to study not only the
flow-concentration relation, namely, the fundamental diagram, but also its
uncertainty, namely, the variance of the fundamental diagram \textemdash an
important characteristic in the observed traffic flow data. It is shown that in
the simplified versions of the model consisting of only a few speed states,
analytic solutions for both quantities can be obtained, which facilitate the
discussion of the corresponding physical content. We also show that the effect
of vehicle size can be included into the model by introducing the maximal
congestion density $k_{max}$. By making use of this parameter, the free flow
region and congested flow region are naturally divided, and the transition is
characterized by the capacity drop at the maximum of the flow-concentration
relation. The model parameters are then adjusted to the observed traffic flow
on the I-80 Freeway Dataset in the San Francisco area from the NGSIM program,
where both the fundamental diagram and its variance are reasonably reproduced.
Despite its simplicity, we argue that the current model provides an alternative
description for the fundamental diagram and its uncertainty in the study of
traffic flow.

formation at z_form= 1.95+-0.2. The spectra of the galaxies in RXJ0848.6+4453
are dominated by young stellar populations at all galaxy masses and in many
cases show emission indicating low level on-going star formation. The average
age of the young stellar populations (estimated from H-zeta) is consistent with
a major star formation episode 1-2 Gyr prior, which in turn agrees with
z_form=1.95. Galaxies dominated by young stellar populations are distributed
throughout the cluster. We speculate that low level star formation has not yet
been fully quenched in the center of this cluster may be because the cluster is
significantly poorer than other clusters previously studied at similar
redshifts, which appear to have very little on-going star formation in their
centers.

developing a new routing protocol for wireless sensor network. Clustering is a
key technique for this and helps in maximizing the network lifetime and
scalability. Most of the routing and data dissemination protocols of WSN assume
a homogeneous network architecture, in which all sensors have the same
capabilities in terms of battery power, communication, sensing, storage, and
processing. Recently, there has been an interest in heterogeneous sensor
networks, especially for real deployments. This research paper has proposed a
new energy aware clustering protocol (EACP) for heterogeneous wireless sensor
networks. Heterogeneity is introduced in EACP by using two types of nodes:
normal and advanced. In EACP cluster heads for normal nodes are elected with
the help of a probability scheme based on residual and average energy of the
normal nodes. This will ensure that only the high residual normal nodes can
become the cluster head in a round. Advanced nodes use a separate probability
based scheme for cluster head election and they will further act as a gateway
for normal cluster heads and transmit their data load to base station when they
are not doing the duty of a cluster head. Finally a sleep state is suggested
for some sensor nodes during cluster formation phase to save network energy.
The performance of EACP is compared with SEP and simulation result shows the
better result for stability period, network life and energy saving than SEP.

are usually deployed in a harsh environment. Self configuration and
infrastructure less are the two fundamental properties of sensor networks.
Sensor nodes are highly energy constrained devices because they are battery
operated devices and due to harsh environment deployment it is impossible to
change or recharge their battery. Energy conservation and prolonging the
network life are two major challenges in a sensor network. Communication
consumes the large portion of WSN energy. Several protocols have been proposed
to realize power- efficient communication in a wireless sensor network. Cluster
based routing protocols are best known for increasing energy efficiency,
stability and network lifetime of WSNs. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
Hierarchy (LEACH) is an important protocol in this class. One of the
disadvantages of LEACH is that it does not consider the nodes energy and
distance for the election of cluster head. This paper proposes a new energy
efficient clustering protocol DE-LEACH for homogeneous wireless sensor network
which is an extension of LEACH. DE-LEACH elects cluster head on the basis of
distance and residual energy of the nodes. Proposed protocol increases the
network life, stability and throughput of sensor network and simulations result
shows that DE-LEACH is better than LEACH.

local depression in the current in the neutral sheet, and under favorable
conditions stimulate a tearing instability. This leads to reconnection of
magnetic field lines and an explosive release of magnetic energy stored in the
tail. As a result, a substorm breaks up, with sporadic pulsations Pi2 as an
important element of this process. It is expected from theoretical estimates
and kinematic considerations that the higher the Pc3 frequency, the earlier the
Pi2 trains start. We test this prediction using observational data from
satellite measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field and on-ground
magnetic measurements. The results confirm the theoretical expectation.
Additional routes are proposed to theoretically and experimentally test the

that experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running
couplings and masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and
highlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious
expression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem.
Amongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest:
$G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the
interaction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a
zero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is likely a value
of momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$. Regarding the
$\Delta(1232)$-baryon, we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form
factor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole form factor is negative, large
in magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations in the
$\Delta(1232)$ Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is
negative so long as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In
connection with the N-to-Delta transition, the momentum-dependence of the
magnetic transition form factor, $G_M^\ast$, matches that of $G_M^n$ once the
momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson-cloud; and the electric

stochastic gradient descent updates. The amount of shrinkage depends on the
observed Fisher information matrix, which does not need to be explicitly
computed; thus, implicit procedures increase stability without increasing the
computational burden. Our theoretical analysis provides the first full
characterization of the asymptotic behavior of both standard and implicit
stochastic gradient descent-based estimators, including finite-sample error
bounds. Importantly, analytical expressions for the variances of these
stochastic gradient-based estimators reveal their exact loss of efficiency. We
also develop new algorithms to compute implicit stochastic gradient
descent-based estimators for generalized linear models, Cox proportional
hazards, M-estimators, in practice, and perform extensive experiments. Our
results suggest that implicit stochastic gradient descent procedures are poised
to become a workhorse for approximate inference from large data sets

identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated

For example, flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular
dynamics in weighted and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in
the systems they represent. However, many networked systems consist of agents
or components that exhibit multiple layers of interactions. Inevitably,
representing this intricate network of networks as a single aggregated network
leads to information loss and may obscure the actual organization. Here we
propose a method based on compression of network flows that can identify
modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical experiments
on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules that
cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers
separately. We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of
two multilayer collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre
Auger Observatory and scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv.
Compared to conventional aggregated methods, the multilayer method reveals
smaller modules with more overlap that better capture the actual organization.

nuclear matter equation of state constrained by terrestrial experiments. We
find that, by considering the more realistic neutron star model rather than a
simple uniform neutron sphere as usual, the $\sigma_{\rm p}$ bounds from old
neutron stars can be varied by more than an order of magnitude depending on the
specific values of the DM neutron-to-proton coupling ratio $f_{\rm n}/f_{\rm

time, the Chinese held that comets were produced within the Earth's atmosphere,
so that it would have been impossible for them to report a ""collision"" of a
comet with Earth's atmosphere. The translation and conclusions made by Liu et

were suggested. We show that all kinds of stellar or neutron star flares would
be too weak for the observed energy input at Earth in AD 774/5. Even though
Maehara et al. (2012) present two super-flares with 10e35 erg of presumably
solar-type stars, we would like to caution: These two stars are poorly studied
and may well be close binaries, and/or having a M-type dwarf companion, and/or
may be much younger and/or much more magnetic than the Sun - in any such case,
they might not be true solar analog stars. From the frequency of large stellar
flares averaged over all stellar activity phases (maybe obtained only during
grand activity maxima), one can derive (a limit of) the probability for a large
solar flare at a random time of normal activity: We find the probability for
one flare within 3000 years to be possibly as low as 0.3 to 0.008 considering
the full 1 sigma error range. Given the energy estimate in Miyake et al. (2012)
for the AD 774/5 event, it would need to be \sim 2000 stronger than the
Carrington event as solar super-flare. If the AD 774/5 event as solar flare
would be beamed (to an angle of only 24 deg), 100 times lower energy would be
needed. A new AD 774/5 energy estimate by Usoskin et al. (2013) with a
different carbon cycle model, yielding 4 or 6 time lower 14C production,
predicts 4-6 times less energy. If both reductions are applied, the AD 774/5
event would need to be only 4 times stronger than the Carrington event in 1859

to fall or set (inqadda), and its trace (atharuhu) was seen for at least tens
of minutes (up to 70-90 min) during morning twilight. The reports use the
Arabic words kawkab and athar(uhu), which were also used in the known Arabic
reports about supernovae SN 1006 and 1054, so that one might consider an
interpretation as a nova-like event. The kawkab (celestial object) was observed
only during the morning twilight at a brightness of probably between about -3

kilonovae (at 3 to 9 kpc) in the context of short Gamma-Ray Bursts. There are
no similar reports from eastern Asia for this time. However, the short reports
are fully consistent with a bolide: The word kawkab can be used for meteor, the

describes mass transport in a domain with an evolving interface. Across the
evolving interface a jump condition has to be satisfies. The discretization in
that paper is a space-time approach which combines a discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) technique (in time) with an extended finite element method (XFEM). Using
the Nitsche method the jump condition is enforced in a weak sense. While the
emphasis in that paper was on the analysis and one dimensional numerical
experiments the main contribution of this paper is the discussion of
implementation aspects for the spatially three dimensional case. As the
space-time interface is typically given only implicitly as the zero-level of a
level-set function, we construct a piecewise planar approximation of the
space-time interface. This discrete interface is used to divide the space-time
domain into its subdomains. An important component within this decomposition is
a new method for dividing four-dimensional prisms intersected by a piecewise
planar space-time interface into simplices. Such a subdivision algorithm is

biological transport processes is far from being unlimited. The cytoskeletal
binding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir of motors (either
the cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available

transport. In this work we provide a theoretical framework to study,
analytically and numerically, how motor density profiles and crowding along
cytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding
sites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively
advance along cytoskeletal filaments and are continuously exchanged with the
motor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs and then examine the
effects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a
reference situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors
binding and moving along microtubule filaments in a flow chamber. We
investigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a filament can
be regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in
the flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerised tubulin
heterodimers). We present analytical results for the density profiles of bound
motors, the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase diagrams that present
the formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two
tuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the
concentration of tubulins polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments. Extensive
numerical simulations corroborate the analytical results for parameters in the
experimental range and also address the effects of diffusion of motor proteins

[KPKVB10] as a model for large networks. Gugelmann, Panagiotou, and Peter
[GPP12] then initiated the rigorous study of random hyperbolic graphs using the
following model: for $\alpha> \tfrac{1}{2}$, $C\in\mathbb{R}$,
$n\in\mathbb{N}$, set $R=2\ln n+C$ and build the graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=n$
as follows: For each $v\in V$, generate i.i.d. polar coordinates
$(r_{v},\theta_{v})$ using the joint density function $f(r,\theta)$, with
$\theta_{v}$ chosen uniformly from $[0,2\pi)$ and $r_{v}$ with density
$f(r)=\frac{\alpha\sinh(\alpha r)}{\cosh(\alpha R)-1}$ for $0\leq r< R$. Then,
join two vertices by an edge, if their hyperbolic distance is at most $R$. We
prove that in the range $\tfrac{1}{2} < \alpha < 1$ a.a.s. for any two vertices
of the same component, their graph distance is $O(\log^{C_0+1+o(1)}n)$, where
$C_0=2/(\tfrac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\alpha+\tfrac{\alpha^2}{4})$, thus answering a
question raised in [GPP12] concerning the diameter of such random graphs. As a
corollary from our proof we obtain that the second largest component has size
$O(\log^{2C_0+1+o(1)}n)$, thus answering a question of Bode, Fountoulakis and

forming a path of length $\Omega(\log n)$, thus yielding a lower bound on the

recently observed in the XMM-Newton observatory data from galaxy clusters. In
this model, dark matter is composed of two vector bosons, $V$ and $V^\prime$,
which couple to the photon through an effective generalized Chern-Simons
coupling, $g_V$. $V^\prime$ is slightly heavier than $V$ with a mass splitting
$m_{V^\prime}-m_V\simeq 3.5$~keV. The decay of $V^\prime$ to $V$ and a photon
gives rise to the 3.5~keV line. The production of $V$ and $V^\prime$ takes
place in the early universe within the freeze-in framework through the
effective $g_V$ coupling when $m_{V^\prime}<T<\Lambda $, $\Lambda$ being the
cut-off above which the effective $g_V$ coupling is not valid. We introduce a
high energy model that gives rise to the $g_V$ coupling at low energies. To do
this, $V$ and $V^\prime$ are promoted to gauge bosons of spontaneously broken
new $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_{V^\prime}$ gauge symmetries, respectively. The high
energy sector includes milli-charged chiral fermions that lead to the $g_V$
coupling at low energy via triangle diagrams.

extreme cases of non-interacting and strongly interacting atoms. For the latter
case, the two-excitation submanifold contains a two-body bound state, and we
find that the two cases lead to different dynamics and far-field signatures.
Finally we exploit these signatures to characterize the wavefunctions of the
collective eigenstates. For this, we identify a direct relation between the
collective branching ratio and the momentum distribution of the collective
eigenstates' wavefunction. This provides a method to proof the existence of
certain collective eigenstates and to access their wave function without the
need to individually address and/or manipulate single atoms.

In this work, we develop a more realistic stochastic model for a generic

We derive the rate coverage probability for this case, taking into account the
interference correlation across different parts of the allocated spectrum. Our

application of bespoke geometric multigrid preconditioners for equations of
this type. The algorithms deal with the strong anisotropy in the vertical
direction by using the tensor-product approach originally analysed by B\""{o}rm
and Hiptmair [Numer. Algorithms, 26/3 (2001), pp. 219-234]. We extend the
analysis to three dimensions under slightly weakened assumptions, and
numerically demonstrate its efficiency for the solution of the elliptic PDE for
the global pressure correction in atmospheric forecast models. For this we
compare the performance of different multigrid preconditioners on a
tensor-product grid with a semi-structured and quasi-uniform horizontal mesh
and a one dimensional vertical grid. The code is implemented in the Distributed
and Unified Numerics Environment (DUNE), which provides an easy-to-use and
scalable environment for algorithms operating on tensor-product grids. Parallel
scalability of our solvers on up to 20,480 cores is demonstrated on the HECToR
supercomputer.

attention and are believed to hold great promise for fabricating novel
topological devices. For nanoscale device applications, effects from finite
size usually play an important role. In this report, we theoretically
investigate the electronic properties of Dirac semimetal nanostructures.
Quantum confinement generally opens a bulk band gap at the Dirac points. We
find that confinement along different directions shows strong
anisotropiceffects. In particular, the gap due to confinement along vertical
c-axis shows a periodic modulation, which is absent for confinement along
horizontal directions. We demonstrate that the topological surface states could
be controlled by lateral electrostatic gating. It is possible to generate
Rashba-like spin splitting for the surface states and to shift them relative to
the confinement-induced bulk gap. These results will not only facilitate our
fundamental understanding of Dirac semimetal nanostructures, but also provide
useful guidance for designing all-electrical topological spintronics devices.

is widely recognized that Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the
most important contributors to the Galactic fluorine production. In general,
extant nucleosynthesis models overestimate the fluorine production by AGB stars
with respect to observations. In this paper we review the relevant nuclear
reaction rates involved in the fluorine production/destruction. We perform this
analysis on a model with initial mass M=2 M$_\odot$ and Z=0.001. We found that
the major uncertainties are due to the $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O, the
$^{19}$F($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne and the $^{14}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O reactions. A
change of the corresponding reaction rates within the present experimental
uncertainties implies surface $^{19}$F variations at the AGB tip lower than
10\%. For some $\alpha$ capture reactions, however, larger variations in the
rates of those processes cannot be excluded. Thus, we explore the effects of
the variation of some $\alpha$ capture rates well beyond the current published
uncertainties. The largest $^{19}$F variations are obtained by varying the
$^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F and the $^{19}$F($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne
reactions. The analysis of some $\alpha$ capture processes assuming a wider
uncertainty range determines $^{19}$F abundances in better agreement with
recent spectroscopic fluorine measurements at low metallicity. In the framework
of the latter scenario the $^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F and the
$^{19}$F($\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne reactions show the largest effects on fluorine
nucleosynthesis. The presence of poorly known low energy resonances make such a
scenario, even if unlikely, possible. We plan to directly measure these
resonances.

characterize the magnetic activity of the HD 181068 system. To this end, we
obtained in- and out-of-eclipse X-ray snapshots with XMM-Newton and an optical
spectrum, which we analyzed along with the Kepler light-curve. The primary
giant shows strong quiescent X-ray emission at a level of 2e31 ergs, an S-index

previously reported absence of solar-like oscillations in the giant, whose
atmosphere, however, undergoes tidally-induced oscillations imposed by the
changing configuration of the dwarf-binary. We found that the driving force

particular, we show that even subsonic turbulent motions reduce the magnetic
braking efficiency sufficiently in order to allow rotationally supported discs
to form. We therefore suggest that already during the Class 0 stage the
fraction of Keplerian discs is significantly higher than 50%, consistent with
recent observational trends but significantly higher than predictions based on
simulations with misaligned magnetic fields, demonstrating the importance of
turbulent motions for the formation of Keplerian discs. We show that the
accretion of mass and angular momentum in the surroundings of protostellar
discs occurs in a highly anisotropic manner, by means of a few narrow accretion
channels. The magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the discs is highly
disordered, revealing field reversals up to distances of 1000 AU. These
findings demonstrate that as soon as even mild turbulent motions are included,
the classical disc formation scenario of a coherently rotating environment and
a well-ordered magnetic field breaks down. Hence, it is highly questionable to
assess the magnetic braking efficiency based on non-turbulent collapse
simulation. We strongly suggest that, in addition to the global magnetic field
properties, the small-scale accretion flow and detailed magnetic field
structure have to be considered in order to assess the likelihood of Keplerian
discs to be present.

program that aims at understanding the dynamics of the circumstellar envelope
of Betelgeuse. Methods. On January and February 2011, Betelgeuse was observed
using the Astronomical Multi-BEam combineR (AMBER) instrument of the Very Large
Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) in the H and K bands. Using the medium spectral
resolution of the instrument (R $\sim$ 1500), we were able to investigate the
carbon monoxide band heads and the water-vapor bands. We used two different
approaches to analyse our data: a model fit in both the continuum and
absorption lines and then a fit with a Radiative HydroDynamics (RHD)
simulation. Results. Using the continuum data, we derive a uniform disk
diameter of $41.01 \pm 0.41$~mas, a power law type limb-darkened disk diameter

medical images based on multirate scheme incorporated into multiscale retinex
algorithm. The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space
separates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is
achieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny,
small, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each
versions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in
enormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching
and MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each
of the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by
combining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite
enhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using
a wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using
proposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise
(Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed
algorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord
regions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions. Elaborated
experiments are conducted on several medical images and results presented show
that the enhanced medical pictures are of good quality and is found to be
better compared with other researcher methods.

planetary nebulae (PNe), or whether stellar rotation alone and/or a close
binary companion can account for the variety of the observed nebular
morphologies. In a quest for empirical evidence verifying or disproving the
role of magnetic fields in shaping PNe, we follow up on previous attempts to
measure the magnetic field in a representative sample of PN central stars. We
obtained low-resolution polarimetric spectra with FORS 2 at VLT for a sample of
twelve bright central stars of PNe with different morphology, including two
round nebulae, seven elliptical nebulae, and three bipolar nebulae. Two targets
are Wolf-Rayet type central stars. For the majority of the observed central
stars, we do not find any significant evidence for the existence of surface
magnetic fields. However, our measurements may indicate the presence of weak
mean longitudinal magnetic fields of the order of 100 Gauss in the central star
of the young elliptical planetary nebula IC 418, as well as in the Wolf-Rayet
type central star of the bipolar nebula Hen2-113 and the weak emission line
central star of the elliptical nebula Hen2-131. A clear detection of a 250 G
mean longitudinal field is achieved for the A-type companion of the central
star of NGC 1514. Some of the central stars show a moderate night-to-night
spectrum variability, which may be the signature of a variable stellar wind
and/or rotational modulation due to magnetic features. We conclude that strong
magnetic fields of the order of kG are not widespread among PNe central stars.
Nevertheless, simple estimates based on a theoretical model of magnetized wind
bubbles suggest that even weak magnetic fields below the current detection
limit of the order of 100 G may well be sufficient to contribute to the shaping
of PNe throughout their evolution.

considered as defining the intrinsic dynamics of hard spheres, so it is also
revealing to find that they (and therefore the features of the underlying

fractional noise. In particular, we consider pure Bell states and mixtures of

for both independent and common environments. We found that engineering
environments towards fractional Gaussian noise is useful to preserve
entanglement as well as to improve its robustness against noise. We also
address entanglement sudden death by studying the entanglement-survival time as
a function of the initial negativity. We found that: i) the survival time is
bounded from below by an increasing function of the initial negativity, ii) the
survival time depends only slightly on the process used to describe the
environment and exhibits typicality. Overall, our results show that engineering
the environment has only a slight influence over the entanglement-survival
time, i.e. the occurence of entanglement sudden-death, while it represents a
valuable resource to increase the entanglement-preserving time, i.e. to
maintain entanglement closer to the initial level for a longer interaction
time.

self-generated turbulence. By way of example, we apply the model to a fast 1500
km \mathrm{s}^{-1} coronal mass ejection at ten solar radii. Results indicate
that the maximum energies at outer corona are likely to be limited to few MeV,
due to lack of suprathermal protons for appreciable wave growth, and
insufficient time required acceleration. We find that the second-order Fermi
acceleration, although being a too slow process to have a notable effect at the
highest energies, significantly flattens energy spectra at low energy end.
Simulations indicate that protons continue to damp waves efficiently several
solar radii from the shock in the downstream region, which may be an important
mechanism for heating suprathermals. Our simulations also suggest that models
assuming a simple isotropic scattering are likely to predict too efficient
acceleration.

converting the summations into Sternheimer equations. Then, the novel avenue of
expressing the dielectric matrix in a Lanczos basis is developed, which reduces
the matrix size by orders of magnitude while being computationally efficient.
We also develop a model dielectric operator that allows us to further reduce
the size of the dielectric matrix without accuracy loss. Furthermore, we
develop a scheme that reduces the numerical cost of the contour deformation
technique to the level of the lightest plasmon pole model. Finally, the use of
the simplified quasi-minimal residual scheme in replacement of the conjugate

In the latter limit the entropy shows a logarithmic growth, which is

architecture, in which all sensors have the same capabilities in terms of
battery power, communication, sensing, storage, and processing. However the
continued advances in miniaturization of processors and low-power
communications have enabled the development of a wide variety of nodes. When
more than one type of node is integrated into a WSN, it is called
heterogeneous. Multihop short distance communication is an important scheme to
reduce the energy consumption in a sensor network because nodes are densely
deployed in a WSN. In this paper M-EECDA (Multihop Energy Efficient Clustering

The protocol combines the idea of multihop communications and clustering for
achieving the best performance in terms of network life and energy consumption.
M-EECDA introduces a sleep state and three tier architecture for some cluster
heads to save energy of the network. M-EECDA consists of three types of sensor
nodes: normal, advance and super. To become cluster head in a round normal
nodes use residual energy based scheme. Advance and super nodes further act as
relay node to reduce the transmission load of a normal node cluster head when

mainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities
($\epsilon$), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic
equations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due to the
presence of trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed
geodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of
the energy in this black hole. Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of
the rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of
the black hole, the normalization factor $\alpha$, which is related to the
state parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate $r$. A
comparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole (Hussain et. al SIGMA, 2007), without quintessence is given. It is
observed that the presence of the quintessence field reduces the energy in this
black hole spacetime. Further it is found that there exists a point outside the
event horizon of this black hole where the effect of quintessence balances the
energy content in this black hole without quintessence, and where the total
energy of the underlying spacetime becomes zero.

extend from 380 nm - 1.26 um. The spectrograph is comprised of four identical
spectrograph modules, with each module collecting roughly 600 spectra from a
robotic fiber positioner at the telescope prime focus. Each spectrograph module
will have two visible channels covering wavelength ranges 380 nm - 640 nm and
640 nm - 955 nm, and one near infrared (NIR) channel with a wavelength range
955 nm - 1.26 um. Dispersed light in each channel is imaged by a 300 mm focal
length, f/1.07, vacuum Schmidt camera onto a 4k x 4k, 15 um pixel, detector
format. For the NIR channel a HgCdTe substrate-removed Teledyne 1.7 um cutoff
device is used. In the visible channels, CCDs from Hamamatsu are used. These
cameras are large, having a clear aperture of 300 mm at the entrance window,
and a mass of ~ 250 kg.
  Like the two visible channel cameras, the NIR camera contains just four
optical elements: a two-element refractive corrector, a Mangin mirror, and a
field flattening lens. This simple design produces very good imaging
performance considering the wide field and wavelength range, and it does so in
large part due to the use of a Mangin mirror (a lens with a reflecting rear
surface) for the Schmidt primary. In the case of the NIR camera, the rear
reflecting surface is a dichroic, which reflects in-band wavelengths and
transmits wavelengths beyond 1.26 um. This, combined with a thermal rejection
filter coating on the rear surface of the second corrector element, greatly
reduces the out-of-band thermal radiation that reaches the detector.

paper submissions for IEEE InfoVis, IEEE Vis-SciVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis, and
IEEE PacificVis since 2009 and (2) the author-chosen keywords for papers
published in the IEEE Visualization conference series (now called IEEE VIS)
since 2004. Our analysis of research topics in visualization can serve as a
starting point to (a) help create a common vocabulary to improve communication
among different visualization sub-groups, (b) facilitate the process of
understanding differences and commonalities of the various research sub-fields
in visualization, (c) provide an understanding of emerging new research trends,
(d) facilitate the crucial step of finding the right reviewers for research
submissions, and (e) it can eventually lead to a comprehensive taxonomy of
visualization research. One additional tangible outcome of our work is an
application that allows visualization researchers to easily browse the 2600+
keywords used for IEEE VIS papers during the past 10 years, aiming at more
informed and, hence, more effective keyword selections for future visualization
publications.

Their solution typically requires imposing prior knowledge about the latent
ground truth. While this regularizes the problem to an extent where it can be
solved, it also biases the result toward the expected. With inappropriate
priors harming more than they use, it remains unclear what prior to use for a
given practical problem. Priors are hence mostly chosen in an {\em ad hoc} or
empirical fashion. We argue here that the gradient distribution of
natural-scene images may provide a versatile and well-founded prior for
biomedical images. We provide motivation for this choice from different points
of view, and we fully validate the resulting prior for use on biomedical images
by showing its stability and correlation with image quality. We then provide a
set of simple parametric models for the resulting prior, leading to
straightforward (quasi-)convex optimization problems for which we provide
efficient solver algorithms. We illustrate the use of the present models and
solvers in a variety of common image-processing tasks, including contrast
enhancement, noise level estimation, denoising, blind deconvolution,
zooming/up-sampling, and dehazing. In all cases we show that the present method
leads to results that are comparable to or better than the state of the art;
always using the same, simple prior. We conclude by discussing the limitations
and possible interpretations of the prior.

  Artificial Intelligence (UAI2004)",,,"UAI-P-2004-PG-349-356","cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel approach to sufficient dimension reduction in regression,
based on estimating contour directions of negligible variation for the response
surface. These directions span the orthogonal complement of the minimal space
relevant for the regression, and can be extracted according to a measure of the
variation in the response, leading to General Contour Regression(GCR). In
comparison to exiisting sufficient dimension reduction techniques, this
sontour-based mothology guarantees exhaustive estimation of the central space
under ellipticity of the predictoor distribution and very mild additional
assumptions, while maintaining vn-consisytency and somputational ease.
Moreover, it proves to be robust to departures from ellipticity. We also
establish some useful population properties for GCR. Simulations to compare
performance with that of standard techniques such as ordinary least squares,
sliced inverse regression, principal hessian directions, and sliced average
variance estimation confirm the advntages anticipated by theoretical analyses.
We also demonstrate the use of contour-based methods on a data set concerning
grades of students from Massachusetts colleges.

in deployment area to their securely located Sink, route security has to be
guaranteed. Under dynamic load and selective attacks, availability of multiple
secure paths is a boon and increases the attacker efforts by many folds. We
propose to build a subset of neighbors as our front towards destination node.

message passing (AMP) algorithm can be interpreted as recursively solving a
signal denoising problem: at each AMP iteration, one observes a Gaussian noise
perturbed original signal. Retrieving the signal amounts to a successive noise
cancellation until the noise variance decreases to a satisfactory level. In
this paper we incorporate the Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) based
parametric denoiser with the AMP framework and propose the novel parametric
SURE-AMP algorithm. At each parametric SURE-AMP iteration, the denoiser is
adaptively optimized within the parametric class by minimizing SURE, which
depends purely on the noisy observation. In this manner, the parametric
SURE-AMP is guaranteed with the best-in-class recovery and convergence rate. If
the parameter family includes the families of the mimimum mean squared error
(MMSE) estimators, we are able to achieve the Bayesian optimal AMP performance
without knowing the signal prior. In the paper, we resort to the linear
parameterization of the SURE based denoiser and propose three different kernel
families as the base functions. Numerical simulations with the
Bernoulli-Gaussian, $k$-dense and Student's-t signals demonstrate that the
parametric SURE-AMP does not only achieve the state-of-the-art recovery but
also runs more than 20 times faster than the EM-GM-GAMP algorithm.
