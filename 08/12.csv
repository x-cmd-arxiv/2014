currently-existing experimental conditions, and may serve as a direct probe for
the presence of coherent multi-photon dynamics involving collective quantum

clumpy and asymmetrical, with peaks at cometocentric radii $\sim$500-1000~km,

self-consistent variational theory for weak polyelectrolytes which includes the

several experimental findings including non-monotonic conformational size with
the variation in the electrostatic strength and a shift from a continuous to a
discontinuous collapse transition with the increase in the dipole strength of

theory predicts a series of solvent quality driven size transitions spanning
the re-entrant poor, theta and good solvent regimes. At high dipole strength,
the size remains that of a compact globule independent of solvent quality. The
dipole strength of the ion-pair formed due to counterion condensation, which
depends on the size and polarizability of the monovalent counterions, is found
to be an important molecular parameter in determining the nature of collapse

short-term horizon and 99% confidence level, by properly applying a scaling on
the short-term Profit-and-Loss (P&L) distribution. Besides the standard
square-root-of-time scaling, based on normality assumptions, we consider two
leptokurtic probability density function classes for fitting empirical P&L
datasets and derive accurately their scaling behaviour in light of the Central
Limit Theorem, interpreting time scaling as a convolution problem. Our analyses
result in a range of possible VaR-scaling approaches depending on the
distribution providing the best fit to empirical data, the desired percentile
level and the time horizon of the Economic Capital calculation. After assessing
the different approaches on a test equity trading portfolio, it emerges that
the choice of the VaR-scaling approach can affect substantially the Economic
Capital calculation. In particular, the use of a convolution-based approach
could lead to significantly larger risk measures (by up to a factor of four)
than those calculated using Normal assumptions on the P&L distribution.

approaches to computer vision and, especially, to semantic labeling. Nowadays
state of the art systems use deep learning on millions of labeled images with
very successful results on benchmarks, though it is unlikely to expect similar
results in unrestricted visual environments. Most learning schemes essentially
ignore the inherent sequential structure of videos: this might be a critical
issue, since any visual recognition process is remarkably more complex when
shuffling video frames. Based on this remark, we propose a re-foundation of the
communication protocol between visual agents and the environment, which is
referred to as learning to see like children. Like for human interaction,
visual concepts are acquired by the agents solely by processing their own
visual stream along with human supervisions on selected pixels. We give a proof
of concept that remarkable semantic labeling can emerge within this protocol by
using only a few supervised examples. This is made possible by exploiting a
constraint of motion coherent labeling that virtually offers tons of
supervisions. Additional visual constraints, including those associated with
object supervisions, are used within the context of learning from constraints.
The framework is extended in the direction of lifelong learning, so as our
visual agents live in their own visual environment without distinguishing

the collapse of magnetic molecular cloud cores using the adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) code Enzo2.2 in the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
approximation. The cloud cores are initially either prolate or oblate,
centrally condensed clouds with masses of 1.73 or 2.73 $M_\odot$, respectively.
The radial density profiles are Gaussian, with central densities 20 times
higher than boundary densities. A barotropic equation of state is used to
represent the transition from low density, isothermal phases, to high density,
optically thick phases. The initial magnetic field strength ranges from 6.3 to
100 $\mu$G, corresponding to clouds that are strongly to marginally
supercritical, respectively, in terms of the mass to magnetic flux ratio. The
magnetic field is initially uniform and aligned with the clouds' rotation axes,
with initial ratios of rotational to gravitational energy ranging from
$10^{-4}$ to 0.1. Two significantly different outcomes for collapse result: (1)
formation of single protostars with spiral arms, and (2) fragmentation into
multiple protostar systems. The transition between these two outcomes depends
primarily on the initial magnetic field strength, with fragmentation occurring
for mass to flux ratios greater than about 14 times the critical ratio for
prolate clouds. Oblate clouds typically fragment into several times more clumps
than prolate clouds. Multiple, rather than binary, system formation is the
general rule in either case, suggesting that binary stars are primarily the
result of the orbital dissolution of multiple protostar systems.

method for sampling and computing integrals over the potential energy landscape
of small molecular assemblies. EASAL's efficiency arises from the fact that
small assembly landscapes permit the use of so-called Cayley (inter-atomic
distance based) parameters for geometric representation and sampling of the
assembly configuration space regions; this results in their isolation,
convexification, customized sampling and systematic traversal using a
comprehensive topological roadmap.
  We define custom-designed measurements to investigate and compare various
sampling characteristics of EASAL and the traditional Monte Carlo (MC)
sampling, including (i) sampling speed, (ii) efficiency and accuracy of uniform
grid coverage, (iii) accuracy of weighted coverage at covering low energy
regions, (iv) ability to localize sampling to macrostates, and (v) flexibility
in sampling distributions.
  In particular, we compare the sampling characteristics of EASAL and MC in
sampling the assembly landscape of 2 trans-membrane helices, with short-range
pair-potentials. We demonstrate that EASAL provides a reasonable coverage of
crucial but narrow regions of the energy landscape of low effective dimension,
with much fewer samples and computational resources than MC sampling. Promising
avenues for combining the complementary advantages of the two methods are
discussed.

Several spectroscopic studies of these objects have revealed notable

In this paper, we analyze the magnitude distributions of these two groups,
which we refer to as the red and less red color populations. By compiling
spectral and photometric data from several previous works, we show that the
observed bimodalities are self-consistent and categorize 221 of the 842 Trojans

demonstrate that the magnitude distributions of the two color populations are
distinct to a high confidence level (>95%) and fit them individually to a
broken power law, with special attention given to evaluating and correcting for
incompleteness in the Trojan catalog as well as incompleteness in our
categorization of objects. A comparison of the best-fit curves shows that the
faint-end power-law slopes are markedly different for the two color

different locations. We propose a few hypotheses for the origin and evolution

variable corresponds to the presence of melt water or ice on the sea ice
surface. With only a minimal set of physical parameters, the model predictions
agree very closely with observed power law scaling of the pond size
distribution and critical length scale where melt ponds undergo a transition in
fractal geometry.

Repetitive control algorithms are proposed and analyzed. The well known
relation between a discrete-time plant (filter) and its Markov Toeplitz matrix
representation has been exploited in previous ILC literature. However, this
connection breaks down when the filters have noncausal components. In this
paper we provide a formal representation and analysis that recover the
connections between noncausal filters and Toeplitz matrices. This tool is then
applied to translate the anti-causal zero-phase-error prototype repetitive
control scheme to the design of a stable and fast converging ILC algorithm. The
learning gain matrices are chosen such that the resulting state transition
matrix has a \textit{Symmetric Banded Toeplitz} (SBT) structure. It is shown
that the well known sufficient condition for repetitive control closed loop
stability based on a filter's frequency domain $H_\infty$ norm is also
sufficient for ILC convergence and that the condition becomes necessary as the
data length approaches infinity. Thus the ILC learning matrix design can be
translated to repetitive control loop shaping filter design in the frequency

accurate measure of methanol deuteration in the cold pre-stellar gas. The

of NNLO corrections to hadronic top-quark pair production, fully differential
top-quark decays, inclusive semileptonic charmless b-quark decays, associated
Higgs boson and jet production in gluon fusion, muon decay spin asymmetry, and
t-channel single-top production. Common to these calculations was the use of
conventional dimensional regularization (CDR). In this publication, we present
a complete formulation of the subtraction scheme for arbitrary processes with
any number of colored partons in the final state, and up to two partons in the
initial state. Furthermore, we modify the integrated subtraction terms of the
double-real radiation to enable the introduction of the 't Hooft-Veltman
version of dimensional regularization (HV), in which resolved states are
four-dimensional. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach on the example
of top-quark pair production in the gluon fusion channel.

transfer matrices of lattice gauge theories with discrete gauge groups and
parametrized by the center of the gauge group algebra and its dual. For general
choices of these parameters the transfer matrix contains operators acting on
links which can also be thought of as perturbations to the quantum double model
driving it out of its topological phase and destroying the exact solvability of
the quantum double model. We modify these transfer matrices with perturbations
and extract exactly solvable models which remain in a quantum phase, thus
nullifying the effect of the perturbation. The algebra of the modified vertex
and plaquette operators now obey a deformed version of the quantum double
algebra. The Abelian cases are shown to be in the quantum double phase whereas
the non-Abelian phases are shown to be in a modified phase of the corresponding
quantum double phase. These are illustrated with the groups $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and
$S_3$. The quantum phases are determined by studying the excitations of these
systems namely their fusion rules and the statistics. We then go further to
construct a transfer matrix which contains the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase
namely the double semion phase. More generally for other discrete groups these
transfer matrices contain the twisted quantum double models. These transfer
matrices can be thought of as being obtained by introducing extra parameters
into the transfer matrix of lattice gauge theories. These parameters are
central elements belonging to the tensor products of the algebra and its dual
and are associated to vertices and volumes of the three dimensional lattice. As
in the case of the lattice gauge theories we construct the operators creating
the excitations in this case and study their braiding and fusion properties.

(sparse signal recovery) when the signal entries can be either positive or
negative. In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly
sparsified so that only a very small fraction of the entries are nonzero. Our
proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is
one linear scan of the coordinates. We have developed two estimators: (i) the
{\em tie estimator}, and (ii) the {\em absolute minimum estimator}. Using only
the tie estimator, we are able to recover a $K$-sparse signal of length $N$
using $1.551 eK \log K/\delta$ measurements (where $\delta\leq 0.05$ is the
confidence). Using only the absolute minimum estimator, we can detect the
support of the signal using $eK\log N/\delta$ measurements. For a particular
coordinate, the absolute minimum estimator requires fewer measurements (i.e.,
with a constant $e$ instead of $1.551e$). Thus, the two estimators can be
combined to form an even more practical decoding framework.
  Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan)
recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would require substantially more
(e.g., one order of magnitude) measurements than L1 decoding by linear
programming, when the nonzero entries of signals can be either negative or
positive. In this paper, following a known experimental setup, we show that, at
the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies of our proposed method
are (at least) similar to the standard L1 decoding.

its favorable interaction with sphingomyelin, which is almost entirely in the
outer leaf, one expects the great majority of cholesterol to be there also.
Experimental results do not support this, implying that there is some mechanism
which attracts cholesterol to the inner leaf. We hypothesize that it is drawn
there to reduce the bending free energy of the membrane caused by the presence
of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). It does this in two ways: first by simply
diluting the amount of PE in the inner leaf, and second by ordering the tails
of the PE so as to reduce its spontaneous curvature. Incorporating this

deceleration during their propagation ($a\leq-50$ m s$^{-2}$), the other 48 %
are consistent with a constant speed within the uncertainties ($-50\leq
a\leq50$ m s$^{-2}$). The start velocity and the acceleration show a strong
anticorrelation with $c\approx-0.8$, \textit i.e initially faster events
undergo stronger deceleration than slower events. The (smooth) transition
between constant propagation for slow events and deceleration in faster events
occurs at an EUV wave start velocity of $v\approx230$ km s$^{-1}$, which
corresponds well to the fast-mode speed in the quiet corona. These findings
provide strong evidence that the EUV waves under study are indeed
large-amplitude fast-mode MHD waves. This interpretation is further supported
by the correlations obtained between the peak velocity and the peak amplitude,
impulsiveness, and build-up time of the disturbance. We obtained the following
association rates of EUV wave events to other solar phenomena: 95 % are
associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME), 74 % to a solar flare, 15 % to
interplanetary type II bursts, and 22 % to coronal type II bursts. These
findings are consistent with the interpretation that the associated CMEs are

evidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up due
to inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. However,

been challenged by the discovery of a dense and almost static shell that is
three times closer to the star than the bow shock and has been decelerated by
some external force. The two physically distinct structures cannot both be
formed by the hydrodynamic interaction of the wind with the interstellar

requiring a new understanding of the bow shock. Pressure from the photoionized
wind generates a standing shock in the neutral part of the wind and forms an
almost static, photoionization-confined shell. Other red supergiants should
have significantly more massive shells than Betelgeuse, because the
photoionization-confined shell traps up to 35 per cent of all mass lost during
the red supergiant phase, confining this gas close to the star until it
explodes. After the supernova explosion, massive shells dramatically affect the
supernova lightcurve, providing a natural explanation for the many supernovae

galaxies. We present scaling relations for galaxies forming at redshifts $z \ge
15$ when reionization is just beginning. We utilize the ``Rarepeak'
cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that captures the complete star
formation history in over 3,300 galaxies, starting with massive Population III
stars that form in dark matter halos as small as ~$10^6 M_\odot$. We make
various correlations between the bulk halo quantities, such as virial, gas, and
stellar masses and metallicities and their respective accretion rates,
quantifying a variety of properties of the first galaxies up to halo masses of
$10^9 M_\odot$. Galaxy formation is not solely relegated to atomic cooling
halos with virial temperatures greater than $10^4$ K, where we find a dichotomy
in galaxy properties between halos above and below this critical mass scale.
Halos below the atomic cooling limit have a stellar mass -- halo mass
relationship $\log M_\star \simeq 3.5 + 1.3\log(M_{\rm vir} / 10^7 M_\odot)$.
We find a non-monotonic relationship between metallicity and halo mass for the
smallest galaxies. Their initial star formation events enrich the interstellar
medium and subsequent star formation to a median of $10^{-2} Z_\odot$ and
$10^{-1.5} Z_\odot$, respectively, in halos of total mass $10^7 M_\odot$ that
is then diluted by metal-poor inflows, well beyond Population III
pre-enrichment levels of $10^{-3.5} Z_\odot$. The scaling relations presented
here can be employed in models of reionization, galaxy formation and chemical
evolution in order to consider these galaxies forming prior to reionization.

steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of the

broadly reproduces the observed scatter in HI at a given stellar mass as
quantified by the HI mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the HI
richness versus local galaxy density. This shows that the predicted HI
fluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data with
few minor discrepancies. For satellite galaxies in >= 10^12M_* halos, the HI
richness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. The
depletion rate of HI once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid at
higher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows
much less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests
that, up to halo mass scales probed here (<= 10^14M_*), star formation is
mainly attenuated by starvation, but HI is additionally removed by stripping
once a hot gaseous halo is present. In low mass halos, the HI richness of
satellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they become
gas-poor towards the center. We show that the gas fraction of satellite and
central galaxies decreases from z=5 to z=0,tracking each other until z~1 after
which the satellites' HI content drops much more quickly, particularly for the
highest halo masses. Mergers somewhat increase the HI richness and its scatter
about the mean relation, tracking the metallicity in a way consistent with
arising from inflow fluctuations, while star formation is significantly boosted

grains into mm-cm-sized pebbles. These pebbles can clump together through the
streaming instability and form gravitationally bound pebble 'clouds'. Pebbles
inside such a cloud will undergo mutual collisions, dissipating energy into
heat. As the cloud loses energy, it gradually contracts towards solid density.
We model this process and investigate two important properties of the collapse:
(i) the timescale of the collapse and (ii) the temporal evolution of the pebble
size distribution. Our numerical model of the pebble cloud is zero-dimensional
and treats collisions with a statistical method. We find that planetesimals
with radii larger than 100 km collapse on the free-fall timescale of about 25
years. Lower-mass clouds have longer pebble collision timescales and collapse
much more slowly, with collapse times of a few hundred years for 10-km-scale
planetesimals and a few thousand years for 1-km-scale planetesimals. The mass
of the pebble cloud also determines the interior structure of the resulting
planetesimal. The pebble collision speeds in low-mass clouds are below the
threshold for fragmentation, forming pebble-pile planetesimals consisting of
the primordial pebbles from the protoplanetary disk. Planetesimals above 100 km
in radius, on the other hand, consist of mixtures of dust (pebble fragments)
and pebbles which have undergone substantial collisions with dust and other
pebbles. The Rosetta mission to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and the New
Horizons mission to Pluto will both provide valuable information about the
structure of planetesimals in the Solar System. Our model predicts that 67P is
a pebble-pile planetesimal consisting of primordial pebbles from the Solar
Nebula, while the pebbles in the cloud which contracted to form Pluto must have
been ground down substantially during the collapse.

simulations based on the most recent observational data. We find that, across a
wide range of mass assumptions, the system is unstable, resulting in the
eventual crossing of orbits and probable subsequent collision of moons. Cupid
and Belinda are usually the first satellites to cross orbits, and they do so on
a time scale of 10^3-10^7 years. Cressida and Desdemona are generally the next
pair to cross, on a time scale of 10^5-10^7 years. We show that the crossing
times are highly sensitive to initial conditions and that Cupid's instability
is related to its resonant interactions with Belinda. We also show that a
previously discovered power law, which relates orbit crossing time to satellite
mass, is valid across a wide range of masses. We generalize the power law to
handle two unstable orbital pairs with overlapping lifetimes and show that it
can be used to extend the time span of studies of orbital stability in a
computationally efficient manner. Our results suggest that the current Uranian
satellite system is in transition and that the moons will continue to collide
and reaccrete for the foreseeable future.

satellites and centrals in which star formation has been quenched, using the
environment quenching efficiency formalism that separates out the dependence of
stellar mass. We show that the centrals of the groups containing the satellites
are responding to the environment in the same way as their satellites (at least
for stellar masses above 10^10.3 Msun), and that the well-known differences
between satellites and the general set of centrals arise because the latter are
overwhelmingly dominated by isolated galaxies. The widespread concept of
""satellite quenching"" as the cause of environmental effects in the galaxy
population can therefore be generalized to ""group quenching"". We then explore
the dependence of the quenching efficiency of satellites on overdensity,
group-centric distance, halo mass, the stellar mass of the satellite, and the
stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of its central, trying to
isolate the effect of these often interdependent variables. We emphasize the
importance of the central sSFR in the quenching efficiency of the associated
satellites, and develop the meaning of this ""galactic conformity"" effect in a
probabilistic description of the quenching of galaxies. We show that conformity
is strong, and that it varies strongly across parameter space. Several
arguments then suggest that environmental quenching and mass quenching may be
different manifestations of the same underlying process. The marked difference
in the apparent mass dependencies of environment quenching and mass quenching
which produces distinctive signatures in the mass functions of centrals and
satellites will arise naturally, since, for satellites at least, the
distributions of the environmental variables that we investigate in this work
are essentially independent of the stellar mass of the satellite.

to the formation of a soliton, and the fluctuations around the soliton were
identified with stringy excitations. We point out, however, that in this

missing. This was due to an unnecessary decompactification of the world sheet;
by keeping it compactified, we show that, in addition to a trivial ground
state, there is also a non-trivial one. We investigate fluctuations around the

velocity dispersions from the AIMSS project with literature data to explore
their dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.
  We confirm that the mass ratios of many UCDs in the stellar mass range 10$^6$
-- 10$^9$ M$_{\odot}$ are systematically higher than those for globular
clusters which have mass ratios near unity. However, at the very highest masses
in our sample, i.e. 10$^9$ -- 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, we find that cE galaxies
also have mass ratios of close to unity, indicating their central regions are
mostly composed of stars.
  Suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of UCDs have included a
variable IMF, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. Here we
present another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. Under various
assumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellar
mass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidal
stripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. In the early stages of the
stripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. At late
stages, the final remnant resembles the properties of $\sim$10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$
UCDs. Finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling of
tidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations to
further test the stripping hypothesis.

\emph{trivial} if all permutations in $\mathcal{F}$ agree on the same $t$

edges have $t$ vertices in common, and \emph{trivial} if all its edges share
the same $t$ vertices.
  The fundamental problem is to determine how large an intersecting family can
be. Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel proved that for $n$ sufficiently large with
respect to $t$, the largest $t$-intersecting families in $S_n$ are the trivial
ones. The classic Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem shows that the largest
$t$-intersecting $k$-uniform hypergraphs are also trivial when $n$ is large. We
determine the \emph{typical} structure of $t$-intersecting families, extending
these results to show that almost all intersecting families are trivial. We
also obtain sparse analogues of these extremal results, showing that they hold
in random settings.
  Our proofs use the Bollob\'as set-pairs inequality to bound the number of
maximal intersecting families, which can then be combined with known stability
theorems. We also obtain similar results for vector spaces.

dust and hydrogen at a constant temperature. These spheres undergo solid-body
rotation with maximum velocities in the range 0-300 \kms and neutral hydrogen
optical depths in the range $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{5}-10^{7}$. We consider two types
of source distributions in the sphere: central and homogeneous. Our main result
is that rotation introduces a dependence of the line morphology with viewing
angle and rotational velocity. Observations with a line of sight parallel to
the rotation axis yield line morphologies similar to the static case. For lines
of sight perpendicular to the rotation axis both the intensity at the line
center and the line width increase with rotational velocity. Along the same
line of sight, the line becomes single peaked at rotational velocities close to
half the line width in the static case. Notably, we find that rotation does not
induce any spatial anisotropy in the integrated line flux, the escape fraction
or the average number of scatterings. This is because Lyman {\alpha} scattering
through a rotating solid-body proceeds identical as in the static case. The
only difference is the doppler shift from the different regions in the sphere
that move with respect to the observer. This allows us to derive an analytic
approximation for the viewing-angle dependence of the emerging spectrum, as a
function of rotational velocity.

mobilities in this material approaching 4200 cm2/Vs at low temperatures. The
temperature dependence of scattering indicates that the mobility, an order of
magnitude larger than previously reported for MoS2, is intrinsically limited by
acoustic phonon scattering at THz frequencies. Our measurements of carrier
relaxation reveal picosecond cooling times followed by recombination lasting
tens of nanoseconds and dominated by Auger scattering into defects. Our results
provide a useful context in which to understand and evaluate the performance of
MoS2-based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

scheme, a given ground state with well defined spin and space group quantum
numbers, is expanded in terms of a nonorthogonal symmetry-projected basis
determined through chains of variation-after projection calculations. The
results obtained for the ground state and correlation energies of half-filled

well as momentum distributions and spin-spin correlation functions in small

approximations. The structure of the intrinsic determinants resulting from the
variational strategy is interpreted in terms of defects that encode information
on the basic units of quantum fluctuations in the considered 2D systems. The
varying nature of the underlying quantum fluctuations, reflected in a
transition to a stripe regime for increasing onsite repulsions, is discussed
using the intrinsic determinants belonging to a 16$\times$4 lattice with 56
electrons. Such a transition is further illustrated by computing spin-spin and
charge-charge correlation functions with the corresponding multireference FED
wave functions. In good agreement with previous studies, the analysis of the
pairing correlation functions reveals a weak enhancement of the extended
$s$-wave and d$_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing modes. Given the quality of results here
reported together with those previously obtained for 1D lattices and the

industry is striving to exploit large swaths of spectrum which anyone can use
for free without having to obtain a license. Major standards bodies are
currently considering a proposal to retool and deploy Long Term Evolution (LTE)
technologies in unlicensed bands below 6 GHz. This paper studies the
fundamental questions of whether and how the unlicensed spectrum can be shared
by intrinsically strategic operators without suffering from the tragedy of the
commons. A class of general utility functions is considered. The spectrum
sharing problem is formulated as a repeated game over a sequence of time slots.
It is first shown that a simple static sharing scheme allows a given set of
operators to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for mutually beneficial
sharing. The question of how many operators will choose to enter the market is
also addressed by studying an entry game. A sharing scheme which allows dynamic
spectrum borrowing and lending between operators is then proposed to address
time-varying traffic and proved to achieve perfect Bayesian equilibrium.
Numerical results show that the proposed dynamic sharing scheme outperforms
static sharing, which in turn achieves much higher revenue than uncoordinated
full-spectrum sharing. Implications of the results to the standardization and
deployment of LTE in unlicensed bands (LTE-U) are also discussed.

applications were studied in this thesis. In the first part of this work, a
hydrophone was developed for mapping the particle velocity of an acoustic
field. This hydrophone was constructed using a thin copper wire and an external
magnetic field. A model was elaborated to determine the relationship between
the acoustic pressure and the measured electrical current, which is induced by
Lorentz force when the wire vibrates in the acoustic field of an ultrasound
transducer. The built prototype was characterized and its spatial resolution,
frequency response, sensitivity, robustness and directivity response were
investigated. An imaging method called Lorentz Force Electrical Impedance
Tomography was also studied. In this method, a biological tissue is vibrated by
ultrasound in a magnetic field, which induces an electrical current by Lorentz
force. The electrical impedance of the tissue can be deduced from the
measurement of the current. This technique was applied for imaging a gelatin
phantom, a beef muscle sample, and a thermal lesion in a chicken breast sample.
This showed the method may be useful for providing additional contrast to
conventional ultrasound imaging. Finally, this thesis demonstrated that shear
waves can be generated in soft tissues using Lorentz force. This work was
performed by applying an electrical current with two electrodes in a soft solid
placed in a magnetic field. Shear waves were observed in gelatin phantom and
liver sample. The speed of the shear waves were used to compute elasticity and
their source to map the electrical conductivity of the samples.

insight into the relationships between protein sequence, structure and
function. It is often challenging, however, to discover these relationships
across a large and diverse superfamily. Contemporary similarity network
visualization techniques allow researchers to aggregate sequence similarity
information into a single global view. Network visualization provides a
qualitative estimate of functional diversity within a superfamily, but is
unable to quantitate explicit boundaries, when present, between neighboring
families in sequence space. This limits the potential of existing
sequence-based algorithms to generate functional predictions from superfamily
datasets.
  Results: By building on current network analysis tools, we have developed a
new algorithm for elucidating pairs of homologous families within a sequence
dataset. Our algorithm is able to filter through a dense similarity network in
order to estimate both the boundaries of individual families and also how the
families neighbor one another. Globally, these neighboring families define a
topology across the entire superfamily. The topology is simple to interpret by
visualizing the network output generated by our filtration protocol. We have
compared the network topology within the kinase superfamily against available
phylogenetic data. Our results suggest that neighbors within the filtered
kinase network are more likely to share structural and functional properties
than more distant network clusters.

when the y coordinate of the particle is zero. Here, we propose an extension
for the comb model via Langevin-like equations driven by fractional Gaussian

that the correlations in the y-direction affect the diffusive behavior in the
x-direction in a non-trivial fashion, resulting in a quite rich diffusive
scenario characterized by usual, superdiffusive or subdiffusive scaling of
second moment in the x-direction. We further show that the long-range
correlations affect the probability distribution of the particle positions in
the x-direction, making their tails longer when noise in the y-direction is
persistent and shorter for anti-persistent noise. Our model thus combines and
allows the study/analysis of the interplay between different mechanisms of
anomalous diffusion (geometric constraints and long-range correlations) and may
find direct applications for describing diffusion in complex systems such as
living cells.

most practical situations. In the future, the work here could be extended to
address data that are non-Gaussian. Aside from establishing a rigorous
mathematical foundation for the distribution of the statistic, the report also
explores a few approximations for the proposed statistic.

attention as novel materials and device topologies have enabled realization of
compact, scalable and low-power coupled oscillatory systems. Of particular
interest are compact and low-power relaxation oscillators that have been
recently demonstrated using MIT (metal- insulator-transition) devices using
properties of correlated oxides. This paper presents an analysis of the
dynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled
relaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two
implementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where complementary
MIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide oscillations and (b) a D-R
configuration where it is composed of a resistor (R) in series with a
voltage-triggered state changing MIT device (D). The MIT device acts like a
hysteresis resistor with different resistances in the two different states. The
synchronization dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge
based coupling using a resistive (Rc) and a capacitive (Cc) element in
parallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical and
capacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an anti-phase
locking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system locks in phase.
Further, we demonstrate that for certain range of values of Rc and Cc, a
bistable system is possible which can have potential applications in
associative computing. In D-R configuration, we demonstrate the existence of
rich dynamics including non-monotonic flows and complex phase relationship
governed by the ratios of the coupling impedance. Finally, the developed
theoretical formulations have been shown to explain experimentally measured
waveforms of such pairwise coupled relaxation oscillators.

the flares are likely to occur. Most of these studies mainly discuss the
photospheric and chromospheric activity before the flare onset. In this paper
we study the coronal features before the famous large flare occurrence on
December 13th, 2006. Using the data from Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS),
X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) /Extreme
ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), we discuss the coronal features in the
large scale (~ a few 100 arcsec) before the flare onset. Our findings are as
follows: 1) The upflows in and around active region start growing from ~10 to
30 km /s a day before the flare. 2) The expanding coronal loops are clearly
observed a few hours before the flare. 3) Soft X-ray and EUV intensity are
gradually reduced. 4) The upflows are further enhanced after the flare. From
these observed signatures, we conclude that the outer part of active region
loops with low density were expanding a day before the flare onset, and the
inner part with high density were expanding a few hours before the onset.

the gravitational radiation emitted by the infall of a massive scalar field
into a Schwarzschild black hole. Whereas part of the scalar field is
absorbed/scattered by the black hole and triggers gravitational wave emission,
another part lingers in long-lived quasi-bound states. Solving numerically the
Teukolsky master equation for gravitational perturbations coupled to the
massive Klein-Gordon equation, we find a characteristic gravitational wave
signal, composed by a quasi-normal ringing followed by a late time tail. In
contrast to `clean' black holes, however, the late time tail contains small
amplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasi-bound state.
Additionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These
features were already observed in fully non-linear studies; our analysis shows
they are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional
numerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data. Moreover, we discuss the
power law of the tail and that it only becomes universal sufficiently far away
from the `dirty' black hole. The wiggly tails, by constrast, are a generic
feature that may be used as a smoking gun for the presence of massive fields
around black holes, either as a linear cloud or as fully non-linear hair.

composed of a large number of differentiable functions, or solve a stochastic
optimization problem, to a moderate accuracy. The block coordinate
descent/update (BCD) method, on the other hand, handles problems with multiple
blocks of variables by updating them one at a time; when the blocks of
variables are easier to update individually than together, BCD has a lower
per-iteration cost. This paper introduces a method that combines the features
of SG and BCD for problems with many components in the objective and with
multiple (blocks of) variables.
  Specifically, a block stochastic gradient (BSG) method is proposed for
solving both convex and nonconvex programs. At each iteration, BSG approximates
the gradient of the differentiable part of the objective by randomly sampling a
small set of data or sampling a few functions from the sum term in the
objective, and then, using those samples, it updates all the blocks of
variables in either a deterministic or a randomly shuffled order. Its
convergence for both convex and nonconvex cases are established in different
senses. In the convex case, the proposed method has the same order of
convergence rate as the SG method. In the nonconvex case, its convergence is
established in terms of the expected violation of a first-order optimality
condition. The proposed method was numerically tested on problems including
stochastic least squares and logistic regression, which are convex, as well as
low-rank tensor recovery and bilinear logistic regression, which are nonconvex.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) expand in the
ambient corona. A large-scale magnetic field mostly tangential to the interface
is inferred, both on the CME and on the background sides. However, the magnetic
field component along the shear flow is not strong enough to quench the
instability. There is also observational evidence that the ambient corona is in
a turbulent regime, and therefore the criteria for the development of the
instability are a-priori expected to differ from the laminar case. To study the
evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with a turbulent background, we
perform three-dimensional simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
equations. The instability is driven by a velocity profile tangential to the
CME-corona interface, which we simulate through a hyperbolic tangent profile.
The turbulent background is generated by the application of a stationary
stirring force. We compute the instability growth-rate for different values of
the turbulence intensity, and find that the role of turbulence is to attenuate
the growth. The fact that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is observed, sets an
upper limit to the correlation length of the coronal background turbulence.

localized beams in an strontium barium niobate photorefractive crystal in one
dimension, using the coherent density method. For the case of bright beams, if
the interacting beams are in-phase, they attract each other during propagation
and form bound breathers; if out-of-phase, the beams repel each other and fly
away. The bright incoherent beams do not radiate much and form long-lived
well-defined breathers or quasi-stable solitons. If the phase difference is
$\pi/2$, the interacting beams may both attract or repel each other, depending
on the interval between the two beams, the beam widths, and the degree of
coherence. For the case of dark incoherent beams, in addition to the above the
interactions also depend on the symmetry of the incident beams. As already
known, an even-symmetric incident beam tends to split into a doublet, whereas
an odd-symmetric incident beam tends to split into a triplet. When launched in
pairs, the dark beams display dynamics consistent with such a picture and in
general obey soliton-like conservation laws, so that the collisions are mostly
elastic, leading to little energy and momentum exchange. But they also radiate
and breathe while propagating. In all the cases, the smaller the interval

is shown to be dependent upon the excitation of localized surface plasmon
resonances and prohibits efficient scattering into the underlying

the dependence of scattering and absorption in nanoparticles upon their complex
refractive index. These results provide an insight into the optimum material
properties required to minimize parasitic optical absorption, while maintaining
high scattering cross-section efficiency, thus providing a general design
guideline for efficient light trapping with scattering nanoparticles. The work
is extended to include comprehensive optoelectronic simulations of plasmonic
solar cells in which the scattering metals are made from either Au, Ag or Al.
We show that Al particles provide the closest approximation to the optimized

enhancements. Indeed, for the Al particles we report a full-band enhancement of
external quantum efficiency over the reference device.

dilemma game model with avoiding mechanism, where the four strategies are
cooperation, defection, altruistic and selfish punishment. By introducing the
low level of random mutation of strategies, we demonstrate that the presence of
selfish punishment with avoiding mechanism can alleviate the two kinds of
social dilemmas for various parametrizations. In addition, we propose an
extended pair approximation method, whose solutions can essentially estimate
the dynamical behaviors and final evolutionary frequencies of the four

characterize the emergent co-exist strategy phases, and its validity are
supported by extensive simulations.

this work we used the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory to study the
crowding current effects in mesoscopic superconducting systems with an array of

  subtype-specific prognostic genes being not hold anymore",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.GN q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background
  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant histological type of
lung cancer, accounting for up to 85% of cases. Disease stage is commonly used
to determine adjuvant treatment eligibility of NSCLC patients, however, it is
an imprecise predictor of the prognosis of an individual patient. Currently,
many researchers resort to microarray technology for identifying relevant
genetic prognostic markers, with particular attention on trimming or extending
a Cox regression model.
  Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are two
major histology subtypes. It has been demonstrated that there exist fundamental
differences in the underlying mechanisms between them, which motivated us to
postulate there might exist specific genes relevant to prognosis of each
histology subtype.
  Results
  In this article, we propose a simple filterer feature selection algorithm
with a Cox regression model as the base. Applying this method to a real-world
microarray data, no evidence has been found to support the existence of
histology-specific prognostic gene signature. Nevertheless, a 31-gene
prognostic gene signature for the early-stage AC and SCC samples is obtained,
which provides comparable performance when compared with other relevant
signatures.
  Conclusions
  Our proposal is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement.
Therefore, it is expected that other researchers, especially those with less
statistical knowledge and experience, can adapt this method readily to test
their own research hypotheses.

intraoperative imaging. Typically a C-arm scan is performed using a circle-like
trajectory around a region of interest. Therefor an angular range of at least
180{\deg} plus fan-angle must be covered to ensure a completely sampled data
set. This fact defines some constraints on the geometry and technical
specifications of a C-arm system, for example a larger C radius or a smaller C
opening respectively. These technical modifications are usually not benificial
in terms of handling and usability of the C-arm during classical 2D
applications like fluoroscopy. The method proposed in this paper relaxes the
constraint of 180{\deg} plus fan-angle rotation to acquire a complete data set.
The proposed C-arm trajectory requires a motorization of the orbital axis of
the C and of ideally two orthogonal axis in the C plane. The trajectory
consists of three parts: A rotation of the C around a defined iso-center and
two translational movements parallel to the detector plane at the begin and at
the end of the rotation. Combining these three parts to one trajectory enables
for the acquisition of a completely sampled dataset using only 180{\deg} minus
fan-angle of rotation. To evaluate the method we show animal scans acquired
with a mobile C-arm prototype. We expect that the transition of this method
into clinical routine will lead to a much broader use of intraoperative 3D
imaging in a wide field of clinical applications.

conformal symmetry is broken by a soft mechanism and is not anomalous. One of

predicts exactly zero cosmological constant. In the simplest version of the
model, some of the couplings need to be fine tuned to very small values. We
formulate the problem of fine tuning of these couplings. We argue that the
problem arises since we require a soft mechanism to break conformal symmetry.
The symmetry breaking is possible only if the scalar fields do not evolve
significantly over the time scale of the Universe. We present two solutions to
this fine tuning problem. We argue that the problem is solved if the classical
value of one of the scalar fields is super-Planckian, i.e. takes a value much
larger than the Planck mass. The second solution involves introduction of a
strongly coupled hidden sector that we call hypercolor. In this case the
conformal invariance is broken dynamically and triggers the breakdown of the
electroweak symmetry. We argue that our analysis applies also to the case of
the standard model Higgs multiplet.

a sliding window decoder with a stopping rule based on a soft bit-error-rate
(BER) estimate is used for the q-ary SC-LDPC codes. Two regimes are considered:
one when the constraint length of q-ary SC-LDPC codes is equal to the block
length of q-ary LDPC-BCs and the other when the two decoding latencies are
equal. Simulation results confirm that, in both regimes, (3,6)-, (3,9)-, and
(3,12)-regular non-binary SC-LDPC codes can significantly outperform both
binary and non-binary LDPC-BCs and binary SC-LDPC codes. Finally, we present a
computational complexity comparison of q-ary SC-LDPC codes and q-ary LDPC-BCs
under equal decoding latency and equal decoding performance assumptions.

structure, which has leaded to highly anisotropy in its optical, electronic,
and mechanical properties. We report, using the non-equilibrium Green's
function approach and the first-principles method, that the anisotropy in the
thermal conduction is very weak in the single-layer black phosphorus -- the
difference between two in-plane directions is less than 4%. Our phonon
calculations disclose that the two in-plane acoustic phonon branches have lower
group velocities in the direction perpendicular to the pucker, as the black
phosphorus is softer in this direction, leading to a weakening effect for the
thermal conductance in the perpendicular direction. However, the out-of-plane
acoustic phonon branch behaviors abnormally; i.e., the group velocity of this
phonon branch is higher in the perpendicular direction, although the
single-layer black phosphorus is softer in this direction. The abnormal
behavior of the out-of-plane phonon branch is closely related to the highly
anisotropic Poisson's ratio in the single-layer black phosphorus. As a result
of the counteraction between the in-plane phonon modes and the out-of-plane
phonon mode, the thermal conductance in the perpendicular direction is weaker
than the parallel direction, but the anisotropy is pretty small.

In the REOBiS2 system, both crystal structure and physical properties are
tunable by mixing the RE (RE = rare earth) site with Ce, Nd and Sm due to the
difference of ionic radius of RE. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system, bulk
superconductivity is observed for x = 1.0 with y = 0.3 and x = 0.5 - 1.0 with y

along the a axis is generated while the c axis does not show a remarkable

increasing F concentration. Furthermore, we found that the Nd site can be
replaced by smaller Sm ions up to z = 0.8 in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. Bulk
superconductivity is observed within z = 0 - 0.8 for y = 0.3 and z = 0 - 0.6

pressure generated by systematic solution of the RE site in the blocking layer
commonly induces lattice contraction along the a axis in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. The obtained results indicate that both optimal F

the given answer. While the recognition of circular-arc graphs has been known
to be polynomial since the 1980s, no polynomial-time certifying recognition

combining the empirical star formation histories of Lu et al. (2014) and star
formation models that relate star formation rate with the cold gas mass in
galaxies. We find that the total baryon mass in low-mass galaxies is always
much less than the universal baryon mass fraction since $z = 2$, regardless of
star formation model adopted. The data for the evolution of the gas phase
metallicity require net metal outflow at $z\lesssim 2$, and the metal loading
factor is constrained to be about $0.01$, or about $60\%$ of the metal yield.
Based on the assumption that galactic outflow is more enriched in metal than
both the interstellar medium and the material ejected at earlier epochs, we are
able to put stringent constraints on the upper limits for both the net
accretion rate and the net mass outflow rate. The upper limits strongly suggest
that the evolution of the gas phase metallicity and gas mass fraction for
low-mass galaxies at $z < 2$ is not compatible with strong outflow. We
speculate that the low star formation efficiency of low-mass galaxies is owing
to some preventative processes that prevent gas from accreting into galaxies in
the first place.

colours, but at peak brightness SN 2011by reached a fainter absolute magnitude
in all optical bands and exhibited lower flux in the near-ultraviolet (NUV).
Based on those data, Foley & Kirshner (2013) argue that the progenitors of SNe
2011by and 2011fe were supersolar and subsolar, respectively, and that SN
2011fe generated 1.7 times the amount of 56Ni as SN 2011by. With this work, we
extend the comparison of these SNe Ia to 10 days before and 300 days after
maximum brightness with new spectra and photometry. We show that the nebular
phase spectra of SNe 2011fe and 2011by are almost identical, and do not support
a factor of 1.7 difference in 56Ni mass. Instead, we find it plausible that the
Tully-Fisher distance for SN 2011by is an underestimate, in which case these
SNe Ia may have reached similar peak luminosity, formed similar amounts of
56Ni, and had lower metallicity progenitors than previously estimated.
Regardless of the true distance to SN 2011by, we find that the relative
progenitor metallicity difference remains well supported by their disparity in
NUV flux, which we show to be even stronger at pre-maximum epochs --- although
contributions from differences in total ejecta mass, viewing angle, or
progenitor density cannot be ruled out. We also demonstrate that, independent
of distance modulus, SN 2011by exhibits a late-time luminosity excess that
cannot be explained by a light echo, but is more likely to be the result of
greater energy trapping by the nucleosynthetic products of SN 2011by.

to form in situ via the evolution of isolated binaries. In the standard
formation channel, these systems survived a common envelope phase, after which
the remaining helium core of the primary star and the subsequently formed BH
are not expected to be highly spinning. However, the measured spins of BHs in
LMXBs cover the whole range of spin parameters. We propose here that the BH
spin in LMXBs is acquired through accretion onto the BH after its formation. In
order to test this hypothesis, we calculated extensive grids of detailed binary
mass-transfer sequences. For each sequence, we examined whether, at any point
in time, the calculated binary properties are in agreement with their
observationally inferred counterparts of 16 Galactic LMXBs. The ""successful""
sequences give estimates of the mass that the BH has accreted since the onset
of Roche-Lobe overflow. We find that in all Galactic LMXBs with measured BH
spin, the origin of the spin can be accounted for by the accreted matter, and
we make predictions about the maximum BH spin in LMXBs where no measurement is
yet available. Furthermore, we derive limits on the maximum spin that any BH
can have depending on current properties of the binary it resides in. Finally
we discuss the implication that our findings have on the BH birth-mass
distribution, which is shifted by ~1.5 Msolar towards lower masses, compared to
the currently observed one.

forming regions is an inverse problem subject to complicated chemistry that
varies non-linearly with time and the physical environment. In this paper we
apply a Bayesian approach based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for
solving the non-linear inverse problems encountered in astrochemical modelling.
We use observations for ice and gas species in dark molecular clouds and a time
dependent, gas grain chemical model to infer the values of the physical and
chemical parameters that characterize quiescent regions of molecular clouds. We
show evidence that in high dimensional problems, MCMC algorithms provide a more
efficient and complete solution than more classical strategies. The results of
our MCMC method enable us to derive statistical estimates and uncertainties for
the physical parameters of interest as a result of the Bayesian treatment.

systems is a precious diagnostic of the nucleosynthesis processes that occur
deep within stars, and preserves information on the components history. The
binary system u Her belongs to a group of hot Algols with both components being
B-stars. We have isolated the individual spectra of the two components by the
technique of spectral disentangling of a new series of 43 high-resolution
echelle spectra. Augmenting these with an analysis of the Hipparcos photometry
of the system yields revised stellar quantities for the components of u Her.
For the primary component (the mass-gaining star) we find M_A = 7.88 +/- 0.26
M_sun, R_A = 4.93 +/- 0.15 R_sun and T_eff_A = 21600 +/- 220 K. For the
secondary (the mass-losing star) we find M_B = 2.79 +/- 0.12 M_sun, R_B = 4.26
+/- 0.06 R_sun and T_eff_B = 12600 +/- 550 K. A non-LTE analysis of the primary

from the standard cosmic abundance pattern in accord with theoretical
expectations for CNO nucleosynthesis processing. From a grid of calculated
evolutionary models the best match to the observed properties of the stars in u
Her enabled tracing the initial properties and history of this binary system.
We confirm that it has evolved according to case A mass transfer. A detailed
abundance analysis of the primary star gives C/N = 0.9, which supports the
evolutionary calculations and indicates strong mixing in the early evolution of
the secondary component, which was originally the more massive of the two. The
composition of the secondary component would be a further important constraint
on the initial properties of u Her system, but requires spectra of a higher

well studied problem in algorithmic mechanism design. Assuming that the social

propose a general approach to designing a randomized $\alpha$-approximation

decomposing an optimal solution for the relaxed linear program into a convex
combination of integer solutions. Unfortunately, Lavi and Swamy's decomposition

exceptions in the form of irregularities. Since rules in language are efficient

irregularity linger in the face of internal (endogenous) and external
(exogenous) pressures to conform to a rule? Here we address this problem by
taking a detailed look at simple past tense verbs in the Corpus of Historical
American English. The data show that the language is open, with many new verbs
entering. At the same time, existing verbs might tend to regularize or
irregularize as a consequence of internal dynamics, but overall, the amount of
irregularity sustained by the language stays roughly constant over time.
Despite continuous vocabulary growth, and presumably, an attendant increase in
expressive power, there is no corresponding growth in irregularity. We analyze
the set of irregulars, showing they may adhere to a set of minority rules,
allowing for increased stability of irregularity over time. These findings
contribute to the debate on how language systems become rule governed, and how
and why they sustain exceptions to rules, providing insight into the interplay
between the emergence and maintenance of rules and exceptions in language.

efficient because, contrary to prior work, it relies neither on source
separation, nor on monaural segregation. The method starts with a training
stage that establishes a locally-linear Gaussian regression model between the
directional coordinates of all the sources and the auditory features extracted
from binaural measurements. While fixed-length wide-spectrum sounds (white
noise) are used for training to reliably estimate the model parameters, we show
that the testing (localization) can be extended to variable-length
sparse-spectrum sounds (such as speech), thus enabling a wide range of
realistic applications. Indeed, we demonstrate that the method can be used for
audio-visual fusion, namely to map speech signals onto images and hence to
spatially align the audio and visual modalities, thus enabling to discriminate
between speaking and non-speaking faces. We release a novel corpus of real-room
recordings that allow quantitative evaluation of the co-localization method in
the presence of one or two sound sources. Experiments demonstrate increased
accuracy and speed relative to several state-of-the-art methods.

field with twice the winding number of the liquid crystal defect, coupling the
topological invariants of both fields. For example, it is possible to transform
uniformly-polarized light into light with a radial polarization profile. Our
approach also correctly yields a zero-intensity region near the defect core,
which is always present in areas of discontinuous light polarization or phase.
Using circularly polarized incident light, we show that defects with
non-integer winding numbers can be obtained, where topological constants are
preserved by phase vortices, demonstrating coupling between the light's spin,
orbital angular momentum and polarization profile. Further, we find an

multiple intensity regions, again depending on the defect's winding number,

dimensional spacetime and a gravitational field living in 11 dimensional

estimated by reproducing the particle - wave characteristic of diffraction
experiments. In the presence of matter fields the gravitational field develops
localized modes with elementary excitations called gravonons which are induced
by the sources (massive particles). The final world model treated here contains
only gravonons and a scalar matter field. The solution of the Schroedinger
equation for the world model yields matter fields which are localized in the 4
dimensional subspace. The localization has the following properties: (i) There
is a chooser mechanism for the selection of the localization site. (ii) The
chooser selects one site on the basis of minor energy differences and
differences in the gravonon structure between the sites, which appear
statistical. (iii) The changes from one localization site to a neighbouring one
take place in a telegraph-signal like manner. (iv) The times at which telegraph
like jumps occur dependent on subtleties of the gravonon structure which appear
statistical. (v) The fact that the dynamical law acts in the configuration
space of fields living in 11 dimensional spacetime lets the events observed in
4 dimensional spacetime appear non-local. In this way the phenomenology of
Copenhagen quantum mechanics is obtained without the need of introducing the
process of collapse and a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function.
Operators defining observables need not be introduced. All experimental
findings are explained in a deterministic way as a consequence of the time

investigate the impact of galaxy-cluster mergers on the order statistics of the

shifts the extreme value distribution of the largest Einstein radius to higher
values, typically increasing the expected value by ${\sim}10\%$. A comparison
with current data reveals that the largest observed Einstein radius agrees
excellently well with the theoretical predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at
redshifts $z > 0.5$. At redshifts $z < 0.5$, our results are somewhat more
controversial. Although cluster mergers also increase the expected values of
the order statistics of the $n$ largest Einstein radii by ${\sim}10\%$, the
theoretically expected values are notably lower (${\sim}3\sigma$ deviation for
$n = 12$) than the largest Einstein radii of a selected sample of SDSS clusters
in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.55$. The uncertainties of the observed
Einstein radii are still large, however, and thus the measurements need to be
carefully revised in future works. Therefore, given the premature state of
current observational data, overall, there is still no reliable statistical
evidence for observed Einstein radii to exceed the theoretical expectations of
the standard cosmological model.

root of an overdetermined or singular polynomial system with rational
coefficients. The difficulty lies in the fact that consistency of
overdetermined systems is not a continuous property. Our certification is based
on hybrid symbolic-numeric methods to compute the exact ""rational univariate
representation"" (RUR) of a component of the input system from approximate
roots. For overdetermined polynomial systems with simple roots, we compute an
initial RUR from approximate roots. The accuracy of the RUR is increased via
Newton iterations until the exact RUR is found, which we certify using exact
arithmetic. Since the RUR is well-constrained, we can use it to certify the
given approximate roots using alpha-theory. To certify isolated singular roots,
we use a determinantal form of the ""isosingular deflation"", which adds new
polynomials to the original system without introducing new variables. The
resulting polynomial system is overdetermined, but the roots are now simple,
thereby reducing the problem to the overdetermined case. We prove that our
algorithms have complexity that are polynomial in the input plus the output
size upon successful convergence, and we use worst case upper bounds for
termination when our iteration does not converge to an exact RUR. Examples are
included to demonstrate the approach.

is maximum at a certain temperature, and this temperature is lower for NNSS
than for OOSS. From a band structure viewpoint, we find that this can be traced
back to the narrowness of the band gap between the upper and the lower
pudding-mold type bands. On the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient of NNSS in
the low temperature regime steeply increases with increasing temperature, which
is due to the narrowness of the upper band. These differences in thermoelectric

problem arises naturally in a number of power systems contexts, most
importantly in the context of direct methods for transient stability analysis
and voltage stability assessment. We introduce a novel form of homotopy
continuation method called the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation
(NPHC) method that is mathematically guaranteed to find all the solutions
without ever encountering a bifurcation. The method is based on embedding the
real form of power flow equation in complex space, and tracking the generally
unphysical solutions with complex values of real and imaginary parts of the
voltage. The solutions converge to physical real form in the end of the
homotopy. The so-called $\gamma$-trick mathematically rigorously ensures that
all the paths are well-behaved along the paths, so unlike other continuation
approaches, no special handling of bifurcations is necessary. The method is
\textit{embarrassingly parallelizable} and can be applied to reasonably large
sized systems. We demonstrate the technique by analysis of several standard
test cases up to the 14-bus system size. Finally, we discuss possible
strategies for scaling the method to large size systems, and propose several
applications for transient stability analysis and voltage stability assessment.

expression for the exit probability of the $q$-voter model in one dimension.
This expression gives a better fit for the more recent data about simulations
in large networks, and as such, departs from the expression
$\frac{\rho^q}{\rho^q + (1-\rho)^q}$ found in papers that investigated small
networks only. The approximation consists in assuming a large separation on the
time scales at which active groups of agents convince inactive ones and the
time taken in the competition between active groups. Some interesting findings
are that for $q=2$ we still have $\frac{\rho^2}{\rho^2 + (1-\rho)^2}$ as the
exit probability and for large values of $q$ the difference between the result
and $\frac{\rho^q}{\rho^q + (1-\rho)^q}$ becomes negligible (the difference is
maximum for $q=5$ and 6)

p_2$, exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. Responsible
for the speed-up is a subroutine called the quantum order finding algorithm
(QOFA) which calculates the order -- the smallest integer, $r$, satisfying $a^r
\mod N =1$, where $a$ is a randomly chosen integer coprime to $N$ (meaning
their greatest common divisor is one, $\gcd(a, N) =1$). Given $r$, and with
probability not less than $1/2$, the factors are given by $p_1 = \gcd
(a^{\frac{r}{2}} - 1, N)$ and $p_2 = \gcd (a^{\frac{r}{2}} + 1, N)$. For odd
$r$ it is assumed the factors cannot be found (since $a^{\frac{r}{2}}$ is not
generally integer) and the QOFA is relaunched with a different value of $a$.
But a recent paper [E. Martin-Lopez: Nat Photon {\bf 6}, 773 (2012)] noted that
the factors can sometimes be found from odd orders if the coprime is square.
  This raises the question of improving SFA's success probability by
considering odd orders. We show that an improvement is possible, though it is
small. We present two techniques for retrieving the order from apparently
useless runs of the QOFA: not discarding odd orders; and looking out for new
order finding relations in the case of failure. In terms of efficiency, using
our techniques is equivalent to avoiding square coprimes and disregarding odd
orders, which is simpler in practice. Even still, our techniques may be useful
in the near future, while demonstrations are restricted to factoring small
numbers. The most convincing demonstrations of the QOFA are those that return a
non-power-of-two order, making odd orders that lead to the factors attractive
to experimentalists.

to imply a well defined background cosmological model. It may not. Smoothing
over structure adds in an extra contribution, transferring power from small
scales up to large. Second-order perturbation theory implies that the effect is
small, but suggests that formally the perturbation series may not converge. The
amplitude of the effect is actually determined by the ratio of the Hubble
scales at matter-radiation equality and today - which are entirely unrelated.
This implies that a universe with significantly lower temperature today could
have significant backreaction from more power on small scales, and so provides
the ideal testing ground for understanding backreaction. We investigate this
using two different N-body numerical simulations - a 3D Newtonian and a 1D
simulation which includes all relevant relativistic effects. We show that while
perturbation theory predicts an increasing backreaction as more initial
small-scale power is added, in fact the virialisation of structure saturates
the backreaction effect at the same level independently of the equality scale.
This implies that backreaction is a small effect independently of initial
conditions. Nevertheless, it may still contribute at the percent level to
certain cosmological observables and therefore it cannot be neglected in
precision cosmology.

positions and dwell times in prostate HDR brachytherapy use surrogate linear or
quadratic objective functions that have no direct interpretation in terms of
dose-volume histogram (DVH) criteria, do not result in an optimum or have long
solution times.
  We decrease the solution time of existing linear and quadratic dose-based
programming models (LP and QP, respectively) to allow optimizing over potential
catheter positions using mixed integer programming. An additional average
speed-up of 75% can be obtained by stopping the solver at an early stage,
without deterioration of the plan quality. For a fixed catheter configuration,
the dwell time optimization model LP solves to optimality in less than 15
seconds, which confirms earlier results. We propose an iterative procedure for
QP that allows to prescribe the target dose as an interval, while retaining
independence between the solution time and the number of dose calculation
points. This iterative procedure is comparable in speed to the LP model, and
produces better plans than the non-iterative QP.
  We formulate a new dose-volume based model that maximizes $V_{100\%}$ while
satisfying pre-set DVH-criteria. This model optimizes both catheter positions
and dwell times within a few minutes depending on prostate volume and number of
catheters, optimizes dwell times within 35 seconds, and gives better DVH
statistics than dose-based models. The solutions suggest that the correlation
between objective value and clinical plan quality is weak in existing
dose-based models.

the fidelity of the target entangling operation. We demonstrate how the
exclusive use of discrete phase shifts in the field moderating the
qubit-oscillator interaction - easily implemented with modern synthesizers - is
sufficient to both ensure multiple oscillator modes are decoupled and to
suppress the effects of fluctuations in the driving field. This approach is
amenable to a wide variety of technical implementations including geometric
phase gates in superconducting qubits and the Molmer-Sorensen gate for trapped

interactions (temperature dependence and zero-point motion effect) is important
in many materials. We address it in the adiabatic harmonic approximation, based
on first principles (e.g. Density-Functional Theory), from different points of
view: directly from atomic position fluctuations or, alternatively, from
Janak's theorem generalized to the case where the Helmholtz free energy,
including the vibrational entropy, is used. We prove their equivalence, based
on the usual form of Janak's theorem and on the dynamical equation. We then
also place the Allen-Heine-Cardona (AHC) theory of the renormalization in a
first-principle context. The AHC theory relies on the rigid-ion approximation,
and naturally leads to a self-energy (Fan) contribution and a Debye-Waller
contribution. Such a splitting can also be done for the complete harmonic
adiabatic expression, in which the rigid-ion approximation is not required. A
numerical study within the Density-Functional Perturbation theory framework
allows us to compare the AHC theory with frozen-phonon calculations, with or
without the rigid-ion terms. For the two different numerical approaches without
rigid-ion terms, the agreement is better than 7 $\mu$eV in the case of diamond,
which represent an agreement to 5 significant digits. The magnitude of the non
rigid-ion terms in this case is also presented, distinguishing specific phonon
modes contributions to different electronic eigenenergies.

the first of a series on $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-Supergeometry. The new theory
exhibits challenging differences with the classical one: nonzero degree even
coordinates are not nilpotent, and even (resp., odd) coordinates do not
necessarily commute (resp., anticommute) pairwise (the parity is the parity of
the total degree). It is based on the hierarchy: `
$\mathbb{Z}_2^0$-Supergeometry (classical differential Geometry) contains the
germ of $\mathbb{Z}_2^1$-Supergeometry (standard Supergeometry), which in turn
contains the sprout of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-Supergeometry, etc.' The
$\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supergeometric viewpoint provides deeper insight and
simplified solutions; interesting relations with Quantum Field Theory and
Quantum Mechanics are expected. In this article, we define
$\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifolds and provide examples in the atlas, the ringed
space and coordinate settings. We thus show that formal series are the
appropriate substitute for nilpotency. Moreover, the category of
$\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifolds is closed with respect to the tangent and
cotangent functors. The fundamental theorem describing supermorphisms in terms

approach and allow both the autoregressive coefficients and innovation variance
to vary over time. Importantly, our estimation method uses the lattice filter
and is cast within the partial autocorrelation domain. The marginal posterior
distributions are of standard form and, as a convenient by-product of our
estimation method, our approach avoids undesirable matrix inversions. As such,
estimation is extremely computationally efficient and stable. To illustrate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that
compares our method with other competing methods and find that, in most cases,
our approach performs superior in terms of average squared error between the
estimated and true time-varying spectral density. Lastly, we demonstrate our
methodology through three modeling applications; namely, insect communication
signals, environmental data (wind components), and macroeconomic data (US gross

goodness-of-fit test of the errors in nonlinear autoregressive time series
models with stationary $\alpha$-mixing error terms. The test statistic is based
on the integrated squared error of the nonparametric error density estimate and
the null error density. By deriving the asymptotic normality of test statistics
in these models, we extend the result of Cheng and Sun (Statist. Probab. Lett.
\textbf{78}, 1(2008), 50-59) in the model with i.i.d error terms to the more
general case.

approaches, are revolutionizing many classical disciplines. These techniques
can also be applied to food and nutrition, which must be studied to design
healthy diets. Using nutritional information from over 1,000 raw foods, we
systematically evaluated the nutrient composition of each food in regards to
satisfying daily nutritional requirements. The nutrient balance of a food was
quantified herein as nutritional fitness, using the food's frequency of
occurrence in nutritionally adequate food combinations. Nutritional fitness
offers prioritization of recommendable foods within a global network of foods,
in which foods are connected based on the similarities of their nutrient
compositions. We identified a number of key nutrients, such as choline and
alpha-linolenic acid, whose levels in foods can critically affect the foods'
nutritional fitness. Analogously, pairs of nutrients can have the same effect.
In fact, two nutrients can impact the nutritional fitness synergistically,
although the individual nutrients alone may not. This result, involving the
tendency among nutrients to show correlations in their abundances across foods,
implies a hidden layer of complexity when exploring for foods whose balance of
nutrients within pairs holistically helps meet nutritional requirements.
Interestingly, foods with high nutritional fitness successfully maintain this
nutrient balance. This effect expands our scope to a diverse repertoire of
nutrient-nutrient correlations, integrated under a common network framework
that yields unexpected yet coherent associations between nutrients. Our
nutrient-profiling approach combined with a network-based analysis provides a
more unbiased, global view of the relationships between foods and nutrients,
and can be extended towards nutritional policies, food marketing, and
personalized nutrition.

with heterogeneous fracture aperture fields is proposed. Inside fractures,
fluid transport is calculated on the finest scale and found to be localized in
channels as a consequence of the aperture field. The channel network is
characterized and reduced to a vectorized artificial channel network (ACN).
Different realizations of ACNs are used to systematically calculate efficient
apertures for fluid transport inside differently sized fractures as well as
fracture intersection and entry properties. Typical situations in fracture
networks are parameterized by fracture inclination, flow path length along the
fracture and intersection lengths in the entrance and outlet zones of
fractures. Using these scaling relations obtained from the finer scales, we
simulate the invasion process of immiscible fluids into saturated discrete
fracture networks, which were studied in previous works.

  Outcomes of Mortality and Mean Duration of I.C.U. Stay",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis conducts an observational study into whether diuretics should be
administered to ICU patients with sepsis when length of stay in the ICU and
30-day post-hospital mortality are considered. The central contribution of the
thesis is a stepwise, reusable software-based approach for examining the
outcome of treatment vs no-treatment decisions with observational data. The
thesis implements, demonstrates and draws findings via three steps: Step 1.
Form a study group and prepare modeling variables. Step 2. Model the propensity
of the study group with respect to the administration of diuretics with a
propensity score function and create groups of patients balanced in this
propensity. Step 3. Statistically model each outcome with study variables to
decide whether the administration of diuretics has a significant impact.
Additionally, the thesis presents a preliminary machine learning based method
using Genetic Programming to predict mortality and length of stay in ICU
outcomes for the study group. The thesis finds, for its study group, in three
of five propensity balanced quintiles, a statistically significant longer
length of stay when diuretics are administered. For a less sick subset of
patients (SAPS ICU admission score < 17) the administration of diuretics has a
significant negative effect on mortality.
