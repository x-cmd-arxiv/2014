datatypes (set functors) can be usefully analyzed via container representations
in terms of a set of shapes and a set of positions in each shape. This paper
builds on the observation that datatypes often carry additional structure that
containers alone do not account for. We introduce directed containers to
capture the common situation where every position in a data-structure
determines another data-structure, informally, the sub-data-structure rooted by
that position. Some natural examples are non-empty lists and node-labelled
trees, and data-structures with a designated position (zippers). While
containers denote set functors via a fully-faithful functor, directed
containers interpret fully-faithfully into comonads. But more is true: every
comonad whose underlying functor is a container is represented by a directed
container. In fact, directed containers are the same as containers that are
comonads. We also describe some constructions of directed containers. We have
formalized our development in the dependently typed programming language Agda.

The implied inversion statistic is equivalent to a statistic on ordered set
partitions studied by Steingr\'imsson, Ishikawa, Kasraoui, and Zeng, and is
known to have a nice distribution in terms of $q$-Stirling numbers. The
resulting major index exhibits a combinatorial relationship between

combination of the inverted s- and p-band dispersions, the engineered
pseudo-spin coupling, and the attractive on-site atom interaction, naturally
allows the observation of FFLO superfluids as well as MFs in different

insulator (TI) with edge states, the MFs in the superfluid may be found to be
in the conduction or valence band, distinguished from previous TI-based schemes

gets more costly to use reserve generation to compensate for the variability of
renewables like solar and wind. Hence attention has been drawn to exploiting
flexibility in demand as a substitute for reserve generation. Flexibility has
different attributes. In this paper we consider loads requiring a constant
power for a specified duration (within say one day), whose flexibility resides
in the fact that power may be delivered at any time so long as the total
duration of service equals the load's specified duration. We give conditions
under which a variable power supply is adequate to meet these flexible loads,
and describe how to allocate the power to the loads. We also characterize the
additional power needed when the supply is inadequate. We study the problem of
allocating the available power to loads to maximize welfare, and show that the
welfare optimum can be sustained as a competitive equilibrium in a forward
market in which electricity is sold as service contracts differentiated by the
duration of service and power level. We compare this forward market with a spot
market in their ability to capture the flexiblity inherent in

delivery of material and energy fluxes to its body and coastal zone in a way
that avoids malnourishment that would compromise system integrity. We present a
quantitative framework for studying delta topology and transport based on
representation of a deltaic system by a rooted directed acyclic graph. Applying
results from spectral graph theory allows systematic identification of the
upstream and downstream subnetworks for a given vertex, computing steady flux
propagation in the network, and finding partition of the flow at any channel
among the downstream channels. We use this framework to construct vulnerability
maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the
shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream
links. This enables us to evaluate which links hotspots and what management
scenarios would most influence flux delivery to the outlets. The results can be
used to examine local or spatially distributed delta interventions and develop
a system approach to delta management.

$S_2$, and seminormality. Equivalently, these are varieties $X$ with Serre's
$S_2$ property, such that there exists an open subvariety $U$, with complement
of codimension at least two, such that the only singularities of $U$ are
(analytically) double normal crossings. Such varieties have been called
""demi-normal"" by Koll\'ar \cite{Kol13}. First, we discuss why these properties
are ideal for the study of nonnormal varieties that appear in the birational
classification of varieties. We define semiresolutions and provide examples to
illustrate the procedure of gluing along the conductor as the fundamental tool
in obtaining a semiresolution of $X$ from a resolution of its normalization. As
an application of these methods, we discuss semirational singularities. Our
main results are a semismooth Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem
(Theorem 4.2) and a proof that the definition of semirational singularities
does not depend on the semiresolution chosen (Theorem 4.3) . The smooth version
of (4.2) first appeared in \cite{GR70}. We also explain why semirational
singularities are, in particular, Cohen-Macaulay and DuBois. Finally, we
discuss the role semiresolutions play in forming a nonnormal interpretation of
the results of de Fernex and Hacon in \cite{dFH09}, where the
$\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis was found to be extraneous in the birational
classification of normal varieties.

points of a Poisson process of intensity $\mu$ and, in each piece, the
Hamiltonian is the Dirichlet Laplacian. The particles interact through a
repulsive pair potential decaying polynomially fast at infinity. We assume that
the particles have a positive density, i.e., $n/|\Lambda|\to\rho>0$ as
$|\Lambda|\to+\infty$. In the low density or large disorder regime, i.e.,
$\rho/\mu$ small, we obtain a two term asymptotic for the thermodynamic limit
of the ground state energy per particle of the interacting system; the first
order correction term to the non interacting ground state energy per particle
is controlled by pairs of particles living in the same piece. The ground state
is described in terms of its one and two-particles reduced density matrix.
Comparing the interacting and the non interacting ground states, one sees that
the effect of the repulsive interactions is to move a certain number of
particles living together with another particle in a single piece to a new
piece that was free of particles in the non interacting ground state.

on the range of the interaction via the screening parameter $\kappa$. How to
determine in this case an effective coupling parameter has been a matter of
intensive debate. Here we propose a consistent approach for defining and
measuring the coupling strength in Coulomb and Yukawa OCPs based on a
fundamental structural quantity, the radial pair distribution function (RPDF).
The RPDF is often accessible in experiments by direct observation or indirectly
through the static structure factor. Alternatively, it is directly computed in
theoretical models or simulations. Our approach is based on the observation
that the build-up of correlation from a weakly coupled system proceeds in two
steps: First, a monotonically increasing volume around each particle becomes
devoid of other particles (correlation hole), and second (upon further increase
of the coupling), a shell structure emerges around each particle giving rise to
growing peaks of the RPDF. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we present a
systematic study for the dependence of these features of the RPDF on $\Gamma$
and $\kappa$ and derive a simple expression for the effective coupling
parameter.

uniqueness of tangents in the special case of G-plurisubharmonic functions,
where G is a compact subset of the Grassmannian of p-planes in ${\mathbb R}^n$.
An upper semi-continuous function u on an open set $\Omega$ in ${\mathbb R}^n$
is G-plurisubharmonic if its restriction to $\Omega\cap W$ is subharmonic for
every affine G-plane $W$. Here G is assumed to be invariant under a subgroup K
of O(n) which acts transitively on the sphere $S^{n-1}$. Tangents to u at a
point x are the cluster points of u under a natural flow (or blow-up) at x.
They always exist and are G-harmonic at all points of continuity. A homogeneity
property is established for all tangents in these geometric cases. This leads
to principal results concerning the Strong Uniqueness of Tangents, which means
that all tangents are unique and of the form $\Theta K_p$ where $K_p$ is the
Riesz kernel and $\Theta$ is the density of u at the point. Strong uniqueness
is a form of regularity which implies that the sets $\{\Theta(u,x)\geq c\}$ for
$c>0$ are discrete. When the invariance group K= O(n), U(n) or Sp(n), strong
uniqueness holds for all but a small handful of cases. It also holds for
essentially all interesting G which arise in calibrated geometry.
  When strong uniqueness fails, homogeneity implies that tangents are
characterized by a subequation on the sphere, which is worked out in detail. In
the cases corresponding to the real, complex and quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere
equations (convex functions, and complex and quaternionic plurisubharmonic
functions) tangents, which are far from unique, are then systematically studied
and classified.

earliest examples due to Euler and Lagrange. There are numerous results in the
literature demonstrating the existence of central configurations with specific
symmetry properties, using slightly different techniques in each. The aim here
is to describe a uniform approach by adapting to the symmetric case the
well-known variational argument showing the existence of central
configurations. The principal conclusion is that there is a central
configuration for every possible symmetry type, and for any symmetric choice of
masses. Finally the same argument is applied to the class of balanced
configurations introduced by Albouy and Chenciner.

where both the $3\alpha$ condensate and ${^{8}{\rm Be}} + \alpha$ cluster
asymptotic configurations are included. A new method is also used to resolve
spurious continuum coupling with physical states. We focus on the structures of
the ""Hoyle band"" states, $2_2^+$, and $4_2^+$ states, which are recently
observed above the Hoyle state and of the $0_3^+$ and $0_4^+$ states, which are
also quite recently identified in experiment. Their resonance parameters and
decay properties are reasonably reproduced. All these states have gaslike
configurations of the $3\alpha$ clusters with larger root mean square radii
than that of the Hoyle state. The Hoyle band is not simply considered to be the
${^{8}{\rm Be}}(0^+) +\alpha$ rotation as suggested by previous cluster model
calculations, nor to be a rotation of a rigid-body triangle-shaped object
composed of the $3\alpha$ particles. This is mainly due to the specificity of
the Hoyle state, which has the $3\alpha$ condensate structure and gives a rise
to the $0_3^+$ state with a prominent ${^{8}{\rm Be}}(0^+)+\alpha$ structure as
a result of very strong monopole excitation from the Hoyle state.

motors operating on the micro-scale domain. It was proven [J. Spiechowicz et
al., J. Stat. Mech. P02044, (2013)] that biased noise $\eta(t)$ can induce
normal and anomalous transport processes similar to those generated by a static
force $F$ acting on inertial Brownian particles in a reflection-symmetric
periodic structure in presence of symmetric unbiased time-periodic driving.
Here, we show that within selected parameter regimes, noise $\eta(t)$ of the
mean value $\langle \eta(t) \rangle = F$ can be significantly more effective
than the deterministic force $F$: the motor can move much faster, its velocity
fluctuations are much smaller and the motor efficiency increases several times.
These features hold true in both normal and absolute negative mobility regimes.
We demonstrate this with detailed simulations by resource to generalized white
Poissonian noise. Our theoretical results can be tested and corroborated
experimentally by use of a setup that consists of a resistively and
capacitively shunted Josephson junction. The suggested strategy to replace $F$
by $\eta(t)$ may provide a new operating principle in which micro- and
nanomotors could be powered by biased noise.

surface effects in plasmonics necessarily requires a fully quantum-mechanical
approach, such as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), that goes
beyond an effective Drude-type model. We present a more general formulation of
the hydrodynamic model for the inhomogeneous electron gas, which additionally
includes gradients of the electron density in the energy functional. In doing
so, we arrive at a Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Model (SC-HDM), where spill-out
emerges naturally. We find a redshift for the optical response of Na nanowires,
and a blueshift for Ag nanowires, which are both in quantitative agreement with
experiments and more advanced quantum methods. The SC-HDM gives accurate
results with modest computational effort, and can be applied to arbitrary
nanoplasmonic systems of much larger sizes than accessible with TD-DFT methods.
Moreover, while the latter typically neglect retardation effects due to
time-varying magnetic fields, our SC-HDM takes retardation fully into account.

isomorphism for countable models of T up to two model-theoretic invariants. If
T admits a nonsimple type, then it is shown to be Borel complete by embedding
the isomorphism problem for linear orders into the isomorphism problem for
models of T. This is done by constructing models with specific linear orders in
the tail of the Archimedean ladder of a suitable nonsimple type.
  If the theory admits no nonsimple types, then we use Mayer's characterization
of isomorphism for such theories to compute invariants for countable models. If
the theory is small, then the invariant is real-valued, and therefore its
isomorphism relation is smooth. If not, the invariant corresponds to a
countable set of reals, and therefore the isomorphism relation is Borel
equivalent to $F_2$.
  Combining these two results, we conclude that (Mod(T),$\cong$) is either
maximally complicated or maximally uncomplicated (subject to completely general
model-theoretic lower bounds based on the number of types and the number of
countable models).

constant relies on time delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed

span a range from 50 - 100 km/s/Mpc. Quasars monitored to measure these time
delays, are multi-component objects. The variability may arise from different
components of the quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a
variable emitting region in a jet with emission from the core region may
introduce an error in the Hubble constant derived from a time delay. Here, we
investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying physical
explanation of the widespread in values of the Hubble constant based on
gravitational lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the derived
value of the Hubble constant is very sensitive to the offset between the center
of the emission and the center of the variable emitting region. Thus, we
propose using the value of H0 known from other techniques to spatially resolve
the origin of the variable emission once the time delay is measured. We
advocate this method particularly for gamma-ray astronomy, where the angular

as long as magnetic fields remain frozen in the gas. The latter condition
depends on the levels of ionisation that characterise the innermost regions of
a collapsing cloud. The chemistry of dense cloud cores and, in particular, the
ionisation fraction is largely controlled by cosmic rays. The aim of this paper
is to evaluate whether the attenuation of the flux of cosmic rays expected in
the regions around a forming protostar is sufficient to decouple the field from
the gas, thereby influencing the formation of centrifugally supported disc. We
adopted the method developed in a former study to compute the attenuation of
the cosmic-ray flux as a function of the column density and the field strength
in clouds threaded by poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. We applied this
formalism to models of low- and high-mass star formation extracted from
numerical simulations of gravitational collapse that include rotation and
turbulence. For each model we determine the size of the magnetic decoupling
zone, where collapse or rotation motion becomes unaffected by the local
magnetic field. In general, we find that decoupling only occurs when the
attenuation of cosmic rays is taken into account with respect to a calculation
in which the cosmic-ray ionisation rate is kept constant. The extent of the
decoupling zone also depends on the dust grain size distribution and is larger
if large grains (of radius $\sim 10^{-5}$ cm) are formed by compression and
coagulation during cloud collapse. We conclude that a realistic treatment of
cosmic-ray propagation and attenuation during cloud collapse may lead to a
value of the resistivity of the gas in the innermost few hundred AU around a
forming protostar that is higher than generally assumed.

gas-rich high-redshift disc galaxies. In this paper, we revisit the
axisymmetric perturbation theory and the resulting growth of structure by
taking the realistic thickness of the disc into account. In the unstable
regime, which corresponds for thick discs to a Toomre parameter below the
critical value Q_0,crit = 0.696, we find a fastest growing perturbation
wavelength that is always a factor 1.93 times larger than in the classical
razor-thin disc approximation. This result is independent of the adopted disc
scaleheight and by this independent of temperature and surface density. In
order to test the analytical theory, we compare it with a high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulation of an isothermal gravitationally unstable gas disc
with the typical vertical sech^2 density profile and study its break up into
rings that subsequently fragment into dense clumps. In the first phase, rings
form, that organize themselves discretely, with distances corresponding to the
local fastest growing perturbation wavelength. We find that the disc
scaleheight has to be resolved initially with five or more grid cells in order
to guarantee proper growth of the ring structures, which follow the analytical
prediction. These rings later on contract to a thin and dense line, while at
the same time accreting more gas from the inter-ring region. It is these dense,
circular filaments, that subsequently fragment into a large number of clumps.
Contrary to what is typically assumed, the clump sizes are therefore not
directly determined by the fastest growing wavelength.

processes of cloud formation and dissipation in brown dwarf atmospheres. Here
we report the results of an independent analysis of archival data from the
Brown dwarf Atmosphere Monitoring (BAM) program. Time series data for 14 L and
T dwarfs reported to be significantly variable over timescales of hours were
analyzed. We confirm large-amplitude variability (amplitudes $>$2\%) for 4/13
targets and place upper limits of 0.7\%-1.6\% on variability in the remaining
sample. For two targets we find evidence of weak variability at amplitudes of
1.3\% and 1.6\%. Based on our revised classification of variable objects in the
BAM study, we find strong variability outside the L/T transition to be rare at
near infrared wavelengths. From a combined sample of 81 L0-T9 dwarfs from the
revised BAM sample and the variability survey of Radigan et al. we infer an
overall observed frequency for large-amplitude variability outside the L/T
transition of 3.2$_{-1.8}^{+2.8}$\%, in contrast to 24$^{+11}_{-9}$\% for
L9-T3.5 spectral types. We conclude that while strong variability is not
limited to the L/T transition, it occurs more frequently in this spectral type
range, indicative of larger or more highly contrasting cloud features at these

assumed true spectra for K giants should be based on neither the assumption
that molecular band strengths in the infrared can be predicted accurately from
optical spectral class or color nor synthetric spectra. The OH bands in K
giants grow stronger with cooler stellar temperatures, and they are stronger
than predicted by synthetic spectra. As a group, A dwarfs are better behaved

excesses from debris disks. No suitable A dwarfs were located in parts of the
sky continuously observable from Spitzer, and with previous means of estimating
the true spectra of K giants ruled out, it was necessary to use models of A

quantitatively compare performances from different events of track, field, and
road running in a meaningful way. There are several commonly-used methods, but
each has its limitations. Some methods, for example, are valid only for running
events, or are unable to compare men's performances to women's, while others
are based largely on world records and are thus unsuitable for comparing world
records to one other. The most versatile and widely-used statistic is a set of
scoring tables compiled by the IAAF, which are updated and published every few
years. Unfortunately, these methods are not fully disclosed. In this paper, we
propose a straight-forward, objective, model-based algorithm for assigning
scores to athletic performances for the express purpose of comparing marks
between different events. Specifically, the main score we propose is based on
the expected number of athletes who perform better than a given mark within a
calendar year. Computing this naturally interpretable statistic requires only a
list of the top performances in each event and is not overly dependent on a
small number of marks, such as the world records. We found that this statistic
could predict the quality of future performances better than the IAAF scoring
tables, and is thus better suited for comparing performances from different
events. In addition, the probabilistic model used to generate the performance
scores allows for multiple interpretations which can be adapted for various
purposes, such as calculating the expected top mark in a given event or
calculating the probability of a world record being broken within a certain
time period. In this paper, we give the details of the model and the scores, a

provide great computational power. However, exploiting such platforms for
existing scientific applications is not a trivial task. Current GPU programming
frameworks such as CUDA C/C++ require low-level programming from the developer
in order to achieve high performance code. As a result porting of applications
to GPUs is typically limited to time-dominant algorithms and routines, leaving
the remainder not accelerated which can open a serious Amdahl's law issue. The
lattice QCD application Chroma allows to explore a different porting strategy.
The layered structure of the software architecture logically separates the
data-parallel from the application layer. The QCD Data-Parallel software layer
provides data types and expressions with stencil-like operations suitable for
lattice field theory and Chroma implements algorithms in terms of this
high-level interface. Thus by porting the low-level layer one can effectively
move the whole application in one swing to a different platform. The
QDP-JIT/PTX library, the reimplementation of the low-level layer, provides a
framework for lattice QCD calculations for the CUDA architecture. The complete
software interface is supported and thus applications can be run unaltered on
GPU-based parallel computers. This reimplementation was possible due to the
availability of a JIT compiler (part of the NVIDIA Linux kernel driver) which
translates an assembly-like language (PTX) to GPU code. The expression template
technique is used to build PTX code generators and a software cache manages the
GPU memory. This reimplementation allows us to deploy an efficient
implementation of the full gauge-generation program with dynamical fermions on
large-scale GPU-based machines such as Titan and Blue Waters which accelerates
the algorithm by more than an order of magnitude.

decomposition in the snapshot space. The spectral decomposition is based on the

their cons and pros. Continuous Galerkin methods allow avoiding penalty
parameters though they involve partition of unity functions which can alter the
properties of multiscale basis functions. On the other hand, discontinuous
Galerkin techniques allow gluing multiscale basis functions without any
modifications. Because basis functions are constructed independently from each

techniques that use snapshots in larger regions to construct the offline space.
We provide numerical results to show that one can accurately approximate the

streamlined version of the CMS reconstruction and analysis software running on
a computer farm. The software-base HLT requires a trade-off between the
complexity of the algorithms, the sustainable output rate, and the selection
efficiency. This is going to be even more challenging during Run II, with a
higher centre-of-mass energy, a higher instantaneous luminosity and pileup, and
the impact of out-of-time pileup due to the 25 ns bunch spacing. The online
algorithms need to be optimised for such a complex environment in order to keep

spectral index, and fractional polarization. The Rotation Measure varies across
the face of the Large Relic but is not well correlated with the other
properties of the source. The shape of individual filaments suggests that the
Large Relic is at least 25 kpc thick. We detect a low surface brightness arc

physical connection between these features. The center of the F-complex is

morphological similarities to the radio structure of NGC1265. Source C, the
Long Tail, is unresolved in width near the galaxy core and is </~100pc in

many of the unusual phenomena can be understood in the context of Abell 2256

a relativistic scalar field theory in which the couplings are arbitrary aside

theory is assumed to have two-particle phase shifts that are bounded by \pi/2
in the regime of elastic scattering. We determine the spectrum of the

it depends on the infinite-volume two-to-two K-matrix as well as a nonstandard
infinite-volume three-to-three K-matrix. A key feature of our result is the
need to subtract physical singularities in the three-to-three amplitude and
thus deal with a divergence-free quantity. This allows our initial, formal
result to be truncated to a finite dimensional determinant equation. At
present, the relation of the three-to-three K-matrix to the corresponding
scattering amplitude is not known, although previous results in the
non-relativistic limit suggest that such a relation exists.

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Stellar models are evolved with initial
masses between 1Msun and 7Msun at Z=0.007, and 1Msun and 8Msun at Z=0.014

with helium enriched compositions (Y=0.30, 0.35, 0.40) at Z=0.014 and Z=0.03.
The efficiency of third dredge-up and the mass range of carbon stars decreases
with an increase in metallicity. We predict carbon stars form from initial
masses between 1.75-7Msun at Z=0.007 and between 2-4.5Msun at solar
metallicity. At Z=0.03 the mass range for C-star production is narrowed to
3.25-4Msun. The third dredge-up is reduced when the helium content of the model
increases owing to the reduced number of thermal pulses on the AGB. A small
increase of Delta Y = 0.05 is enough to prevent the formation of C stars at
Z=0.03, depending on the mass-loss rate, whereas at Z=0.014, an increase of
Delta Y = 0.1 is required to prevent the formation of C stars. We speculate
that the probability of finding C stars in a stellar population depends as much
on the helium abundance as on the metallicity. To explain the paucity of C
stars in the inner region of M31 we conclude that the observed stars have Y >
0.35 or that the stellar metallicity is higher than [Fe/H] ~ 0.1.

multiple superconducting energy gaps in different bands with interaction
between Cooper pairs in these bands. The discovery of prominent multiband

triggered enormous interests in multiband superconductors. Most recently
discovered superconductors exhibit multiband features. The multiband
superconductors possess novel properties that are not shared by their
single-band counterpart. Examples include the time-reversal symmetry broken
state in multiband superconductors with frustrated interband couplings, the
collective oscillation of number of Cooper pairs between different bands, known
as the Leggett mode, the phase soliton and fractional vortex, which are the
main focus of this review. This review presents a survey of a wide range of

to highlight unusual and unique properties of multiband superconductors, and to
reveal the challenges and opportunities in the research on the multiband

spectroscopy with OSIRIS of the innermost regions of the NGC 1333 SVS 13

arc sec long microjet traced by the emission of shock-excited [FeII]. Beyond
the extent of this jet, we find a series of bubbles and fragments of bubbles
that are traced in the lower excitation H_2 1-0 S(1) line. While the most
recent outflow activity is directed almost precisely (PA ~145 deg) to the
south-east of SVS 13, there is clear indication that prior bubble ejections
were pointed in different directions. Within these variations, a clear
connection of the newly observed bubble ejection events to the well-known,
poorly collimated HH 7-11 system of Herbig-Haro objects is established.
Astrometry of the youngest of the expanding shock fronts at 3 epochs covering a
time span of over two years gives kinematic ages for two of these. The
kinematic age of the youngest bubble is slightly older than the historically
observed last photometric outburst of SVS 13 in 1990, consistent with that
event launching the bubble and some deceleration of its expansion. A
re-evaluation of historic infrared photometry and new data show that SVS 13 has
not yet returned to its brightness before that outburst and thus shows a
behavior similar to FUor outbursts, albeit with a smaller amplitude. We
postulate that the creation of a series of bubbles and the changes in outflow
direction are indicative of a precessing disk and accretion events triggered by
a repetitive phenomenon possibly linked to the orbit of a close binary
companion. We have tried, but failed to detect, the kinematic signature of
rotation of the microjet in the [FeII] emission line at 1.644 micrometers.

to relax the notion of exactly satisfying a tolerance value. We then
concentrate on a {\em probabilistic} relaxation of the given tolerance. This

These two parameters are known to be related linearly, with the jet power
resulting from the Bondi power by multiplication with an efficiency factor of
order 1%. Using a recently published (Nemmen + Tchekhovskoy 2014) high-quality
sample of 27 radio galaxies, I construct a P_B-P_jet diagram that includes
information on optical AGN types as far as available. This diagram indicates
that the jet production efficiency is a function of AGN type: Seyfert 2
galaxies seem to be systematically (with a false alarm probability of 0.043%)
less efficient, by about one order of magnitude, in powering jets than Seyfert
1 galaxies, LINERs, or the remaining radio galaxies. This suggests an
evolutionary sequence from Sy2s to Sy1s and LINERs, controlled by an interplay
of jets on the one hand and dust and gas in galactic nuclei on the other hand.
When taking this effect into account, the P_B-P_jet relation is probably much
tighter intrinsically than currently assumed.

arbitrary formal group law (and thus a generalized cohomology theory). We focus
on the case of the hyperbolic formal group law (corresponding to elliptic
cohomology). We study some of the properties of formal root polynomials. We
give applications to the efficient computation of the transition matrix between
two natural bases of the formal Demazure algebra in the hyperbolic case. As a
corollary, we rederive in a transparent and uniform manner the formulas of
Billey and Graham-Willems. We also prove the corresponding formula in
connective $K$-theory, which seems new, and a duality result in this case.
Other applications, including some related to the computation of Bott-Samelson
classes in elliptic cohomology, are also discussed.

problem, has generated a great deal of technical machinery which is
unfortunately regarded as inaccessible by outsiders. Some of its tools (e.g.,
flat norm distance and decomposition in generalized surface space) hold
interest from a theoretical perspective but computational infeasibility
prevented practical use. Others, like nonasymptotic densities as shape
signatures, have been developed independently for data analysis (e.g., the
integral area invariant).
  The flat norm measures distance between currents (generalized surfaces) by
decomposing them in a way that is robust to noise. The simplicial deformation
theorem shows currents can be approximated on a simplicial complex,
generalizing the classical cubical deformation theorem and proving sharper
bounds than Sullivan's convex cellular deformation theorem.
  Computationally, the discretized flat norm can be expressed as a linear
programming problem and solved in polynomial time. Furthermore, the solution is
guaranteed to be integral for integral input if the complex satisfies a simple
topological condition (absence of relative torsion). This discretized
integrality result yields a similar statement for the continuous case: the flat
norm decomposition of an integral 1-current in the plane can be taken to be
integral, something previously unknown for 1-currents which are not boundaries
of 2-currents.
  Nonasymptotic densities (integral area invariants) taken along the boundary
of a shape are often enough to reconstruct the shape. This result is easy when
the densities are known for arbitrarily small radii but that is not generally
possible in practice. When only a single radius is used, variations on
reconstruction results (modulo translation and rotation) of polygons and (a
dense set of) smooth curves are presented.

whether a linear-constraint loop with a precondition, specifically with

these decision problems is yet unknown. The EXPSPACE lower bound is derived
from the reachability problem for Petri nets (equivalently, Vector Addition

problems in VAS theory). The lower bound for the rationals follows from a novel
simulation of Boolean programs. Lower bounds are also given for the problem of

and any model checking algorithm for the modal mu-calculus, suitably

mu-calculus model checking algorithm: fixpoint iteration. This is also one of
the few algorithms, if not the only one, that were not originally devised for
parity game solving already. While an empirical study quickly shows that this
does not yield an algorithm that works well in practice, it is interesting from
a theoretical point for two reasons: first, it is exponential on virtually all
families of games that were designed as lower bounds for very particular
algorithms suggesting that fixpoint iteration is connected to all those.
Second, fixpoint iteration does not compute positional winning strategies. Note
that the Walukiewicz formulas only define winning regions; some additional work
is needed in order to make this algorithm compute winning strategies. We show
that these are particular exponential-space strategies which we call
eventually-positional, and we show how positional ones can be extracted from

BOSS spectrograph. The RM quasar sample is flux-limited to i_psf=21.7 mag, and
covers a redshift range of 0.1<z<4.5. Optical spectroscopy was performed during
2014 Jan-Jul dark/grey time, with an average cadence of ~4 days, totaling more
than 30 epochs. Supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands was
conducted at multiple facilities including the CFHT and the Steward Observatory
Bok telescopes in 2014, with a cadence of ~2 days and covering all lunar
phases. The RM field (RA, DEC=14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the CFHT-LS
W3 field, and coincides with the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) Medium Deep Field MD07,
with three prior years of multi-band PS1 light curves. The SDSS-RM 6-month
baseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum and
broad line region (BLR) variability on timescales of up to several months (in
the observed frame) for ~10% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline for
continued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and at
higher redshift. SDSS-RM is the first major program to systematically explore
the potential of RM for broad-line quasars at z>0.3, and will investigate the
prospects of RM with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy.
SDSS-RM will provide guidance on future multi-object RM campaigns on larger

of 22 nearby infrared galaxies over a wide infrared luminosity range (10 <

band of the AKARI IRC spectroscopy enables us to access both the 3.3 um
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature from star forming
activity and the continuum of torus-dust emission heated by an active galactic
nucleus (AGN). Applying our AGN diagnostics to the AKARI spectra, we discover
14 buried AGNs. The large fraction of buried AGNs suggests that AGN activity
behind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies
(U/LIRGs). We also find that both the fraction and energy contribution of
buried AGNs increase with infrared luminosity from 10 < log(L_IR / Lsun) < 13,
including normal infrared galaxies with log (L_IR / Lsun) < 11. The energy
contribution from AGNs in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in LIRGs
and ~20% in ULIRGs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity
originates from starburst activity. Using the PAH emission, we investigate the
luminosity relation between star formation and AGN. We find that these infrared
galaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected Seyfert
galaxies with the same AGN luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies could
be an early evolutionary phase of AGN.

straightforwardly generalized to other theories that violate the Lorentz

same role as a Killing vector field. As an application, we study static charged
($D+1$)-dimensional spacetimes in the framework of the healthy
(non-projectable) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity in the infrared limit, and find
various solutions. Some of them represent Lifshitz space-times with
hyperscaling violations, and some have black hole structures. In the latter
universal horizons always exist inside the Killing horizons. The surface
gravity on them can be either larger or smaller than the surface gravity on the
Killing horizons, depending on the space-times considered. Although such black
holes are found only in the infrared, we argue that black holes with universal
horizons also exist in the full theory of the HL gravity. A simple example is
the Schwarzschild solution written in the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates,
which is also a solution of the full theory of the HL gravity and has a
universal horizon located inside the Schwarzschild Killing horizon.

uncertainty in existing measurements stems from how 'red' and 'blue' galaxies
have been selected/defined. Accordingly, we model our data as two naturally
overlapping populations, each with their own mass function and colour-mass
relation, which enables us characterise the two populations without having to
specify a priori which galaxies are 'red' and 'blue'. Our results then provide
the means to derive objective operational definitions for the terms 'red' and
'blue', which are based on the phenomenology of the colour-mass diagrams.
  Informed by this descriptive modelling, we show that: 1.) after accounting
for dust, the stellar colours of 'blue' galaxies do not depend strongly on
mass; 2.) the tight, flat 'dead sequence' does not extend much below log M* ~
10.5; instead, 3.) the stellar colours of 'red' galaxies vary rather strongly
with mass, such that lower mass 'red' galaxies have bluer stellar populations;
4.) below log M* ~ 9.3, the 'red' population dissolves into obscurity, and it
becomes problematic to talk about two distinct populations; as a consequence,
5.) it is hard to meaningfully constrain the shape, including the possibility
of an upturn, of the 'red' galaxy mass function below log M* ~ 9. Points 1-4
provide meaningful targets for models of galaxy formation and evolution to aim

approximate bolometric light curve out to 4334 days by scaling the late time
V-band data by a constant factor where no bolometric light curve data is
available. Considering the five most relevant decay chains starting at 44Ti,
55Co, 56Ni, 57Ni, and 60Co, we perform a least squares fit to the constructed
composite bolometric light curve. For the nickel isotopes, we obtain best fit
values of M(56Ni) = (7.1 +- 0.3) x 10^{-2} Msun and M(57Ni) = (4.1 +- 1.8) x
10^{-3} Msun. Our best fit 44Ti mass is M(44Ti) = (0.55 +- 0.17) x 10^{-4}
Msun, which is in disagreement with the much higher (3.1 +- 0.8) x 10^{-4} Msun
recently derived from INTEGRAL observations. The associated uncertainties far
exceed the best fit values for 55Co and 60Co and, as a result, we only give
upper limits on the production masses of M(55Co) < 7.2 x 10^{-3} Msun and
M(60Co) < 1.7 x 10^{-4} Msun. Furthermore, we find that the leptonic channels
in the decay of 57Co (internal conversion and Auger electrons) are a
significant contribution and constitute up to 15.5% of the total luminosity.
Consideration of the kinetic energy of these electrons is essential in lowering
our best fit nickel isotope production ratio to [57Ni/56Ni]=2.5+-1.1, which is
still somewhat high but is in agreement with gamma-ray observations and model
predictions.

(C-RAN) is proposed recently to overcome the efficiency and flexibility
problems with the traditional RAN architecture by centralizing baseband
processing. However, there lacks a mathematical model to analyze the
statistical multiplexing gain from the pooling of virtual base stations (VBSs)
so that the expenditure on fronthaul networks can be justified. In this paper,
we address this problem by capturing the session-level dynamics of VBS pools
with a multi-dimensional Markov model. This model reflects the constraints
imposed by both radio resources and computational resources. To evaluate the
pooling gain, we derive a product-form solution for the stationary distribution
and give a recursive method to calculate the blocking probabilities. For
comparison, we also derive the limit of resource utilization ratio as the pool
size approaches infinity. Numerical results show that VBS pools can obtain
considerable pooling gain readily at medium size, but the convergence to large
pool limit is slow because of the quickly diminishing marginal pooling gain. We
also find that parameters such as traffic load and desired Quality of Service
(QoS) have significant influence on the performance of VBS pools.

as only one block into a digest of m bits, where 80 <= m <= 232 and 80 <= m <=

Moreover, a detailed proof that the new hash function is resistant to the

a door to convenience for utilization of lightweight digital signing schemes.

the inversion symmetry is absent. This valley polarization effect results from
the fact that in the absence of inversion, charge carriers in different band
valleys could be selectively excited by different circular polarized light.
Such restriction to non-centrosymmetric systems poses a limitation on the
material selection for achieving CP. Although several experiments observed CP
in centrosymmetric MX2 systems e.g., for bilayer in MX2, they were dismissed as
being due to some extrinsic sample irregularities. Here we show that also for n

strictly absent, such intrinsic selectivity in CP is to be expected on the
basis of fundamental spin-orbit physics. First-principles calculations of CP
predict significant polarization for n = 2 bilayers: from 69% in MoS2 to 93% in

range of materials that might be considered for spin-polarization spintronic
applications to include the hitherto forbidden spintronic compound that belong

from such general, material-agnostic condensed matter theory arguments to
material-specific design principles that could aid future laboratory search of
R-2 materials. Specifically, we (i) classify different prototype layered
structures that have been broadly studied in the literature in terms of their
expected R-2 behavior, including the Bi2Se3-structure type (a prototype
topological insulator), MoS2-structure type (a prototype valleytronic compound)
and LaBiOS2-structure type (a host of superconductivity upon doping); (ii)
formulate the properties that ideal R-2 compounds should have in terms of
combination of their global unit cell symmetries with specific point group
symmetries of their constituent sectors; (iii) use first-principles band theory
to search for compounds from the prototype family of LaOBiS2-type structures
that satisfy these R-2 design metrics. We initially consider both stable and
hypothetical compounds to establish an understanding of trends of R-2 with

entropy of spacetime horizons has a larger significance as the leading
contribution to the entanglement entropy of general spacetime regions, in the
underlying quantum theory [2]. This `spacetime entanglement conjecture' has a
holographic realization that equates the entropy formula evaluated on an
arbitrary space-like co-dimension two surface with the differential entropy of
a particular family of co-dimension two regions on the boundary. The
differential entropy can be thought of as a directional derivative of
entanglement entropy along a family of surfaces. This holographic relation was
first studied in [3] and extended in [4], and it has been proven to hold in
Einstein gravity for bulk surfaces with planar symmetry (as well as for certain
higher curvature theories) in [4]. In this essay, we review this proof and
provide explicit examples of how to build the appropriate family of boundary
intervals for a given bulk curve. Conversely, given a family of boundary
intervals, we provide a method for constructing the corresponding bulk curve in
terms of intersections of entanglement wedge boundaries. We work mainly in
three dimensions, and comment on how the constructions extend to higher

strength is studied, in which the strength in the continuum is properly treated
without discretizing unbound particle spectra. The model is the sef-consistent
Hartree-Fock calculation and the RPA Green's function method with Skyrme

$^{68}_{28}$Ni$_{40}$, in which an experimental observation of low-lying
socalled ""pigmy resonance"" with an appreciable amount of monopole strength at
12.9 $\pm$ 1.0 MeV was recently reported. In the present study it is concluded
that sharp monopole peaks with the width of the order of 1 MeV can hardly be
expected for $^{68}$Ni in that energy region. Instead, a broad shoulder of
monopole strength consisting of neutron excitations to non-resonant
one-particle states (called ""threshold strength"") with relatively low
angular-momenta $(\ell, j)$ is obtained in the continuum energy region above
the particle threshold, which is considerably lower than that of isoscalar
giant monopole resonance. In the case of monopole excitations of $^{68}$Ni
there are no unperturbed particle-hole states below 20 MeV, in which the
particle expresses a neutron (or proton) resonant state. It is emphasized that
in the theoretical estimate a proper treatment of the continuum is extremely
important.

a potential breakthrough in capacity gains can be achieved by deploying a very
large number of antennas at the basestation. In order to achieve the
performance that massive MIMO systems promise, accurate transmit-side channel
state information (CSI) should be available at the basestation. While
transmit-side CSI can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time
division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user
terminal to the basestation is needed for frequency division duplexing (FDD)

technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed
antenna group beamforming (AGB), maps multiple correlated antenna elements to a
single representative value using pre-designed patterns. The proposed method
modifies the feedback packet by introducing the concept of a header to select a
suitable group pattern and a payload to quantize the reduced dimension channel
vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant
feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach performing the vector
quantization of whole channel vector under the same target sum rate

of small cells in order to deliver high data rate per unit area. Traffic
variations are more pronounced in a small cell, which in turn lead to more
dynamic interference to other cells. It is crucial to adapt radio resource
management to traffic conditions in such a heterogeneous network (HetNet). This
paper studies the optimization of spectrum allocation in HetNets on a
relatively slow timescale based on average traffic and channel conditions
(typically over seconds or minutes). Specifically, in a cluster with $n$ base
transceiver stations (BTSs), the optimal partition of the spectrum into $2^n$
segments is determined, corresponding to all possible spectrum reuse patterns
in the downlink. Each BTS's traffic is modeled using a queue with Poisson
arrivals, the service rate of which is a linear function of the combined
bandwidth of all assigned spectrum segments. With the system average packet
sojourn time as the objective, a convex optimization problem is first
formulated, where it is shown that the optimal allocation divides the spectrum
into at most $n$ segments. A second, refined model is then proposed to address
queue interactions due to interference, where the corresponding optimal
allocation problem admits an efficient suboptimal solution. Both allocation
schemes attain the entire throughput region of a given network. Simulation
results show the two schemes perform similarly in the heavy-traffic regime, in
which case they significantly outperform both the orthogonal allocation and the
full-frequency-reuse allocation. The refined allocation shows the best
performance under all traffic conditions.

this paper, we investigate keys to the success of projects on SCSs based on
large data consisting of more than three hundred thousand projects. We focus on
the following three perspectives: 1) the team structure, 2) social activity
with external developers, and 3) content developed by the project. To evaluate
the success quantitatively, we define activity, popularity and sociality as
success indexes. A summary of the findings we obtained by using the techniques
of correlation analysis, social network analysis and topic extraction is as
follows: the number of project members and the connectivity between the members
are positively correlated with success indexes. Second, projects that
faithfully tackle change requests from external developers are more likely to
be successful. Third, the success indexes differ between topics of softwares
developed by projects. Our analysis suggests how to be successful in various

spreading influence of complex network is one of the most promising domains. So
far, various topology-based centrality measures have been proposed to identify
the node spreading influence in a network. However, the node spreading
influence is a result of the interplay between the network topology structure
and spreading dynamics. In this paper, we build up the systematic method by
combining the network structure and spreading dynamics to identify the node
spreading influence. By combining the adjacent matrix $A$ and spreading
parameter $\beta$, we theoretical give the node spreading influence with the
eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Comparing with the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model epidemic results for four real
networks, our method could identify the node spreading influence more
accurately than the ones generated by the degree, K-shell and eigenvector
centrality. This work may provide a systematic method for identifying node
spreading influence.

accurate method in molecular dynamics simulation to determine the drift
velocity of a particle driven by a weak external force in a one-dimensional
periodic potential. With the calculated drift velocity, we found that the
mobility and diffusion of the particle obey the Einstein relation, whereas
their temperature dependences deviate from the Arrhenius law. A microscopic
hopping mechanism was proposed to explain the non-Arrhenius behavior. Moreover,
the position distribution of the particle in the potential well was found to
deviate from the Boltzmann equation in a non-equilibrium steady state. The
non-Boltzmann behavior may be attributed to the thermostat which introduces and
effective ""viscous"" drag opposite to the drift direction of the particle.

of cancer subpopulations, which promotes drug resistance and relapse. Even
though substantial heterogeneity is witnessed in most cancer types, mutation
accumulation patterns can be regularly found and can be exploited to
reconstruct predictive models of cancer evolution. Yet, available methods
cannot infer logical formulas connecting events to represent alternative
evolutionary routes or convergent evolution. Results: We introduce PMCE, an
expressive framework that leverages mutational profiles from cross-sectional
sequencing data to infer probabilistic graphical models of cancer evolution
including arbitrary logical formulas, and which outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise, on simulations.
The application of PMCE to 7866 samples from the TCGA database allows us to
identify a highly significant correlation between the predicted evolutionary
paths and the overall survival in 7 tumor types, proving that our approach can
effectively stratify cancer patients in reliable risk groups. Availability:

transitions in cancer development are increasingly well understood, we lack
quantitative theory for how chemoprevention is predicted to affect survival. We
employ master equations and probability generating functions, the latter well
known in statistical physics, to derive the dynamics of tumor growth as a
mean-field approximation. We also study numerically the associated stochastic
birth-death process. Our findings predict exponential tumor growth when a
cancer is in its early stages of development and hyper-exponential growth
thereafter. Numerical simulations are in general agreement with our analytical
approach. We evaluate how constant, low impact treatments affect both
neoplastic growth and the frequency of chemoresistant clones. We show that
therapeutic outcomes are highly predictable for treatments starting either
sufficiently early or late in terms of initial tumor size and the initial
number of chemoresistant cells, whereas stochastic dynamics dominate therapies
starting at intermediate neoplasm sizes, with high outcome sensitivity both in
terms of tumor control and the emergence of resistant subclones. The outcome of
chemoprevention can be understood in terms of both minimal physiological
impacts resulting in long-term control and either preventing or slowing the
emergence of resistant subclones. We argue that our model and results can also

exponential friction-versus-load behavior for all sliding directions. Since our
approach does not impose any limits on lengths and directions of the sliding
paths, we investigate arbitrary sliding directions for an fcc Cu(111) interface
and detect two periodic paths which form the upper and lower bound of
nanofriction. For long aperiodic paths the friction force convergences to a
value in between these limits. For low loads we retrieve the Derjaguin
generalization of Amontons-Coulomb kinetic friction law which appears to be
valid all the way down to the nanoscale. We observe a non-vanishing

triangle of an initial vacancy having six unpaired electrons had distorted to
isosceles triangle by the Jahn-Teller effect. Among capable spin-state of
Sz=6/2, 4/2 and 2/2, the most stable one was Sz=2/2. Total energy was 15.6
kcal/mol lower (stable) than that of the initial one and a sum of spin density
(magnetic moment) around one vacancy was 1.49 {\mu}B. Amazing result was
obtained in case of Sz=4/2. Initial flat ribbon turned to three dimensionally
curled one. There appears ferromagnetic spin distribution on GNR. Total energy
was -15.5kcal/mol, which was very close to that of Sz=2/2. Such calculation
suggested the coexistence of flat ribbon and curled ribbon by generating
vacancies. Bi-layered AB stacked GNR was analyzed in case of {\alpha}-site
vacancy and also \b{eta}-site one. The most stable spin state was Sz=2/2 in
both cases. These distorted vacancy triangle show 60 degree clockwise rotation
from beta- to alpha-site, which is consistent with several experimental

investment target. Due to the time inconsistency of the resulting multi-period
mean-variance model with an adaptive risk aversion, we investigate in this
paper the time consistent behavior portfolio policy by solving a nested
mean-variance game formulation. We derive semi-analytical time consistent
behavior portfolio policy which takes a piecewise linear feedback form of the
current wealth level with respect to the discounted investment target.

  Physics",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the recent measurement of reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ the
knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters that describe PMNS matrix has
improved significantly except the CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$. The other
unknown parameters in neutrino oscillation studies are mass hierarchy and the
octant of the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. Many dedicated
experiments are proposed to determine these parameters which may take at least
10 years from now to become operational. It is therefore very crucial to use
the results from the existing experiments to see whether we can get even
partial answers to these questions. In this paper we study the discovery
potential of the ongoing NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments as well as the
forthcoming T2HK experiment in addressing these questions. In particular, we
evaluate the sensitivity of NO$\nu$A to determine neutrino mass hierarchy,
octant degeneracy and to obtain CP violation phase after running for its
scheduled period of 3 years in neutrino mode and 3 years in anti-neutrino mode.
We then extend the analysis to understand the discovery potential if the
experiments will run for (5$\nu$+5$\bar{\nu}$) years and (7$\nu$+3$\bar{\nu}$)
years. We also show how the sensitivity improves when we combine the data from
(3$\nu$+3$\bar{\nu}$) years of NO$\nu$A run with (3$\nu$+2$\bar{\nu}$) years of
T2K and (3$\nu$+7$\bar{\nu}$) years of T2HK experiments. The CP violation
sensitivity is marginal for T2K and NO$\nu$A experiments even for ten years
data taking of NO$\nu$A. T2HK has a significance above 5$\sigma$ for a fraction
of two-fifth values of the $\delta_{CP}$ space. We also find that $\delta_{CP}$
can be determined to be better than $35^\circ $, $21^\circ $ and $9^\circ $ for
all values of $\delta_{CP}$ for T2K, NO$\nu$A and T2HK respectively.

including tunability, dynamic multistability, and negative magnetic

dipole-dipole forces that makes it possible for counter-intuitive dynamic
states referred to as chimera states to appear; the latter feature clusters of
SQUIDs with synchronous dynamics which coexist with clusters exhibiting
asynchronous behavior. The spontaneous appearance of chimera states is
demonstrated numerically for one-dimensional SQUID metamaterials driven by an
alternating magnetic field in which the fluxes threading the SQUID rings are
randomly initialized; then, chimera states appear generically for sufficiently
strong initial excitations, which exhibit relatively long lifetimes. The
synchronization and metastability levels of the chimera states are discussed in
terms of appropriate measures. Given that both one- and two-dimensional SQUID
metamaterials have been already fabricated and investigated in the laboratory,
the presence of a chimera state could in principle be detected with presently
available experimental setups.

weighted networks that makes use of surrogate networks with preserved edge
weights or vertex strengths. We first investigate whether characteristics of
weighted networks are influenced by trivial properties of the edge weights or
vertex strengths (e.g., their standard deviations). If so, these influences are
then effectively segregated with an appropriate surrogate normalization of the
respective network characteristic. We demonstrate this approach by
re-examining, in a time-resolved manner, weighted functional brain networks of
epilepsy patients and control subjects derived from simultaneous EEG/MEG
recordings during different behavioral states. We show that this
surrogate-assisted analysis approach reveals complementary information about
these networks, can aid with their interpretation, and thus can prevent

introduction of appropriate particle invariants and the use of Liouville`s
theorem one can get explicit solutions for the resulting total downstream
pressure adding up from partial pressure contributions of solar wind protons,
solar wind electrons and pick-up protons. These expressions deliver in a first
step the main contributions to the total plasma pressure in the downstream
plasma flow and consistently determine the shock compression ratio. Here now we
start out from these individual fluid pressures downstream of the shock and
thereafter evaluate for the first time the shock-induced entropy production of
the different fluids, when they are passing over the shock to the downstream
side. As is shown here, the resulting ion entropy production substantially
deviates from earlier calculations using a pseudo-polytropic reaction of the
ions to the shock compression, with polytropies selected to describe
fluid-specific reactions at the shock passage similar to those seen by the
VOYAGERs. From these latter models ion entropy jumps are derived that depend on
the pick-up ion abundance, while our calculations, to the opposite, deliver an
abundance-independent ion entropy production which only depends on the shock
compression ratio and the tilt angle between the upstream magnetic field and
the shock surface normal. We also do show here that only when including the
strongly heated electrons into the entropy balance one then arrives at the
total entropy production that just fulfills the thermodynamically permitted
limit.

and Saturn) with massive gas envelopes and 'ice giants' (Uranus and Neptune)
with much thinner envelopes around their cores. It is poorly understood how
these two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to
form the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs,
heat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless
accretion is halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles (~ cm-sized
particles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap
in the pebble disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the
rapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. As opposed to gas giants,
ice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass
envelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles.
This offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giants
and ice giants in the Solar System. Furthermore, as opposed to
planetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation and
envelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids in
protoplanetary discs are predominantly in pebbles. Our results imply that the
outer regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebble
accretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanets
in wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.

planets to accrete their gaseous envelopes before the dissipation of the
protoplanetary gas disc (<3 Myr). In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation
of planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be
accreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be
efficient, and resonant trapping poses a further hurdle. Here we instead
investigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural
outcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We
construct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in
the outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of
the solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key
quantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We
find that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the
inside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall
efficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50 %
for planetary architectures similar to the Solar System. Growth by pebble
accretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic Type
I migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large
radial extent (~100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our
findings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected
around low-mass stars (<1 M_sun), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not
easily form gas-giant planets (M > 100 M_E), but preferentially form
Neptune-mass planets or smaller (< 10 M_E). This is consistent with exoplanet
surveys which show that gas giants are relatively uncommon around stars of low
mass or low metallicity.

of a very strong excess over the power-law X-ray continuum at $E\sim6$ keV
($EW\simeq 800$ eV), extending down to $\sim 4.5$ keV, and found that the X-ray
spectrum of the source can be explained by two different models. i) An
absorption scenario, in which the X-ray source is obscured by two
fully-covering ionized absorbers, with a strong reflection component from
neutral material ($R\sim 1.7$), a black body component and four narrow Gaussian
lines (corresponding to Fe K$\alpha$, Fe K$\beta$, Fe xxv and Fe xxvi). ii) A
reflection scenario, in which the X-ray spectrum is dominated by an obscured
($\log N_{\rm\,H}\sim 22.9$) blurred reflection produced in an ionized disk
around a rotating supermassive black hole with a spin of $a \geq 0.73$, and
affected by light-bending ($R\sim 2.7$), plus two narrow Gaussian lines
(corresponding to Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$). The narrow Fe K$\alpha$ and
K$\beta$ lines are consistent with being produced by ionized iron, and in
particular by Fe xiv-Fe xvi and Fe xii-Fe xvi for the absorption and reflection
scenario, respectively. While the X-ray continuum varies significantly during
the observation, the intensity of the broad feature appears to be constant, in
agreement with both the absorption and reflection scenarios. For both scenarios
we obtained a steep power-law emission ($\Gamma\sim 2.2-2.3$), and we speculate
that the source might be an obscured narrow-line Seyfert 1.

for actions of finite groups and the integers, as introduced by Hirshberg,
Winter and the third author. If the group has a box space of finite asymptotic
dimension, then actions with finite Rokhlin dimension preserve the property of
having finite nuclear dimension, when passing to the crossed product
C*-algebra. A detailed study of the asymptotic dimension of box spaces shows
that finitely generated, virtually nilpotent groups have box spaces with finite
asymptotic dimension, providing a reasonably large class of examples. We then
establish a relation between Rokhlin dimension of residually finite groups
acting on compact metric spaces and amenability dimension of the action in the
sense of Guentner, Willett and Yu. We show that for free actions of infinite,
finitely generated, nilpotent groups on finite dimensional spaces, both these
dimensional values are finite. In particular, the associated transformation
group C*-algebras have finite nuclear dimension. This extends an analogous
result about $\mathbb{Z}^m$-actions by the first author. We also provide some
results concerning the genericity of finite Rokhlin dimension, and permanence
properties with respect to the absorption of a strongly self-absorbing

precision at the cm/s level. A low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) can
provide a wavelength comb with a very large bandwidth as required for
astronomical experiments, but unavoidable spectral drifts are difficult to
control. Instead of actively controlling the FPI cavity, we propose to
passively stabilize the interferometer and track the time-dependent cavity
length drift externally. A dual-finesse cavity allows drift tracking during
observation. The drift of the cavity length is monitored in the high-finesse
range relative to an external standard: a single narrow transmission peak is
locked to an external cavity diode laser and compared to an atomic frequency.
Following standard locking schemes, tracking at sub-mm/s precision can be
achieved. This is several orders of magnitude better than currently planned
high-precision Doppler experiments. It allows freedom for relaxed designs
rendering this approach particularly interesting for upcoming Doppler
experiments. We also show that the large number of interference modes used in
an FPI allows us to unambiguously identify the interference mode of each FPI
transmission peak defining its absolute wavelength solution. The accuracy
reached in each resonance with the laser concept is then defined by the cavity
length that is determined from the one locked peak and by the group velocity
dispersion. The latter can vary by several 100m/s over the relevant frequency
range and severely limits the accuracy of individual peak locations. A
potential way to determine the absolute peak positions is to externally measure
the frequency of each individual peak with a laser frequency comb (LFC). Thus,
the concept of laser-locked FPIs may be useful for applying the absolute

of the Schwinger-Keldysh technique for quantum expectation values is presented
as a special rule of obtaining the nonlocal effective equations of motion for
the mean quantum field from the Euclidean effective action. This rule is
applied to a new model of ghost free nonlocal cosmology which can generate the
de Sitter stage of cosmological evolution at an arbitrary value of $\varLambda$
-- a model of dark energy with its scale played by the dynamical variable that
can be fixed by a kind of a scaling symmetry breaking mechanism. This model is
shown to interpolate between the superhorizon phase of gravity theory mediated
by a scalar mode and the short distance general relativistic limit in a special
frame which is related by a nonlocal conformal transformation to the original
metric. The role of compactness and regularity of spacetime in the Euclidean

take advantage of the catalytic properties of platinum metals to completely
remove the polymer capping after the transfer of macroscopic graphene sheets to
a solid-state device. For that purpose a platinum metal coated structure is
brought in close proximity with the polymer capping. Subsequent annealing in
air at a temperature between 175 and 350{\deg}C actuates a complete catalytic
removal of the polymer. Finally, the platinum metal catalyst is removed
revealing ultra clean graphene interfaced with an arbitrary device. Experiments
to interface macroscopic graphene layers with oxidized silicon wafers
demonstrate the general applicability of this approach. In repeating the
procedure, multi-layer graphene sheets can also be produced. Direct evidence
for the latter is provided by optical images of three overlapping graphene
sheets. The exceeding level of cleanliness of the graphene is examined on the

dissipation, we avoid the divergence of the energy on the long time scale,
which affects the original model. In particular, we define new jump operators,
which depend on the momentum of the system and lead to an exponential
relaxation of the energy to a finite value. The finite asymptotic energy is
naturally associated to a collapse noise with a finite temperature, which is a
basic realistic feature of our extended model. Remarkably, even in the presence
of a low temperature noise, the collapse model is effective. The action of the
new jump operators still localizes the wavefunction and the relevance of the
localization increases with the size of the system, according to the so-called
amplification mechanism, which guarantees a unified description of the
evolution of microscopic and macroscopic systems. We study in detail the
features of our model, both at the level of the trajectories in the Hilbert
space and at the level of the master equation for the average state of the

  The thesis describes an agent-based model aimed to simulate those processes
in which a digital object faces the risk of obsolescence, a migration process
has to be performed and the most appropriate file format has to be adopted.
Agents have been designed in order to monitor and control the local system
where they reside and its environment. They are able to become aware of
obsolescent formats based on global parameters such as their diffusion. They
communicate as well with each other to find out the most suitable preservation
action to be performed. Agents request suggestions that are evaluated and
propagated according to a weighting based on the level of trust assigned to
both the agents who identified the problem and proposed the solution. In the
current research, the definition of the trust level has been chosen based on
the cultural and geographical distances, the expertise of the involved agents
and the file format numerosity. The level of trust between two agents is
automatically updated after every interaction by the mean of a feedback
mechanism profiting of an inter agent communication based on stigmergy. Summing
up, the thesis demonstrates how a multi-agent system can either perform an
autonomous preservation action or suggest a list of best candidate solutions to
the user. It benefits the management of several kinds of digital archive,
especially those with limited resources specifically dedicated to digital
preservation, such as small personal collections and many public institutions.

randomly transports the hot air mass that can pre-heat and then ignite the area
ahead the fire. This contributes to give a random character to the firefront
position together with other phenomena as for example fire spotting, vegetation
distribution (patchiness), gaseous combustion fluctuation, small-scale terrain
elevation changes. Here only turbulence is considered. The level-set method is
used to numerically describe the evolution of the fireline contour that is
assumed to have a random motion because of turbulence. The progression of the
combustion process is then described by a level-set contour distributed
according to a weight function given by the probability density function of the
air particles in turbulent motion. From the comparison between the ordinary and
the randomized level-set methods, it emerges that the proposed modelling
approach turns out to be suitable to simulate a moving firefront fed by the
ground fuel and driven, beside the meteorological and orographical factors,
also by the turbulent diffusion of the hot air. This approach allows the
simulation of the fire overcoming of a firebreak zone. The discussed results
are explorative and need to be subjected to a future validation.

retinal axons to their terminal sites in vertebrate optic tectum or superior
colliculus to form an ordered map of connections. The details of mechanisms
involved, and the degree to which they might interact, are still not well
understood. We have developed a framework within which existing computational
models can be assessed in an unbiased and quantitative manner against a set of
experimental data curated from the mouse retinocollicular system. Our framework
facilitates comparison between models, testing new models against known
phenotypes and simulating new phenotypes in existing models. We have used this
framework to assess four representative models that combine Eph/ephrin
gradients and/or activity-based mechanisms and competition. Two of the models
were updated from their original form to fit into our framework. The models
were tested against five different phenotypes: wild type, Isl2-EphA3 ki/ki,
Isl2-EphA3 ki/+, ephrin-A2,A3,A5 triple knock-out and Math-/- (Atoh7). Only one
model could account for the collapse point in Isl2-EphA3 ki/+, and two models
successfully reproduced the extent of the Math5-/- anteromedial projection. The
models needed a weak anteroposterior gradient in the superior colliculus in
order to reproduce the residual order in the ephrin-A2,A3,A5 triple knock-out
phenotype, suggesting either an incomplete knock-out or the presence of another

a leading rapid turbulent burst followed by a trailing slow laminar decay from

discovered that activated Ras promotes further Ras activation. Here we show
using particle-based simulation that this positive feedback is sufficient to
produce persistent clusters of active Ras molecules at the nanometer scale via
a dynamic nucleation mechanism. Furthermore, we find that our cluster
statistics are consistent with experimental observations of the Ras system.
Interestingly, we show that our model does not support a Turing regime of
macroscopic reaction-diffusion patterning, and therefore that the clustering we
observe is a purely stochastic effect, arising from the coupling of positive
feedback with the discrete nature of individual molecules. These results
underscore the importance of stochastic and dynamic properties of reaction

in such a way that for each vertex $v \in V$ the number of arcs entering $v$ is

This problem was introduced by Gabow [SODA'06], who proved it to be MAXSNP-hard

rounding $4/3$-approximation algorithm.
  Since the problem in question is a special case of the classic 3-Dimensional

reasonable to ask whether recent improvements in approximation algorithms for
the latter two problems [Cygan, FOCS'13; Sviridenko & Ward, ICALP'13] allow for
an improved approximation for Upper Degree-Constrained Partial Orientation. We

combination of two types of rules: improving sets of bounded pathwidth from the

are initially made for a nucleus by applying each of these relations. Very
reliable estimates are then produced either by an average or by choosing the
extrapolation where the smoothest structures enter. Corresponding mass
relations for $Q_{\alpha}$ values are used to study the general structure of
super-heavy elements. A minor neutron shell at $N = 152$ is seen, but no sign
of other shell structures are apparent in the super-heavy region. Accuracies
are typically substantially better than $0.5$~MeV.

magnetic flows. Our aim is to determine the origin of such flows by using
realistic MHD simulations. We simulate cancellation and emergence of magnetic
flux through the solar photosphere. Our first numerical experiment starts with
magnetic field of both polarities. To simulate emergence into a region with
pre-existing field, we introduce a large-scale horizontally uniform sheet of
horizontal field. We follow the subsequent evolution, creating synthetic
polarimetric observations, including known instrumental effects of the
Sunrise/IMaX and Hinode/SP instruments. We compare the simulated and observed
spectropolarimetric signals. Strongly blue- and redshifted Stokes V signals are
produced in locations where strong line-of-sight velocities coincide with the
strong line-of-sight component of magnetic field. The size and strength of
simulated events is smaller than observed and they are mostly associated with
downflows, contrary to observations. In a few cases where they appear above a
granule, single blue lobed Stokes V are produced due to strong gradients in
magnetic field and velocity. No change of magnetic field sign is detected along
the line of sight in these instances. More high-speed magnetized flows occur in
the case where emergence is simulated than in the case where no horizontal
field was added. The simulations indicate that the observed events result from
magnetic flux emergence, where reconnection may take place but does not seem to
be necessary.

within many-body perturbation theory with positive spectral properties. The
method cures the problem of negative spectral functions which arises from a
straightforward inclusion of vertex diagrams beyond the GW approximation. Our
approach consists of a two-steps procedure: we first express the approximate
many-body self-energy as a product of half-diagrams and then identify the
minimal number of half-diagrams to add in order to form a perfect square. The
resulting self-energy is an unconventional sum of self-energy diagrams in which
the internal lines of half a diagram are time-ordered Green's functions whereas
those of the other half are anti-time-ordered Green's functions, and the lines
joining the two halves are either lesser or greater Green's functions. The
theory is developed using noninteracting Green's functions and subsequently
extended to self-consistent Green's functions. Issues related to the conserving
properties of diagrammatic approximations with positive spectral functions are
also addressed. As a major application of the formalism we derive the minimal
set of additional diagrams to make positive the spectral function of the GW
approximation with lowest-order vertex corrections and screened interactions.
The method is then applied to vertex corrections in the three-dimensional
homogeneous electron gas by using a combination of analytical frequency
integrations and numerical Monte-Carlo momentum integrations to evaluate the
diagrams.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are connected with broad-lines supernovae Ib/c,
(SNe-Ibc). The presence of GRB-SNe is revealed by rebrightenings emerging from
the optical GRB afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of the source,
after the prompt GRB emission. Aims: \textit{Fermi}-GBM has a field of view
(FoV) which is about 6.5 times larger than the FoV of \textit{Swift}, therefore
we expect that a number of GRB-SN connections have been missed due to lack of
optical and X-ray instruments on board of \textit{Fermi}, which are essential
to reveal SNe associated with GRBs. This fact has motivated our search in the
\textit{Fermi} catalogue for possible GRB-SN events. Methods: The search for
possible GRB-SN associations follows two requirements: (1) SN should fall
inside the \textit{Fermi}-GBM error box of the considered long GRB, and (2)
this GRB should occur within $20$ days before the SN event. Results: We have
found $5$ cases, within $z<0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements. One
of them, GRB 130702A-SN 2013dx, was already known as GRB-SN association. We
have analyzed the remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are,
very likely, just random coincidences, due to the \textit{Fermi}-GBM large
error box associated with each GRB detection. We found one GRB possibly
associated with a SN 1998bw-like, GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba. Conclusions: The very
low redshift of GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropic
energy of this burst ($E_{iso} = 1.39 \times 10^{48}$) erg. We then compute the
rate of \textit{Fermi} low-luminosity GRBs connected with SNe to be $\rho_{0,b}
\leq 770\ $Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. We estimate that \textit{Fermi}-GBM could
detect $1$--$4$ GRBs-SNe within $z \leq 0.2$ in the next 4 years.

formation of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. The true
nature of the EoS has been a matter of debate at any density range not only in
the nuclear physics but also in the astronomy and astrophysics. We have
constructed a database of EoSs by compiling data from the literature. Our
database contains the basic properties of the nuclear EoS of symmetric nuclear
matter and of pure neutron matter. It also includes the detailed information
about the theoretical models, for example the adopted methods and assumptions
in individual models. The novelty of the database is to consider new
experimental probes such as the symmetry energy, its slope relative to the
baryon density, and the incompressibility, which enables the users to check
their model dependences. We demonstrate the performance of the EOSDB through
the examinations of the model dependence among different nuclear EoSs. It is
reveled that some theoretical EoSs, which is commonly used in astrophysics, do
not satisfactorily agree with the experimental constraints.

the Fermi surface consists of points (massless Dirac points) or even when the
chemical potential is in a energy gap by studying the tight-binding electrons
on a honeycomb lattice in a uniform magnetic field. The quantum oscillations of
the magnetization as a function of the inverse magnetic field are known as the
de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations and the frequency is proportional to the
area of the Fermi surface. The dominant period of the new oscillations
corresponds to the area of the first Brillouin zone and its phase is zero. The
origin of the new quantum oscillations is the characteristic magnetic field
dependence of the energy known as the Hofstadter butterfly and the Harper
broadening of Landau levels. The new oscillations are not caused by the
crossing of the chemical potential and Landau levels, which is the case in the
dHvA oscillations. The new oscillations can be observed experimentally in
systems with large supercell such as graphene antidot lattice or ultra cold
atoms in optical lattice at an external magnetic field of a few Tesla when the
area of the supercell is ten thousand times larger than that of graphene.

any specific matter field to drive inflation, but inflation stems from the
microscopic, Planck scale structure of spacetime, thus being of quantum
gravitational origin. At a certain temperature spacetime performs a phase
transition, where the cosmological constant drops from a huge, Planck scale
value, which is about $10^{87}s^{-2}$ to its present, pretty small value
$10^{-35}s^{-2}$. When the cosmological constant is large, the universe goes
through a period of very rapid expansion which, however, comes to an abrupt end
after the phase transition has been completed. Assuming that the cosmological
constant depends on the age of the universe in an appropriate manner during the
phase transition one may recover the predictions of the conventional
inflationary scenario.

elementary clay mineral platelets in dilute aqueous dispersion. This dilute

which are due to the nature of the amphiphilic cations and to the organization

Controlling the structure of materials at the nanometre scale is of fundamental
importance for tailoring such materials properties. Langmuir Blodgett films are

distortion metric on the data term, which is known to be robust for
non-Gaussian noise contamination. The proposed algorithm exploits the idea of
iterative minimization of weighted $\ell_2$ error. We refer to this algorithm
as $\ell_1$-K-SVD, where the dictionary atoms and the corresponding sparse
coefficients are simultaneously updated to minimize the $\ell_1$ objective,
resulting in noise-robustness. We demonstrate through experiments that the
$\ell_1$-K-SVD algorithm results in higher atom recovery rate compared with the
K-SVD and the robust dictionary learning (RDL) algorithm proposed by Lu et al.,
both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise conditions. We also show that, for
fixed values of sparsity, number of dictionary atoms, and data-dimension, the
$\ell_1$-K-SVD algorithm outperforms the K-SVD and RDL algorithms when the
training set available is small. We apply the proposed algorithm for denoising
natural images corrupted by additive Gaussian and Laplacian noise. The images
denoised using $\ell_1$-K-SVD are observed to have slightly higher peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over K-SVD for Laplacian noise, but the
improvement in structural similarity index (SSIM) is significant (approximately
$0.1$) for lower values of input PSNR, indicating the efficacy of the $\ell_1$
metric.
