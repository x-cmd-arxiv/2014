in a previous publication, a quantum gravity formulation exists on the basis of
abstract quantum number conservation, the laws of thermodynamics, unspecific
interactions, and locally maximising the ratio of resulting degrees of freedom
per imposed degree of freedom of the theory. The first law of thermodynamics
was evaluated by imposing boundary conditions on small volumes of optimised
dimension (3+1). As a consequence, no explicit microscopic quantum structure
was required in order to recover all well established physics as special cases
(Quantum Field Theory, QFT, and General Relativity, GR) and compute all
measurable quantities. This article presents the generalised action in terms of
tetrads and shows how this action may be related to the spin of generalised
matter fields, especially for fermionic matter.

a Polish space. In the Markovian case, the idea of Poincar\'e sections is

ergodic. Moreover, if the infinitesimal generator of the Markov semigroup only
has equally placed simple eigenvalues including $0$ on the imaginary axis, then
the periodic measure is PS-ergodic and has positive minimum period. Conversely
if the periodic measure with the positive minimum period is PS-mixing, then the
infinitesimal generator only has equally placed simple eigenvalues (infinitely
many) including $0$ on the imaginary axis. Moreover, under the spectral gap
condition, PS-mixing of the periodic measure is proved. The ``equivalence"" of

localized excitations that correspond to reversed dynamically precessing
magnetic moments, known as magnetic droplet solitons. Fundamentally, these
excitations are associated with an attractive interaction between elementary
spin-excitations (i.e., magnons) and were predicted to occur in PMA materials
in the absence of damping [1,2]. While damping, present in all magnetic
materials, suppresses these excitations, it is now possible to compensate
damping by spin transfer torques through electrical current flow in nanometer
scale contacts to ferromagnetic thin films [3,4]. A theory predicts the
appearance of magnetic droplet solitons at a threshold current in nanocontacts
[5] and, recently, experimental signatures of droplet nucleation have been
reported [6]. However, thus far, they have been observed to be nearly
reversible excitations, with only partially reversed magnetization and to be
subject to instabilities that cause them to drift away from the nanocontacts
(i.e., drift instabilities) [6]. Here we show that magnetic droplet solitons
can be stabilized in a spin transfer nanocontact. Further, they exhibit a
strong hysteretic response to fields and currents and a nearly fully reversed
magnetization in the contact. These observations, in addition to their
fundamental interest, open up new applications for magnetic droplet solitons as
multi-state high frequency current and field tunable oscillators.

to this hypothesis, collective vigilance allows prey in large groups to detect
predators more efficiently by making alarm signals or behavioral cues to each
other, thereby allowing individuals within the group to spend more time
foraging. Here, we find that collective vigilance is sufficient to select for
gregarious foraging behavior as long there is not a direct cost for grouping
(e.g., competition for limited food resources), even when controlling for
confounding factors such as the dilution effect. Further, we explore the role
of the genetic relatedness and reproductive strategy of the prey, and find that
highly related groups of prey with a semelparous reproductive strategy are the
most likely to evolve gregarious foraging behavior mediated by the benefit of
vigilance. These findings, combined with earlier studies with evolving digital
organisms, further sharpen our understanding of the factors favoring grouping
behavior.

greater communication between a prosthesis and its user. Towards this end, we
present a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a
robotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing
in the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict
impact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning
system's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in
their interactions with a workspace. We tested this system with five
able-bodied subjects. Each subject manipulated the robot arm while receiving
different forms of vibrotactile feedback regarding the arm's contact with its
workspace. Our trials showed that communicable predictions could be learned
quickly during human control of the robot arm. Using these predictions as a
basis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task
performance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our
study therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and
machine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an
artificial limb. We expect that a greater level of acceptance and ownership can
be achieved if the prosthesis itself takes an active role in transmitting
learned knowledge about its state and its situation of use.

We employ the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a distance and find the best
Gaussian approximation by minimizing this distance. It then follows that the
approximate Gaussian must be equivalent to the Gaussian reference measure,
defining a natural function space setting for the underlying calculus of

well-adapted to the required minimization, seeking to find the mean as a

rank perturbations of the reference covariance; and through Schr\""odinger
potential perturbations of the inverse reference covariance. Two applications
are shown: to a nonlinear inverse problem in elliptic PDEs, and to a
conditioned diffusion process. We also show how the Gaussian approximations we
obtain may be used to produce improved pCN-MCMC methods which are not only
well-adapted to the high-dimensional setting, but also behave well with respect
to small observational noise (resp. small temperatures) in the inverse problem

pathways that underlie synaptic plasticity. For example, Rubinstein-Taybi
syndrome (RTS) is due to a mutation in cbp, encoding the histone
acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP). CBP is a transcriptional
co-activator for CREB, and induction of CREB-dependent transcription plays a
key role in long-term memory (LTM). In animal models of RTS, mutations of cbp
impair LTM and late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP). To explore intervention
strategies to rescue the deficits in LTP, we extended a previous model of LTP
induction to describe histone acetylation and simulated LTP impairment due to
cbp mutation. Plausible drug effects were simulated by parameter changes, and
many increased LTP. However no parameter variation consistent with a
biochemical effect of a known drug fully restored LTP. Thus we examined paired
parameter variations. A pair that simulated the effects of a phosphodiesterase
inhibitor (slowing cAMP degradation) concurrent with a deacetylase inhibitor
(prolonging histone acetylation) restored LTP. Importantly these paired
parameter changes did not alter basal synaptic weight. A pair that simulated a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor and an acetyltransferase activator was similarly
effective. For both pairs strong additive synergism was present. These results
suggest that promoting histone acetylation while simultaneously slowing the
degradation of cAMP may constitute a promising strategy for restoring deficits
in LTP that may be associated with learning deficits in RTS. More generally
these results illustrate the strategy of combining modeling and empirical
studies may help design effective therapies for improving long-term synaptic

combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06

waveguide. The goal is to estimate the source of waves from measurements of the
acoustic pressure at a remote array of sensors. The waveguide effect is due to
boundaries that trap the waves and guide them in a preferred (range) direction,
the waveguide axis, along which the medium is unbounded. The random waveguide
is a model of perturbed ideal waveguides which have flat boundaries and are
filled with known media that do not change with range. The perturbation
consists of fluctuations of the boundary and of the wave speed due to numerous
small inhomogeneities in the medium. The fluctuations are uncertain in
applications, which is why we model them with random processes, and they cause
significant cumulative scattering at long ranges from the source. The
scattering effect manifests mathematically as an exponential decay of the
expectation of the acoustic pressure, the coherent part of the wave. The
incoherent wave is modeled by the random fluctuations of the acoustic pressure,
which dominate the expectation at long ranges from the source. We use the
existing theory of wave propagation in random waveguides to analyze the inverse
problem of estimating the source from incoherent wave recordings at remote
arrays. We show how to obtain from the incoherent measurements high fidelity
estimates of the time resolved energy carried by the waveguide modes, and study

Shaping properties of these networks and their similarity to Delta-Sigma
Modulators has received a lot of attention. However, very little of the
research done in this area has focused on the effect the weights in these

network output signal. This paper concerns itself with the various modes of
network operation and beneficial as well as detrimental effects which the
systematic generation of network weights can effect. Also, a method for
post-processing of the spiking output signal is introduced, bringing the output
signal more in line with conventional Delta-Sigma Modulators. Relevancy of this
research to industrial application of neural nets as building blocks of
oversampled A/D converters is shown. Also, further points of contention are
listed, which must be thoroughly researched to add to the above mentioned
applicability of spiking neural nets.

arithmetic progression. Following the greedy algorithm, the Stanley sequence
$S(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_k)$ is defined to be the 3-free sequence $\{a_n\}$ having
initial terms $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_k$ and with each subsequent term $a_n>a_{n-1}$
chosen minimally such that the 3-free condition is not violated. Odlyzko and
Stanley conjectured that Stanley sequences divide into two classes based on
asymptotic growth patterns, with one class of highly structured sequences
satisfying $a_n\approx \Theta(n^{\log_2 3})$ and another class of seemingly
chaotic sequences obeying $a_n=\Theta(n^2/\log n)$. We propose a rigorous
definition of regularity in Stanley sequences based on local structure rather
than asymptotic behavior and show that our definition implies the corresponding
asymptotic property proposed by Odlyzko and Stanley. We then construct many
classes of regular Stanley sequences, which include as special cases all such
sequences previously identified. We show how two regular sequences may be
combined into another regular sequence, and how parts of a Stanley sequence may
be translated while preserving regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that certain
Stanley sequences possess proper subsets that are also Stanley sequences, a
situation that appears previously to have been assumed impossible.

of the events is above a certain threshold, or from time series, when the
intensity of a signal surpasses a threshold value. We are particularly
concerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting
time and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to
justify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the
times as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are
different in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson
process, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean
value. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group
transformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after
iterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized
central limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite
moments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean
waiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but
not the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering
random-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions
with a power-law ""bulk"" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds
the moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the
scale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a
non-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.
Conclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural
hazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the
distribution with the behavior of the extreme events.

During the SSS phase, the model SEDs revealed the presence of a strong stellar
and nebular component of radiation in the spectrum. The former was emitted by
the burning WD at highly super-Eddington rate, while the latter represented a
fraction of its radiation reprocessed by the thermal nebula. During the
transition phase, both the components were decreasing and during quiescence the
SED satisfied radiation produced by a large, optically thick disk (R(disk) > 10
R(Sun)). The mass of the emitting material was (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 1E-4(d/1.6
kpc)**(5/2) M(Sun). The helium ash, deposited on the WD surface during the
whole burning period, was around of 8 x 1E-6(d/1.6kpc)**2 M(Sun), which yields
an average growing rate of the WD mass, dM(WD)/dt ~ 4 x 1E-7(d/1.6 kpc)**2

required rate, the accretion can be realized from the disk-like reservoir of
material around the WD. In this case the time between outbursts will extend,
with the next explosion beyond 2027. In the opposite case, the wind from the
giant has to be focused to the orbital plane to sustain the high accretion rate
at a few times 1E-7 M(Sun)/yr. Then the next explosion can occur even prior to
2027.

Sgr A* prior to the closest approach of the G2 object, a putative infalling gas
cloud that orbits close to Sgr A*. The high stellar density at the location of
Sgr A* produces a background of ~250 mJy at 4.5 microns in each pixel with a
large pixel-to-pixel gradient, but the light curve for the highly variable Sgr
A* source was successfully measured by modeling and removing the variations due
to pointing wobble. The observed flux densities range from the noise level of
~0.7 mJy rms in a 6.4-s measurement to ~10 mJy. Emission was seen above the
noise level ~34% of the time. The light curve characteristics, including the
flux density distribution and structure function, are consistent with those
previously derived at shorter infrared wavelengths. We see no evidence in the
light curve for activity attributable to the G2 interaction at the observing
epoch, ~100 days before the expected G2 periapsis passage. The IRAC light curve

eccentric orbit. Penny et al. discovered the presence of a third component in
the IUE spectra. The eclipsing binary and the third body revolve around a
common centre of gravity with a period of 1644 days in an eccentric orbit with
the semimajor axis of 10 AU. We demonstrate the presence of the apsidal-line
rotation with a period of about 141 years, which is considerably longer than
its theoretically predicted value, based on the published radii of the binary
components derived from the Hipparchos Hp light curve. However, our new
solution of the same light curve resulted in smaller radii and a better
agreement between the observed and predicted period of the apsidal- line
advance. There are indications that the third body is a binary. The object was
resolved by VLTI with the PIONIER combiner; in June 2012 the separation was
3.78 mas, magnitude difference in the H region 1.75 mag. This result means that
(assuming the distance 770 pc) the inclination of the long orbit is 87.7
degrees.

that the region responsible for the O$_2$ emission is 9"" (6e16 cm) in size, and
is located close to the H2 Peak 1position (where vibrationally-excited H$_2$
emission peaks), and not at Peak A, 23"" away. The peak O2 column density is
1.1e18/cm2. The line velocity is close to that of 621 GHz water maser emission
found in this portion of the Orion Molecular Cloud, and having a shock with
velocity vector lying nearly in the plane of the sky is consistent with
producing maximum maser gain along the line-of-sight. The enhanced O$_2$
abundance compared to that generally found in dense interstellar clouds can be
explained by passage of a low-velocity C-shock through a clump with preshock
density 2e4/cm3, if a reasonable flux of UV radiation is present. The postshock
O$_2$ can explain the emission from the source if its line of sight dimension
is ~10 times larger than its size on the plane of the sky. The special geometry

LiZn2Mo3O8, we study a single-band extended Hubbard model on an anisotropic
Kagome lattice with the 1/6 electron filling. Due to the partial filling of the
lattice, the inter-site repulsive interaction is necessary to generate Mott
insulators, where electrons are localized in clusters, rather than at lattice
sites. We provide examples of such cluster Mott insulators and study the phase
transitions between metallic states and cluster Mott insulators on an
anisotropic Kagome lattice. It is shown that these cluster Mott insulators are
generally U(1) quantum spin liquids with spinon Fermi surfaces. However, the
nature of charge excitations in different cluster Mott insulators could be
quite different and we show that there exists a novel cluster Mott insulator
where charge fluctuations around the hexagonal cluster induce a plaquette
charge order (PCO). The spinon excitation spectrum in this spin-liquid cluster
Mott insulator is reconstructed due to the PCO so that only 1/3 of the total
spinon excitations are magnetically active. The strong coupling limit of the
same model is also analyzed via a Kugel-Khomskii-like model. Based on these
results, we propose that the anomalous behavior of the finite-temperature
spin-susceptibility in LiZn2Mo3O8 may be explained by finite-temperature
properties of the cluster Mott insulator with the PCO as well as fractionalized
spinon excitations. Existing and possible future experiments on LiZn2Mo3O8, and
other Mo-based cluster magnets are discussed in light of these theoretical
predictions.

different in their cognitive psychology and judiciousness, which can affect the
visual inference. The usual way to estimate the effectiveness of a statistical
test is its power. The estimate of power of a lineup can be controlled by
combining evaluations from multiple observers. Factors that may also affect the
power of visual inference are the observers' demographics, visual skills, and
experience, the sample of null plots taken from the null distribution, the
position of the data plot in the lineup, and the signal strength in the data.
This paper examines these factors. Results from multiple visual inference
studies using Amazon's Mechanical Turk are examined to provide an assessment of
these. The experiments suggest that individual skills vary substantially, but
demographics do not have a huge effect on performance. There is evidence that a
learning effect exists but only in that observers get faster with repeated

emitter classified as a BL Lac object. Its redshift is constrained by
intergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4<z<0.58$. The MAGIC telescopes
have monitored the source's activity since 2005. In early 2012, PG 1553+113 was
found in a high-state, and later, in April of the same year, the source reached
its highest VHE flux state detected so far. Simultaneous observations carried
out in X-rays during 2012 April show similar flaring behaviour. In contrast,
the $\gamma$-ray flux at $E<100\,\mathrm{GeV}$ observed by Fermi-LAT is
compatible with steady emission. In this paper, a detailed study of the flaring
state is presented. The VHE spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fitted
either by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. A
simple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the PG 1553+113 VHE
$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probability
P=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). The observed curvature is compatible with the
extragalactic background light (EBL) imprint predicted by current generation
EBL models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. New constraints on the redshift are
derived from the VHE spectrum. These constraints are compatible with previous
limits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the optical
lower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Finally,
we find that the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model gives a satisfactory
description of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution
during the flare.

numerical simulations of such impacts into granular materials using different
projectile shapes under Earth's gravity. We then compare the amounts of ejected
mass obtained in our simulations against what was found in experiments that
used similar setups, which allows us to validate our numerical approach. For
the targets, we consider 2 different monodisperse grain-diameter sizes: 5 mm
and 3 mm. The impact speed of the projectile is 11 m s$^{-1}$ directed
downward, perpendicular to the surface of the targets. Using an implementation
of the soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) in the $N$-Body gravity tree
code PKDGRAV, previously validated in the context of low-speed impacts into
sintered glass bead agglomerates, we find a noticeable dependence of the amount
of ejected mass on the projectile shape. As found in experiments, in the case
of the larger target grain size (5 mm), a conically shaped projectile ejects a
greater amount of mass than do projectiles of other shapes, including disks and
spheres. We then find that numerically the results are sensitive to the normal
coefficient of restitution of the grains, especially for impacts into targets
comprised of smaller grains (3 mm). We also find that static friction plays a
more important role for impacts into targets comprised of the larger grains. As
a preliminary demonstration, one of these considered setups is simulated in a
microgravity environment. As expected, a reduction in gravity increases both
the amount of ejected mass and the timescale of the impact process. Our
methodology is also adaptable to the conditions of sampling mechanisms included

from radial velocity data taken in 1979-1980, but posterior analysis of data
taken in 2006-2007 did not confirm this period. We analysed the high

radial velocities of the He II 4686 A emission line and, for the first time,
detected what may be the orbital modulation in the photometric data. This

other. A shared linguistic system provides people with the benefits of shared
knowledge and coordinated planning. Once norms are in place, why would they
ever change? This question, echoing broad questions in the theory of social
dynamics, has particular force in relation to language. By definition, an
innovator is in the minority when the innovation first occurs. In some areas of
social dynamics, important minorities can strongly influence the majority
through their power, fame, or use of broadcast media. But most linguistic
changes are grassroots developments that originate with ordinary people. Here,
we develop a novel model of communicative behavior in communities, and identify
a mechanism for arbitrary innovations by ordinary people to have a good chance
of being widely adopted.
  To imitate each other, people must form a mental representation of what other
people do. Each time they speak, they must also decide which form to produce
themselves. We introduce a new decision function that enables us to smoothly
explore the space between two types of behavior: probability matching (matching
the probabilities of incoming experience) and regularization (producing some
forms disproportionately often). Using Monte Carlo methods, we explore the
interactions amongst the degree of regularization, the distribution of biases
in a network, and the network position of the innovator. We identify two
regimes for the widespread adoption of arbritrary innovations, viewed as
informational cascades in the network. With moderate regularization of
experienced input, average people (not well-connected people) are the most
likely source of successful innovations. Our results shed light on a major
outstanding puzzle in the theory of language change. The framework also holds
promise for understanding the dynamics of other social norms.

drawn significant interests for its dual use of radio signals to provide
wireless data and energy access at the same time. However, a challenging
secrecy communication issue arises as the messages sent to the information
receivers (IRs) may be eavesdropped by the energy receivers (ERs), which are
presumed to harvest energy only from the received signals. To tackle this
problem, we propose in this paper an artificial noise (AN) aided transmission
scheme to facilitate the secrecy information transmission to IRs and yet meet
the energy harvesting requirement for ERs, under the assumption that the AN can
be cancelled at IRs but not at ERs. Specifically, the proposed scheme splits
the transmit power into two parts, to send the confidential message to the IR
and an AN to interfere with the ER, respectively. Under a simplified three-node
wiretap channel setup, the transmit power allocations and power splitting
ratios over fading channels are jointly optimized to minimize the outage
probability for delay-limited secrecy information transmission, or to maximize
the average rate for no-delay-limited secrecy information transmission, subject
to a combination of average and peak power constraints at the transmitter as
well as an average energy harvesting constraint at the ER. Both the secrecy
outage probability minimization and average rate maximization problems are
shown to be non-convex, for each of which we propose the optimal solution based
on the dual decomposition as well as suboptimal solution based on the
alternating optimization. Furthermore, two benchmark schemes are introduced for
comparison. Finally, the performances of proposed schemes are evaluated by
simulations in terms of various trade-offs for wireless (secrecy) information
versus energy transmissions.

any type of (normalizable) one-particle wave packet, it is shown that the

of them is an important cyber defense task. The main defense paradigm in this
regard is that the defender uses some kind of machine learning algorithms to
train a detection model, which is then used to classify websites in question.
Unlike other settings, the following issue is inherent to the problem of
malicious websites detection: the attacker essentially has access to the same
data that the defender uses to train its detection models. This 'symmetry' can
be exploited by the attacker, at least in principle, to evade the defender's
detection models. In this paper, we present a framework for characterizing the
evasion and counter-evasion interactions between the attacker and the defender,
where the attacker attempts to evade the defender's detection models by taking
advantage of this symmetry. Within this framework, we show that an adaptive
attacker can make malicious websites evade powerful detection models, but
proactive training can be an effective counter-evasion defense mechanism. The
framework is geared toward the popular detection model of decision tree, but
can be adapted to accommodate other classifiers.

CVs. The nonmagnetic NLs are found mostly in a state of high mass accretion
rate ($\ge$1$\times$10$^{-9}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$) and some show occasional low
states. Using the XRT data, we find optically thin multiple-temperature cooling
flow type emission spectra with X-ray temperatures (kT$_{max}$) of 21-50 keV.
These hard X-ray emitting boundary layers diverge from simple isobaric cooling
flows indicating X-ray temperatures that are of virial values in the disk. In
addition, we detect power law emission components from MV Lyr and BZ Cam and
plausibly from V592 Cas which may be a result of the Compton scattering of the
optically thin emission from the fast wind outflows in these systems and/or
Compton up-scattering of the soft disk photons. The X-ray luminosities of the
(multi-temperature) thermal plasma emission in the 0.1-50.0 keV range are
(0.9-5.0)$\times$10$^{32}$ erg/sec. The ratio of the X-ray and disk
luminosities (calculated from the UV-optical wavelengths) yield an efficiency
(L$_{x}$/L$_{disk}$) ~ 0.01-0.001. Given this non-radiative ratio for the X-ray
emitting boundary layers with no significant optically thick blackbody emission
in the soft X-rays (consistent with ROSAT observations) together with the
high/virial X-ray temperatures, we suggest that high state NL systems may have
optically thin BLs merged with ADAF-like flows and/or X-ray coronae. In

wind outflows detected in these three NLs (particularly BZ Cam and V592 Cas) or

scotch the rumor to the spreaders. An analytical treatment based on the theory
of convergence of density dependent Markov chains is developed to analyze how
the final proportion of ignorants behaves asymptotically in a finite
homogeneously mixing population. We perform Monte Carlo simulations in random
graphs and scale-free networks and verify that the results obtained for
homogeneously mixing populations can be approximated for random graphs, but are
not suitable for scale-free networks. Furthermore, regarding the process on a
heterogeneous mixing population, we obtain a set of differential equations that
describes the time evolution of the probability that an individual is in each

to stop the rumor propagation. In addition, our results can be considered to
develop optimal information dissemination strategies and approaches to control

the solar atmosphere. It is generally accepted that CMEs are results of
eruptions of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). However, a heated debate is on whether
MFRs pre-exist before the eruptions or they are formed during the eruptions.
Several coronal signatures, \textit{e.g.}, filaments, coronal cavities, sigmoid
structures and hot channels (or hot blobs), are proposed as MFRs and observed
before the eruption, which support the pre-existing MFR scenario. There is
almost no reported observation about MFR formation during the eruption. In this
letter, we present an intriguing observation of a solar eruptive event occurred
on 2013 November 21 with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the
\textit{Solar Dynamic Observatory}, which shows a detailed formation process of
the MFR during the eruption. The process started with the expansion of a
low-lying coronal arcade, possibly caused by the flare magnetic reconnection
underneath. The newly-formed ascending loops from below further pushed the
arcade upward, stretching the surrounding magnetic field. The arcade and
stretched magnetic field lines then curved-in just below the arcade vertex,
forming an X-point. The field lines near the X-point continued to approach each
other and a second magnetic reconnection was induced. It is this high-lying
magnetic reconnection that led to the formation and eruption of a hot blob
($\sim$ 10 MK), presumably a MFR, producing a CME. We suggest that two
spatially-separated magnetic reconnections occurred in this event, responsible
for producing the flare and the hot blob (CME), respectively.

effect. To solve this problem, a new framework called RMSE-ELM is proposed in
this paper. It is a two-layer recursive model. In the first layer, the
framework trains lots of ELMs in different groups concurrently, then employs
selective ensemble to pick out an optimal set of ELMs in each group, which can
be merged into a large group of ELMs called candidate pool. In the second
layer, selective ensemble is recursively used on candidate pool to acquire the
final ensemble. In the experiments, we apply UCI blended datasets to confirm
the robustness of our new approach in two key aspects (mean square error and
standard deviation). The space complexity of our method is increased to some
degree, but the results have shown that RMSE-ELM significantly improves
robustness with slightly computational time compared with representative
methods (ELM, OP-ELM, GASEN-ELM, GASEN-BP and E-GASEN). It becomes a potential
framework to solve robustness issue of ELM for high-dimensional blended data in

low-energy electronic structure of the heavily electron-doped AxFe2Se2 (A=K,
Rb, Cs) demonstrates that interband scattering or Fermi surface nesting is not
a necessary ingredient for the unconventional superconductivity in iron-based
superconductors. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in the
one-unit-cell FeSe on SrTiO3 substrate can reach as high as ~65 K, largely
transcending the bulk Tc of all known iron-based superconductors. However, in
the case of AxFe2Se2, the inter-grown antiferromagnetic insulating phase makes
it difficult to study the underlying physics. Superconductors of alkali metal
ions and NH3 molecules or organic-molecules intercalated FeSe and single layer
or thin film FeSe on SrTiO3 substrate are extremely air-sensitive, which
prevents the further investigation of their physical properties. Therefore, it
is urgent to find a stable and accessible FeSe-derived superconductor for
physical property measurements so as to study the underlying mechanism of
superconductivity. Here, we report the air-stable superconductor
(Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe with high temperature superconductivity at ~40 K synthesized
by a novel hydrothermal method. The crystal structure is unambiguously
determined by the combination of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and
nuclear magnetic resonance. It is also found that an antiferromagnetic order
coexists with superconductivity in such new FeSe-derived superconductor. This
novel synthetic route opens a new avenue for exploring other superconductors in
the related systems. The combination of different structure characterization
techniques helps to complementarily determine and understand the details of the
complicated structures.

highly degenerate fermions at finite temperatures. It is based on the second
quantization representation of the $N$-particle density operator in a basis of
(anti-)symmetrized $N$-particle states (configurations of occupation numbers)
and allows to tread arbitrary pair interactions in a continuous space.
  We give a detailed description of the method and discuss the application to
electrons or, more generally, Coulomb-interacting fermions. As a test case we
consider a few quantum particles in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. Depending
on the coupling parameter (ratio of the interaction energy to kinetic energy),
the method strongly reduces the sign problem as compared to direct path
integral Monte Carlo (DPIMC) simulations in the regime of strong degeneracy
which is of particular importance for dense matter in laser plasmas or compact
stars. In order to provide a self-contained introduction, the chapter includes
a short introduction to Metropolis Monte Carlo methods and the second
quantization of quantum mechanics.

The existing proposals of the Cooper pair splitter can only realize a low
efficiency of entanglement production, and its size is constrained by the
superconducting coherence length. Here we show that a long-range Cooper pair
splitter can be implemented in a normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (NSN)
junction by driving a supercurrent in the S. The supercurrent results in a band
gap modification of the S, which significantly enhances the crossed Andreev
reflection (CAR) of the NSN junction and simultaneously quenches its elastic
cotunneling. Therefore, a high entanglement production rate close to its
saturation value can be achieved by the inverse CAR. Interestingly, in addition
to the conventional entangled electron states between opposite energy levels,
novel entangled states with equal energy can also be induced in our proposal.

dust temperature and radiation field of the disk with a Monte Carlo method, and
then solve the gas temperature distribution and chemical composition. The
radiative transfer includes detailed treatment of scattering by atomic hydrogen
and absorption by water of Lyman alpha photons, since the Lyman alpha line
dominates the UV spectrum of accreting young stars. In a fiducial model, we
find that warm water vapor with temperature around 300 K is mainly distributed
in a small and well-confined region in the inner disk. The inner boundary of
the warm water region is where the shielding of UV field due to dust and water
itself become significant. The outer boundary is where the dust temperature
drops below the water condensation temperature. A more luminous central star
leads to a more extended distribution of warm water vapor, while dust growth
and settling tends to reduce the amount of warm water vapor. Based on typical
assumptions regarding the elemental oxygen abundance and the water chemistry,
the column density of warm water vapor can be as high as 1E22 cm^{-2}. A small
amount of hot water vapor with temperature higher than ~300 K exists in a more
extended region in the upper atmosphere of the disk. Cold water vapor with
temperature lower than 100 K is distributed over the entire disk, produced by
photodesorption of the water ice.

analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks,
linear acyclic models are typically used to model the datagenerating process of

causal ordering of variables in a linear acyclic model without using any prior

the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly

the different users sharing it be identified as well? Whenever such user
identification is feasible, it opens the way to possible improvements in
personalized recommendations, but also raises privacy concerns. We develop a

machine learning and computational neuroscience. An important but poorly
understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing. Here, we
present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing,
C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller). Unlike previously proposed
algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information
maximization (Infomax) [Butko & Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy
[Najemnik & Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a
combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and
effort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to
illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial
and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly
inadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we
present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain
context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem
involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC
and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.

optimal solution to this problem in NP-hard and propose a heuristic algorithm
to efficiently solve it.
  Evaluation of the proposed algorithm through NS2 simulations shows that we
can increase the throughput of the constrained secondary users' network by
150\% to 200\% for a wide range of scenarios covering different primary users'
densities, traffic loads, and spectrum availability.

large amounts of manual labor. For data volumes expected from future HI surveys
with upcoming facilities, this approach is not feasible any longer.
  Aims. We describe the implementation of a fully automated source finding,
parametrization, and classification pipeline for the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey
(EBHIS). With future radio astronomical facilities in mind, we want to explore
the feasibility of a completely automated approach to source extraction for
large-scale HI surveys.
  Methods. Source finding is implemented using wavelet denoising methods, which
previous studies show to be a powerful tool, especially in the presence of data
defects. For parametrization, we automate baseline fitting, mask optimization,
and other tasks based on well-established algorithms, currently used
interactively. For the classification of candidates, we implement an artificial
neural network which is trained on a candidate set comprised of false positives
from real data and simulated sources. Using simulated data, we perform a
thorough analysis of the algorithms implemented.
  Results. We compare the results from our simulations to the parametrization
accuracy of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) survey. Even though HIPASS is
more sensitive than EBHIS in its current state, the parametrization accuracy
and classification reliability match or surpass the manual approach used for
HIPASS data.

more than two years in their rest frames, at z ~ 15, depending on DM particle

asymptotic regime within this class, that is, we provide here a full
description of the late-time asymptotics of the solutions to the Einstein
equations when the initial data set is close to the asymptotic regime. Our
proof is based on several energy functionals with lower order corrections (as
is standard for such problems) and the derivation of a simplified model which
we exhibit here. Roughly speaking, the Einstein equations in the symmetry class
under consideration consists of a system of wave equations coupled to
constraint equations plus a system of ordinary differential equations. The
unknowns involved in the system of ordinary equations are blowing up in the
future timelike directions. One of our main contributions is the derivation of
novel effective equations for suitably renormalized unknowns. Interestingly,
this renormalization is not performed with respect to a fixed background, but
does involve the energy of the coupled system of wave equations. In addition,
we construct an open set of initial data which are arbitrarily close to the
expected asymptotic behavior. We emphasize that, in comparison, the class of
Gowdy spacetimes exhibits a very different dynamical behavior to the one we
uncover in the present work for general polarized T2-symmetric spacetimes.
Furthermore, all the conclusions of this paper are valid within the framework

tones of diverse frequencies and variable amplitudes. To detect and process
these signals, the ear employs a highly nonlinear, adaptive, real-time spectral
analyzer: the cochlea. Sound excites vibration of the eardrum and the three
miniscule bones of the middle ear, the last of which acts as a piston to
initiate oscillatory pressure changes within the liquid-filled chambers of the
cochlea. The basilar membrane, an elastic band spiraling along the cochlea
between two of these chambers, responds to these pressures by conducting a
largely independent traveling wave for each frequency component of the input.
Because the basilar membrane is graded in mass and stiffness along its length,
however, each traveling wave grows in magnitude and decreases in wavelength
until it peaks at a specific, frequency-dependent position: low frequencies
propagate to the cochlear apex, whereas high frequencies culminate at the base.
The oscillations of the basilar membrane deflect hair bundles, the mechanically
sensitive organelles of the ear's sensory receptors, the hair cells. As
mechanically sensitive ion channels open and close, each hair cell responds
with an electrical signal that is chemically transmitted to an afferent nerve
fiber and thence into the brain. In addition to transducing mechanical inputs,
hair cells amplify them [...]

experimentally well verified formalisms. However, it is known that the
interpretation makes explicit reference to external observation or
""measurement."" One says that the Copenhagen interpretation suffers from the
measurement problem. This deficiency of the interpretation excludes it as a
viable fundamental formalism and prevents the use of standard quantum mechanics
in discussions of quantum cosmology. Numerous alternative interpretations have
been developed with the goals of reproducing its predictive success while
obviating the measurement problem. While several interpretations make distinct,
falsifiable, predictions, many claim to precisely reproduce the results of
standard quantum mechanics. The sheer number of interpretations raises several
issues. If the experimental predictions are identical, how are they to be
assessed? On what grounds can an interpretation be said to trump another?
Without recourse to experimental findings, one may continue to assess an
interpretation on its logical structure, self-consistency, and simplicity
(number and plausibility of its assumptions). We argue, and where possible,
demonstrate, that all common interpretations have unresolved deficiencies.
Among these deficiencies are failures to resolve the measurement problem,
fine-tuning problems, logical/mathematical inconsistencies, disagreement with
experiment, and others. Shortcomings as severe as these call into question the
viability of any of the common interpretations. When appropriate, we indicate
where future work may resolve some of these issues.

of science derive from a proposition found at the end of Book X of Euclid's
Elements. But its conclusions, using the representation of fractions as a ratio
of two integers relatively prime i.e. the proposition VII.22 of the Elements,
do not match the Aristotelian texts. In this article, we propose a new
demonstration conformed to these texts. They are based on very old results of
the odd/even theory. Since they use neither the proposition VII.22, nor any
other result proved by a reductio ad absurdum, it seems to be the first result
which was impossible to prove in another way. The significance of this result,
revealing a complete new territory in Mathematics, the field of irrational
magnitudes, accounts for the centrality gained afterwards by this kind of
reasoning, firstly in Mathematics, then in all forms of rational discourse.

communication at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies using small cells within
heterogeneous cellular networks. The high path loss of mmWave as well as
physical obstructions make communication challenging. To compensate for the
severe path loss, mmWave systems may employ a beam alignment algorithm that
facilitates highly directional transmission by aligning the beam direction of
multiple antenna arrays. This paper discusses a mmWave system employing
dual-polarized antennas. First, we propose a practical soft-decision beam
alignment (soft-alignment) algorithm that exploits orthogonal polarizations. By
sounding the orthogonal polarizations in parallel, the equality criterion of
the Welch bound for training sequences is relaxed. Second, the analog
beamforming system is adapted to the directional characteristics of the mmWave
link assuming a high Ricean K-factor and poor scattering environment. The
soft-algorithm enables the mmWave system to align innumerable narrow beams to
channel subspace in an attempt to effectively scan the mmWave channel. Thirds,
we propose a method to efficiently adapt the number of channel sounding
observations to the specific channel environment based on an approximate
probability of beam misalignment. Simulation results show the proposed
soft-alignment algorithm with adaptive sounding time effectively scans the
channel subspace of a mobile user by exploiting polarization diversity.

approach is taken to penalise velocities inside the solid domain and the
effective thermal conductivity is interpolated in order to accommodate
differences in thermal conductivity of the solid and fluid phases. The
governing equations are discretised using stabilised finite elements and
topology optimisation is performed for two different problems using discrete
adjoint sensitivity analysis. The study shows that topology optimisation is a
viable approach for designing heat sink geometries cooled by natural convection

correct electroweak symmetry breaking and require that the lightest CP-even
Higgs, h, fit the LHC data for the $\sim 125.5$ GeV state at the $68\%$~C.L.
after including existing constraints from LEP and B physics and LHC limits on
the heavier Higgs bosons. We find that these models are easily consistent with
the LUX and SuperCDMS limits on dark-matter-Nucleon scattering and the observed
$\Omega h^2$ for S masses above about 55 GeV. At lower $m_S$, the situation is
more delicate. For points with $m_S$ in the 6-25 GeV range corresponding to the
CDMS~II and CRESST-II positive signal ranges, the dark-matter-Nucleon cross
sections predicted by the Type I and Type II models more or less automatically
fall within the $95\%-99\%$~C.L. signal region boundaries. Were it not for the
LUX and SuperCDMS limits, which exclude all (almost all) such points in the
case of Type I (Type II), this would be a success for the 2HDMS models. In
fact, in the case of Type II there are a few points with 5.5 GeV $\leq m_S
\leq$ 6.2 GeV that survive the LUX and SuperCDMS limits and fall within the
CDMS~II 99\% C.L. signal region. Possibilities for dark matter to be
isospin-violating in this 2HDMS context are also examined.

  First, we consider how to reproduce experiments that involve human subjects,
and in particular how to deal with different ethics requirements at different
institutions. Second, we look at whether parallel and distributed computational
experiments are more or less reproducible than serial ones. Third, we consider
reproducible computational experiments from fields outside computer science.
Our final case study looks at whether reproducibility for one researcher is the
same as for another, by having an author attempt to have others reproduce their
own, reproducible, paper.
  This paper is open, executable and reproducible: the whole process of writing
this paper is captured in the source control repository hosting both the source
of the paper, supplementary codes and data; we are providing setup for several
experiments on which we were working; finally, we try to describe what we have
achieved during the week of the school in a way that others may reproduce (and
hopefully improve) our experiments.

symmetric positive definite matrix of trace one. Finite probability
distributions are a special case where the density matrix is restricted to be
diagonal. Density matrices are mixtures of dyads, where a dyad has the form uu'
for any any unit column vector u. These unit vectors are the elementary events
of the generalized probability space. Perhaps the simplest case to see that
something unusual is going on is the case of uniform density matrix, i.e. 1/n
times identity. This matrix assigns probability 1/n to every unit vector, but
of course there are infinitely many of them. The new normalization rule thus
says that sum of probabilities over any orthonormal basis of directions is one.
We develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions
that includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate
these, i.e. analogs of the theorem of total probability, various Bayes rules
for the calculation of posterior density matrices, etc. The resulting calculus
parallels the familiar 'classical' probability calculus and always retains the
latter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal.
  Whereas the classical Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which model
is 'best', the generalization maintains uncertainty about which unit direction
has the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds also generalize: as in the
classical setting we bound the negative log likelihood of the data by the
negative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.
