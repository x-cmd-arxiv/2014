W Comae, between 2008 February 28 and 2013 May 17, is presented. The source
showed a gradual tendency to decrease its mean flux level with a total change
of ~3~mJy. A maximum and minimum brightness states in the $R$-band of
14.25$\pm$0.04 and 16.52$\pm$0.1~mag respectively were observed, corresponding
to a maximum variation of $\Delta$F = 5.40 mJy. We estimated a minimum
variability timescale of $\Delta$t=3.3 days. A maximum polarization degree
$P$=33.8\%$\pm$1.6\%, with a maximum variation of $\Delta$P = 33.2\%, was
found. One of our main results is the detection of a large rotation of the
polarization angle from 78\degr to 315\degr ($\Delta\theta\sim$237\degr) that
coincides in time with the $\gamma$-ray flare observed in 2008 June. This
result indicates that both optical and $\gamma$-ray emission regions could be
co-spatial. During this flare, a correlation between the $R$-band flux and
polarization degree was found with a correlation coefficient of
$r_{F-p}=0.93\pm$0.11.
  From the Stokes parameters we infer the existence of two optically thin
synchrotron components that contribute to the polarized flux. One of them is
stable with a constant polarization degree of 11\%. Assuming a shock-in jet
model during the 2008 flare, we estimated a maximum Doppler factor
$\delta_D\sim 27$ and a minimum of $\delta_D\sim 16$; a minimum viewing angle
of the jet $\sim$2\degr.0; and a magnetic field $B \sim$ 0.12~G.

  matching conditional lower bounds",,,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Fr\'echet distance is a well-studied and very popular measure of
similarity of two curves. The best known algorithms have quadratic time
complexity, which has recently been shown to be optimal assuming the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) [Bringmann FOCS'14].
  To overcome the worst-case quadratic time barrier, restricted classes of
curves have been studied that attempt to capture realistic input curves. The
most popular such class are c-packed curves, for which the Fr\'echet distance
has a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in time $\tilde{O}(c n /\epsilon)$ [Driemel
et al. DCG'12]. In dimension $d \ge 5$ this cannot be improved to
$O((cn/\sqrt{\epsilon})^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta > 0$ unless SETH fails
[Bringmann FOCS'14].
  In this paper, exploiting properties that prevent stronger lower bounds, we
present an improved algorithm with runtime $\tilde{O}(cn/\sqrt{\epsilon})$.
This is optimal in high dimensions apart from lower order factors unless SETH
fails. Our main new ingredients are as follows: For filling the classical
free-space diagram we project short subcurves onto a line, which yields
one-dimensional separated curves with roughly the same pairwise distances
between vertices. Then we tackle this special case in near-linear time by
carefully extending a greedy algorithm for the Fr\'echet distance of
one-dimensional separated curves.

estimated. Moreover, we treat the SO(n) n-component spin model to obtain the
generalized expressions for the near-critical scalings, which suggest that the

also study the behavior of magnetization of the classical XY spin model in the

find that in presence of the uniform magnetic field, disorder may enhance the

an evolved galaxy field has become a standard technique in recent analyses. By
partially removing non-linear damping caused by bulk motions, the real-space
BAO peak in the correlation function is sharpened, and oscillations in the
power spectrum are visible to smaller scales. In turn these lead to stronger
measurements of the BAO scale. Future surveys are being designed assuming that
this improvement has been applied, and this technique is therefore of critical
importance for future BAO measurements. A number of reconstruction techniques
are available, but the most widely used is a simple algorithm that decorrelates
large-scale and small-scale modes approximately removing the bulk-flow
displacements by moving the overdensity field (Eisenstein et al. 2007;
Padmanabhan, White & Cohn 2009). We consider the practical implementation of
this algorithm, looking at the efficiency of reconstruction as a function of
the assumptions made for the bulk-flow scale, the shot noise level in a random
catalogue used to quantify the mask and the method used to estimate the
bulk-flow shifts. We also examine the efficiency of reconstruction against
external factors including galaxy density, volume and edge effects, and

often based on Lorentz reciprocity for linearly viscous fluids, applies to a
wide class of non-linear viscoplastic fluids. This follows from Edelen's
non-linear generalization of the Onsager relation for the special case of
\emph{strongly dissipative} rheology, where constitutive equations are
derivable from his dissipation potential. For flow domains with strong
dissipation in the interior and on a portion of the boundary this implies
strong dissipation on the remaining portion of the boundary, with strongly
dissipative traction-velocity response given by a dissipation potential. This
leads to a non-linear generalization of Stokes resistance formulae for a wide
class of viscoplastic fluid problems. We consider the application to non-linear
Darcy flow and to the effective slip for viscoplastic flow over textured
surfaces.

(proof-irrelevant) family F of setoids over a setoid A gives rise to a category
C(A, F) of setoids with objects A. We may regard the family F as a setoid of
setoids, and a crucial issue in this article is to construct rich or large
enough such families. Depending on closure conditions of F, the category C(A,
F) has corresponding categorical constructions. We exemplify this with finite
limits. A very large family F may be obtained from Aczel's model construction
of CZF in type theory. It is proved that the category so obtained is isomorphic
to the internal category of sets in this model. Set theory can thus establish
(categorical) properties of C(A, F) which may be used in type theory. We also
show that Aczel's model construction may be extended to include the elements of
any setoid as atoms or urelements. As a byproduct we obtain a natural extension
of CZF, adding atoms. This extension, CZFU, is validated by the extended model.
The main theorems of the paper have been checked in the proof assistant Coq

integrate set-theoretic and type-theoretic reasoning in proof assistants.

type. Our work is motivated by challenges that occur in environmental
epidemiology, where the usual presence of several confounding variables that
exhibit complex interactions and high correlations makes it difficult to
estimate and understand the effects of risk factors on health outcomes of
interest. The modeling approach we adopt assumes that responses and confounding
variables are manifestations of continuous latent variables, and uses
multivariate Gaussians to jointly model these. Responses and confounding
variables are not treated equally as relevant parameters of the distributions
of the responses only are modeled in terms of explanatory variables or risk
factors. Spatial dependence is introduced by allowing the weights of the
nonparametric process priors to be location specific, obtained as probit
transformations of Gaussian Markov random fields. Confounding variables and
spatial configuration have a similar role in the model, in that they only
influence, along with the responses, the allocation probabilities of the areas
into the mixture components, thereby allowing for flexible adjustment of the
effects of observed confounders, while allowing for the possibility of residual
spatial structure, possibly occurring due to unmeasured or undiscovered
spatially varying factors. Aspects of the model are illustrated in simulation
studies and an application to a real data set.

transformations in conceptual level by type wise differentiated intervening net
rewriting systems dispersing problems to abstract parts, matching being
determined by substitution relations. Achieved sets of conceptual nets
constitute congruent classes. New results are obtained within construction of
problem solving systems where solution algorithms are derived parallel with
other candidates applied to the same net classes. By applying parallel
transducer paths consisting of net rewriting systems to net classes congruent
quotient algebras are established and the manifested class rewriting comprises
all solution candidates whenever produced nets are in anticipated languages
liable to acceptance of net automata. Furthermore new solutions will be added

solving systems and the overall decidability of the set of the solutions. By
overlapping presentation of nets new abstraction relation among nets is
formulated alongside with consequent alphabetical net block renetting system
proportional to normal forms of renetting systems regarding the operational

clearly defined (as in regression or classification), for some of the

which the data-based clustering algorithms should try to get close. This paper
aims to provide some insight into the theoretical foundations of clustering by
focusing on two main objectives: to provide an explicit formulation for the
ideal population goal of the modal clustering methodology, which understands
clusters as regions of high density; and to present two new loss functions,
applicable in fact to any clustering methodology, to evaluate the performance
of a data-based clustering algorithm with respect to the ideal population goal.
In particular, it is shown that only mild conditions on a sequence of density
estimators are needed to ensure that the sequence of modal clusterings that
they induce is consistent.

can receive unbounded random endowments for which we propose a new definition

We prove a type of super-hedging theorem using the acceptable portfolios which
enables us to obtain the consumption budget constraint condition under market
frictions. Applying the path dependence reduction and the embedding approach,
we obtain the existence and uniqueness of the optimal consumption using some
auxiliary processes and the duality analysis. As an application of the duality
theory, the market isomorphism with special discounting factors is also
discussed in the sense that the original optimal consumption with habit

to extreme irradiation, which gives rise to thermal ionization of trace Alkali
metals in their atmospheres. On objects where the atmospheric electrical
conductivity is substantial, the global circulation couples to the background
magnetic field, inducing supplementary fields and altering the nature of the
flow. To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole
aligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly-ionized
atmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower
winds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework. Here, we
consider the effect of a tilted dipole magnetic field on the circulation and
demonstrate that in addition to regulating wind velocities, an oblique field
generates stationary non-axisymmetric structures that adhere to the geometry of
the magnetic pole. Using a kinematic perturbative approach, we derive a
closed-form solution for the perturbed circulation and show that the fractional
distortion of zonal jets scales as the product of the field obliquity and the
Elsasser number. The results obtained herein suggest that on planets with
oblique magnetic fields, advective shifts of dayside hotspots may have
substantial latitudinal components. This prediction may be tested
observationally using the eclipse mapping technique.

an irregular X-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy cluster
Abell 2142. The tip of the X-ray emission coincides with a concentration of
galaxies. The bulk of the X-ray emission of this substructure appears to be
lagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800
kpc. The temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 keV, which is a factor of
~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma of
a galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13M_sun. For this reason, we interpret
this structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the main
dark-matter halo. The X-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gas
stripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through the
intracluster medium (ICM). This is the longest X-ray trail reported to date.
For an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas has
been surviving in the presence of the hot ICM for at least 600 Myr, which
exceeds the Spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of >~400.
Such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangled
magnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.
The long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that the
infalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

determined by (i) the nonrelativistic scattering of many quantum particles and
(ii) the application of Bose-Einstein statistics to the adiabatic and
isocurvature modes, as introduced in Part 1 [1]. Other resonance structure is
understood in terms of annihilations and decays. We setup Bunch-Davies vacuum
initial conditions during inflation and track the evolution of modes including
Hubble expansion. In the case of a complex inflaton carrying an internal U(1)
symmetry, we show that when the isocurvature instability is active, the
inflaton fragments into separate regions of \phi-particles and
anti-\phi-particles. We then introduce a weak breaking of the U(1) symmetry;
this can lead to baryogenesis, as shown by some of us recently [2,3]. Then
using our results, we compute corrections to the particle-antiparticle
asymmetry from this preheating era.

postbounce supernova evolution in a $15$-$M_\odot$ progenitor star and vary the
local neutrino heating rate, the magnitude and spatial dependence of
asphericity from convective burning in the Si/O shell, and spatial resolution.
Our simulations suggest that there is a direct correlation between the strength
of turbulence in the gain layer and the susceptability to explosion. 2D and 3D
simulations explode at much lower neutrino heating rates than 1D simulations.
This is commonly explained by the fact that nonradial dynamics allows accreting
material to stay longer in the gain layer. We show that this explanation is
incomplete. Our results indicate that the effective turbulent ram pressure
exerted on the shock plays a crucial role by allowing multi-D models to explode
at a lower postshock thermal pressure and thus with less neutrino heating than
1D models. We connect the turbulent ram pressure with turbulent energy at large
scales and in this way explain why 2D simulations are erroneously exploding
more easily than 3D simulations.

constant energy density and this generates the interior Schwarzschild radius to
mass relation and the Misner maximum mass for relativistic compact stars. If
dark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric
or of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is
the possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible
electric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact
stars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the
limiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars
made of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation
is carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of
structure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is
proportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's
method to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior
Schwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with
constituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the
maximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical
approximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows
that the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the
minimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is
repulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational
collapse.

with the curvature and the gauge field by means of a Lagrangian given by a
power of the Maxwell one. A sixth-power self-interaction potential, which does
not spoil conformal invariance is also included in the action. Using a
circularly symmetric ansatz, we obtain black hole solutions dressed with the
scalar and gauge fields, which are regular on and outside the event horizon.
These charged hairy black holes are asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.
The mass and the electric charge are computed by using the Regge-Teitelboim
Hamiltonian approach. If both leading and subleading terms of the asymptotic
condition of the scalar field are present, a boundary condition that
functionally relates them is required for determining the mass. Since the
asymptotic form of the scalar field solution is defined by two integration
constants, the boundary condition may or may not respect the asymptotic
conformal symmetry. An analysis of the temperature and entropy of these black
holes is presented. The temperature is a monotonically increasing function of
the horizon radius as expected for asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes.
However, restrictions on the parameters describing the black holes are found by
requiring the entropy to be positive, which, given the nonminimal coupling
considered here, does not follow the area law. Remarkably, the same conditions
ensure that the conformally related solutions become black holes in the
Einstein frame.

suppress both magnetism and orbital ordering, the electron doping suppresses
magnetism faster. Crucially, we find a realistic parameter regime for moderate

antiferromagnetic order. This is reminiscent of the non-magnetic orbital
nematic phase observed recently in FeSe and a number of iron pnictide materials

loop with a temperature reaching several keVs. A power-law high-energy spectral
tail is evident near the HXR peak time, in accordance with the appearance of
footpoints at high energies, and is well correlated with the radio emission.
The energy content of the thermal component keeps increasing gradually after
the disappearance of this nonthermal component. These results suggest that
electron acceleration only covers a central period of a longer and more gradual
energy dissipation process and that the electron transport within the loop
plays a crucial role in the formation of the inferred power-law electron
distribution. The spectral index of power-law photons shows a very gradual
evolution indicating a quasi-steady state of the electron accelerator, which is
confirmed by radio observations. These results are consistent with the theory
of stochastic electron acceleration from a thermal background. Advanced
modeling with coupled electron acceleration and spatial transport processes is
needed to explain these observations more quantitatively, which may reveal the
dependence of the electron acceleration on the spatial structure of the

properties of Fe$_{1+y}$Te compounds. Because in iron chalcogenides the
correlations are stronger than in the iron arsenides, we assume in our model
that some of the Fe orbitals give rise to localized magnetic moments. These
moments interact with each other via exchange interactions as well as
phonon-mediated biquadratic interactions that favor a collinear double-stripe
state, corresponding to the ordering vectors $\left(\pm\pi/2,\pm\pi/2\right)$.
The remaining Fe orbitals are assumed to be itinerant, giving rise to the
first-principle derived Fermi surface displaying nesting features at momenta
$\left(\pi,0\right)/\left(0,\pi\right)$. Increasing the amount of itinerant
electrons due to excess Fe, $y$, leads to changes in the Fermi surface and to
the suppression of its nesting properties. As a result, due to the Hund's
coupling between the itinerant and localized moments, increasing $y$ leads to
modifications in the local moments' exchange interactions via the multi-orbital
generalization of the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interaction. By numerically computing the RKKY corrections and minimizing the
resulting effective exchange Hamiltonian, we find, in general, that the excess
electrons introduced in the system change the classical magnetic ground state
from a double-stripe state to an incommensurate spiral, consistent with the
experimental observations. We show that these results can be understood as a
result of the suppression of magnetic spectral weight of the itinerant
electrons at momenta $\left(\pi,0\right)/\left(0,\pi\right)$, combined with the
transfer of broad magnetic spectral weight from large to small momenta,
promoted by the introduction of excess Fe.

the large equivalent widths are driven by the increased electron temperature

frequently found at large galactocentric offsets, and their progenitors remain
mysterious. Our observations find no convincing underlying quiescent sources
coincident with the locations of these transients, allowing us to rule out a
number of potential progenitor systems. The presence of surviving massive-star
binary companions (or other cluster members) are ruled out, providing an
independent rejection of a massive star origin for these events. Dwarf
satellite galaxies are disfavoured unless one invokes as yet unknown conditions
that would be extremely favourable for their production in the lowest mass
systems. Our limits also probe the majority of the globular cluster luminosity
function, ruling out the presence of an underlying globular cluster population
at high significance, and thus the possibility that they are created via
dynamical interactions in dense globular cluster cores. Given the lack of
underlying systems, previous progenitor suggestions have difficulty reproducing
the remote locations of these transients, even when considering solely
halo-borne progenitors. Our preferred scenario is that calcium-rich transients
are high velocity, kicked systems, exploding at large distances from their
natal site. Coupled with a long-lived progenitor system post-kick, this
naturally explains the lack of association these transients have with their
host stellar light, and the extreme host-offsets exhibited. Neutron star --
white dwarf mergers may be a promising progenitor system in this scenario.

precise and detailed information about the latency functions. Such information
may, however, be unavailable or difficult to obtain. Moreover, one is often
primarily interested in enforcing a desired target flow as the equilibrium by
suitably influencing player behavior in the routing game. We ask whether one
can achieve target flows as equilibria without knowing the underlying latency
functions.
  Our main result gives a crisp positive answer to this question. We show that,
under fairly general settings, one can efficiently compute edge tolls that
induce a given target multicommodity flow in a nonatomic routing game using a
polynomial number of queries to an oracle that takes candidate tolls as input
and returns the resulting equilibrium flow. This result is obtained via a novel
application of the ellipsoid method. Our algorithm extends easily to many other
settings, such as (i) when certain edges cannot be tolled or there is an upper
bound on the total toll paid by a user, and (ii) general nonatomic congestion
games. We obtain tighter bounds on the query complexity for series-parallel
networks, and single-commodity routing games with linear latency functions, and
complement these with a query-complexity lower bound. We also obtain strong
positive results for Stackelberg routing to achieve target equilibria in
series-parallel graphs.
  Our results build upon various new techniques that we develop pertaining to
the computation of, and connections between, different notions of approximate
equilibrium; properties of multicommodity flows and tolls in series-parallel
graphs; and sensitivity of equilibrium flow with respect to tolls. Our results
demonstrate that one can indeed circumvent the potentially-onerous task of
modeling latency functions, and yet obtain meaningful results for the
underlying routing game.

is needed to explain the spectrum in ~95 per cent of SNe Ia observed before -5
days, decreasing to ~80 per cent at maximum. The average velocity of the Ca II
high-velocity component is ~8500 km/s higher than the photospheric component.
We confirm previous results that SNe Ia around maximum light with a larger
contribution from the high-velocity component relative to the photospheric
component in their Ca II NIR feature have, on average, broader light curves and
lower Ca II NIR photospheric velocities. We find that these relations are
driven by both a stronger high-velocity component and a weaker contribution
from the photospheric Ca II NIR component in broader light curve SNe Ia. We
identify the presence of C II in very-early-time SN Ia spectra (before -10
days), finding that >40 per cent of SNe Ia observed at these phases show signs
of unburnt material in their spectra, and that C II features are more likely to
be found in SNe Ia having narrower light curves.

exploring the relationship between the flexural mode and thermal and mechanical

flexural mode, where the rigid translational and rotational invariances play a
crucial role. After that, we outline contributions from the flexural mode in
four different physical properties or phenomena of graphene -- its thermal
conductivity, thermal expansion, Young's modulus, and nanomechanical resonance.
We explain how graphene's superior thermal conductivity is mainly due to its
three acoustic phonon modes at room temperature, including the flexural mode.
Its coefficient of thermal expansion is negative in a wide temperature range
resulting from the particular vibration morphology of the flexural mode. We
then describe how the Young's modulus of graphene can be extracted from its
thermal fluctuations, which are dominated by the flexural mode. Finally, we
discuss the effects of the flexural mode on graphene nanomechanical resonators,
while also discussing how the essential properties of the resonators, including

dedicated type algebras for particular properties, ranging from protocol
compatibility to race-freedom, lock-freedom, or even responsiveness. Two
successful, although rather different, approaches, are session types and
process types. The former allows to specify and verify (distributed)
communication protocols using specific type (proof) systems; the latter allows
to infer from a system specification a process abstraction on which it is
simpler to verify properties, using a generic type (proof) system. What is the
relationship between these approaches? Can the generic one subsume the specific
one? At what price? And can the former be used as a compiler for the latter?
The work presented herein is a step towards answers to such questions.
Concretely, we define a stepwise encoding of a pi-calculus with sessions and
session types (the system of Gay and Hole) into a pi-calculus with process
types (the Generic Type System of Igarashi and Kobayashi). We encode session
type environments, polarities (which distinguish session channels end-points),
and labelled sums. We show forward and reverse operational correspondences for
the encodings, as well as typing correspondences. To faithfully encode session
subtyping in process types subtyping, one needs to add to the target language
record constructors and new subtyping rules. In conclusion, the programming
convenience of session types as protocol abstractions can be combined with the
simplicity and power of the pi-calculus, taking advantage in particular of the
framework provided by the Generic Type System.

We denote by ORD(F) the decision problem asking whether an input graph admits
an F-free ordering; we also use ORD(F) to denote the class of graphs that do
admit an F-free ordering. It was observed by Damaschke (and others) that many
natural graph classes can be described as ORD(F) for sets F of small patterns
(with three or four vertices). Damaschke also noted that for many sets F
consisting of patterns with three vertices, ORD(F) is polynomial-time solvable
by known algorithms or their simple modifications. We complete the picture by
proving that all these problems can be solved in polynomial time. In fact, we
provide a single master algorithm, i.e., we solve in polynomial time the
problem $ORD_3$ in which the input is a set F of patterns with at most three
vertices and a graph H, and the problem is to decide whether or not H admits an
F-free ordering of the vertices. Our algorithm certifies non-membership by a
forbidden substructure, and thus provides a single forbidden structure
characterization for all the graph classes described by some ORD(F) with F

with F consisting of larger patterns have been shown to be NP-complete by
Duffus, Ginn, and Rodl, and we add two simple examples.

schemes have multiple other advantages. They are computationally efficient,
extremely natural, and significantly simpler than prior (non-capacity
approaching) schemes. In particular, our protocols do not employ any coding but
allow the original protocol to be performed as-is, interspersed only by short
exchanges of hash values. When hash values do not match, the parties backtrack.
Our approach is, as we feel, by far the simplest and most natural explanation

  Unmixing","Submitted for journal publication; 33 pages, 14 figures",,,,"math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subspace-based signal processing traditionally focuses on problems involving
a few subspaces. Recently, a number of problems in different application areas
have emerged that involve a significantly larger number of subspaces relative
to the ambient dimension. It becomes imperative in such settings to first
identify a smaller set of active subspaces that contribute to the observation
before further processing can be carried out. This problem of identification of
a small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a
single (noisy) observation in the ambient space is termed subspace unmixing.
This paper formally poses the subspace unmixing problem under the parsimonious
subspace-sum (PS3) model, discusses connections of the PS3 model to problems in
wireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and
compressed sensing, and proposes a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal
subspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing. The MSD algorithm turns the
subspace unmixing problem for the PS3 model into a multiple hypothesis testing
(MHT) problem and its analysis in the paper helps control the family-wise error
rate of this MHT problem at any level $\alpha \in [0,1]$ under two random
signal generation models. Some other highlights of the analysis of the MSD
algorithm include: (i) it is applicable to an arbitrary collection of subspaces
on the Grassmann manifold; (ii) it relies on properties of the collection of
subspaces that are computable in polynomial time; and ($iii$) it allows for
linear scaling of the number of active subspaces as a function of the ambient
dimension. Finally, numerical results are presented in the paper to better
understand the performance of the MSD algorithm.

compare properties of ICME/MC flux ropes measured at 1 AU and properties of
associated solar progenitors including flares, filaments, and CMEs. In
particular, the magnetic field-line twist distribution within interplanetary
magnetic flux ropes is systematically derived and examined. Our analysis shows
that for most of these events, the amount of twisted flux per AU in MCs is
comparable with the total reconnection flux on the Sun, and the sign of the MC
helicity is consistent with the sign of helicity of the solar source region
judged from the geometry of post-flare loops. Remarkably, we find that about
one half of the 18 magnetic flux ropes, most of them being associated with
erupting filaments, have a nearly uniform and relatively low twist distribution
from the axis to the edge, and the majority of the other flux ropes exhibit
very high twist near the axis, of up to $\gtrsim 5$ turns per AU, which
decreases toward the edge. The flux ropes are therefore not linear force free.
We also conduct detailed case studies showing the contrast of two events with
distinct twist distribution in MCs as well as different flare and dimming
characteristics in solar source regions, and discuss how reconnection geometry
reflected in flare morphology may be related to the structure of the flux rope
formed on the Sun.

higher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to published
results over a similar redshift baseline. Using a compendium of data and the

fitting parameters of $A = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, which

Unruh effect. A modal qubit appears as if subjected to quantum noise that
degrades quantum information, as observed in the accelerated reference frame.
The Unruh effect experienced by a mode of a free Dirac field, as seen by a
relativistically accelerated observer, is treated as a noise channel, which we
term the Unruh channel. We characterize this channel by providing its
operator-sum representation, and study various facets of quantum correlations,
such as, Bell inequality violations, entanglement, teleportation and
measurement-induced decoherence under the effect. We compare and contrast this
channel from conventional noise due to environmental decoherence. We show that
the Unruh effect produces an amplitude-damping-like channel, associated with
zero temperature, even though the Unruh effect is associated with a non-zero
temperature. Asymptotically, the Bloch sphere subjected to the channel does not
converge to a point, as would be expected by fluctuation-dissipation arguments,
but contracts by a finite factor. We construct for the Unruh effect the inverse
channel, a non-completely-positive map, that formally reverses the effect, and
offer some physical interpretation.

which relies on compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called
a Query DAG (Q-DAG). Each non-leaf node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric
operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG
represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some
event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the
algorithms for exact inference in belief networks --- we show how they can be
generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms. The time and space
complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity
of the inference algorithm on which it is based; that of a Q-DAG on-line
evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference
amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents.
The main value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources
required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The
proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on
different software and hardware platforms, given the simplicity of the Q-DAG
evaluation algorithm. This paper describes this new paradigm for probabilistic
inference, explaining how it works, its uses, and outlines some of the research
directions that it leads to.

updating strategies fail here, except under very special assumptions. We
propose a new rule for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our
approach is deliberately conservative: we make no or weak assumptions about the
so-called incompleteness mechanism that produces incomplete observations. We
model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool
from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we derive a new updating rule
using coherence arguments. In general, our rule produces lower posterior
probabilities, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical
consequence of the ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We show how
the new rule can properly address the apparent paradox in the 'Monty Hall'

Hough transform, renewal processes and hidden Markov models which have proven
highly effective in this context. The methods are applied to the SSS data to
develop a dataset of spurious object detections, along with confidence
measures, which can allow this unwanted data to be removed from consideration.

Answering this question requires obtaining collective behavioural traces

a unique possibility to measure socio-economic signals from such digital
traces. Here, we focus on Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has
experienced periods of rapid increase in exchange rates (price) followed by
sharp decline; we hypothesise that these fluctuations are largely driven by the
interplay between different social phenomena. We thus quantify four
socio-economic signals about Bitcoin from large data sets: price on on-line
exchanges, volume of word-of-mouth communication in on-line social media,
volume of information search, and user base growth. By using vector
autoregression, we identify two positive feedback loops that lead to price
bubbles in the absence of exogenous stimuli: one driven by word of mouth, and
the other by new Bitcoin adopters. We also observe that spikes in information
search, presumably linked to external events, precede drastic price declines.
Understanding the interplay between the socio-economic signals we measured can
lead to applications beyond cryptocurrencies to other phenomena which leave
digital footprints, such as on-line social network usage.

of the pure LTO/STO interface at 300 K is $\approx$ 118 $\mu$V/K, but increases
dramatically on $\delta$-doping. The observed linear temperature dependence of
S(T) over the temperature range 100 K to 300 K is in agreement with the theory
of diffusion thermopower of a two-dimensional electron gas. The S(T) displays a
distinct enhancement in the temperature range (T $<$ 100 K) where the sheet
resistance shows a Kondo-type minimum. We attributed this maximum in S(T) to
Kondo scattering of conduction electron by localized impurity spins at the
interface. The suppression of S by a magnetic field, and the isotropic nature
of the suppression in out-of-plane and in-plane field geometries further
strengthen the Kondo model based interpretation of S(H, T).

Constraints from the $\bar{Q}$ differential equation, from the operator product

three-loop result also predicts additional terms in the OPE expansion, as well

find that the function controlling this factorization is purely logarithmic

the parity-even part of the ratio function $V$, is remarkably simple; only five
of the nine possible final entries in its symbol are non-vanishing. We study
the analytic and numerical behavior of both the parity-even and parity-odd

stars in an effort to pin-point the origin of so-called eye shaped CSE of three
carbon-rich AGB stars. In addition, we seek to understand if this pre-planetary
nebula (PN) shaping can be responsible for asymmetries observed in PNe.
Hydrodynamical simulations are used to study the effect of typical interstellar
magnetic fields on the free-expanding spherical stellar winds as they sweep up
the local interstellar medium (ISM). The simulations show that typical Galactic
interstellar magnetic fields of 5 to 10 muG, are sufficient to alter the
spherical expanding shells of AGB stars to appear as the characteristic eye
shape revealed by far-infrared observations. The typical sizes of the simulated
eyes are in accordance with the observed physical sizes. However, the eye
shapes are of transient nature. Depending on the stellar and interstellar
conditions they develop after 20,000 to 200,000yrs and last for about 50,000 to
500,000 yrs, assuming that the star is at rest relative to the local
interstellar medium. Once formed the eye shape will develop lateral outflows
parallel to the magnetic field. The ""explosion"" of a PN in the center of the
eye-shaped dust shell gives rise to an asymmetrical nebula with prominent
inward pointing Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.
  Interstellar magnetic fields can clearly affect the shaping of wind-ISM
interaction shells. The occurrence of the eyes is most strongly influenced by
stellar space motion and ISM density. Observability of this transient phase is
favoured for lines-of-sight perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field
direction. The simulations indicate that shaping of the pre-PN envelope can
strongly affect the shape and size of PNe.

confinement of electrons. The confinement mechanism, however, remains unclear.
The transport of coronal hot electrons into ambient plasma was recently
investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Electron transport was
significantly suppressed by the formation of a highly localized, nonlinear
electrostatic electric potential in the form of a double layer (DL). In this
work large-scale PIC simulations are performed to explore the dynamics of DLs
in larger systems where, instead of a single DL, multiple DLs are generated.
The primary DL accelerates return current electrons, resulting in high velocity
electron beams that interact with ambient ions. This forms a Buneman unstable
system that spawns more DLs. Trapping of heated return current electrons
between multiple DLs strongly suppresses electron transport. DLs also
accelerate ambient ions and produce strong ion flows over an extended region.
This clarifies the mechanism by which hot electrons in the corona couple to and
accelerate ions to form the solar wind. These new dynamics in larger systems
reveal a more likely picture of DL development and their impact on the ambient
plasma in the solar corona. They are applicable to the preparation for in-situ
coronal space missions like the Solar Probe Plus.

understood.
  Aims. Our goal is to determine the physical conditions and kinematic
structure of massive star-forming cloud clumps.
  Methods. We analyze H$_2$O 557 GHz line profiles observed with HIFI toward
four positions in two infrared-dark cloud clumps . By comparison with
ground-based C$^{17}$O, N$_2$H$^+$, CH$_3$OH and NH$_3$ line observations, we
constrain the volume density and kinetic temperature of the gas and estimate
the column density and abundance of H$_2$O and N$_2$H$^+$.
  Results. The observed water lines are complex with emission and absorption
components. The absorption is red shifted and consistent with a cold envelope,
while the emission is interpreted as resulting from protostellar outflows. The
gas density in the clumps is $\sim$ 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. The o-H2O outflow column
density is 0.3 to 3.0 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, the o-H2O absorption column density
is between 1.5 10$^{14}$ and 2.6 10$^{15}$ cm$^-2$ with cold o-H2O abundances
between 1.5 10$^{-9}$ and 3.1 10$^{-8}$.
  Conclusions. All clumps have high gas densities ($\sim$ 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and
display infalling gas. Three of the four clumps have outflows. The clumps form
an evolutionary sequence as probed by H$_2$O N$_2$H$^+$, NH$_3$ and CH$_3$OH.
We find that G28-MM is the most evolved, followed by G11-MM then G28-NH3. The
least evolved clump is G11-NH3 which shows no sign-posts of star-formation.
G11-NH3 is a high-mass pre-stellar core.

we discuss a theoretical framework addressing all data in their overall
evolution.
  For two weeks the source has shown a plateau of enhanced GeV emission
preceding a sudden major flare lasting about 3 days before decaying. The
gamma-ray flare onset is abrupt (about 6 hours), and is characterized by a
prominent ""Compton dominance"" with the GeV flux exceeding the pre-flare values
by a factor of 4-5, whereas the optical and X-ray fluxes increased only by a
factor 2.
  We explore two alternatives. Case 1, with high-energy emission originating
within the BLR; and Case 2, with most of it produced outside. We show that Case
1 has considerable problems in explaining the whole set of multifrequency data.
Case 2, instead, leads to a consistent and interesting interpretation based on
the enhanced inverse Compton radiation that is produced as the jet crashes onto
a mirror cloud positioned at few parsec from the BH. This model explains the
gamma-ray vs. optical/X-ray behavior of 3C 454.3, including the otherwise
puzzling phenomena such as the prominent ""orphan"" optical flare, and the
enhanced line emission with no appreciable gamma-ray counterpart that preceded
the GeV flare. It also accounts for the delayed onset of the latter on top of
the long plateau. Our modelling of the exceptional 3C 454.3 gamma-ray flare
shows that, while emission inside the canonical BLR is problematic, major and
rapid variations can be produced at parsec scales with moderate bulk Lorentz
factors $\Gamma\approx 15$.

with respect to neutrino-source hadron state are investigated. Due to the
smallness of neutrino masses, we naturally obtain the old (i.e. pre-mixing)
formulas of decay probabilities. Together, it is shown that the oscillation
formulas, similar to the usual ones, are applied irrespectively of the details
of neutrino-producing processes. The derived oscillation formulas are the same
in form as the usually used ones except for the oscillation length.

between the two datasets: firstly, that individuals are more likely to meet
with one friend at a place they have not visited before, but tend to meet at
familiar locations when with a larger group. We also find that groups of
individuals are more likely to meet at places that their other friends have

distribution of dark energy in the Universe by measuring the time delay of the

emission line structure is important for cosmological application and for the
black hole mass measurements of intermediate redshift quasars. The knowledge of
the shape of Mg II line and its variability allows to determine which part of
the line should be used to measure the time delay and the black hole mass. We
thus aim at determination of the structure and the variability of the Mg II
line as well as of the underlying Fe II pseudo-continuum. We performed five
spectroscopic observations of a quasar CTS C30.10 (z = 0.9000) with the SALT
telescope between December 2012 and March 2014, and we studied the variations
of the spectral shape in the 2700 - 2900 A rest frame. We showed that the Mg II
line in this source consists of two kinematic components, which makes the
source representative of type B quasars. Both components were well modeled with
a Lorentzian shape. Both components vary in a similar way. The Fe II
contribution seems to be related only to the first (blue) Mg II component}.
Broad band spectral fitting rather favor the use of the whole line profile. The
contribution of the Narrow Line Region to Mg II is very low, below 2%. The Mg
II variability is lower than the variability of the continuum, which is
consistent with the simple reprocessing scenario. The variability level of CTS
C30.10 and the measurement accuracy of the line and continuum is high enough to
expect that further monitoring will allow to measure the time delay between the
Mg II line and continuum.

  The measured luminosity function is in good agreement with previous

models is good, which is encouraging for the production of mock catalogs of
[OII] flux limited surveys. We observe the bright end evolution over 8.5 Gyr:
we measure the decrease of log L* from 42.4 erg/s at redshift 1.44 to 41.2 at

Complex Syst. 17 (2014) 1450016",,,"nlin.AO physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The idea is advanced that self-organization in complex systems can be treated
as decision making (as it is performed by humans) and, vice versa, decision
making is nothing but a kind of self-organization in the decision maker nervous
systems. A mathematical formulation is suggested based on the definition of
probabilities of system states, whose particular cases characterize the
probabilities of structures, patterns, scenarios, or prospects. In this general
framework, it is shown that the mathematical structures of self-organization
and of decision making are identical. This makes it clear how self-organization
can be seen as an endogenous decision making process and, reciprocally,
decision making occurs via an endogenous self-organization. The approach is
illustrated by phase transitions in large statistical systems, crossovers in
small statistical systems, evolutions and revolutions in social and biological
systems, structural self-organization in dynamical systems, and by the
probabilistic formulation of classical and behavioral decision theories. In all
these cases, self-organization is described as the process of evaluating the
probabilities of macroscopic states or prospects in the search for a state with
the largest probability. The general way of deriving the probability measure
for classical systems is the principle of minimal information, that is, the
conditional entropy maximization under given constraints. Behavioral biases of
decision makers can be characterized in the same way as analogous to quantum
fluctuations in natural systems.

cultural markets, providing one potential explanation why experts routinely
fail at predicting commercial success of cultural products. To counteract the
difficulty of making accurate predictions, ""measure and react"" strategies have
been advocated but finding a concrete strategy that scales for very large
markets has remained elusive so far. Here we propose a ""measure and optimize""
strategy based on an optimization policy that uses product quality, appeal, and
social influence to maximize expected profits in the market at each decision
point. Our computational experiments show that our policy leverages social
influence to produce significant performance benefits for the market, while our
theoretical analysis proves that our policy outperforms in expectation any
policy not displaying social information. Our results contrast with earlier
work which focused on showing the unpredictability and inequalities created by
social influence. Not only do we show for the first time that dynamically
showing consumers positive social information under our policy increases the
expected performance of the seller in cultural markets. We also show that, in
reasonable settings, our policy does not introduce significant unpredictability
and identifies ""blockbusters"". Overall, these results shed new light on the
nature of social influence and how it can be leveraged for the benefits of the
market.

the observation of a 2D WAL effect, a superconducting transition was revealed

sensitive to disorder and impurity potentials. It was observed that the
interplay of strongly coupled spin and charge degrees of freedom creates the
regimes of irregular dynamics both in coordinate and spin channels. The border
between the regular and irregular regimes determined by the strength and
frequency of the driving field is found analytically within the quasiclassical
approach by means of the Ince-Strutt diagram for Mathieu equation, and is
supported by full quantum mechanical simulations of the driven dynamics. The
investigation of quasienergy spectrum by Floquet approach reveals the presence
of non-Poissonian level statistics which indicates the possibility of chaotic
quantum dynamics and corresponds to the areas of parameters for irregular

be used to split the Kramers degeneracy of its energy levels and to remove all

phase difference is known to be ineffective in two-terminal short Josephson
junctions, where irrespective of the junction structure the induced Kramers
degeneracy splitting is suppressed and the ground state fermion parity must
stay even, so that a protected zero-energy Andreev level crossing may never
appear. Our main result is that these limitations can be completely avoided by
using multi-terminal Josephson junctions. There the Kramers degeneracy breaking
becomes comparable to the superconducting gap, and applying phase differences
may cause the change of the ground state fermion parity from even to odd. We
prove that the necessary condition for the appearance of a fermion parity
switch is the presence of a ""discrete vortex"" in the junction: the situation
when the phases of the superconducting leads wind by $2\pi$. Our approach
offers new strategies for creation of Majorana bound states as well as spin
manipulation. Our proposal can be implemented using any low density, high

2005 December to 2008 December, and regained after that. A sharp outburst
probably occurred around the end of our monitoring program. Overlapped on the
long-term trend are some short-term small-amplitude oscillations. No
intra-night variability was found in the object, which is in accord with the
historical observations before 2005. By investigating the color behavior, we
found strong bluer-when-brighter chromatism for the long-term variability of
1ES 0806+52.4. The total amplitudes at the c, i and o bands are 1.18, 1.12, and
1.02 mags, respectively. The amplitudes tend to increase toward shorter
wavelength, which may be the major cause of bluer-when-brighter. Such
bluer-when-brighter is also found in other blazars like S5 0716+714, OJ 287,

that the hard X-ray flux is a combination of the synchrotron and inverse

surface due to the curvature of the stretched film induces attraction of the
cylinders that can be quantified by the variation of their gravitational
potential energies as they descend into the liquid while still floating on the
film. Although the experimental results follow the trend predicted from the
balance of the gravitational and elastic energies of the system, they are
somewhat underestimated. The origin of this discrepancy is the hysteresis of
adhesion between the cylinder and the elastic film that does not allow the
conversion of the total available energy into gravitational potential energy as
some part of it is recovered in stretching the film behind the cylinders while
they approach each other. A modification of the model accounting for the
effects of adhesion hysteresis improves the agreement between theoretical and
experimental results. The contribution of the adhesion hysteresis can be
reduced considerably by introducing a thin hydrogel layer atop the elastic film
that enhances the range of attraction of the cylinders (as well as rigid
spheres) in a dramatic way. Morphological instabilities in the gel project
corrugated paths to the motion of small spheres, thus leading to a large
numbers of particles to aggregate along their defects. These observations
suggest that a thin hydrogel layer supported on a deformable elastic film

many viruses, including recently-discovered large double-stranded DNA ones.
Many X-ray scattering patterns of such viruses show major polygonal fringes,
which can be reproduced in image reconstruction with a homogeneous icosahedral
shell. A key question regarding a low-resolution reconstruction is how to
introduce further changes to the 3D profile in an efficient way with only a few
parameters. Here, we derive and compile different analytical models of such an
object with consideration of practical optical setups and typical structures of
such viruses. The benefits of such models include 1) inherent filtering and
suppressing different numerical errors of a discrete grid, 2) providing a
concise and meaningful set of descriptors for feature extraction in
high-throughput classification/sorting and higher-resolution cumulative
reconstructions, 3) disentangling (physical) resolution from (numerical)
discretization step and having a vector graphics format for visualization or
further analysis at arbitrary scales, 4) eliminating the phase-retrieval step
and enforcing transparent, relevant, and controlled type/level of a-priori
information in a real-space formulation, and 5) evaluating the reflections and
surface resonances of an icosahedral object, and hence corrections for the
common scattering model.

Specifically, we identify, categorize, and capture the web service testing
needs in two different ways, namely, Operationalized Regression Testing of Web

Both of the approach can be combined to reduce the regression testing efforts

named as Automatic Web Service Change Management (AWSCM), which helps in
selecting the relevant test cases to construct reduced test suite from the old
test suite. We present few case studies on different web service projects to
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed tool. The reduction in the effort

a broad-lined Type Ic supernova in the galaxy NGC 1729 that produced a
relativistic and rapidly decelerating outflow without a gamma-ray burst
signature. Photometry and spectroscopy follow the flux evolution from -13 to
+272 days past the B-band maximum of -17.4 +/- 0.5 mag. The spectra are
dominated by Fe II, O I, and Ca II absorption lines at ejecta velocities of
20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. Other spectral absorption lines are
consistent with contributions from photospheric He I, and hydrogen may also be
present at higher velocities (> 27,000 km/s). We use these observations to
estimate explosion properties and derive a total ejecta mass of 2.7 Msolar, a
kinetic energy of 1.0x10^{52} erg, and a 56Ni mass of 0.1-0.2 Msolar. Nebular
spectra (t > 200d) exhibit an asymmetric double-peaked [OI] 6300,6364 emission
profile that we associate with absorption in the supernova interior, although
toroidal ejecta geometry is an alternative explanation. SN 2012ap joins SN
2009bb as another exceptional supernova that shows evidence for a central
engine (e.g., black-hole accretion or magnetar) capable of launching a
non-negligible portion of ejecta to relativistic velocities without a
coincident gamma-ray burst detection. Defining attributes of their progenitor
systems may be related to notable properties including above-average
environmental metallicities of Z > Zsolar, moderate to high levels of
host-galaxy extinction (E(B-V) > 0.4 mag), detection of high-velocity helium at
early epochs, and a high relative flux ratio of [Ca II]/[O I] > 1 at nebular
epochs. These events support the notion that jet activity at various energy
scales may be present in a wide range of supernovae.

White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries are used to study several
different important open problems in modern astrophysics.
  Aims. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) identified the largest catalogue of
WDMS binaries currently known. However, this sample is seriously affected by
selection effects and the population of systems containing cool white dwarfs
and early-type companions is under-represented.Here we search for WDMS binaries
within the spectroscopic data release 1 of the LAMOST (Large sky Area
Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) survey. LAMOST and SDSS follow
different target selection algorithms. Hence, LAMOST WDMS binaries may be drawn
from a different parent population and thus help in overcoming the selection
effects incorporated by SDSS on the current observed population.
  Methods. We develop a fast and efficient routine based on the wavelet
transform to identify LAMOST WDMS binaries containing a DA white dwarf and a M
dwarf companion, and apply a decomposition/fitting routine to their LAMOST
spectra to estimate their distances and measure their stellar parameters,
namely the white dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses,
and the secondary star spectral types.
  Results. We identify 121 LAMOST WDMS binaries, 80 of which are new
discoveries, and estimate the sample to be \sim90 per cent complete. The LAMOST
and SDSS WDMS binaries are found to be statistically different. However, this
result is not due to the different target selection criteria of both surveys,
but likely a simple consequence of the different observing conditions. Thus,
the LAMOST population is found at considerably shorter distances (\sim50-450
pc) and is dominated by systems containing early-type companions and hot white
dwarfs. (abridged)

in the vicinity of the upper critical field line for a two-band superconductor.
Multiple-band effects are pronounced when the bands have very different
coherence lengths. The transition to superconductive state is mainly determined
by the properties of the rigid condensate of the ""strong"" band, while the
""weak"" band with a large coherence length of the Cooper pairs causes the
nonlocality in fluctuation behaviour and break down of the simple
Ginzburg-Landau picture. As expected, the multiple-band electronic structure
does not change the functional forms of dominating divergencies of the
fluctuating corrections when the magnetic field approaches the upper critical
field. The temperature dependence of the coefficients, however, is modified.
The large in-plane coherence length sets the field scale at which the upper
critical field has upward curvature. The amplitude of fluctuations and
fluctuation width enhances at this field scale due to reduction of the
effective z-axis coherence length. We also observe that the apparent transport
transition displaces to lower temperatures with respect to the thermodynamic
transition. Even though this effect exists already in a single-band case at
sufficiently high fields, it may be strongly enhanced in multiband materials.

computationally efficient algorithm that given $n$ samples from an unknown

statistical queries. A statistical query asks for the expectation of a
predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical
query is valid if it is ""close"" to the correct expectation over the
distribution.
  Our result stands in stark contrast to the well known fact that exponentially
many statistical queries can be answered validly and efficiently if the queries
are chosen non-adaptively (no query may depend on the answers to previous
queries). Moreover, a recent work by Dwork et al. shows how to accurately
answer exponentially many adaptively chosen statistical queries via a
computationally inefficient algorithm; and how to answer a quadratic number of
adaptive queries via a computationally efficient algorithm. The latter result
implies that our result is tight up to a linear factor in $n.$
  Conceptually, our result demonstrates that achieving statistical validity
alone can be a source of computational intractability in adaptive settings. For
example, in the modern large collaborative research environment, data analysts
typically choose a particular approach based on previous findings. False
discovery occurs if a research finding is supported by the data but not by the
underlying distribution. While the study of preventing false discovery in
Statistics is decades old, to the best of our knowledge our result is the first
to demonstrate a computational barrier. In particular, our result suggests that
the perceived difficulty of preventing false discovery in today's collaborative

concerning the author's recent work on the exactification of Stirling's

acknowledging that the calculations in Ref. 2 are basically correct, he claims
that there is no need for the concept of regularisation when determining values
of $\ln \Gamma(z)$ from its complete asymptotic expansion. Here it is shown
that he has already applied the concept at the beginning of the analysis in
Ref. 1. Next he claims that the definition used in Ref. 2 for the Stokes
multiplier in the subdominant part of a complete expansion, which is
responsible for demonstrating that the Stokes phenomenon is discontinuous
rather than a smooth transition, is not correct. It is shown that the Stokes
multiplier used in Ref. 2 is entirely consistent with Berry's description of
the conventional view of the Stokes phenomenon in his famous work where he
developed the smoothing view [15]. Furthermore, it is pointed out that Paris
has not substantiated the smoothing view by at least reproducing or improving
the results in Table 7 of Ref. 2, which not only confirm the jump discontinuous
nature of the Stokes phenomenon, but also provide accurate values of $\ln
\Gamma(z)$ to 30 figures, regardless of the size of the variable or whether the
truncation is optimal or not. Finally, the issue of computational expediency of
MB-regularised values over Borel-summed values is discussed since Paris is
critical of the Borel-summed forms being used in computations.

(PIC) simulations support this analysis, and confirm the scenario.

powerful tool than phenomenological Lindblad equations for modeling exciton
transport in photosynthetic complexes. This view predominantly originates from
an indiscriminate use of the secular approximation. We provide a detailed
description of how to model both coherent oscillations and several types of
noise, giving explicit examples. All issues with non-positivity are overcome by
a consistent straightforward physical noise model. Herein also lies the
strength of the Bloch-Redfield approach because it facilitates the analysis of
noise-effects by linking them back to physical parameters of the noise
environment. This includes temporal and spatial correlations and the strength
and type of interaction between the noise and the system of interest. Finally
we analyze a prototypical dimer system as well as a 7-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson
(FMO) complex in regards to spatial correlation length of the noise, noise
strength, temperature and their connection to the transfer time and transfer.

  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/D_Chernikova/contributions?ev=prf_act",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a full derivation of the variance-to-mean or
Feynman-alpha formula in a two energy group and two spatial region-treatment.
The derivation is based on the Chapman - Kolmogorov equation with the inclusion
of all possible neutron reactions and passage intensities between the two
regions. In addition, the two-group one-region and the two-region one-group
Feynman-alpha formulas, treated earlier in the literature for special cases,
are extended for further types and positions of detectors.We focus on the
possibility of using these theories for accelerator-driven systems and
applications in the safeguards domain, such as the differential
self-interrogation method and the differential die-away method. This is due to
the fact that the predictions from the models which are currently used do not
fully describe all the effects in the heavily reflected fast or thermal
systems. Therefore, in conclusion a comparative study of the two-group
two-region, the two-group one-region, the one-group two-region and the
one-group one-region Feynman-alpha models is discussed.

are physically modeled using disk-formed objects, e.g., buttons and magnetic
pin. These BNE configurations are artificially designed to mimic the real ones
observed in experiments. A computer scanner is used to capture the
configurations. Obtained images are then digitized using web browser running a
HTML equipped with a JavaScript code, which is built mainly only for this work.
From digitization process all grains positions (granular bed and intruder) are
obtained, which is later analyzed using the simplest model, i.e., potential
energy. Since the minimum energy principle (MEP) suggests that a closed system
should go to its state with minimum internal energy, our BNE system must also
obey it. Evolution of only the intruder seems to violate MEP but not for the
whole system. Grains compaction plays important role, so that the system can
achieve its configuration with minimum potential energy.

Neural Networks With Fixed Spread Value. Face detection is the first step in
face recognition system. The purpose is to localize and extract the face region
from the background that will be fed into the face recognition system for
identification. General preprocessing approach was used for normalizing the
image and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network was used to distinguish
between face and non-face. RBF Neural Networks offer several advantages
compared to other neural network architecture such as they can be trained using
fast two stages training algorithm and the network possesses the property of
best approximation. The output of the network can be optimized by setting
suitable value of center and spread of the RBF. In this paper, fixed spread
value will be used. The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) used to
distinguish faces and non-faces and the evaluation of the system will be the
performance of detection, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate
(FRR) and the discriminative properties.
