  Initial Applications",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a brief survey on the modern tensor numerical methods for
multidimensional stationary and time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). The guiding principle of the tensor approach is the rank-structured
separable approximation of multivariate functions and operators represented on
a grid. Recently, the traditional Tucker, canonical, and matrix product states
(tensor train) tensor models have been applied to the grid-based electronic
structure calculations, to parametric PDEs, and to dynamical equations arising
in scientific computing. The essential progress is based on the quantics tensor
approximation method proved to be capable to represent (approximate) function
related $d$-dimensional data arrays of size $N^d$ with log-volume complexity,
$O(d \log N)$. Combined with the traditional numerical schemes, these novel
tools establish a new promising approach for solving multidimensional integral
and differential equations using low-parametric rank-structured tensor formats.
As the main example, we describe the grid-based tensor numerical approach for
solving the 3D nonlinear Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem, that was the starting
point for the developments of tensor-structured numerical methods for
large-scale computations in solving real-life multidimensional problems. We
also address new results on tensor approximation of the dynamical Fokker-Planck
and master equations in many dimensions up to $d=20$. Numerical tests
demonstrate the benefits of the rank-structured tensor approximation on the
aforementioned examples of multidimensional PDEs. In particular, the use of
grid-based tensor representations in the reduced basis of atomics orbitals
yields an accurate solution of the Hartree-Fock equation on large $N\times N
\times N$ grids with a grid size of up to $N= 10^{5}$.

However, achieving robust measurements of component properties is difficult,
even with high quality imaging, and it becomes even more so with the imaging
typical of large surveys.
  In this paper we consider the advantages of a new, multi-band approach to
galaxy fitting. We perform automated bulge-disc decompositions for 163 nearby
galaxies, by simultaneously fitting multiple images taken in five photometric
filters. We show that we are able to recover structural measurements that agree
well with various other works, and confirm a number of key results. We
additionally use our results to illustrate the link between total S\'ersic
index and bulge-disc structure, and demonstrate that the visually
classification of lenticular galaxies is strongly dependent on the inclination
of their disc component.
  By simulating the same set of galaxies as they would appear if observed at a
range of redshifts, we are able to study the behaviour of bulge-disc
decompositions as data quality diminishes. We examine how our multi-band fits
perform, and compare to the results of more conventional, single-band methods.
Multi-band fitting improves the measurement of all parameters, but particularly
the bulge-to total flux ratio and component colours. We therefore encourage the
use of this approach with future surveys.

noise increases with the size of the probed region. We are interested in the
expected time required to find the target to within some given resolution and
error probability. For a known velocity, we characterize the optimal tradeoff
between time and resolution (i.e., maximal rate), and show that in contrast to
the case of constant measurement noise, measurement dependent noise incurs a
multiplicative gap between adaptive search and non-adaptive search. Moreover,
our adaptive scheme attains the optimal rate-reliability tradeoff. We further
show that for optimal non-adaptive search, accounting for an unknown velocity
incurs a factor of two in rate.

method reproduces the observed antiferromagnetic Mott insulating state,
populating the Os $d_{z^2}$ majority orbital. The quarter-filled $e_g$ manifold
is characterized by a symmetry breaking due to the tetragonal structure, and
the Os ion shows a crystal field splitting $\Delta_{cf}$ = 1.7 eV from the

oxidation state Os$^{7+}$. The small magnetocrystalline anisotropy before
including correlation (i.e., in the metallic state) is increased by more than
an order of magnitude in the Mott-insulating state, a result of a strong
interplay between large SOC and a strong correlation. In contrast to
conventional wisdom that the $e_g$ complex will not support orbital magnetism,
we find that for the easy axis [100] direction the substantial Os orbital
moment $M_L\approx-0.2 \mu_B$ compensates half of the Os spin moment $M_S$ =
0.4$\mu_B$. The origin of the orbital moment is analyzed and understood in
terms of additional spin-orbital lowering of symmetry, and beyond that due to
structural distortion, for magnetization along [100]. Further interpretation is
assisted by analysis of the spin density and the Wannier function with SOC

  High-cadence, multi-band LCs are fitted with a functional model and the
best-fit parameters are compared among the SN types. Bolometric LCs (BLCs) are
constructed for the entire sample. We computed the black-body (BB) temperature
(T_BB) and photospheric radius (R_ph) evolution for each SN via BB fits on the
spectral energy distributions. In addition, the BLC properties are compared to
model expectations.
  Complementing our sample with literature data, we find that SNe Ic and Ic-BL
(broad-line) have shorter rise times than those of SNe Ib and IIb. \Delta m_15
is similar among the different sub-types. SNe Ic appear brighter and bluer than
SNe Ib, but this difference vanishes if we consider host galaxy extinction
corrections based on colors. Our SNe have typical T_BB ~ 10000 K at peak, and
R_ph ~ 10^15 cm. Analysis of the BLCs of SNe Ib and Ic gives typical ejecta
masses M_ej = 3.6-5.7 M_sun, energies E_K = 1.5-1.7x10^51 erg, and M(^56Ni) =
0.3 M_sun. Higher values for E_K and M(^56Ni) are estimated for SNe Ic-BL (M_ej
= 5.4 M_sun, E_K = 10.7x10^51 erg, M(^56Ni) = 1.1 M_sun). For the majority of
SNe Ic and Ic-BL we can put strong limits (<2-4 days) on the duration of the
expected early-time plateau. In the case of SN Ib 2006lc, a >5.9 days plateau
seems to be detected. The rising part of the BLCs is reproduced by power laws
with index <2. For two SNe we a possible shock break-out cooling tail.
  Based on the limits for the plateau length and on the slow rise of the BLCs,
we find that in most of our SNe Ic and Ic-BL the ^56Ni is mixed up to the outer
layers, suggesting that SN Ic progenitors are de facto helium poor.

  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set, and let $d \geq 1$. For $n$ in

that $X_{\omega}$ is empty, as well as the limiting distribution of entropy of
$X_{\omega}$. Furthermore, we show that the probability of obtaining a nonempty
system without periodic points tends to zero.

different behavior than is possible within the class of $\mathbb{Z}$-SFTs.

  Detonations","21 pages 5 figures Short version published in 23rd ICDERS",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The turbulent structure of an irregular detonation is studied through very
high resolution numerical simulations of 600 points per half reaction length.
The aim is to explore the nature of the transverse waves during the collision
and reflection processes of the triple point with the channel walls.
Consequently the formation and consumption mechanism of unreacted gas pockets
is studied. Results show that as the triple point collides with the wall, the
transverse shock interacts with the unreacted pocket. After reflection of the
triple point off the wall, the transverse wave interacts with the wall. The
structure found to be of a double Mach configuration and does not change before
and after reflection. In the second half of the detonation cell the triple
point and the transverse wave collide simultaneously with the wall. The strong
transverse wave switches from a primary triple point before collision to a new
one after reflection. After some time a weak triple point reflects off the wall
and hence the structure exhibits more like a single Mach configuration. Due to
simultaneous interaction of the triple point and the transverse wave with the
wall in the second half of the detonation cell, a larger high pressurized
region appears on the wall. During the reflection the reaction zone detaches
from the shock front and produces a pocket of unburned gas. Three mechanisms
found to be of significance in the re initiation mechanism of detonation at the
end of the detonation cell; i: energy resealed via consumption of unburned
pockets by turbulent mixing ii: compression waves arise due to collision of the
triple point on the wall which helps the shock to jump abruptly to an
overdriven detonation iii: drastic growth of the Richtmyer Meshkov instability
causing a part of the front to accelerate with respect to the neighboring
portions.

characterized in terms of the dielectric constant which play an important role
on capacitance, conductivity, screening, dielectric losses and refractive

calculations including van der Waals interactions on two types of layered
materials of similar two-dimensional molecular geometry but remarkably
different electronic structures, that is, graphene and molybdenum disulphide
(MoS$_2$). We focus on such two-dimensional crystals because of they
complementary physical and chemical properties, and the appealing interest to
incorporate them in the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic
devices. We predict that the effective dielectric constant ($\varepsilon$) of
few-layer graphene and MoS$_2$ is tunable by external electric fields ($E_{\rm
ext}$). We show that at low fields ($E_{\rm ext}^{}<0.01$ V/\AA) $\varepsilon$
assumes a nearly constant value $\sim$4 for both materials, but increases at
higher fields to values that depend on the layer thickness. The thicker the
structure the stronger is the modulation of $\varepsilon$ with the electric
field. Increasing of the external field perpendicular to the layer surface
above a critical value can drive the systems to an unstable state where the
layers are weakly coupled and can be easily separated. The observed dependence
of $\varepsilon$ on the external field is due to charge polarization driven by
the bias, which show several similar characteristics despite of the layer
considered.

transport and thermalization, and therefore cannot be described by conventional
statistical mechanics. In this paper, using analytic arguments and numerical
simulations, we study the behaviour of local observables in an isolated MBL
system following a quantum quench. For the case of a global quench, we find
that the local observables reach stationary, highly non-thermal values at long
times as a result of slow dephasing characteristic of the MBL phase. These
stationary values retain the local memory of the initial state due to the
existence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. The temporal
fluctuations around stationary values exhibit universal power-law decay in
time, with an exponent set by the localization length and the diagonal entropy
of the initial state. Such a power-law decay holds for any local observable and
is related to the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement in the MBL phase.
This behaviour distinguishes the MBL phase from both the Anderson insulator
(where no stationary state is reached), and from the ergodic phase (where
relaxation is expected to be exponential). For the case of a local quench, we
also find a power-law approach of local observables to their stationary values
when the system is prepared in a mixed state. Quench protocols considered in
this paper can be naturally implemented in systems of ultra cold atoms in
disordered optical lattices, and the behaviour of local observables provides a
direct experimental signature of many-body localization.

mutations, yet the impact of these epistatic interactions on evolutionary
dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the evolutionary role
of epistasis over 50,000 generations in a well-studied laboratory evolution
experiment in E. coli. The extensive duration of this experiment provides a
unique window into the effects of epistasis during long-term adaptation to a
constant environment. Guided by analytical results in the weak-mutation limit,
we develop a computational framework to assess the compatibility of a given
epistatic model with the observed patterns of fitness gain and mutation
accumulation through time. We find that a decelerating fitness trajectory alone
provides little power to distinguish between competing models, including those
that lack any direct epistatic interactions between mutations. However, when
combined with the mutation trajectory, these observables place strong
constraints on the set of possible models of epistasis, ruling out many
existing explanations of the data. Instead, we find that the data are
consistent with ""two-epoch"" model of adaptation, in which an initial burst of
diminishing returns epistasis is followed by a steady accumulation of mutations
under a constant distribution of fitness effects. Our results highlight the
need for additional DNA sequencing of these populations, as well as for more
sophisticated models of epistasis that are compatible with all of the
experimental data.

81 and 89 galaxies with Chandra and XMM-Newton respectively, totaling 15.0 and

lines, placing strong constraints on the mixing angle of sterile neutrinos with

emission at two different temperatures. These disks are typically assumed to be
a sign of multiple belts, which in only a few cases have been confirmed via
high resolution observations. We first compile a sample of two-temperature
disks to derive their properties, summarised by the ratios of the warm and cool
component temperatures and fractional luminosities. The ratio of warm to cool
temperatures is constant in the range 2-4, and the temperatures of both warm
and cool components increases with stellar mass. We then explore whether this
emission can arise from dust in a single narrow belt, with the range of
temperatures arising from the size variation of grain temperatures. This model
can produce two-temperature spectra for Sun-like stars, but is not supported
where it can be tested by observed disk sizes and far-IR/mm spectral slopes.
Therefore, while some two-temperature disks arise from single belts, it is
probable that most have multiple spatial components. These disks are plausibly
similar to the outer Solar System's configuration of Asteroid and
Edgeworth-Kuiper belts separated by giant planets. Alternatively, the inner
component could arise from inward scattering of material from the outer belt,
again due to intervening planets. In either case, we suggest that the ratio of
warm/cool component temperatures is indicative of the scale of outer planetary
systems, which typically span a factor of about ten in radius.

argue that the stellar population synthesis code BPASS can explain the high

populations, without invoking any AGN contribution. Binary stellar evolution
pathways prolong the age interval over which a starburst is likely to show
elevated line ratios, relative to those predicted by single stellar evolution
codes. As a result, model galaxies at near-Solar metallicities and with ages of
up to ~100 Myr after a starburst typically have a line ratio [O III]/H beta~3,
consistent with those seen in Lyman break galaxies and local sources with

unprecedented photometric precision on more than 150,000 target stars. Most of
the transiting planet candidates detected by Kepler have been observed as
long-cadence targets with 30 minute integration times, and the upcoming
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will record full frame images with
a similar integration time. Integrations of 30 minutes affect the transit
shape, particularly for small planets and in cases of low signal-to-noise.
Using the Fisher information matrix technique, we derive analytic
approximations for the variances and covariances on the transit parameters
obtained from fitting light curve photometry collected with a finite
integration time. We find that binning the light curve can significantly
increase the uncertainties and covariances on the inferred parameters when
comparing scenarios with constant total signal-to-noise (constant total
integration time in the absence of read noise). Uncertainties on the transit
ingress/egress time increase by a factor of 34 for Earth-size planets and 3.4
for Jupiter-size planets around Sun-like stars for integration times of 30
minutes compared to instantaneously-sampled light curves. Similarly,
uncertainties on the mid-transit time for Earth and Jupiter-size planets
increase by factors of 3.9 and 1.4. Uncertainties on the transit depth are
largely unaffected by finite integration times. While correlations among the
transit depth, ingress duration, and transit duration all increase in magnitude

defects to a models with a tensor component or a dust component improves the
fit around $\ell=200$. Fitting simultaneously to both temperature and

the approximation of an inertial Galactocentric reference frame is still valid

LMC's orbital period and apocentric distance derived assuming a fixed Milky Way
are significantly shortened for models where the Milky Way is allowed to move
freely in response to the gravitational pull of the LMC. Holding other
parameters fixed, the fraction of models favoring first infall is reduced. Due
to this interaction, the Milky Way center of mass within the inner 50 kpc can
be significantly displaced in phase-space in a very short period of time that
ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 Gyr by as much as 30 kpc and 75 km/s. Furthermore, we
show that the gravitational pull of the LMC and response of the Milky Way are
likely to significantly affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal
debris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than
previous estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr
deposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the present-day
Sgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly accounting for the
movement of the Milky Way around its common center of mass with the LMC
significantly modifies the angular distance between apocenters and tilts its
orbital pole, alleviating tensions between previous models and observations.
While these models are preliminary in nature, they highlight the central
importance of accounting for the mutual gravitational interaction between the
MW and LMC when modeling the kinematics of objects in the Milky Way and Local
Group.

sample stars. We measured the equivalent widths of iron lines and used strict
differential excitation/ionization balance analysis to determine atmospheric
parameters of unprecedented internal precision (DTeff=7K, Dlogg=0.019,
D[Fe/H]=0.006dex, Dvt=0.016km/s). Reliable relative ages and highly precise
masses were then estimated using theoretical isochrones. The spectroscopic
parameters we derived are in good agreement with those measured using other
independent techniques. The root-mean-square scatter of the differences seen is
fully compatible with the observational errors, demonstrating, as assumed thus
far, that systematic uncertainties in the stellar parameters are negligible in
the study of solar twins. We find a tight activity-age relation for our sample
stars, which validates the internal precision of our dating method.
Furthermore, we find that the solar cycle is perfectly consistent both with
this trend and its star-to-star scatter. We present the largest sample of solar

separate the contribution from these two processes or components to the total
observationally derived abundances. Our approach provides a method to determine
the contribution of each process to the production of elements such as Sr, Zr,
Ba, and Eu. We explore the observed star-to-star abundance scatter as a
function of metallicity that each process leads to. Moreover, we use the

the astrophysical conditions of neutrino-driven winds from core-collapse
supernovae.

symmetric, i.e., stationary in a rotating frame. This symmetry gives rise to a
first integral of the Euler equation, often employed for constructing
equilibrium solutions via iteration. For eccentric orbits, however, the lack of
helical symmetry has prevented the use of this method, and the numerical
relativity community has often resorted to constructing initial data by
superimposing boosted spherical stars without solving the Euler equation. The
spuriously excited neutron star oscillations seen in evolutions of such data
arise because such configurations lack the appropriate tidal deformations and
are stationary in a linearly comoving---rather than rotating---frame. We
consider eccentric configurations at apoapsis that are instantaneously
stationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical symmetry to
eccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as
instantaneously circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle. The two
inscribed helical symmetry vectors give rise to approximate instantaneous first
integrals of the Euler equation throughout each companion. We use these
integrals as the basis of a self-consistent iteration of the Einstein
constraints to construct conformal thin-sandwich initial data for eccentric
binaries. We find that the spurious stellar oscillations are reduced by at
least an order of magnitude, compared with those found in evolutions of
superposed initial data. The tidally induced oscillations, however, are
physical and qualitatively similar to earlier evolutions. Finally, we show how
to incorporate radial velocity due to radiation reaction in our inscribed
helical symmetry vectors, which would allow one to obtain truly non-eccentric
initial data when our eccentricity parameter $e$ is set to zero.

typical Wolf-Rayet models as the progenitor because their ejecta masses are too
high and they do not fit the observed SED unless they have a massive companion

late-time observations of the location will truly confirm if the progenitor was

density, and magnetic fields. They therefore serve as key objects in the study
of multiple frontiers of physics. In addition, their origin (mainly in
core-collapse supernovae) and evolution (via accretion or, for neutron stars,
magnetic spindown and reconfiguration) touch upon multiple open issues in
astrophysics.
  In this review, we discuss current mass and spin measurements and their
reliability for neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the
overall importance of spins and masses for compact object astrophysics. Current
masses are obtained primarily through electromagnetic observations of binaries,
although future microlensing observations promise to enhance our understanding
substantially. The spins of neutron stars are straightforward to measure for
pulsars, but the birth spins of neutron stars are more difficult to determine.
In contrast, even the current spins of stellar-mass black holes are challenging
to measure. As we discuss, major inroads have been made in black hole spin
estimates via analysis of iron lines and continuum emission, with reasonable
agreement when both types of estimate are possible for individual objects, and
future X-ray polarization measurements may provide additional independent
information. We conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spin
measurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected to
revolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.

manner. Upon its arrival, a job should be assigned to a server. Each job has a
size which defines the amount of resources that it needs. Servers have uniform
capacity and, at all times, the total size of jobs assigned to a server should
not exceed the capacity. This setting is closely related to the classic bin
packing problem. The difference is that, in bin packing, the objective is to
minimize the total number of used servers. In the Cloud, however, the charge
for each server is proportional to the length of the time interval it is rented
for, and the goal is to minimize the cost involved in renting all used servers.
Recently, certain bin packing strategies were considered for renting servers in
the Cloud [Li et al. SPAA'14]. There, it is proved that all Any-Fit bin packing
strategy has a competitive ratio of at least $\mu$, where $\mu$ is the max/min
interval length ratio of jobs. It is also shown that First Fit has a
competitive ratio of $2\mu + 13$ while Best Fit is not competitive at all. We

algorithm. In particular, if the value of $\mu$ is known, the algorithm has a
competitive ratio of $\mu+2$; this improves upon the existing upper bound of
$\mu+8$. Finally, we introduce a simple algorithm called Move To Front (MTF)
which has a competitive ratio of at most $6\mu + 7$ and also promising
average-case performance. We experimentally study the average-case performance
of different algorithms and observe that the typical behaviour of MTF is
distinctively better than other algorithms.

uncertainty quantification of models with high-dimensional random inputs, using
Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions. It is known that bounding a probabilistic
parameter, referred to as {\it coherence}, yields a bound on the number of
samples necessary to identify coefficients in a sparse PC expansion via
solution to an $\ell_1$-minimization problem. Utilizing asymptotic results for
orthogonal polynomials, we bound the coherence parameter for polynomials of
Hermite and Legendre type under the respective natural sampling distribution.
In both polynomial bases we identify an importance sampling distribution which
yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order of the approximation. For
more general orthonormal bases, we propose the {\it coherence-optimal}
sampling: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, which directly uses the basis
functions under consideration to achieve a statistical optimality among all
sampling schemes with identical support. We demonstrate these different
sampling strategies numerically in both high-order and high-dimensional,
manufactured PC expansions. In addition, the quality of each sampling method is
compared in the identification of solutions to two differential equations, one
with a high-dimensional random input and the other with a high-order PC
expansion. In both cases the coherence-optimal sampling scheme leads to similar
or considerably improved accuracy.

identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as
these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of
microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 16S datasets are
compositional, and thus, microbial abundances are not independent. Secondly,
microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only
tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU interaction networks is
severely under-powered, and additional assumptions are required for accurate
inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation

of microbial ecological interactions from metagenomic datasets that addresses
both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for
compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that
assumes the underlying ecological interaction network is sparse. To reconstruct
the interaction network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse
neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. Because no large-scale microbial
ecological networks have been experimentally validated, SPIEC-EASI comprises
computational tools to generate realistic OTU count data from a set of diverse
underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of edge recovery and network properties on realistic synthetic data
under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously

the only tractable method to incorporate the wide range of densities and
isospin asymmetries required to describe finite nuclei, infinite nuclear
matter, and neutron stars. Purpose: A relativistic energy density functional
(EDF) is developed to address the complexity of such diverse nuclear systems.
Moreover, a statistical perspective is adopted to describe the information
content of various physical observables. Methods: We implement the model
optimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function
using various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. The minimization
is then supplemented by a covariance analysis that includes both uncertainty
estimates and correlation coefficients. Results: A new model, FSUGold2, is
created that can well reproduce the ground-state properties of finite nuclei,
their monopole response, and that accounts for the maximum neutron star mass
observed up to date. In particular, the model predicts both a stiff symmetry
energy and a soft equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter--suggesting a
fairly large neutron-skin thickness in Pb208 and a moderate value of the
nuclear incompressibility. Conclusions: We conclude that without any meaningful
constraint on the isovector sector, relativistic EDFs will continue to predict
significantly large neutron skins. However, the calibration scheme adopted here
is flexible enough to create models with different assumptions on various
observables. Such a scheme--properly supplemented by a covariance
analysis--provides a powerful tool to identify the critical measurements
required to place meaningful constraints on theoretical models.

that clusters are exposed after 1-3Myr. Here, we investigate the role that
spatial resolution plays in this apparent conflict. We use a recent catalogue
of young ($<10$~Myr) massive ($>5000$~\msun) clusters in the nearby spiral
galaxy, M83, along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging in the optical and
near-IR, and ground based near-IR imaging, to see how the colours (and hence
estimated properties such as age and extinction) are affected by the aperture
size employed, in order to simulate studies of differing resolution. We find
that the near-IR is heavily affected by the resolution, and when aperture sizes
$>40$~pc are used, all young/blue clusters move red-ward in colour space, which
results in their appearance as heavily extincted clusters. However, this is due
to contamination from nearby sources and nebular emission, and is not an
extinction effect. Optical colours are much less affected by resolution. Due to
the larger affect of contamination in the near-IR, we find that, in some cases,
clusters will appear to show near-IR excess when large ($>20$~pc) apertures are
used. Our results explain why few young ($<6$~Myr), low extinction ($\av <
1$~mag) clusters have been found in recent ground based near-IR studies of
cluster populations, while many such clusters have been found in higher
resolution HST based studies. Additionally, resolution effects appear to (at
least partially) explain the origin of the near-IR excess that has been found
in a number of extragalactic YMCs.

smaller annular tube, which encloses the hot (HHX) and ambient (AHX)
heat-exchangers, and the regenerator (REG). Simulations are wall-resolved, with
no-slip and adiabatic conditions enforced at all boundaries, while the heat
transfer and drag due to the REG and HXs are modeled. HHX temperatures have
been investigated in the range 440K - 500K with AHX temperature fixed at 300K.
The initial exponential growth of acoustic energy is due to a network of
traveling waves amplified by looping around the REG/HX unit in the direction of
the imposed temperature gradient. A simple analytical model demonstrates that
such thermoacoustic instability is a Lagrangian thermodynamic process
resembling a Stirling cycle. A system-wide linear stability model based on
Rott's theory is able to accurately predict the frequency and the growth rate,
exhibiting properties consistent with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The
limit cycle is governed by acoustic streaming -- a rectified flow resulting
from high-amplitude acoustics. Its key features are explained with an axially
symmetric incompressible model driven by the wave-induced stresses extracted
from the compressible calculations. These features include Gedeon streaming and
mean recirculations due to flow separation. The first drives the mean advection
of hot fluid from the HHX to a secondary heat exchanger (AHX2), in the thermal
buffer tube (TBT), necessary to achieve saturation of the acoustic energy
growth. The direct evaluation of the energy fluxes reveals that the efficiency
of the device deteriorates with the drive ratio and that the acoustic power in
the TBT is balanced primarily by the mean advection and thermoacoustic heat
transport.

of their optical/UV emission and re-radiates it in the mid- and far-infrared.
Radio observations are largely unaffected by dust obscuration, enabling us to
study the central regions of LIRGs in an unbiased manner. The main goal of this
project is to examine how the radio properties of local LIRGs relate to their
infrared spectral characteristics. Here we present an analysis of the radio
continuum properties of a subset of the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey
(GOALS), which consists of 202 nearby systems (z<0.088). Our radio sample
consists of 35 systems, or 46 individual galaxies, that were observed at both
1.49 and 8.44 GHz with the VLA with a resolution of about 1 arcsec (FWHM). The
aim of the project is to use the radio imagery to probe the central kpc of
these LIRGs in search of active galactic nuclei. We used the archival data at
1.49 and 8.44 GHz to create radio-spectral-index maps using the standard
relation between flux density Sv and frequency v, S~v^-a, where a is the radio
spectral index. By studying the spatial variations in a, we classified the
objects as radio-AGN, radio-SB, and AGN/SB (a mixture). We identified the
presence of an active nucleus using the radio morphology, deviations from the
radio/infrared correlation, and spatially resolved spectral index maps, and
then correlated this to the usual mid-infrared ([NeV]/[NeII] and [OIV]/[NeII]
line ratios and EQW of the 6.2 um PAH feature) and optical (BPT diagram) AGN
diagnostics. We find that 21 out of the 46 objects in our sample are radio-AGN,
9 are classified as starbursts (SB), and 16 are AGN/SB. After comparing to

that initial category learning, as indexed by changes in accuracy, is predicted
by increasingly efficient integrative processing in subcortical areas, with
higher functional specialization, more efficient integration across modules,

development of automaticity, as indexed by changes in the speed of correct

function of the spin-orbit beat period. Relying upon a new model of the system,
we show that cyclical changes in the location of the threading region along the
ballistic trajectory of the accretion stream could produce both effects. This
model predicts that the threading radius is variable, in contrast to previous
studies which have assumed a constant threading radius. Additionally, we
identify a very strong photometric maximum which is only visible for half of
the beat cycle. The exact cause of this maximum is unclear, but we consider the
possibility that it is the optical counterpart of the third accreting polecap
proposed by Rana et al. (2005). Finally, the rate of change of the white
dwarf's spin period is consistent with it being proportional to the difference
between the spin and orbital periods, implying that the spin period is
approaching the orbital period asymptotically.

distance indicators, their progenitor systems remain unresolved. One of the key
questions is if there is a non-degenerate companion star at the time of a
thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf (WD). In this paper, we investigate if
an interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star may result in
observable footprints around the maximum brightness and thereafter, by
performing multi-dimensional radiation transfer simulations based on
hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction. We find that such systems result
in variations in various observational characteristics due to different viewing
directions, while the predicted behaviors (redder and fainter for the companion
direction) are opposite to what were suggested by the previous study. The
variations are generally modest and within observed scatters. However, the
model predicts trends between some observables different from observationally
derived, thus a large sample of SNe Ia with small calibration errors may be
used to constrain the existence of such a companion star. The variations in
different colors in optical band passes can be mimicked by external
extinctions, thus such an effect could be a source of a scatter in the peak
luminosity and derived distance. After the peak, hydrogen-rich materials
expelled from the companion will manifest themselves in hydrogen lines.
H$\alpha$ is however extremely difficult to identify. Alternatively, we find
that P$_{\beta}$ in post-maximum near-infrared spectra can potentially provide
powerful diagnostics.

diameter decreases to nano-scale, the number of surface defects relatively
increases, leading to the Na-relative luminescence decreasing. In addition, we

splitter and a wireless energy harvester, the self-sustaining relay scavenges
radio frequency (RF) energy from the received signals to process and forward
the information. Our aim is to develop a resource allocation scheme that
jointly optimizes (i) BS transmit powers, (ii) received power splitting factors
for energy harvesting and information processing at the relays, and (iii) relay
transmit powers. In the face of strong intercell interference and limited radio
resources, we formulate three highly-nonconvex problems with the objectives of
sum-rate maximization, max-min throughput fairness and sum-power minimization.
To solve such challenging problems, we propose to apply the successive convex
approximation (SCA) approach and devise iterative algorithms based on geometric
programming and difference-of-convex-functions programming. The proposed
algorithms transform the nonconvex problems into a sequence of convex problems,
each of which is solved very efficiently by the interior-point method. We prove
that our algorithms converge to the locally optimal solutions that satisfy the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the original nonconvex problems. We then
extend our results to the case of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying with
variable timeslot durations. We show that our resource allocation solutions in
this case offer better throughput than that of the AF counterpart with equal
timeslot durations, albeit at a higher computational complexity. Numerical
results confirm that the proposed joint optimization solutions substantially
improve the network performance, compared with cases where the radio resource
parameters are individually optimized.

power-density spectra of several accreting low-mass neutron star (NS) binaries.
Observations of the peculiar Z-source Circinus X-1 display unusually low QPO
frequencies. Using these observations, we have previously considered the
relativistic precession (RP) twin peak QPO model to estimate the mass of
central NS in Circinus X-1. We have shown that such an estimate results in a
specific mass-angular-momentum (M-j) relation rather than a single preferred
combination of M and j. Here we confront our previous results with another
binary, the atoll source 4U 1636-53 that displays the twin peak QPOs at very
high frequencies, and extend the consideration to various twin peak QPO models.
In analogy to the RP model, we find that these imply their own specific M-j
relations. We explore these relations for both sources and note differences in
the chi-square behavior that represent a dichotomy between high- and
low-frequency sources. Based on the RP model, we demonstrate that this
dichotomy is related to a strong variability of the model predictive power
across the frequency plane. This variability naturally comes from the radial
dependence of characteristic frequencies of orbital motion. As a consequence,
the restrictions on the models resulting from observations of low-frequency
sources are weaker than those in the case of high-frequency sources. Finally we
also discuss the need for a correction to the RP model and consider the
removing of M-j degeneracies, based on the twin peak QPO-independent angular
momentum estimates.

  Motivation: Several cancer-related genomic data have become available (e.g.,
The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) typically involving hundreds of patients. At
present, most of these data are aggregated in a cross-sectional fashion
providing all measurements at the time of diagnosis.Our goal is to infer cancer
progression models from such data. These models are represented as directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) of collections of selectivity relations, where a mutation
in a gene A selects for a later mutation in a gene B. Gaining insight into the
structure of such progressions has the potential to improve both the
stratification of patients and personalized therapy choices.
  Results: The CAPRI algorithm relies on a scoring method based on a
probabilistic theory developed by Suppes, coupled with bootstrap and maximum
likelihood inference. The resulting algorithm is efficient, achieves high
accuracy, and has good complexity, also, in terms of convergence properties.
CAPRI performs especially well in the presence of noise in the data, and with
limited sample sizes. Moreover CAPRI, in contrast to other approaches, robustly
reconstructs different types of confluent trajectories despite irregularities
in the data.We also report on an ongoing investigation using CAPRI to study
atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, in which we uncovered non trivial
selectivity relations and exclusivity patterns among key genomic events.

COR model considering aero dynamics along with its verification through
experiment. To introduce and analyze the variable characteristic of the COR
model, the collision phenomenon between a pendulum and two kinds of ball is
employed as an example and aerodynamics such as drag force is considered for
analyzing the after-effect of the collision. Collision velocity of the
pendulum, dynamic parameters of colliding bodies, contact time, drag
coefficient, the air density, and the cross-sectional area of the ball are
found as the typical variables of analytical COR model. This observation
generalizes the result in previous researches. To verify new COR model, the
travel distances for the curve-fitted constant COR model and the curve-fitted
variable COR model are compared through simulation and experiment. Moreover,
comparison between constant COR and variable COR is presented in several point
of views. Finally, using the variable COR model, the travel distance of the

investigate the evolutions of the period ratios of the three planets after the
primordial gas disk was depleted. Three routines are found to probably result

are: (i) through apsidal alignment only; (ii) out of pairwise 2:1 MMRs, then
through apsidal alignment; (iii) out of the 4:2:1 Laplace Resonance (LR) , then
through apsidal alignment. All the three scenarios require the initial
eccentricities of planets $\sim0.15$, which implies a planetary scattering
history during and after the gas disk was depleted. All the three routines will
go through the apsidal alignment phase, and enter a state with near-zero
eccentricities finally. We also find some special characteristics for each

of the outer two planets would be broken first to reach the current state. As

governing equation for resummed propagator that partly includes the
non-perturbative effect in the high-k limit. The resultant propagator in the
high-k limit contains the new corrections arising from the screening mechanism
as well as the standard exponential damping. We explicitly derive the
expression for new high-k contributions in specific modified gravity models,
and find that in the case of f(R) gravity for a currently constrained model
parameter, the corrections are basically of the sub-leading order and can be
neglected. Thus, in f(R) gravity, similarly to the GR case, we can analytically
construct the regularized propagator that reproduces both the resummed high-k
behavior and the low-k results computed with standard perturbation theory,
consistently taking account of the nonlinear modification of gravity valid at
large scales. With the regularized multi-point propagators, we give predictions
for power spectrum and correlation function at one-loop order, and compare

consists of two components (sub-systems) interacting with each other through
certain coupling terms. A straightforward way to tackle the assimilation
problem in such systems is to concatenate the states of the sub-systems into
one augmented state vector, so that a standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
can be directly applied. In this work we present a divided state-space
estimation strategy, in which data assimilation is carried out with respect to
each individual sub-system, involving quantities from the sub-system itself and
correlated quantities from other coupled sub-systems. On top of the divided
state-space estimation strategy, we also consider the possibility to run the
sub-systems separately. Combining these two ideas, a few variants of the EnKF
are derived. The introduction of these variants is mainly inspired by the
current status and challenges in coupled data assimilation problems, and thus
might be of interest from a practical point of view. Numerical experiments with
a multi-scale Lorentz 96 model are conducted to evaluate the performance of
these variants against that of the conventional EnKF. In addition, specific for
coupled data assimilation problems, two prototypes of extensions of the
presented methods are also developed in order to achieve a trade-off between
efficiency and accuracy.

several thousands separate mini-circles found in organisms of the class
Kinetoplastida. When the cell is not actively dividing these are topologically
connected in a marginally linked network of rings with only one connected
component. During cell division each mini-circle is removed from the network,
duplicated and then re-attached, along with its progeny. We study this process
under the hypothesis that there is a coupling between the topological state of
the mini-circles and the expression of genetic information encoded on them,
leading to the production of Topoisomerase. This model describes a
self-regulating system capable of full replication that reproduces several
previous experimental findings. We find that the fixed point of the system
depends on a primary free parameter of the model: the ratio between the rate of
removal of mini-circles from the network (R) and their (re)attachment rate (A).
The final topological state is found to be that of a marginally linked network
structure in which the fraction of mini-circles linked to the largest connected
component approaches unity as R/A decreases. Finally we discuss how this may
suggest an evolutionary trade-off between the speed of replication and the
accuracy with which a fully topologically linked state is produced.

multi-user MIMO-Y channel, where three $N_{T}$-antenna users ($N_{T}=2N,\,3N$)
are selected from three clusters to exchange information via an $N_{R}$-antenna
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay ($N_{R}=3N$), and $N\geq1$ represents the number
of data stream(s) of each unicast transmission within the MIMO-Y channel. The
proposed schemes effectively harvest multi-user diversity (MuD) without the
need of global channel state information (CSI) or centralized computations. In
particular, a novel reference signal space (RSS) is proposed to enable the
distributed scheduling for both cluster-wise (CS) and group-wise (GS) patterns.
The minimum user-antenna (Min-UA) transmission with $N_{T}=2N$ is first
considered. Next, we consider an equal number of relay and user antenna (ER-UA)
transmission with ${N_{T}=3N}$, with the aim of reducing CSI overhead as
compared to Min-UA. For ER-UA transmission, the achievable MuD orders of the
proposed distributed scheduling schemes are analytically derived, which proves
the superiority and optimality of the proposed RSS-based distributed
scheduling. These results reveal some fundamental behaviors of MuD and the
performance-complexity tradeoff of user scheduling schemes in the MIMO-Y
channel.

exploit spectral properties of the received signal strength which reflects the
rate at which the wireless propagation medium is being altered, an opportunity
that has not been exploited in the related literature. In this paper, the power
spectral density of the signal strength measurements are related to the
person's position and velocity to augment the particle filter based tracking
algorithm with an additional measurement. The system performance is evaluated
using simulations and validated using experimental data. Compared to a system

T\'{e}l et al. (Physica A, 159 (1989) 155-166), for MFA of complex networks.
First we compare the SB algorithm with two existing algorithms of MFA for
complex networks: the compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm proposed by Furuya
and Yakubo (Phys. Rev. E, 84 (2011) 036118), and the improved box-counting (BC)
algorithm proposed by Li et al. (J. Stat. Mech.: Theor. Exp., 2014 (2014)

networks. We make a detailed comparison between the numerical and theoretical
results of these model networks. The comparison results show that the SB
algorithm is the most effective and feasible algorithm to calculate the mass
exponents tau(q) and to explore the multifractal behavior of complex networks.
Then we apply the SB algorithm to study the multifractal property of some
classic model networks, such as scale-free networks, small-world networks, and
random networks. Our results show that multifractality exists in scale-free
networks, that of small-world networks is not obvious, and it almost does not
exist in random networks.

the observations taken in a quiet region near the solar limb. In spite of
accounting for PRD and RT effects it has not been possible to reproduce the
observed triple peak structure in Q/I. While the two wing PRD peaks (on either
side of central peak) and the near wing continuum can be reproduced, the
central peak is completely suppressed by the enhanced depolarization resulting
from the hyperfine structure splitting. This suppression remains for all the
tested widely different 1D model atmospheres or for any multi-component
combinations of them. While multidimensional radiative transfer effects may
improve the fit to the intensity profiles, they do not appear capable of
explaining the enigmatic central Q/I peak. This leads us to suspect that some
aspect of quantum physics is missing.

between radiative and convective regions, that cause a localized sharp
variation in the sound speed. These are known as ""acoustic glitches"". Acoustic
glitches leave their signatures on the oscillation frequencies of stars, and
hence these signature can be used as diagnostics of these regions. In
particular, the signature of these glitches can be used as diagnostics of the
position of the second helium ionization zone and that of the base of the
envelope convection zone. With the help of stellar models we study the
properties of these acoustic glitches in main-sequence stars. We find that the
acoustic glitch due to the helium ionization zone does not correspond to the
dip in the adiabatic index \Gamma_1 caused by the ionization of HeII, but to
the peak in \Gamma_1 between the HeI and HeII ionization zones. We find that it
is easiest to study the acoustic glitch due to the helium ionization zone in

There are few thousand
asteroids whose surfaces have been observed spectrally. Determining the surface
properties of those objects is important for many practical and scientific
applications, such as for example developing impact deflection strategies or
studying history and evolution of the Solar System and planet formation.
  The aim of this study is to develop a pre-selection method that can be
utilized in searching for asteroids of any taxonomic complex. The method could
then be utilized im multiple applications such as searching for the missing
V-types or looking for primitive asteroids.
  We used the Bayes Naive Classifier combined with observations obtained in the
course of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer surveys as well as a database of asteroid phase curves for asteroids
with known taxonomic type. Using the new classification method we have selected
a number of possible V-type candidates. Some of the candidates were than
spectrally observed at the Nordic Optical Telescope and South African Large
Telescope.
  We have developed and tested the new pre-selection method. We found three
asteroids in the mid/outer Main Belt that are likely of differentiated type.
Near-Infrared are still required to confirm this discovery. Similarly to other
studies we found that V-type candidates cluster around the Vesta family and are
rare in the mid/oter Main Belt.
  The new method shows that even largely explored large databases combined
together could still be further exploited in for example solving the missing
dunite problem.

known as a permutation vincular pattern, and based on it they re-defined known
Mahonian statistics and introduced new ones, proving or conjecturing their
Mahonity. These conjectures were proved by Foata and Zeilberger in 2001, and by
Foata and Randrianarivony in 2006.
  In 2010, Burstein refined some of these results by giving a bijection between
permutations with a fixed value for the major index and those with the same
value for STAT, where STAT is one of the statistics defined and proved to be
Mahonian in the 2000 Babson and Steingr\'imsson's paper. Several other
statistics are preserved as well by Burstein's bijection.
  At the Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics Conference (FPSAC) in
2010, Burstein asked whether his bijection has other interesting properties. In
this paper, we not only show that Burstein's bijection preserves the Eulerian
statistic ides, but also use this fact, along with the bijection itself, to
prove Mahonity of the statistic STAT on words we introduce in this paper. The
words statistic STAT introduced by us here addresses a natural question on
existence of a Mahonian words analogue of STAT on permutations. While proving
Mahonity of our STAT on words, we prove a more general joint equidistribution
result involving two six-tuples of statistics on (dense) words, where
Burstein's bijection plays an important role.

immersed in a sea of free electrons and neutrons. As the neutrons are
superfluid their angular momentum is carried by an array of quantized vortices.
These vortices can pin to the nuclear lattice and prevent the neutron
superfluid from spinning down, allowing it to store angular momentum which can
then be released catastrophically, giving rise to a pulsar glitch. A crucial
ingredient for this model is the maximum pinning force that the lattice can
exert on the vortices, as this allows us to estimate the angular momentum that
can be exchanged during a glitch. In this paper we perform, for the first time,
a detailed and quantitative calculation of the pinning force \emph{per unit
length} acting on a vortex immersed in the crust and resulting from the
mesoscopic vortex-lattice interaction. We consider realistic vortex tensions,
allow for displacement of the nuclei and average over all possible orientation
of the crystal with respect to the vortex. We find that, as expected, the
mesoscopic pinning force becomes weaker for longer vortices and is generally
much smaller than previous estimates, based on vortices aligned with the
crystal. Nevertheless the forces we obtain still have maximum values of order
$f_{\rm{pin}}\approx 10^{15}$ dyn/cm, which would still allow for enough
angular momentum to be stored in the crust to explain large Vela glitches, if
part of the star is decoupled during the event.

of the osculating orbital theory, which considers the perturbing forces acting
on the orbit of each star arising from mass exchange via Roche lobe overflow
(RLOF). The scheme is compared to results calculated from a `classical'
prescription. Using our stellar binary evolution code BINSTAR, we calculate the
orbital evolution of Algol binaries undergoing case A and case B mass transfer,
by applying the osculating scheme. The velocities of the ejected and accreted
material are evaluated by solving the restricted three-body equations of
motion, within the ballistic approximation. This allows us to determine the
change of linear momentum of each star, and the gravitational force applied by
the mass transfer stream. Torques applied on the stellar spins by tides and
mass transfer are also considered. Using the osculating formalism gives shorter
post-mass transfer orbital periods typically by a factor of 4 compared to the
classical scheme, owing to the gravitational force applied onto the stars by
the mass transfer stream. Additionally, during the rapid phase of mass
exchange, the donor star is spun down on a timescale shorter than the tidal
synchronization timescale, leading to sub-synchronous rotation. Consequently,
between 15 and 20 per cent of the material leaving the inner-Lagrangian point
is accreted back onto the donor (so-called `self-accretion'), further enhancing
orbital shrinkage. Self-accretion, and the sink of orbital angular momentum
which mass transfer provides, may potentially lead to more contact binaries.
Even though Algols are mainly considered, the osculating prescription is
applicable to all types of interacting binaries, including those with eccentric
orbits.

of the drag force, gravitational force and electric force on the dust grains,
the lift force has never been considered as a force exerted on the dust grains
in the gas disk. If the grains are spinning and moving in the fluid, then the
lift force is exerted on them. We show in this paper that the dust grains can
be continuously spinning due to the frequent collisions so that the lift force
continues to be exerted on them, which is valid in a certain parameter space
where the grain size is larger than ~ 1 m and where the distance from the
central star is larger than 1 AU for the minimum mass solar nebula. In
addition, we estimate the effects of the force on the grain motion and obtain
the result that the mean relative velocity between the grains due to the lift
force is comparable to the gas velocity in the Kepler rotational frame when the
Stokes number and lift-drag ratio are both ~ 1. This estimation is performed
under the assumptions of the steady state and the isotropic spin angular
momentum. We also estimate the mean relative velocity when the grains keep
spinning and conclude that the lift force marginally affects the mean relative
velocity in the minimum mass solar nebula. If there is a grain-concentrated
part in the disk, the relative velocity due to the lift force may dominate
there because of high collision rate.

the effective phonon theory, the exponents of the power-law dependence of the
thermal conductivities as the function of temperature are only determined by
the exponents of the soft or hard on-site potentials. These theoretical
predictions have been consistently verified very well by extensive numerical
simulations.

possessing a composition induced paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quantum phase
transition (QPT) at the critical concentration $x_c \sim$ 0.026 in bulk. A
low-temperature non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviour around $x_c$ usually indicates
the presence of quantum criticality (QC) in this system. In this work, we
explore the existence of such a QPT in nanoparticles of this alloy system. We
synthesized single-phase, polydispersed and 40-50 nm mean diameter crystalline
nanoparticles of Pd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$ alloys, with $x$ near $x_c$ and beyond, by a
chemical reflux method. In addition to the determination of the size,
composition, phase and crystallinity of the alloys by microscopic and
spectroscopic techniques, the existence of a possible QPT was explored by
resistivity and DC magnetization measurements. A dip in the value of the
exponent $n$ near $x_c$, and a concomitant peak in the constant $A$, of the
$AT^n$ dependence of the low temperature ($T$) resistivity indicate the
presence of a quantum-like phase transition in the system. The minimum value of
$n$, however, remains within the Fermi liquid regime ($n >$ 2). The DC
magnetization results suggest an anticipatory presence of a superparamagnetic
to ferromagnetic QPT in the mean-sized nanoparticles. The observation of a
possible quantum critical NFL behaviour ($n <$ 2) through resistivity is argued
to be inhibited by the electron-magnon scatterings present in the smaller
nanoparticles.

predict iconicity? And what exactly makes an image iconic? We provide answers
to these questions through an extensive experimental study on a challenging

consistent across individuals, even when they are not domain experts, thus
demonstrating that iconicity is not purely subjective. We then consider an
exhaustive list of properties that are intuitively related to iconicity and
measure their correlation with these iconicity ratings. We combine them to
predict iconicity of new unseen images. We also propose a direct iconicity
predictor that is discriminatively trained with iconicity ratings. By combining
both systems, we get an iconicity prediction that approaches human performance.

computationally inaccessible for more than very few electrons. In order to
surpass this limitation, one of the authors [X. Oriols, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2007,
98 (066803)] has recently proposed a new model to study electron-electron
correlations from Bohm trajectories associated to time-dependent wave-packets
solutions of pseudo single-particle Schr\""odinger equations. In the
aforementioned paper only the orbital exchange interaction is considered
assuming that all electrons have the same spin orientation. Then, the
many-particle wave function is a complex Slater determinant of the
single-particle wave-packets. In the present work the previous formalism is
extended to study many-particle wave functions where the electrons have
different spin orientations.The main difficulty to treat N different electron
spin orientations with time-dependent wave-packets is that one must study all
the possible N!N! products of permutations among spin states. To overcome this
computationally inaccessible problem, in this article the total wave function
is treated as a separated product of two many-particle wave functions, the
first with spin up and the second with spin down. In order to numerically
justify this approximation, the Bohm velocity in different antisymmetric total
wave-function scenarios is computed. The computational results confirms the
accurate validity of our approximation under a large number of cases.

the non-uniform hypernetwork. Furthermore, we develop a model for weighted
hypernetworks that couples the establishment of new hyperedges and nodes and
the weights' dynamical evolution. We obtain the stationary average hyperdegree

hypernetwork model with attractiveness, respectively. In particular, the model
yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes' properties and scale-free behavior
for the hyperdegree and hyperstrength distribution. It is expected that our
work may give help to the study of the hypernetworks in real-world systems.

leads to a pure steady state in which pairs of neighboring spins form dimers

bring substantial improvement in spectral efficiency and/or energy efficiency,
due to the excessive degrees-of-freedom and huge array gain. However,
large-scale MIMO is expected to deploy lower-cost radio frequency (RF)
components, which are particularly prone to hardware impairments.
Unfortunately, compensation schemes are not able to remove the impact of
hardware impairments completely, such that a certain amount of residual
impairments always exists. In this paper, we investigate the impact of residual
transmit RF impairments (RTRI) on the spectral and energy efficiency of
training-based point-to-point large-scale MIMO systems, and seek to determine
the optimal training length and number of antennas which maximize the energy
efficiency. We derive deterministic equivalents of the
signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) with zero-forcing (ZF) receivers,
as well as the corresponding spectral and energy efficiency, which are shown to
be accurate even for small number of antennas. Through an iterative sequential
optimization, we find that the optimal training length of systems with RTRI can
be smaller compared to ideal hardware systems in the moderate SNR regime, while
larger in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it is observed that RTRI can
significantly decrease the optimal number of transmit and receive antennas.

will enable the fastest spread of information in a decentralized environment.In
a model of communication based on a random walk on an undirected graph, the
optimal set over all sets of the same or smaller cardinality minimizes the sum
of the mean first arrival times to the set by walkers starting at nodes outside
the set. The problem originates from the study of the spread of information or
consensus in a network and was introduced in this form by V.Borkar et al. in
2010. More generally, the work of A. Clark et al. in 2012 showed that
estimating the fastest rate of convergence to consensus of so-called leader
follower systems leads to a consideration of the same optimization problem.
  The set function $F$ to be minimized is supermodular and therefore the greedy
algorithm is commonly used to construct optimal sets or their approximations.
In this paper, the problem is reformulated so that the search for solutions is
restricted to optimal and near optimal subsets of the graph. We prove
sufficient conditions for the existence of a greedoid structure that contains
feasible optimal and near optimal sets. It is therefore possible we conjecture,
to search for optimal or near optimal sets by local moves in a stepwise manner
to obtain near optimal sets that are better approximations than the factor
$(1-1/e)$ degree of optimality guaranteed by the use of the greedy algorithm. A
simple example illustrates aspects of the method.

fundamental transverse mode in CO2 laser-machined, high-finesse optical
Fabry-Perot cavities and investigate the influence of the geometry of the
cavity mirrors. Their highly reflective surfaces are typically not rotationally
symmetric but have slightly different radii of curvature along two principal
axes. We observe that the eccentricity of such elliptical mirrors lifts the
degeneracy of the polarization eigenmodes. The impact of the eccentricity
increases for smaller radii of curvature. A model derived from corrections to
the paraxial resonator theory is in excellent agreement with the measurements,
showing that geometric effects are the main source of the frequency splitting
of polarization modes for the type of microscopic cavity studied here. By
rotating one of the mirrors around the cavity axis, the splitting can be tuned.
In the case of an identical differential phase shift per mirror, it can even be
eliminated, despite a nonvanishing eccentricity of each mirror. We expect our
results to have important implications for many experiments in cavity quantum
electrodynamics, where Fabry-Perot cavities with small mode volumes are
required.

one-dimensional radial baundary layer (BL) models in cataclysmic variables and
compare them with observed soft X-ray/extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra of
dwarf novae in outburst. Every considered BL model is divided into a number of
rings, and for each ring, a structure model along the vertical direction is
computed using the stellar-atmosphere method. The ring spectra are then
combined into a BL spectrum taking Doppler broadening and limb darkening into
account. Two sets of model BL spectra are computed, the first of them consists
of BL models with fixed white dwarf (WD) mass (1 M_sun) and various relative WD
angular velocities (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 break-up velocities), while the other
deals with a fixed relative angular velocity (0.8 break-up velocity) and
various WD masses (0.8, 1, and 1.2 M_sun). The model spectra show broad
absorption features because of blending of numerous absorption lines, and
emission-like features at spectral regions with only a few strong absorption
lines. The model spectra are very similar to observed soft X-ray/EUV spectra of
SS Cyg and U Gem in outburst. The observed SS Cyg spectrum could be fitted by
BL model spectra with WD masses 0.8 - 1 M_sun and relative angular velocities
0.6 - 0.8 break up velocities. These BL models also reproduce the observed
ratio of BL luminosity and disk luminosity. The difference between the observed
and the BL model spectra is similar to a hot optically thin plasma spectrum and
could be associated with the spectrum of outflowing plasma with a mass loss
rate compatible with the BL mass accretion rate. The suggested method of
computing BL spectra seems very promising and can be applied to other BL models
for comparison with EUV spectra of dwarf novae in outburst.

dramatic change of particles behavior compared to the standard continuous time
random walk model. Constant force leads to the transition from non-ergodic
sub-diffusion to seemingly ergodic diffusive behavior. However, we show it
remains anomalous in a sense that the diffusion coefficient depends on the

anomalous exponent defines not only the speed of convergence but also the
stationary distribution which is different from standard Boltzmann equilibrium.

fundamental importance in physics, chemistry and engineering. Motivated by
recent progress concerning the self-assembly of magnetic structures, the
equilibrium orientation of 8 interacting dipoles in a cubic cluster is
investigated in detail. Instead of discrete equilibria we find a new type of
ground state consisting of infinitely many orientations. This continuum of
energetically degenerate states represents a yet unknown form of magnetic
frustration. The corresponding dipole rotations in the flat potential valley of
this Goldstone mode enable the construction of frictionless magnetic couplings.
Using novel computer-assisted algebraic geometry methods, we moreover
completely enumerate all equilibrium configurations. The seemingly simple cubic
system allows for exactly 9536 unstable discrete equilibria falling into 183
distinct energy families.

light. The electromagnetic field is modeled as a reservoir of quantum harmonic
oscillators successively streaming past a quantum system. Each weak and
fleeting interaction entangles the light and the system, and the light
continues its course. Within the framework of open quantum systems, the light
is eventually traced out, leaving the reduced quantum state of the system as
the primary mathematical subject. Two major results are presented. The first is
a master equation approach for a quantum system interacting with a traveling
wave packet prepared with a definite number of photons. In contrast to
quasi-classical states, such as coherent or thermal fields, these N-photon
states possess temporal mode entanglement, and local interactions in time have
nonlocal consequences. The second is a model for a three-dimensional
light-matter interface for an atomic ensemble interacting with a paraxial laser
beam and its application to the generation of QND spin squeezing. Both coherent
and incoherent dynamics due to spatially inhomogeneous atom-light coupling
across the ensemble are accounted for. Measurement of paraxially scattered
light can generate squeezing of an atomic spin wave, while diffusely scattered
photons lead to spatially local decoherence.

wakefield of the self-modulating particle beam is possible and ensures high
energy gain. The witness beam must co-propagate with the tail part of the
driver, since the plasma wave phase velocity there can exceed the light
velocity, which is necessary for efficient acceleration. If the witness beam is
many wakefield periods long, then the trapped charge is limited by beam loading
effects. The initial trapping is better for positrons, but at the acceleration
stage a considerable fraction of positrons is lost from the wave. For efficient
trapping of electrons, the plasma boundary must be sharp, with the density
transition region shorter than several centimeters. Positrons are not
susceptible to the initial plasma density gradient.

bulk region as the heat content $TS$ of its boundary surface. Further, the time
evolution of spacetime metric in Einstein's theory arises due to the difference
$(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$ of suitably defined surface and bulk degrees of freedom.
We show that this thermodynamic interpretation generalizes in a natural fashion
to all Lanczos-Lovelock models of gravity. The Noether charge, related to time
evolution vector field, in a bulk region of space is equal to the heat content
$TS$ of the boundary surface with the temperature $T$ defined using local
Rindler observers and $S$ being the Wald entropy. Using the Wald entropy to
define the surface degrees of freedom $N_{sur}$ and Komar energy density to
define the bulk degrees of freedom $N_{bulk}$, we can also show that the time
evolution of the geometry is sourced by $(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$. When it is
possible to choose the foliation of spacetime such that metric is independent
of time, the above dynamical equation yields the holographic equipartition for
Lanczos-Lovelock gravity with $N_{sur}=N_{bulk}$. The implications are
discussed.

quantum hydrodynamic analogy (QHA) given by Madelung. The role of the quantum
potential in generating the non-local dynamics of quantum mechanics is
analyzed. The work shows how in presence of noise the non-local properties as
well as the quantization of the action are perturbed. The resulting stochastic
QHA dynamics much depend by the strength of the interaction: Strongly bounded
systems (such as linear ones) lead to quantum entangled stochastic behavior,
while weakly bounded ones may be not able to maintain the quantum superposition
of states on large distances and may loose their macro-scale quantum coherence
acquiring the classical stochastic evolution . The work shows that in the frame
of the stochastic approach it is possible to have freedom between quantum
weakly bounded systems. The stochastic QHA model shows that the wave-function
collapse to an eigenstates (deriving by interaction of a quantum microscopic
system with a classical (macroscopic) one) can be described by the model itself
as a kinetic quantum (relaxation) process to a stationary state. Since the time
of the wave function decay to the eigenstate represents the minimum duration
time of a measurement, the minimum uncertainty principle is shown to be
compatible with the relativistic postulate about the light speed as the maximum
velocity of transmission of interaction. About this topic, the paper shows that
the Lorenz invariance of the relativistic quantum potential (coming from the
Dirac equation) enforces the hypothesis that the superluminal transmission of
information are not present in measurements on quantum entangled state.

Phonons are coherently initiated by femtosecond photocarrier screening on
potential gradients. Although translational symmetry within the isotropic plane
normally prohibits optical generation of TA phonons, we show that the combined
application of an external bias in the vertical and lateral directions can
break the selection rules, generating the forbidden TA mode. The amplitude and
on-state time of the TA mode can be modulated by the external field strength
and size of the laterally biased region. The observed frequency shift with an
external bias as well as the strong geometrical dependence confirm the role of
the asymmetric potential distribution in electrically manipulating the crystal
symmetry to control and activate the transistor.

dynamically suppress the associated fifth forces in the presence of massive
sources through derivative non-linearities. The resulting equations of motion
for the scalar are highly non-linear and therefore very few analytic solutions
are known. Here we present a brief investigation of the structure of Vainshtein
screening in symmetrical configurations, focusing in particular on the
spherical, cylindrical and planar solutions that are relevant for observations
of the cosmic web. We consider Vainshtein screening in both the Galileon model,
where the non-linear terms involve second derivatives of the scalar, and a
k-essence theory, where the non-linear terms involve only first derivatives of
the scalar. We find that screening, and consequently the suppression of the
scalar force, is most efficient around spherical sources, weaker around
cylindrical sources and can be absent altogether around planar sources.

example, it is shown that the Hermitian conjugates of the basis do not

supersymmetry must be called into question.

coupled to dark matter with a suitable interaction in the universe described by
Einstein-Aether gravity. Dark energy in the form of Modified Chaplygin gas is
considered. A suitable interaction between dark energy and dark matter is
considered in order to at least alleviate (if not solve) the cosmic coincidence
problem. The dynamical system of equations is solved numerically and a stable
scaling solution is obtained. A significant attempt towards the solution of the
cosmic coincidence problem is taken. The statefinder parameters are also
calculated to classify the dark energy models. Graphs and phase diagrams are
drawn to study the variations of these parameters. It is also seen that the
background dynamics of modified Chaplygin gas in Einstein-Aether gravity is
completely consistent with the notion of an accelerated expansion in the late
universe. Finally, it has been shown that the universe follows the power law
form of expansion around the critical point.

momentum, torque, and force etc in the electromagnetic and gravitational
fields. Applying the octonionic representation enables one single definition of
angular momentum (or torque, force) to combine some physics contents, which
were considered to be independent of each other in the past. J. C. Maxwell used
simultaneously two methods, the vector terminology and quaternion analysis, to
depict the electromagnetic theory. It motivates the paper to introduce the
quaternion space into the field theory, describing the physical feature of
electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The spaces of two fields can be
chosen as the quaternion spaces, while the coordinate component of quaternion
space is able to be the complex number. The quaternion space of electromagnetic
field is independent of that of gravitational field. These two quaternion
spaces may compose one octonion space. Contrarily, one octonion space can be
separated into two subspaces, the quaternion space and S-quaternion space. In
the quaternion space, it is able to infer the field potential, field strength,
field source, angular momentum, torque, and force etc in the gravitational
field. In the S-quaternion space, it is capable of deducing the field
potential, field strength, field source, current continuity equation, and
electric (or magnetic) dipolar moment etc in the electromagnetic field. The
results reveal that the quaternion space is appropriate to describe the
gravitational features, including the torque, force, and mass continuity
equation etc. The S-quaternion space is proper to depict the electromagnetic
features, including the dipolar moment and current continuity equation etc. In
case the field strength is weak enough, the force and the continuity equation
etc can be respectively reduced to that in the classical field theory.
