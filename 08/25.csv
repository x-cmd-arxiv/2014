experimental setups is found to be sensitive to nuclear density differences
between projectiles. In this article, the IBD probe is used to study the
density variation in neutron-rich $^{48}$Ca. By adjusting diffuseness in the
neutron density distribution, three different neutron density distributions of
$^{48}$Ca are obtained. The yields of fragments in the 80$A$ MeV $^{40, 48}$Ca
+ $^{12}$C reactions are calculated by using a modified statistical
abrasion-ablation model. It is found that the IBD results obtained from the
prefragments are sensitive to the density distribution of the projectile, while
the IBD results from the final fragments are less sensitive to the density
distribution of the projectile.

time-dependent lead-lag relationship between two stochastic time series. This
novel version of the previously introduced TOP method alleviates some
inconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant
with respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This
means that, if `$X$ comes before $Y$', this transforms into `$Y$ comes before
$X$' under a time reversal. We show that previously proposed bootstrap test
lacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there
is no lead-lag correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel
tests. The first the free energy p-value $\rho$ criterion quantifies the
probability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random time
series with similar characteristics except for the lead-lag information. The
second self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to be
significant, synchronizing the two time series using the time varying lead-lag
path should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform
intensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations.
Finally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time dependent
lead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom
(UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. The TOPS approach stresses the
importance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of
information or policies may have drastically different impacts and
developments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical
conditions. This study reinforces the view that the hypothesis of statistical
stationarity is highly questionable.

zero net angular momentum which tends to free-fall towards the disc center. We
discuss high-resolution axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of a viscous
counter-rotating disc for cases where the two components are vertically

$\alpha-$viscosity including all terms in the viscous stress tensor. For the
vertically separated components a shear layer forms between them. The middle of
this layer free-falls to the disk center. The accretion rates are increased by
factors $\sim 10^2-10^4$ over that of a conventional disc rotating in one
direction with the same viscosity. The vertical width of the shear layer and
the accretion rate are strongly dependent on the viscosity and the mass
fraction of the counter-rotating gas. In the case of radially separated
components where the inner disc co-rotates and the outer disc rotates in the
opposite direction, a gap between the two components opens and closes
quasi-periodically. The accretion rates are $\gtrsim 25$ times larger than

for the thickness dependence of the magnetic anisotropy constants and resonance

thin films dominated by thickness dependent anisotropies, yielding both a

matched filter to extract cluster mass. The approach is well-suited for
statistical analyses that bin clusters according to other mass proxies. We find
that current experiments, such as Planck, the South Pole Telescope and the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope, can practically implement such a statistical
methodology, and that future experiments will reach sensitivities sufficient
for individual measurements of massive systems. As illustration, we use
simulations of Planck observations to demonstrate that it is possible to
constrain the mass scale of a set of 62 massive clusters with prior information
from X-ray observations, similar to the published Planck ESZ-XMM sample. We
examine the effect of the thermal (tSZ) and kinetic (kSZ) Sunyaev-Zeldovich

The stronger tSZ signal, however, must be actively removed from the CMB maps by
component separation techniques prior to reconstruction of the gravitational
potential. Our study of two such methods highlights the importance of broad
frequency coverage for this purpose. A companion paper presents application to

acoustic radiation force on one given particle involving the scattered waves
from the other particles. The particles, either compressible liquid droplets or
elastic microspheres, are considered to be much smaller than the acoustic
wavelength. In this so-called Rayleigh limit, the acoustic interaction forces

applied to studies of the acoustic interaction force on a particle suspension

stripping to resonance states based on the surface integral formalism of
Kadyrov et al. [Ann. Phys. 324, 1516 (2009)] and continuum-discretized coupled
channels (CDCC).
  First we demonstrate how the surface integral formalism works in the
three-body model and then we consider a more realistic problem in which a
composite structure of target nuclei is taken via optical potentials. We
explore different choices of channel wave functions and transition operators
and show that a conventional CDCC volume matrix element can be written in terms
of a surface-integral matrix element, which is peripheral, and an auxiliary
matrix element, which determines the contribution of the nuclear interior over
the variable $r_{nA}$. This auxiliary matrix element appears due to the
inconsistency in treating of the $n-A$ potential: this potential should be real
in the final state to support bound states or resonance scattering and complex
in the initial state to describe $n-A$ scattering. Our main result is
formulation of the theory of the stripping to resonance states using the prior
form of the surface integral formalism and CDCC method. It is demonstrated that
the conventional CDCC volume matrix element coincides with the surface matrix
element, which converges for the stripping to the resonance state. Also the
surface representation (over the variable $r_{nA}$ of the stripping matrix
element enhances the peripheral part of the amplitude although the internal
contribution doesn't disappear and increases with increase of the deuteron
energy. We present calculations corroborating our findings for both stripping
to the bound state and the resonance.

rapid ambipolar diffusion that leads to localized supercritical regions that
can collapse. Here, we employ non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations
including ambipolar diffusion for gravitationally stratified sheets threaded by
vertical magnetic fields. One of the horizontal dimensions is eliminated,
resulting in a simpler two-dimensional simulation that can clarify the basic
process of accelerated core formation. A parameter study of simulations shows
that the core formation time is inversely proportional to the square of the
flow speed when the flow speed is greater than the Alfv\'en speed. We find a
semi-analytical formula that explains this numerical result. The formula also
predicts that the core formation time is about three times shorter than that
with no turbulence, when the turbulent speed is comparable to the Alfv\'en
speed.

was identified from around $\sim$ 20% of stars. Herschel's high angular
resolution ($\sim$ 7"" FWHM at 100 $\mu$m) provided the capacity for resolving
debris belts around nearby stars with radial extents comparable to the solar
system (50 to 100 au). As part of the DUNES and DEBRIS surveys, we obtained
observations of three debris disc stars, HIP 22263 (HD 30495), HIP 62207 (HD

characterize the capacity of the models to reproduce the disc parameters based

Channel exist. Random Linear Codes (RLC), where redundancy packets consist of
random linear combinations of source packets over a certain finite field, are a
simple yet efficient coding technique, for instance massively used for Network
Coding applications. However the price to pay is a high encoding and decoding
complexity, especially when working on $GF(2^8)$, which seriously limits the
number of packets in the encoding window. On the opposite, structured block
codes have been designed for situations where the set of source packets is
known in advance, for instance with file transfer applications. Here the
encoding and decoding complexity is controlled, even for huge block sizes,
thanks to the sparse nature of the code and advanced decoding techniques that
exploit this sparseness (e.g., Structured Gaussian Elimination). But their
design also prevents their use in convolutional use-cases featuring an encoding
window that slides over a continuous set of incoming packets.
  In this work we try to bridge the gap between these two code classes,
bringing some structure to RLC codes in order to enlarge the use-cases where
they can be efficiently used: in convolutional mode (as any RLC code), but also
in block mode with either tiny, medium or large block sizes. We also
demonstrate how to design compact signaling for these codes (for
encoder/decoder synchronization), which is an essential practical aspect.

conventional way is to compress first and then encrypt the compressed data.
This separation approach proves to be optimal. In certain applications where
sensitive information should be protected as early as possible, it is
preferable to perform encryption first and then compress the encrypted data,
which leads to the concept of the reversed system. Johnson et al. proposed an
achievability scheme for the reversed system that has a modulo-sum encryption
followed by a compression using Wyner-Ziv distributed source coding with side
information. However, this reversed system performs worse than the conventional
system in the sense that it requires more compression rate and secrecy key
rate. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme for the reverse
system where encryption is conducted by a permutation cipher and then the
encrypted data is compressed using the optimal rate-distortion code. The
proposed scheme can achieve the optimal compression rate and secret key rate,
and therefore shows that reversing the order of encryption and compression does
not necessarily compromise the performance of an encryption-compression system.
The proposed system attains weak secrecy, and we show that the information
leakage is mainly contributed by the type information of the sequence, which is
not concealed by the permutation cipher. Given the type of the sequence, the
rest of the information leakage vanishes exponentially.

to estimate the soft decoding performance, which avoids extensive simulations.
Also, a simulation-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the maximum likelihood
decoding performance of QR codes of lengths within 100. Moreover, four
important theorems are proposed to predict the performance of the hard decoding
and the maximum-likelihood decoding in which they can explore some internal
properties of QR codes. It is shown that such four theorems can be applied to
the QR codes with lengths less than 100 for predicting the decoding
performance. In contrast, they can be straightforwardly generalized to longer
QR codes. The result is never seen in the literature, to our knowledge.
Simulation results show that the estimated hard decoding performance is very
accurate in the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, whereas the derived
upper bounds of the maximum likelihood decoding are only tight for moderate to
high SNR regions. For each of the considered QR codes, the soft decoding is
approximately 1.5 dB better than the hard decoding. By using powerful redundant
parity-check cuts, the linear programming-based decoding algorithm, i.e., the
ACG-ALP decoding algorithm performs very well for any QR code. Sometimes, it is
even superior to the Chase-based soft decoding algorithm significantly, and
hence is only a few tenths of dB away from the maximum likelihood decoding.

respective fields, are highly reusable and may be subjected to formal analysis.

be analyzed using formal methods, graphically edited, and deployed to various

easily. This article outlines meta-metrics as one of todays challenges for the
software engineering of these cyber-physical systems to provide guidance during
the system development: For example, unstable results of simulation test-runs
over the vehicle functions revision history are elaborated as an indicating
metric where to focus on with real or further virtual test-runs; furthermore,
varying acting time points for the same virtual traffic situation are
indicating problems with the reliability to interpret the specific situation.

constant C = 0.75cm3K/mole V, theta CW = -370 K. We have observed a splitting
between the zero field cooled ZFC and field cooled FC susceptibility curves
below a temperature Tirr of about 6.3 K. The value of the 'frustration

frustrated. From the ac susceptibility measurements we find a logarithmic
variation of freezing temperature (Tf ) with frequency attesting to the
formation of a spin glass below Tf . However, the value of the characteristic
frequency obtained from the Vogel-Fulcher fit suggests that the ground state is
closer to a cluster glass rather than a conventional spin glass. We explored
further consequences of the spin glass behavior and observed aging phenomena
and memory effect (both in ZFC and FC). We found that a positive temperature
cycle erases the memory, as predicted by the hierarchical model. From the heat
capacity CP data, a hump-like anomaly was observed in CP /T at about 3.75 K.
Below this temperature the magnetic heat capacity shows a nearly linear

electrons. Graphene is irradiated by an electron beam with energy lower than 80
eV. After e-beam irradiation, it is found that the D peak, I(D), appears in the
Raman spectrum, indicating defect formation in graphene. The evolution of
I(D)/I(G) follows the amorphization trajectory with increasing irradiation
dose, indicating that graphene goes through a transformation from
microcrystalline to nanocrystalline and then further to amorphous carbon.
Further, irradiation of graphene with increased water partial pressure does not
significantly change the Raman spectra, which suggests that, in the extremely
low energy range, e-beam induced chemical reactions between residual water and
graphene is not the dominant mechanism driving defect formation in graphene.
Single layer graphene, partially suspended over holes was irradiated with EUV
radiation. By comparing with the Raman results from e-beam irradiation, it is
concluded that the photoelectrons, especially those from the valence band,
contribute to defect formation in graphene during irradiation.

and the imaginary-time method. An intuitive model for the dynamics is developed
which describes the ionization process within a nonadiabatic tunneling picture
with a coordinate dependent electron energy during the under-the-barrier
motion. The nonadiabatic effects in the elliptically polarized laser field
induce a transversal momentum shift of the tunneled electron wave packet at the
tunnel exit, a delayed appearance in the continuum as well as a shift of the
tunneling exit towards the ionic core. The latter significantly modifies the
Coulomb focusing during the electron excursion in the laser field after exiting
the ionization tunnel. We show that nonadiabatic effects are especially large
when the Coulomb field of the ionic core is taken into account during the

mechanism. The disc-locking prevents the star to spin its rotation up, and its
timescale depends on the disc lifetime. Some mechanisms can significantly
shorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier
than other stars. In the present study, we aim to investigate how the
properties of the circumstellar environment can shorten the disc lifetime. We
have identified a few multiple stellar systems, composed of stars with similar
masses, which belong to associations with a known age. Since all parameters
that are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of
environment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all
components, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods
can only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries
allowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while
high-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\sin{i}$
and chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ
significantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates
faster than the more distant and isolated component A. We can ascribe the
rotation period difference to either different initial rotation periods or
different disc-locking phases arising from the presence of the close companion
C. In the specific case of BD$-$21 1074, the second scenario seems to be more
favored. In our hypothesis of different disc-locking phase, any planet orbiting
this star is likely formed very rapidly owing to a gravitational instability
mechanism, rather than core accretion. Only a large difference of initial
rotation periods alone could account for the observed period difference,

level spacing statistics for an ensemble of random matrices with interesting
features. It is invariant under the standard symmetry groups (orthogonal and
unitary) and yet the interaction between eigenvalues is not Vandermondian. The
ensemble contains real symmetric or complex hermitian matrices $\mathbf{S}$ of
the form $\mathbf{S}=\sum_{i=1}^M \langle \mathbf{O}_i
\mathbf{D}_i\mathbf{O}_i^{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$ or $\mathbf{S}=\sum_{i=1}^M

diagonal matrices
$\mathbf{D}_i=\mathrm{diag}\{\lambda_1^{(i)},\ldots,\lambda_N^{(i)}\}$ are
constructed from real eigenvalues drawn \emph{independently} from distributions
$p^{(i)}(x)$, while the matrices $\mathbf{O}_i$ and $\mathbf{U}_i$ are all
orthogonal or unitary. The average $\langle\cdot\rangle$ is simultaneously
performed over the symmetry group and the joint distribution of
$\{\lambda_j^{(i)}\}$. We focus on the limits i.) $N\to\infty$ and ii.)
$M\to\infty$, with $N=2$. In the limit i.), the resulting sum $\mathbf{S}$
develops level repulsion even though the original matrices do not feature it,
and classical RMT universality is restored asymptotically. In the limit ii.)
the spacing distribution attains scaling forms that are computed exactly: for
the orthogonal case, we recover the $\beta=1$ Wigner's surmise, while for the
unitary case an entirely new universal distribution is obtained. Our results
allow to probe analytically the microscopic statistics of the sum of random
matrices that become asymptotically free. We also give an interpretation of
this model in terms of radial random walks in a matrix space. The analytical
results are corroborated by numerical simulations.

certain number and type of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations. The
population dynamics of such sequential acquisition of (epi)genetic alterations
has been the topic of much investigation. The phenomenon of stochastic
tunneling, where an intermediate mutant in a sequence does not reach fixation
in a population before generating a double mutant, has been studied using a
variety of computational and mathematical methods. However, the field still
lacks a comprehensive analytical description since theoretical predictions of
fixation times are only available for cases in which the second mutant is
advantageous. Here, we study stochastic tunneling in a Moran model. Analyzing
the deterministic dynamics of large populations we systematically identify the
parameter regimes captured by existing approaches. Our analysis also reveals
fitness landscapes and mutation rates for which finite populations are found in
long-lived metastable states. These are landscapes in which the final mutant is
not the most advantageous in the sequence, and resulting metastable states are
a consequence of a mutation-selection balance. The escape from these states is
driven by intrinsic noise, and their location affects the probability of
tunneling. Existing methods no longer apply. In these regimes it is the escape
from the metastable states that is the key bottleneck; fixation is no longer
limited by the emergence of a successful mutant lineage. We used the so-called
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to compute fixation times in these parameter
regimes, successfully validated by stochastic simulations. Our work fills a gap
left by previous approaches and provides a more comprehensive description of
the acquisition of multiple mutations in populations of somatic cells.

plant dynamics. In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to
synthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control
systems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of
the slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we
know how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how
to design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is
modeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to
generate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the
sampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the
stability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two
transmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time
for the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in
practice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that
existing event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed
systems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second,
we propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered
results in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined
amount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the
advantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic
stability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum
inter-transmission interval. We believe that this technique is of its own
interest independently of the two-time scale nature of the addressed problem.
The results are shown to be applicable to a class of globally Lipschitz
systems.

problem is to ensure the existence of a minimum amount of time between two

by combining techniques from event-triggered and time-triggered control. The
idea is to turn on the event-triggering mechanism only after a fixed amount of
time has elapsed since the last transmission. This time is computed based on
results on the stabilization of time-driven sampled-data systems. The overall
strategy ensures an asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system.

and Fernandes-Granda states that a continuous, sparse frequency spectrum can be
recovered with infinite precision via a (convex) atomic norm technique given a
set of uniform time-space samples. This theory was then extended to the cases
of partial/compressive samples and/or multiple measurement vectors via atomic
norm minimization (ANM), known as off-grid/continuous compressed sensing (CCS).
However, a major problem of existing atomic norm methods is that the
frequencies can be recovered only if they are sufficiently separated,
prohibiting commonly known high resolution. In this paper, a novel (nonconvex)
sparse metric is proposed that promotes sparsity to a greater extent than the
atomic norm. Using this metric an optimization problem is formulated and a
locally convergent iterative algorithm is implemented. The algorithm
iteratively carries out ANM with a sound reweighting strategy which enhances
sparsity and resolution, and is termed as reweighted atomic-norm minimization
(RAM). Extensive numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the
advantageous performance of RAM with application to direction of arrival (DOA)
estimation.

To date,
there are still no firm constraints on its total luminosity, due to the
difficulty of disentangling Hercules bona-fide stars from the severe Galactic
field contamination. In order to better constrain Hercules properties we aim at
removing foreground and background contaminants in the galaxy field using the
proper motions of the Milky Way stars and the colour-colour diagram. We have
obtained images of Hercules in the rSloan, BBessel and Uspec bands with the
Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and LBC-BIN mode capabilities. The rSloan new
data-set combined with data from the LBT archive span a time baseline of about
5 yr, allowing us to measure for the first time proper motions of stars in the
Hercules direction. The Uspec data along with existing LBT photometry allowed
us to use colour-colour diagram to further remove the field contamination.
Thanks to a highly-accurate procedure to derive the rSloan-filter geometric
distortion solution for the LBC-red, we were able to measure stellar relative
proper motions to a precision of better than 5 mas yr^-1 down to rSloan=22 mag
and disentangle a significant fraction (\>90\%) of Milky Way contaminants. We
ended up with a sample of 528 sources distributed over a large portion of the
galaxy body (0.12 deg^2). Of these sources, 171 turned out to be background
galaxies and additional foreground stars, from the analysis of the Uspec -
BBessel vs. BBessel - rSloan colour-colour diagram. This leaves us with a
sample of 357 likely members of the Hercules UFD. We compared the cleaned
colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) with evolutionary models and synthetic CMDs,
confirming the presence in Hercules of an old population (t=12\pm 2 Gyr), with
a wide spread in metallicity (-3.3\<[Fe/H]\<-1.8).

red-supergiant and intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch populations. We
report the identification of 3 Milky Way carbon-rich dwarf stars, probably
belonging to the thin disk, and pointing to the high incidence of this class at
low Galactic latitudes. A sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts a
faint, red extension of the well-defined SagDIG carbon-rich sequence. The
origin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting the
uncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. SagDIG is also a gas-rich
galaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (HI-hole), which
is offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. We nonetheless
investigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motion
cleaned stellar populations within the HI-hole with appropriately selected
comparison regions, having higher HI densities external to the hole. The
comparison shows no significant differences. In particular, the centre of the
HI-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400
Myr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. We conclude
that there is no convincing evidence that the SagDIG HI-hole is the result of
stellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gas
are the most likely mechanism for its formation.

binary, that is essential for accuracy to fourth post-Newtonian order, if both
components in the binary are spinning rapidly, has been recently derived
independently via the ADM Hamiltonian and the Effective Field Theory
approaches, using different gauges and variables. Here we show the complete
physical equivalence of the two results, thereby we first prove the equivalence
of the ADM Hamiltonian and the Effective Field Theory approaches at
next-to-next-to-leading order with the inclusion of spins. The main difficulty
in the spinning sectors, which also prescribes the manner in which the
comparison of the two results is tackled here, is the existence of redundant
unphysical spin degrees of freedom, associated with the spin gauge choice of a
point within the extended spinning object for its representative worldline.
After gauge fixing and eliminating the unphysical degrees of freedom of the
spin and its conjugate at the level of the action, we arrive at curved
spacetime generalizations of the Newton-Wigner variables in closed form, which
can also be used to obtain further Hamiltonians, based on an Effective Field
Theory formulation and computation. Finally, we make use of our validated
result to provide gauge invariant relations among the binding energy, angular
momentum, and orbital frequency of an inspiralling binary with generic compact
spinning components to fourth post-Newtonian order, including all known sectors

galaxies observed by CALIFA, we present the 2D kinematic view of the 177
galaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. After removing the stellar
contribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radial
velocity of the dominant gaseous component. The main kinematic parameters were
directly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internal
motions. Evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with different
kinematics were detected by using [OIII] profiles. Most objects in the sample
show regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarely
consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35% of the objects present
evidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers larger
than the original spaxel radii. Only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibit
kinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of the
velocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclear
activity. Early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematic
misaligments. There is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profiles
suggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components at
different distances from the nucleus. This work constitutes the first
determination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in the
CALIFA survey. The derived velocity fields, the reported kinematic
peculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseous
components might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies for
specific studies.

clear that both parametrizations are mathematically equivalent at the level of
the classical action, the question about their mathematical equivalence at the
quantum level as well as their physical equivalence is still a matter of debate
in cosmology. We analyze whether the mathematical equivalence still holds when
the first quantum corrections are taken into account. We explicitly calculate
the one-loop divergences in both parametrizations by using the generalized
Schwinger-DeWitt algorithm and compare both results. We find that the quantum
corrections do not coincide off shell and hence induce an off shell dependence
on the parametrization. According to the equivalence theorem, the one-loop
divergences should however coincide on shell. For a cosmological background, we
show explicitly that the on shell equivalence is indeed realized by a
nontrivial cancellation.

distributed storage systems with an exact (table-based) repair process that is
also uncoded, i.e., upon failure, a node is regenerated by simply downloading
packets from the surviving nodes. In our work, we present constructions of FR
codes based on Steiner systems and resolvable combinatorial designs such as
affine geometries, Hadamard designs and mutually orthogonal Latin squares. The
failure resilience of our codes can be varied in a simple manner. We construct
codes with normalized repair bandwidth ($\beta$) strictly larger than one;
these cannot be obtained trivially from codes with $\beta = 1$. Furthermore, we
present the Kronecker product technique for generating new codes from existing
ones and elaborate on their properties. FR codes with locality are those where
the repair degree is smaller than the number of nodes contacted for
reconstructing the stored file. For these codes we establish a tradeoff between
the local repair property and failure resilience and construct codes that meet
this tradeoff. Much of prior work only provided lower bounds on the FR code
rate. In our work, for most of our constructions we determine the code rate for
certain parameter ranges.

\emph{bursty}, with large -- order of magnitude -- changes in the star
formation rate on timescales similar to O-star lifetimes. As a result, the
standard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly
varying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydro-dynamical
simulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and
interpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in
future surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change
rapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing
continuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing UV continuum. Therefore,
flux limited surveys are highly biased toward selecting galaxies in the
\emph{burst} phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf
galaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a $\log_{10}[\nu
L_{\nu}(1500{\rm \AA})/L_{{\rm H}\alpha}]>2.5$ implies a very recent quenching
of star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating
star formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly
higher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation
of nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum
detections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on
continuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen
Balmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give
the false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.

satellite investigating if there is any significant deviation from cosmological
isotropy. We look for differences in the spectrum between two opposite
hemispheres and also for dipolar modulations. We propose a new way to avoid
biases due to partial-sky coverage by producing a mask symmetrized in antipodal
directions, in addition to the standard smoothing procedure. We also properly
take into account both Doppler and aberration effects due to our peculiar
velocity and the anisotropy of the noise, since these effects induce a
significant hemispherical asymmetry. We are thus able to probe scales all the
way to ell = 2000. After such treatment we find no evidence for significant
hemispherical anomalies (i.e. deviations are less than 1.5 sigma when summing
over all scales). Although among the larger scales there are sometimes higher
discrepancies, these are always less than 3 sigma. We also find results on a
dipolar modulation of the power spectrum. Along the hemispheres aligned with
the most asymmetric direction for 2 <= ell <= 2000 we find a 3.3 sigma
discrepancy when comparing to simulations. However, if we do not restrict
ourselves to Planck's maximal asymmetry axis, which can only be known a
posteriori, and compare Planck data with the modulation of simulations along
their respective maximal asymmetry directions, the discrepancy goes down to
less than 1 sigma (with, again, almost 3 sigma discrepancies in some low-ell
modes). We thus conclude that no significant power asymmetries seem to be
present in the full data set. Interestingly, without proper removal of Doppler
and aberration effects one would find spurious anomalies at high ell, between 3
sigma and 5 sigma. Even when considering only ell < 600 we find that the boost
is non-negligible and alleviates the discrepancy by roughly half-sigma.

study of tangents to the subsolutions in these theories, a topic inspired by
the results of Kiselman in the classical plurisubharmonic case. Fundamental to
this study is a new invariant of the equation, called the ""Riesz
characteristic"", which governs asymptotic structures. The existence of tangents
to subsolutions is established in general, as is the existence of an upper
semi-continuous density function. Two theorems establishing the strong
uniqueness of tangents (which means every tangent is a Riesz kernel) are
proved. They cover all O(n)-invariant convex cone equations and their complex
and quaternionic analogues, with the exception of the homogeneous
Monge-Amp\`ere equations, where uniqueness fails. They also cover a large class
of geometrically defined subequations which includes those coming from
calibrations. A discreteness result for the sets where the density is $\geq c >
0$ is also established in any case where strong uniqueness holds. A further
result (which is sharp) asserts the H\""older continuity of subsolutions when
the Riesz characteristic p satisfies $1 \leq p < 2$. Many explicit examples are
examined.
  The second part of this paper is devoted to the ""geometric cases"". A
Homogeneity Theorem and a Second Strong Uniqueness Theorem are proved, and the

a sequence of sparse regression estimates: it starts with all coefficients
equal to zero, and iteratively updates the coefficient (by a small amount
$\epsilon$) of the variable that achieves the maximal absolute inner product
with the current residual. This procedure has an interesting connection to the
lasso: under some conditions, it is known that the sequence of forward
stagewise estimates exactly coincides with the lasso path, as the step size
$\epsilon$ goes to zero. Furthermore, essentially the same equivalence holds
outside of least squares regression, with the minimization of a differentiable
convex loss function subject to an $\ell_1$ norm constraint (the stagewise
algorithm now updates the coefficient corresponding to the maximal absolute
component of the gradient).
  Even when they do not match their $\ell_1$-constrained analogues, stagewise
estimates provide a useful approximation, and are computationally appealing.
Their success in sparse modeling motivates the question: can a simple,
effective strategy like forward stagewise be applied more broadly in other
regularization settings, beyond the $\ell_1$ norm and sparsity? The current
paper is an attempt to do just this. We present a general framework for
stagewise estimation, which yields fast algorithms for problems such as
group-structured learning, matrix completion, image denoising, and more.

  globular proteins","6 figures in the main text",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Protein conformational transitions, which are essential for function, may be
driven either by entropy or enthalpy when molecular systems comprising solute
and solvent molecules are the focus. Revealing thermodynamic origin of a given
molecular process is an important but difficult task, and general principles
governing protein conformational distributions remain elusive. Here we
demonstrate that when protein molecules are taken as thermodynamic systems and
solvents being treated as the environment, conformational entropy is an
excellent proxy for free energy and is sufficient to explain protein
conformational distributions. Specifically, by defining each unique combination
of side chain torsional state as a conformer, the population distribution (or
free energy) on an arbitrarily given order parameter is approximately a linear
function of conformational entropy. Additionally, span of various microscopic
potential energy terms is observed to be highly correlated with both
conformational entropy and free energy. Presently widely utilized free energy
proxies, including minimum potential energy, average potential energy terms by
themselves or in combination with vibrational entropy\cite, are found to
correlate with free energy rather poorly. Therefore, our findings provide a
fundamentally new theoretical base for development of significantly more
reliable and efficient next generation computational tools, where the number of
available conformers,rather than poential energy of microscopic configurations,
is the central focus. We anticipate that many related research fields,
including structure based drug design and discovery, protein design, docking
and prediction of general intermolecular interactions involving proteins, are
expected to benefit greatly.

paper, we address the problem of diffusion of innovations over multiplex social
networks where the neighbours of a person belong to one or multiple networks
(or layers) such as friends, families, or colleagues. To this end, we
generalise one of the basic game-theoretic diffusion models, called networked
coordination game, for multiplex networks. We present analytical results for
this extended model and validate them through a simulation study, finding among
other properties a lower bound for the success of an innovation.While simple
and leading to intuitively understandable results, to the best of our knowledge
this is the first extension of a game-theoretic innovation diffusion model for
multiplex networks and as such it provides a basic framework to study more
sophisticated innovation dynamics.

approximately two-thirds of outflows, with multiple CIV absorbers present,
absorbers are line-locked at the 500 km/s velocity separation of the CIV
absorber doublet; appearing as 'triplets' in the quasar spectra. Line-locking
is an observational signature of radiative line driving in outflowing material,
where the successive shielding of 'clouds' of material in the outflow locks the
clouds together in outflow velocity. Line-locked absorbers are seen in both
broad absorption line quasars (BALs) and non-BAL quasars with comparable
frequencies and with velocities out to at least 20000 km/s. There are no
detectable differences in the absorber properties and the dust content of
single CIV doublets and line-locked CIV doublets. The gas associated with both
single and line-locked CIV absorption systems includes material with a wide
range of ionization potential (14-138 eV). Both single and line-locked CIV
absorber systems show strong systematic trends in their ionization as a
function of outflow velocity, with ionization decreasing rapidly with
increasing outflow velocity. Initial simulations, employing CLOUDY, demonstrate
that a rich spectrum of line-locked signals at various velocities may be
expected due to significant opacities from resonance lines of Li-, He- and
H-like ions of O, C and N, along with contributions from HeII and HI resonance
lines. The simulations confirm that line driving can be the dominant

which the papers (cited as references) are included in WoS as linked database
