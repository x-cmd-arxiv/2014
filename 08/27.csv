the two different phases of massive or vanishing charge fluctuations between
the two occupancies at low temperature, which are equivalent with the

emission, which is stronger for more rapidly rotating stars. This relation is
often interpreted in terms of the Rossby number, i.e., the ratio of rotation
period to convective overturn time. We reconsider this interpretation on the
basis of the observed X-ray emission and rotation periods of 821 stars with
masses below 1.4 Msun. A generalized analysis of the relation between X-ray
luminosity normalized by bolometric luminosity, L_X/L_bol, and combinations of
rotational period, P, and stellar radius, R, shows that the Rossby formulation
does not provide the solution with minimal scatter. Instead, we find that the
relation L_X/L_bol ~ P^{-2}R^{-4} optimally describes the non-saturated
fraction of the stars. This relation is equivalent to L_X ~ P^{-2}, indicating
that the rotation period alone determines the total X-ray emission. Since L_X
is directly related to the magnetic flux at the stellar surface, this means
that the surface flux is determined solely by the star's rotation and is
independent of other stellar parameters. While a formulation in terms of a
Rossby number would be consistent with these results if the convective overturn
time scales exactly as L_bol^{-1/2}, our generalized approach emphasizes the
need to test a broader range of mechanisms for dynamo action in cool stars.

implicit hard sphere solvent is derived from first principles for a system of
monomers that interact via discontinuous potentials designed to account for
local structure and bonding in a coarse-grained sense. The model is based on
the assumption that the implicit solvent interacts on a fast time scale with
the monomers of the chain compared to the time scale for structural
rearrangements of the chain and provides sufficient friction so that the motion
of monomers is governed by the Smoluchowski equation. A microscopic theory for
the dynamics of the system is developed that reduces to a Markovian model of
the kinetics under well-defined conditions. Microscopic expressions for the
rate constants that appear in the Markov state model are analyzed and expressed
in terms of a temperature-dependent linear combination of escape rates that
themselves are independent of temperature. The Markov model is studied by
analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix of transition rates,
and the equilibration process for a simple helix-forming system from an
ensemble of initially extended configurations to mainly folded configurations
is investigated as a function of temperature for a number of different chain
lengths. For short chains, the relaxation is primarily single-exponential and
becomes independent of temperature in the low-temperature regime. The profile
is more complicated for longer chains, where multi-exponential relaxation
behavior is seen at intermediate temperatures followed by a low temperature
regime in which the folding becomes rapid and single exponential. It is
demonstrated that the behavior of the equilibration profile as the temperature
is lowered can be understood in terms of the number of relaxation modes or
``folding pathways'' that contribute to the evolution of the state populations.

applications to a number of rank/select problems for integer keys and strings.
  Given a string of length n over an alphabet of size $\sigma\leq n$, our
method builds the wavelet tree in $O(n \log \sigma/ \sqrt{\log{n}})$ time,
improving upon the state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor of $\sqrt{\log n}$.
As a consequence, given an array of n integers we can construct in $O(n
\sqrt{\log n})$ time a data structure consisting of $O(n)$ machine words and
capable of answering rank/select queries for the subranges of the array in
$O(\log n / \log \log n)$ time. This is a $\log \log n$-factor improvement in
query time compared to Chan and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and a $\sqrt{\log n}$-factor
improvement in construction time compared to Brodal et al.
  Next, we switch to stringological context and propose a novel notion of
wavelet suffix trees. For a string w of length n, this data structure occupies
$O(n)$ words, takes $O(n \sqrt{\log n})$ time to construct, and simultaneously
captures the combinatorial structure of substrings of w while enabling
efficient top-down traversal and binary search. In particular, with a wavelet
suffix tree we are able to answer in $O(\log |x|)$ time the following two
natural analogues of rank/select queries for suffixes of substrings: for
substrings x and y of w count the number of suffixes of x that are
lexicographically smaller than y, and for a substring x of w and an integer k,
find the k-th lexicographically smallest suffix of x.
  We further show that wavelet suffix trees allow to compute a
run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform of a substring x of w in $O(s \log
|x|)$ time, where s denotes the length of the resulting run-length encoding.
This answers a question by Cormode and Muthukrishnan, who considered an
analogous problem for Lempel-Ziv compression.

In recent papers HP1 binding to nucleosomal arrays was measured in vitro and
interpreted in terms of nearest-neighbor cooperative binding. This mode of
chromatin interactions could lead to spreading of HP1 along the nucleosome
chain. Here, we reanalyzed previous data by representing the nucleosome chain
as a one-dimensional binding lattice, and show how the experimental HP1 binding
isotherms can be explained by a simpler model without cooperative interactions
between neighboring HP1 dimers. Based on these calculations and spatial models
of dinucleosomes and nucleosome chains, we propose that binding stoichiometry
is dependent of the nucleosome repeat length (NRL) rather than protein
interactions between HP1 dimers. According to our calculations, more open
nucleosome arrays with long DNA linkers are characterized by a larger number of
binding sites in comparison to chains with short NRL. Furthermore, we
demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulations that the NRL dependent folding of the
nucleosome chain can induce allosteric changes of HP1 binding sites. Thus, HP1
chromatin interactions can be modulated by the change of binding stoichiometry
and type of binding to condensed (methylated) and non-condensed (unmethylated)
nucleosome arrays in the absence of direct interactions between HP1 dimers.

We are able to show that without interacting in any way with the light quantum
(or quanta) expected to behave ""wave-like"", interference fringes can be lost by
simply gaining (or having the potential to gain) the which-path knowledge.
Erasing this information may revive the interference fringes. Delayed choice
can be added, arriving to an experiment in line with Wheeler's original
proposal. We also show that ignorance is not always synonym with having the
interference fringes. The often-invoked ""collapse of the wavefunction"" is found
to be a non-necessary ingredient to describe our experiments.

transverse propagator for the massless fields. The transverse propagator for
antipodal point separation is nonzero and negative, but vanishes in the flat
space-time limit (Ricci scalar going to zero). The longitudinal part of the
massive propagator diverges as $1/m^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the field. The
longitudinal part of the massless propagator is gauge dependent and in

frequency $(\omega_b)$, without considering the adiabatic compressibility
condition of OB approach. This NAB expression reduces to the known
Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) expression under adiabatic compressibility condition.
The NAB expression of $\omega_b$ is found to be modified from its OB
counterpart such that the stabilizing adiabatic lapse rate in OB expression is
replaced by a modified non-adiabatic lapse rate given as $\left(\eta - 1
\right)$ times the auto-convective lapse rate. Here $\eta$ is the ratio of
hydrostatic density to the total density. We perform numerical experiments of
CI for the conditionally stable troposphere i.e for the troposphere that has
the environmental lapse rate negative but smaller than the adiabatic lapse
rate. A novel feature of the present study is that the CI grows under proposed
NAB approach in spite the conditionally stable condition and remains suppressed
under OB approach. The present study, thus, proposes an alternative NAB
approach for the positive growth of the CI in the dry troposphere for which the
CI is conditionally stable under OB approach.

of the study, there will be at least one treatment for which the investigators
have a strong belief that it is better than control, or else they have a strong
belief that none of the experimental treatments are substantially better than
control. This criterion bears a direct relationship with conventional
frequentist power requirements, while allowing prior opinion to feature in the
analysis with a consequent reduction in sample size. If it is concluded that at
least one of the experimental treatments shows promise, then it is envisaged
that one or more of these promising treatments will be developed further in a
definitive phase III trial. The approach is developed in the context of
normally distributed responses sharing a common standard deviation regardless
of treatment. To begin with, the standard deviation will be assumed known when
the sample size is calculated. The final analysis will not rely upon this
assumption, although the intended properties of the design may not be achieved
if the anticipated standard deviation turns out to be inappropriate. Methods
that formally allow for uncertainty about the standard deviation, expressed in
the form of a Bayesian prior, are then explored. Illustrations of the sample
sizes computed from the new method are presented, and comparisons are made with
frequentist methods devised for the same situation.

Line Region (HBLR) and 43 non-HBLR Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2) in the nearby
universe (z<0.04). To compare our findings, we constructed two control samples
that match the redshift and the morphological type distribution of the HBLR and
non-HBLR samples respectively. We used the NED (NASA extragalactic database) to
find all neighboring galaxies within projected radius of 200 kpc/h around each
galaxy, and radial velocity difference delta_u< 500 km/s. We find that, within
a projected radius of at least 150 kpc/h around each Seyfert, the fraction of
non-HBLR Sy2 galaxies with a close companion is significantly higher than that
of their control sample, at the 96% confidence level. Interestingly, the
difference is due to the high frequency of mergers in the non-HBLR sample,
seven versus only one in the control sample, while also they present a high
number of hosts with signs of peculiar morphology. In sharp contrast, the HBLR
sample is consistent with its control sample and furthermore, the number of
their host galaxies that present peculiar morphology, which probably implies
some level of interactions or merging in the past, is the lowest in all four
galaxy samples. Given that the HBLR Seyfert 2 galaxies are essentially Seyfert
1 (Sy1), with their broad line region (BLR) hidden because of the obscuration
by the torus, while the non-HBLR Sy2 sample probably also includes
intrinsically different objects, like ""true"" Sy2s that lack the BLR, and
heavily obscured objects that prohibit even its indirect detection, our results
are discussed within the context of an evolutionary sequence of activity
triggered by close galaxy interactions and merging. We argue that the non-HBLR
Sy2 galaxies may represent different stages of this sequence, possibly the
beginning and the end of the nuclear activity.

secondary eclipse. We detect a secondary eclipse depth of 3.83 +1.10/-1.11 ppm
for a group of 31 sub-Saturn (R < 6 Earth radii) planet candidates with the
greatest potential for a reflected light signature ((R_p/a)^2 > 10 ppm).
Including Kepler-10b in this group increases the depth to 5.08 +0.71/-0.72 ppm.
For a control group with (R_p/a)^2 < 1 ppm, we find a depth of 0.36 +/- 0.37
ppm, consistent with no detection. We also analyze the light curve of
Kepler-10b and find an eclipse depth of 7.08 +/- 1.06 ppm. If the eclipses are
due solely to reflected light, this corresponds to a geometric albedo of 0.22
+/- 0.06 for our group of close-in sub-Saturns, 0.37 +/- 0.05 if including
Kepler-10b in the group, and 0.60 +/- 0.09 for Kepler-10b alone. Including a
thermal emission model does not change the geometric albedo appreciably,
assuming the Bond albedo is 2/3 the geometric albedo. Our result for Kepler-10b
is consistent with previous works. Our result for close-in sub-Saturns shows
that Kepler-10b is unusually reflective, but our analysis is consistent with
the results of Demory (2014) for super-Earths. Our results also indicate that

brightest clusters in the Galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies. If the present Galactic globular clusters formed within
larger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/or
tails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems.
The stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the best
places to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. Here an attempt is
made to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globular
clusters M22 and NGC 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster NGC 3201.
The stellar parameters from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) are used to
identify stars with RAVE metallicities, radial velocities and
elemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties of
the stars in M22, NGC 1851 and NGC 3201. The discovery of RAVE stars that may
be associated with M22 and NGC 1851 are reported, some of which are at
projected distances of ~10 degrees away from the core of these clusters.
Numerous RAVE stars associated with NGC 3201 suggest that either the tidal
radius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound stars
extending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. No further
extra-tidal stars associated with NGC 3201 could be identified. The bright
magnitudes of the RAVE stars make them easy targets for high resolution
follow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging to
solidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidal
debris. In both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding NGC
1851 and NGC 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent with
extended tidal debris from omega Centauri.

interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (SNe Ia-CSM). The precise nature
of the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities
arising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra
offer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes
sufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,
few high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time
optical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe
Ia-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late
epochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass
(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation
state due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show
similarities to the blue ""quasi-continuum"" observed in some core-collapse SNe
Ibn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence
for broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. Similar to the
interacting Type IIn SN 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines are
identified in SN 2012ca, including [S III], [Ar III], [Ar X], [Fe VIII], [Fe
X], and possibly [Fe XI]. The total bolometric energy output does not exceed
10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.
All of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more
consistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although
detailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these
results.

Telescope Array (NTA) project. High-energy neutrinos provide unique and
indisputable evidence for hadronic acceleration. Recently, IceCube has reported
astronomical neutrino candidates in excess of expectation from atmospheric
secondaries, but is limited by the water Cherenkov detection method. A next
generation high-energy neutrino telescope should be capable of establishing
indisputable evidence for cosmic high-energy neutrinos. It should not only have
orders-of-magnitude larger sensitivity, but also enough pointing accuracy to
probe known or unknown astronomical objects, without suffering from atmospheric
secondaries. The proposed installation is a large array of compound eye
stations of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov and fluorescence detectors, with wide
field of view and refined observational ability of air showers from cosmic tau
neutrinos in the PeV-EeV energy range. This advanced optical complex system is
based substantially on the development of All-sky Survey High Resolution
Air-shower detector (Ashra) and applies the tau shower Earth-skimming method to
survey PeV-EeV tau neutrinos. It allows wide (30 deg x 360 deg) and deep (~400
Mpc) survey observation for PeV-EeV tau neutrinos assuming the standard GRB
neutrino fluence.In addition, it enjoys the pointing accuracy of better than
0.2 deg in essentially background-free conditions. With the advanced imaging of
Earth-skimming tau showers in the wide field of view, we aim for clear
discovery and identification of astronomical tau neutrino sources, providing
inescapable evidence of the astrophysical hadronic model for acceleration
and/or propagation of extremely high energy protons in the precisely determined
direction.

High temperature heat treatment usually reduces the impurities concentration

of the first one brings the model to the ordinary rational KZ equation. Another
one is $\tau$. At the level of classical mechanics the deformation parameter
$\tau$ allows to extend the previously obtained modified Gaudin models to the
modified Schlesinger systems. Next, we notice that the identities underlying
generic (elliptic) KZB equations follow from some additional relations for the
properly normalized $R$-matrices. The relations are noncommutative analogues of
identities for (scalar) elliptic functions. The simplest one is the unitarity
condition. The quadratic (in $R$ matrices) relations are generated by
noncommutative Fay identities. In particular, one can derive the quantum
Yang-Baxter equations from the Fay identities. The cubic relations provide
identities for the KZB equations as well as quadratic relations for the
classical $r$-matrices which can be halves of the classical Yang-Baxter
equation. At last we discuss the $R$-matrix valued linear problems which
provide ${\rm gl}_{\tilde N}$ Calogero-Moser (CM) models and Painleve equations
via the above mentioned identities. The role of the spectral parameter plays
the Planck constant of the quantum $R$-matrix. When the quantum ${\rm gl}_N$
$R$-matrix is scalar ($N=1$) the linear problem reproduces the Krichever's
ansatz for the Lax matrices with spectral parameter for the ${\rm gl}_{\tilde

sensitivity to the assumed statistical and systematic uncertainties in the
optical depth determination, the magnitude and uncertainty in the minimum

toy model for one strand of the selectivity filter backbone in ion channels. It
is recently discussed that the presence of quantum coherence in the selectivity
filter is possible and can play a role in mediating ion-conduction and
ion-selectivity in the selectivity filter. The question is ""how a quantum
coherence can be effective in such structures while the environment of the
channel is dephasing (i.e. noisy)?"" Basically, we expect that the presence of
the noise should have a destructive effect in the quantum transport. In fact,
we show that such expectation is valid for ordered chains. However, our results
indicate that introducing the dephasing in the disordered chains leads to the
weakening of the localization effects, arising from the randomness, and then
increases the efficiency of quantum energy transfer. Thus, the presence of
noise is crucial for the enhancement of EET efficiency in disordered chains. We
also show that the contribution of both classical and quantum mechanical
effects are required to improve the speed of energy transfer along the chain.
Our analysis may help for better understanding of fast and efficient
functioning of the selectivity filters in ion channels.

to measure the correlation (similarity) of each two samples and a graph is
constructed for encoding these correlations. Then the Laplacian eigenmapping is
adopted for deriving the graph Laplacian of the graph. Finally, SGC can be
obtained by plugging the graph Laplacian into the conventional GT framework. In
the image classification procedure, SGC utilizes the correlations, which are
encoded in the learned graph Laplacian, to infer the labels of unlabeled

the robustness and the discriminating power of GT. Compared to GT, SGC
sufficiently exploits the whole data. Therefore it alleviates the undercomplete

evaluation. The results demonstrate that SGC can achieve a promising
performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly

phase with both cooperators and defectors, besides the two absorbing phases, in
which either cooperators or defectors dominate. We provide, in addition, a
geometric interpretation of the transitions between phases. In analogy with
lattice models, the geometric percolation of the contact network (i.e.,

carry out a statistically robust analysis of the significance of the
cross-correlations, which is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations
including the uneven sampling and noise properties of the light-curves.
Modeling the light-curves as red noise processes with power-law power spectral
densities, we find that only one of 41 sources with high quality data in both
bands shows correlations with significance larger than 3-sigma (AO 0235+164),
with only two more larger than even 2.25-sigma (PKS 1502+106 and B2 2308+34).
Additionally, we find correlated variability in Mrk 421 when including a strong
flare that occurred in July-September 2012. These results demonstrate very
clearly the difficulty of measuring statistically robust multiwavelength
correlations and the care needed when comparing light-curves even when many
years of data are used. This should be a caution. In all four sources the radio
variations lag the gamma-ray variations, suggesting that the gamma-ray emission
originates upstream of the radio emission. Continuous simultaneous monitoring
over a longer time period is required to obtain high significance levels in

tubules that retract after the dissipation of this gradient. These tubules have
morphologies similar to mitochondrial cristae. The tubulation effect is due to
direct phospholipid packing modification in the outer leaflet that is promoted
by protonation of cardiolipin headgroups. Here we compare the case of
cardiolipin-containing giant unilamellar vesicles with that of
phosphatidylglycerol-containing giant unilamellar vesicles. Local acidification
also promotes formation of tubules in the latter. However, compared to
cardiolipin-containing giant unilamellar vesicles the tubules are longer,
exhibit a visible pearling and have a much longer lifetime after acid
micro-injection is stopped. We attribute these differences to an additional
mechanism that increases monolayer surface imbalance, namely inward PG
flip-flop promoted by the local transmembrane pH-gradient. Simulations using a
fully non-linear membrane model as well as geometrical calculations are in
agreement with this hypothesis. Interestingly, among yeast mutants deficient in
cardiolipin biosynthesis, only the crd1-null mutant, which accumulates

important for understanding static and dynamic properties of the inner crusts
of neutron stars and to explain their cooling process.
  Purpose: We plan to study the behavior of the pairing gaps $\Delta_F$ as a
function of the Fermi momentum $k_F$ for neutron and nuclear matter in all
relevant angular momentum channels where superfluidity is believed to naturally
emerge. The calculations will employ realistic chiral nucleon-nucleon
potentials with the inclusion of three-body forces and self-energy effects.
  Methods: The superfluid states of neutron and nuclear matter are studied by
solving the BCS gap equation for chiral nuclear potentials using the method
suggested by Khodel et al., where the original gap equation is replaced by a
coupled set of equations for the dimensionless gap function $\chi(p)$ defined
by $\Delta(p) = \Delta_F \chi(p)$ and a non-linear algebraic equation for the
gap magnitude $\Delta_F = \Delta(p_F)$ at the Fermi surface. This method is
numerically stable even for small pairing gaps, such as that encountered in the
coupled $^3PF_2$ partial wave.
  Results: We have successfully applied Khodel's method to singlet ($S$) and
coupled channel ($SD$ and $PF$) cases in neutron and nuclear matter. Our
calculations agree with other ab-initio approaches, where available, and
provide crucial inputs for future applications in superfluid systems.

used to model the spread of information, influence, or a viral infection.
Diffusion patterns can be specified by a probabilistic model, such as
Independent Cascade (IC), or captured by a set of representative traces.
  Basic computational problems in the study of diffusion are influence queries
(determining the potency of a specified seed set of nodes) and Influence
Maximization (identifying the most influential seed set of a given size).
Answering each influence query involves many edge traversals, and does not
scale when there are many queries on very large graphs. The gold standard for
Influence Maximization is the greedy algorithm, which iteratively adds to the
seed set a node maximizing the marginal gain in influence. Greedy has a
guaranteed approximation ratio of at least (1-1/e) and actually produces a
sequence of nodes, with each prefix having approximation guarantee with respect
to the same-size optimum. Since Greedy does not scale well beyond a few million

atmospheres of solar composition brown dwarfs and self-luminous extrasolar
giant planets using a kinetics-based 1D atmospheric chemistry model. Our
approach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with
effective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds
equilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that
can be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface
gravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an
otherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the
transition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical
mixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing
could lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are
$1100\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the
NH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for
gravity. HCN may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with very
strong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO-CH4 reaction network
reveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in
partial agreement with previous work. Simple, easy to use quenching relations
are derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble of
models. These relations are valid for determining CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, and CO2
abundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied but may not
apply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes not
considered here (e.g., wave breaking).

by instructing the drifter to explore parts of the flow currently uncharted,

proposed and used to evaluate normal tissue sparing among stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS) plans with different prescription isodose lines. Methods:
Forty plans were generated for 8 intracranial SRS cases, prescribing to isodose
levels (IDLs) ranging from 50% to 90% in 10% increments. Whilst maintaining
similar coverage and conformity, plans at different IDLs were evaluated in
terms of normal tissue sparing using the proposed DDS. The DDS was defined as
the greater decay coefficient in a double exponential decay fit of the dose
drop-off outside the PTV, which models the steep portion of the drop-off.
Provided that the prescription dose covers the whole PTV, a greater DDS
indicates better normal tissue sparing. Results: Among all plans, the DDS was
found the lowest for the prescription at 90% IDL and the highest for the
prescription at 60% or 70%. Beam profile slope change in penumbra and its field
size dependence were explored and given as the physical basis of the findings.
Conclusions: A variable was proposed for SRS plan quality evaluation. Using
this measure, prescriptions at 60% and 70% IDLs were found to provide best
normal tissue sparing. Advances in knowledge: A new variable was proposed based
on which normal tissue sparing was quantitatively evaluated, comparing
different prescription IDLs in SRS.

regularisation schemes that minimise derivatives of the source (using two
finite difference methods) and introduce a scheme that minimises deviations

  The PDE constraint consists, in its simplest form, of a hyperbolic transport
equation for the evolution of the image intensity. The control variable is the
velocity field. Tikhonov regularization on the control ensures well-posedness.
We consider standard smoothness regularization based on $H^1$- or
$H^2$-seminorms. We augment this regularization scheme with a constraint on the
divergence of the velocity field rendering the deformation incompressible and
thus ensuring that the determinant of the deformation gradient is equal to one,
up to the numerical error.
  We use a Fourier pseudospectral discretization in space and a Chebyshev
pseudospectral discretization in time. We use a preconditioned, globalized,
matrix-free, inexact Newton-Krylov method for numerical optimization. A
parameter continuation is designed to estimate an optimal regularization
parameter. Regularity is ensured by controlling the geometric properties of the
deformation field. Overall, we arrive at a black-box solver. We study spectral
properties of the Hessian, grid convergence, numerical accuracy, computational
efficiency, and deformation regularity of our scheme. We compare the designed
Newton-Krylov methods with a globalized preconditioned gradient descent. We
study the influence of a varying number of unknowns in time.
  The reported results demonstrate excellent numerical accuracy, guaranteed
local deformation regularity, and computational efficiency with an optional
control on local mass conservation. The Newton-Krylov methods clearly

evolved from an ancestral sequence that forms the root of a binary tree of

sites, but the parameters of the evolutionary model can vary over sites. We
assume a piecewise constant model for these parameters, with an unknown number
of change-points and hence a trans-dimensional parameter space over which we
seek to perform Bayesian inference. We propose two novel ideas to deal with the
computational challenges of such inference. Firstly, we approximate the model
based on the time machine principle: the top nodes of the binary tree (near the
root) are replaced by an approximation of the true distribution; as more nodes
are removed from the top of the tree, the cost of computing the likelihood is
reduced linearly in $n$. The approach introduces a bias, which we investigate
empirically. Secondly, we develop a particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings
(PMMH) algorithm, that employs a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler and can
use the first idea. Our time-machine PMMH algorithm copes well with one of the
bottle-necks of standard computational algorithms: the trans-dimensional nature
of the posterior distribution. The algorithm is implemented on simulated and
real data examples, and we empirically demonstrate its potential to outperform
competing methods based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques.

luminosities (median $L_{X,500}=5\times10^{43}$ ergs/s) and total mass
estimates (median $5\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$) are measured, adapting to
the specific signal-to-noise regime of XMM-LSS observations. The redshift
distribution of clusters shows a deficit of sources when compared to the
cosmological expectations, regardless of whether WMAP-9 or Planck-2013 CMB
parameters are assumed. This lack of sources is particularly noticeable at $0.4
\lesssim z \lesssim 0.9$. However, after quantifying uncertainties due to small
number statistics and sample variance we are not able to put firm (i.e. $>3
\sigma$) constraints on the presence of a large void in the cluster
distribution. We work out alternative hypotheses and demonstrate that a
negative redshift evolution in the normalization of the $L_{X}-T_X$ relation
(with respect to a self-similar evolution) is a plausible explanation for the
observed deficit. We confirm this evolutionary trend by directly studying how
C1 clusters populate the $L_{X}-T_X-z$ space, properly accounting for selection
biases. We point out that a systematically evolving, unresolved, central
component in clusters and groups (AGN contamination or cool core) can impact
the classification as extended sources and be partly responsible for the
observed redshift distribution.[abridged]

the behavior of positive solutions to the reaction-diffusion system is

$R^F_0(0)<1<R_0$, the spreading or vanishing of the bacteria depends on the

write and execute parallel Java applications on High Performance Computing
(HPC) hardware. Despite its successful adoption in the Java HPC community, the
MPJ Express software currently does not provide any support for debugging and
profiling parallel applications and hence forces its users to rely on manual
and tedious debugging/profiling methods. Support for such tools is essential to
help application developers increase their overall productivity. To address
this we have developed debugging and profiling tools for MPJ Express, which are
the main topic of this paper. Key design goals for these tools include: 1)
maintain compatibility with existing logging, debugging, and visualizing tools,
2) build these tools by extending existing debugging/profiling tools instead of
reinventing the wheel. The first tool, named MPJDebug, builds on the
open-source Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides an
Eclipse-based plugin developed using the Eclipse Plugin Development Environment
(PDE). The default Eclipse debugger currently does not support debugging
parallel applications running on a compute cluster. The second tool, named
MPJProf, is a utility based on Tuning and Analysis Utility (TAU)-an open-source
performance evaluation tool. Our goal here is to exploit TAU to profile Java
applications parallelized using MPJ Express by generating profiles and traces,
which can later be visualized using existing tools like paraprof and Jumpshot.
Towards the end of the paper, we quantify the overhead of using MPJProf, which
we found to be negligible in the profiling stage of parallel application
development.

the evaluation of associated traits or tasks that are deemed to represent some
facets of social behaviour. The amalgamation of these traits is then used to
configure the intuitive notion of social intelligence. Instead, in this paper
we start from a parametrised definition of social intelligence as the expected
performance in a set of environments with several agents, and we assess and
derive tests from it. This definition makes several dependencies explicit: (1)
the definition depends on the choice (and weight) of environments and agents,
(2) the definition may include both competitive and cooperative behaviours
depending on how agents and rewards are arranged into teams, (3) the definition
mostly depends on the abilities of other agents, and (4) the actual difference
between social intelligence and general intelligence (or other abilities)
depends on these choices. As a result, we address the problem of converting
this definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties
ensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and
anticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some
other more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry,
validity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the
definition into a practical test. From the definition and the formalised
properties, we take a look at several representative multi-agent environments,
tests and games to see whether they meet these properties.

The study of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) in relation to

powerful tool to constrain models of galaxy evolution. Aims. We determine the
SMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive
and star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the
center out to approximately 2 virial radii. We also determine rho(r) to compare
it to the number density and total mass density profiles. Methods. We use the
dataset from the CLASH-VLT survey. Stellar masses are obtained by SED fitting
on 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363
cluster members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole
cluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster
SF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster
galaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population
has a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50
Mpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density
regions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this
innermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases
again toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing
radial trend of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand,
the stellar mass fraction, i.e., the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass,
does not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions. Our results appear
consistent with a scenario in which SF galaxies evolve into passive galaxies
due to density-dependent environmental processes, and eventually get destroyed
very near the cluster center to become part of a diffuse intracluster medium.

from the spin-orbit coupling or a magnetic field gradient. The inelastic

applied bias voltage, to a steady nonequilibrium occupation of the harmonic

of the dot and the magnetic polarization of the leads. Depending on the
magnetic configuration and the bias-voltage polarity, we can strongly cool a
single mode or pump energy into it. In the latter case, we find that within our
approximation, the system approaches eventually a regime of mechanical
instability. Furthermore, owing to the sensitivity of the electron transport to
the spin orientation, we find signatures of the nanomechanical motion in the
current-voltage characteristic. Hence, the vibrational state can be read out in
transport measurements.

thermodynamics is irreversible and not deterministic, because it states that a
system forgets its past when approaching equilibrium. I argue that all

include additional assumptions that are not part of classical mechanics. The
same holds for Boltzmann's H-theorem. Furthermore, I argue that the
coarse-graining of phase-space that is used when deriving the second law cannot
be viewed as an expression of our ignorance of the details of the microscopic
state of the system, but reflects the fact that the state of a system is fully
specified by using only a finite number of bits, as implied by the concept of
entropy, which is related to the number of different microstates that a closed
system can have. While quantum mechanics, as described by the Schroedinger
equation, puts this latter statement on a firm ground, it cannot explain the

classical mu-calculus by Bezhanishvili and Hodkinson. Our approach is in the
spirit of Sahlqvist theory. That is, we identify syntactically-defined classes
of inequalities, namely the restricted inductive and tame inductive
inequalities, which are, respectively, canonical or tame canonical. Our
approach is to use an algorithm which processes inequalities with the aim of
eliminating propositional variables. The algorithm we introduce is closely
related to the algorithms ALBA and mu-ALBA studied by Conradie, Palmigiano, et
al. It is based on a calculus of rewrite rules, the soundness of which rests
upon the way in which algebras embed into their canonical extensions and the
order-theoretic properties of the latter. We show that the algorithm succeeds
on every restricted inductive inequality by means of a so-called proper run,
and that this is sufficient to guarantee their canonicity. Likewise, we are
able to show that the algorithm succeeds on every tame inductive inequality by
means of a so-called tame run. In turn, this guarantees their tame canonicity.

found within Indigenous Australian oral traditions. Studies of oral traditions
demonstrate that they extend beyond the realm of myth and legend; they contain
structured knowledge about the natural world (science) as well as historic
accounts of natural events and geo-hazards. These traditions could lead to the
discovery of meteorites and impact sites previously unknown to Western science.
In addition to benefiting the scientific study of meteoritics, this study can
help social scientists better understand the nature and longevity of oral

minimizing the total power consumption while satisfying a set of target
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). To gain insights into the
structure of the optimal solution and reduce the computational complexity for
its evaluation, we analyze the asymptotic regime where $N$ and $K$ grow large
with a given ratio and make use of recent results from large system analysis to
compute the asymptotic solution. Then, we concentrate on the asymptotically
design of heuristic linear precoding techniques. Interestingly, it turns out
that the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder is equivalent to the optimal
one when the ratio between the SINR requirement and the average channel
attenuation is the same for all UEs. If this condition does not hold true but
only the same SINR constraint is imposed for all UEs, then the RZF can be
modified to still achieve optimality if statistical information of the UE
positions is available at the BS. Numerical results are used to evaluate the
performance gap in the finite system regime and to make comparisons among the

by the mutual interaction with currents flowing in conducting vessel
structures. Especially eddy currents caused by time-varying magnetic
perturbations and halo currents flowing directly from the plasma into the walls
are important. The relevance of a resistive wall model is directly evident for
Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs) or Vertical Displacement Events (VDEs). However,
also the linear and non-linear properties of most other large-scale
instabilities may be influenced significantly by the interaction with currents
in conducting structures near the plasma. The understanding of halo currents
arising during disruptions and VDEs, which are a serious concern for ITER as
they may lead to strong asymmetric forces on vessel structures, could also
benefit strongly from these non-linear modeling capabilities. Modeling the
plasma dynamics and its interaction with wall currents requires solving the
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in realistic toroidal X-point geometry
consistently coupled with a model for the vacuum region and the resistive
conducting structures. With this in mind, the non-linear finite element MHD
code JOREK has been coupled with the resistive wall code STARWALL, which allows
to include the effects of eddy currents in 3D conducting structures in
non-linear MHD simulations. This article summarizes the capabilities of the
coupled JOREK-STARWALL system and presents benchmark results as well as first
applications to non-linear simulations of RWMs, VDEs, disruptions triggered by
massive gas injection, and Quiescent H-Mode. As an outlook, the perspectives
for extending the model to halo currents are described.

properties of compact astrophysical objects endowed with strangeness, with the
objective of finding out their relevance in the formation and evolution of the
universe. In the first part of the thesis, Chap.~1-3, we discuss a model,
proposed by us, to describe the propagation of small lumps of Strange Quark
Matter (SQM) or strangelets, through the Terrestrial atmosphere. The
theoretical results were found to be well correlated with exotic cosmic ray
events characterized by very low charge to mass ratio.
  In the next part, we have investigated the other end of the mass spectrum of
SQM. In Chap 5, we have developed an analytical expression for the
Chandrasekhar Limit of Strange Quark Stars. The limit is found to depend on the
fundamental constants (including the bag constant). In the last chapter we have
endeavored to show that the quark nuggets, surviving the quark-hadron phase
transition in the millisecond era of the early Universe can provide the
required closure density and can merge to form compact quark matter objects,
whose maximum mass would be governed by the formulation laid out in the
preceding chapter. We have also found that these Cold Dark Matter objects can
explain the recent astronomical observations of MACHOS by gravitational
micro-lensing techniques in the Large Magellanic clouds in the Halo of our
Galaxy.

to the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies. The new BayeSED
code has been systematically tested on a mock sample of galaxies. The
comparison between estimated and inputted value of the parameters show that
BayeSED can recover the physical parameters of galaxies reasonably well. We
then applied BayeSED to interpret the SEDs of a large Ks-selected sample of
galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field with stellar population synthesis
models. With the new BayeSED code, a Bayesian model comparison of stellar
population synthesis models has been done for the first time. We found that the
model by Bruzual & Charlot (2003), statistically speaking, has larger Bayesian
evidence than the model by Maraston (2005) for the Ks-selected sample. Besides,
while setting the stellar metallicity as a free parameter obviously increases
the Bayesian evidence of both models, varying the IMF has a notable effect only
on the Maraston (2005) model. Meanwhile, the physical parameters estimated with
BayeSED are found to be generally consistent with those obtained with the
popular grid-based FAST code, while the former exhibits more natural
distributions. Based on the estimated physical parameters of galaxies in the
sample, we qualitatively classified the galaxies in the sample into five
populations that may represent galaxies at different evolution stages or in
different environments. We conclude that BayeSED could be a reliable and
powerful tool for investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies from
the rich multi-wavelength observations currently available. A binary version of

diffusion cannot be derived additionally for the momentum. But considering the

finite on the boundary separating two subspaces, whereas the energy density and
the parallel stress diverge as the inverse power of the distance from the
boundary. For a conformally coupled field, the vacuum energy density is
negative on the cylindrical part of the space. On the hemisphere, it is
negative near the top and positive close to the boundary. In the case of
minimal coupling the energy density on the cup is negative. On the tube it is
positive near the boundary and negative at large distances. Though the

elements of arbitrarily small positive height. We prove that all elements of
small height in any finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}^{tr}$ already lie in

that a generalized Hodge dual for torsion tensor can be defined with
coefficients determined by mathematical consistency. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a direct generalization to other dimensions fails and no new
generalized Hodge dual operator could be given. Furthermore, if one enforces
the definition of a generalized Hodge dual to be consistent with the action of
teleparallel gravity in general dimensions, the basic identity for any sensible
Hodge dual would require an \textit{ad hoc} definition for the second Hodge
dual operation which is totally unexpected. Therefore, we conclude that at

The oxygen abundances were presented in Paper I. The photometric
characteristics of the disks are inferred here using photometric maps from the
literature through bulge-disk decomposition. We find evidence that the OH - SB
relation is not unique but depends on the galactocentric distance r (taken as a
fraction of the optical radius R_25) and on the properties of a galaxy: the
disk scale length h and the morphological T-type. The parametric OH - SB
relation reproduces the observed data better than a simple, one-parameter
relation; the deviations resulting when using our parametric relation are
smaller by a factor of ~1.4 than that the simple relation. The influence of the
parameters on the OH - SB relation varies with galactocentric distance. The
influence of the T-type on the OH - SB relation is negligible at the centers of
galaxies and increases with galactocentric distance. In contrast, the influence
of the disk scale length on the OH -- SB relation is maximum at the centers of
galaxies and decreases with galactocentric distance, disappearing at the
optical edges of galaxies. Two-dimensional relations can be used to reproduce
the observed data at the optical edges of the disks and at the centers of the
disks. The disk scale length should be used as a second parameter in the OH -
SB relation at the center of the disk while the morphological T-type should be
used as a second parameter in the relation at optical edge of the disk. The
general properties of the abundance - surface brightness relations are similar
for the three considered bands B, K, and W1.

yields an old and a new structure, with unlike potassium positions and
different electronic bands, but both metallic retaining the face-to-edge

special Lagrangian submanifolds in Calabi-Yau 6-manifolds and coassociative

submanifold $L$ in a nearly K\""ahler manifold $(M^{2n}, J, g)$ is
symplectically dual to the Maslov 1-form on $L$. Using relative calibrations,
we derive a formula for the second variation of the volume of a Lagrangian
submanifold $L^3$ in a strict nearly K\""ahler manifold $(M^6, J, g)$. This
formula implies, in particular, that any formal infinitesimal Lagrangian
deformation of $L^3$ is a Jacobi field on $L^3$. We describe a finite
dimensional local model of the moduli space of compact Lagrangian submanifolds
in a strict nearly K\""ahler 6-manifold. We show that there is a real analytic
atlas on $(M^6, J, g)$ in which the strict nearly K\""ahler structure $(J, g)$
is real analytic. Furthermore, w.r.t. an analytic strict nearly K\""ahler
structure the moduli space of Lagrangian submanifolds of $M^6$ is a real
analytic variety, whence infinitesimal Lagrangian deformations are smoothly
obstructed if and only if they are formally obstructed. As an application, we
relate our results to the description of Lagrangian submanifolds in the sphere
$S^6$ with the standard nearly K\""ahler structure described in
\cite{Lotay2012}.

space if $p>3$ and for a subset of a certain H\""older space otherwise. We also
discuss how fractional Sobolev and H\""older spaces can be generalised for
$2\pi$-periodic, closed curves. Since this energy is not invariant under
scaling, we additionally consider a rescaled version of the energy, where we
take the energy to the power one over $p$ and multiply by the length of the
curve to a certain power. We prove that a circle is at least a stationary point
of the rescaled energy. Furthermore, we show that in general a functional with
a scaling behaviour like $E(r\gamma)=r^\alpha E(\gamma)$, $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$
cannot have stationary points unless $\alpha=0$. Consequently ""integral Menger
curvature"" for $p\neq 3$ can be used as a subsidiary condition for a
Lagrange-multiplier rule.

trapezoidal rule for numerical integration, which is very efficient in this

However, many experimental settings demand the expression of the control signal
as a superposition of given waveforms, a case that cannot easily be
accommodated using time-local constraints. Previous approaches [1,2] have
circumvented this difficulty by performing optimization in a parameter space,
using the chain rule to make a connection to the time domain. In this paper, we
present an extension to Optimal Control Theory which allows gradient-based
optimization for superpositions of arbitrary waveforms directly in a
time-domain subspace. Its key is the use of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse as
an efficient means of transforming between a time-local and waveform-based
descriptions. To illustrate this optimization technique, we study the
parametrically driven harmonic oscillator as model system and reduce its
energy, considering both Hamiltonian dynamics and stochastic dynamics under the
influence of a thermal reservoir. We demonstrate the viability and efficiency
of the method for these test cases and find significant advantages in the case
of waveforms which do not form an orthogonal basis.

degradation, availability decrease and even crash during long time running,
which is called software aging. This phenomenon has been studied for more than
15 years, but most of the literatures studied software as a black box, none of
them uncovered the fundamental and widely accepted mechanism of software aging
as far as we know. Through analyzing the characteristics between biological
aging and software aging, we find some interesting common points and bridge the
gap between these two seemingly unrelated phenomena. The free radical aging
theory in biological studies is also applicative to explore the mechanism and
model of software aging. This paper finds an equivalent concept named `software
free radical' in software aging to free radical in biological aging. In our
study, the accumulation of `software free radical' is a root cause of software
aging. Using the free radical modeling methodology in biological aging, we give
a model for describing the kinetic of software aging based on feedback loops.
Although this paper doesn't give enough theoretical proof of the modeling
method, the practical results show that the feedback loop model can describe
the kinetic of software aging precisely. To further validate the aging
mechanism, we propose several software rejuvenation strategies focusing on
cleaning the `software free radical'. The results show that software aging can
be mitigated effectively by strengthening negative feedback loop or weakening
positive feedback loop. This paper is the first try to answer the question `How
software ages' through interdisciplinary studies. Leveraging the conclusions in
this paper, people can design better software systems or keep their systems at
a high performance level during long time running.

method is considered in detail for the 1D nonlocal
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation under the supposition of weak
diffusion. In terms of the semiclassical formalism developed, the original
nonlinear equation is reduced to an associated linear partial differential
equation and some algebraic equations for the coefficients of the linear
equation with a given accuracy of the asymptotic parameter. The solutions of
the nonlinear equation are constructed from the solutions of both the linear
equation and the algebraic equations. The solutions of the linear problem are
found with the use of symmetry operators. A countable family of the leading
terms of the semiclassical asymptotics is constructed in explicit form.
  The semiclassical asymptotics are valid by construction in a finite time
interval. We construct asymptotics which are different from the semiclassical
ones and can describe evolution of the solutions of the
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation at large times. In the example
considered, an initial unimodal distribution becomes multimodal, which can be
treated as an example of a space structure.

principle programming language. The course was divided into three sections. The
first section covered parallel programming techniques for shared memory systems
that include multicore and Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) systems. In this
section, Java threads was taught as a viable programming API for such systems.
The second section was dedicated to parallel programming tools meant for
distributed memory systems including clusters and network of computers. We used
MPJ Express-a Java MPI library-for conducting programming assignments and lab
work for this section. The third and the final section covered advanced topics
including the MapReduce programming model using Hadoop and the General Purpose
Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU).

degree of smartphones neglects steganography, which can be mainly used to: i)
exfiltrate confidential data via camouflage methods, and ii) conceal valuable

  Therefore, this paper surveys the state of the art of steganographic
techniques for smartphones, with emphasis on methods developed over the period
2005 to the second quarter of 2014. The different approaches are grouped
according to the portion of the device used to hide information, leading to
three different covert channels, i.e., local, object and network. Also, it
reviews the relevant approaches used to detect and mitigate steganographic
attacks or threats. Lastly, it showcases the most popular software applications
to embed secret data into carriers, as well as possible future directions.
