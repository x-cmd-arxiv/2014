dynamical effect may be important inside the last stable orbit because of the
decompression near the sonic point. Here, I consider the radial and vertical
structure of a nearly free-falling flow inside the last stable orbit of a thin
disc around a Kerr black hole. The thickness of such a flow is determined
primarily by the vertical stress created by radial and azimuthal magnetic
fields. The thickness is predicted to oscillate vertically around its
equilibrium value determined by the magnetic field balance with gravity. For
thin discs, this thickness is much larger than that of the accretion disc
itself. Numerical simulations with HARM2d show the vertical structure is more
complicated. In particular, magnetically supported disc seems to be unstable to
segregation of matter into thinner streams with the vertical scale determined
by thermal pressure or other processes.

co-propagating with the electron beam through a short undulator (or modulator)
tuned for the resonance condition followed by transport through a subsequent
chicane will result in energy modulation and z-density modulation
(microbunching), respectively. The latter microbunching will result in
generation of coherent optical or UV transition radiation (COTR, CUVTR) at a
metal converter screen which can reveal slice beam size, centroid, and energy
spread. Additionally, direct assessment of the microbunching factors related to
HGHG by measurement of the COTR intensity and harmonic content after the
chicane as a function of seed laser power and beam parameters will be done.
These experiments will be performed using the ASTA 3-MHz-rate micropulse train
for up to 1ms which is unique to test facilities in the USA.

facilitator of these debates. However, under the immense pressures of free

thematic news. On the opposite end of the spectrum, social media has been
heralded as a new forum, a reincarnation of the ailing public spheres to
further the deliberation of the political. But do the followers of political
parties in social media endorse thematic or episodic content?
  To answer this question, I look at the most recent 3,200 tweets that were
broadcast from the Republican and Democratic Twitter accounts. By employing
Latent dirichlet allocation, I extract the prevailing topics of these tweets
and linked websites. Generalized linear models are used to describe the
relationship between episodicity, thematicity and the endorsement counts of the

  I find that there is a stark contrast between the behavior of Democratic and
Republican followers. In general, there seems to be a slight preference for
thematic messages. Interestingly, the distance to an election increases the
odds of a message to be endorsed.

expels relativistic jets of magnetized plasma in our direction. This plasma
entrains nonthermal synchrotron-emitting electrons that furthermore scatter
internally-produced synchrotron photons as well as externally-produced photons
from the accretion-disk, the broad-line region, and the infrared-emitting
torus. This picture has been very successful in reproducing the two-humped
blazar spectral energy distribution. Yet various discontents persist, including
(1) ultra-short variability at TeV energies that is much shorter than the black
hole's dynamical timescale; (2) very-high energy (VHE; >100 GeV) radiation from
FSRQs; (3) evidence for a hard spectral component in high-synchrotron peaked
objects, found when deabsorbing the measured VHE spectrum using conventional
extragalactic background light (EBL) models; (4) an unusual slowly varying
class of BL Lac objects; (5) location of the gamma-ray emission region. Some of
these problems can be resolved by introducing a hadronic component into the
blazar paradigm, consistent with the hypothesis that blazars are sources of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Gamma-ray observations with the Cherenkov

test this hypothesis.

along trajectories which solve classical equations of motion. However in
systems with higher dimensionality or complexified phase space these are rarely
attainable. A prime example are spin-coherent states which are used e.g. to
describe single molecule magnets (SMM). We use this example to develop
instanton calculus which does not rely on explicit solutions of the classical
equations of motion. Energy conservation restricts the complex phase space to a
Riemann surface of complex dimension one, allowing to deform integration paths
according to Cauchy's integral theorem. As a result, the semiclassical actions
can be evaluated without knowing actual classical paths. Furthermore we show
that in many cases such actions may be solely derived from monodromy properties
of the corresponding Riemann surface and residue values at its singular points.

of the wave function to gravity. The DP model needs a free parameter, acting as
a cut-off to regularize the dynamics, and the predictions of the model highly
depend on the value of this cut-off. The Compton wavelength of a nucleon seems
to be the most reasonable cut-off value since it justifies the non-relativistic
approach. However, with this value, the DP model predicts an unrealistic high
rate of energy increase. Thus, one either is forced to choose a much larger
cut-off, which is not physically justified and totally arbitrary, or one needs
to include dissipative effects in order to tame the energy increase. Taking the
analogy with dissipative collisional decoherence seriously, we develop a
dissipative generalization of the DP model. We show that even with dissipative
effects, the DP model contradicts known physical facts, unless either the
cut-off is kept artificially large, or one limits the applicability of the
model to massive systems. We also provide an estimation for the mass range of
this applicability.

peaks in Titan's northern and southern hemispheres. The HC$_3$N maps indicate
enhanced concentrations of this molecule over the poles, consistent with
previous studies of Titan's photochemistry and atmospheric circulation.
Differences between the spectrally-integrated flux distributions of HNC and
HC$_3$N show that these species are not co-spatial. The observed spectral line
shapes are consistent with HNC being concentrated predominantly in the
mesosphere and above (at altitudes $z\gtrsim 400$ km), whereas HC$_3$N is
abundant at a broader range of altitudes ($z\approx70$-600 km). From spatial
variations in the HC$_3$N line profile, the locations of the HC$_3$N emission

integrated emission from HNC and the line core (upper-atmosphere) component of

motion(fBm) with Hurst parameter $H>\frac{1}{2}$, it is known that the existing
(naive) Euler scheme has the rate of convergence $n^{1-2H}$. Since the limit
$H\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}$ of the SDE corresponds to a Stratonovich SDE driven
by standard Brownian motion, and the naive Euler scheme is the extension of the
classical Euler scheme for It\^{o} SDEs for $H=\frac{1}{2}$, the convergence
rate of the naive Euler scheme deteriorates for $H\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}$. In
this paper we introduce a new (modified Euler) approximation scheme which is
closer to the classical Euler scheme for Stratonovich SDEs for $H=\frac{1}{2}$,
and it has the rate of convergence $\gamma_n^{-1}$, where
$\gamma_n=n^{2H-{1}/2}$ when $H<\frac{3}{4}$, $\gamma_n=n/\sqrt{\log n}$ when
$H=\frac{3}{4}$ and $\gamma_n=n$ if $H>\frac{3}{4}$. Furthermore, we study the
asymptotic behavior of the fluctuations of the error. More precisely, if
$\{X_t,0\le t\le T\}$ is the solution of a SDE driven by a fBm and if
$\{X_t^n,0\le t\le T\}$ is its approximation obtained by the new modified Euler
scheme, then we prove that $\gamma_n(X^n-X)$ converges stably to the solution
of a linear SDE driven by a matrix-valued Brownian motion, when
$H\in(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}]$. In the case $H>\frac{3}{4}$, we show the $L^p$
convergence of $n(X^n_t-X_t)$, and the limiting process is identified as the
solution of a linear SDE driven by a matrix-valued Rosenblatt process. The rate
of weak convergence is also deduced for this scheme. We also apply our approach
to the naive Euler scheme.

eruption. Such a system, which is usually observed in quiet-Sun regions, has
long been suggested to be the manifestation of an MFR with relatively cool
filament material collecting near its bottom. However, observational evidence
of eruptive, filament-hosting MFR systems has been elusive for those
originating in active regions. By utilizing multi-passband extreme-ultra-violet
(EUV) observations from SDO/AIA, we present direct evidence of an eruptive MFR
in the low corona that exhibits a hot envelope and a cooler core; the latter is
likely the upper part of a filament that undergoes a partial eruption, which is
later observed in the upper corona as the coiled kernel of a fast, WL CME. This
MFR-like structure exists more than one hour prior to its eruption, and
displays successive stages of dynamical evolution, in which both ideal and
non-ideal physical processes may be involved. The timing of the MFR kinematics
is found to be well correlated with the energy release of the associated
long-duration C1.9 flare. We suggest that the long-duration flare is the result
of prolonged energy release associated with the vertical current sheet induced
by the erupting MFR.

deposition of material upwards from windward surface shear. The shear driven
deposition is shown to be the more efficient process. Lengthening of waves to
match the wind speed is shown to be very inefficient and consume a large
fraction of the energy imparted by the wind. The surface shear provides a low
energy sink that absorbs most of the momentum from the wind. These produce
bounds on the efficiency of wave growth. The results here are computed in a

at very high Rayleigh numbers. We observe slow vortex merging events and find a

temporal period, and possibly other additional internal parameters such as the
propagation constant, are unknown priori and need to be determined along with
the solution itself. The main idea of the method is to first express those
unknown parameters in terms of the solution through quasi-Rayleigh quotients,
so that the resulting integro-differential equation is for the time-periodic
solution only. Then this equation is computed in the combined spatiotemporal
domain as a boundary value problem by Newton-conjugate-gradient iterations. The
proposed method applies to both stable and unstable time-periodic solutions;
its numerical accuracy is spectral; it is fast-converging; and its coding is
short and simple. As numerical examples, this method is applied to the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation,
whose time-periodic or relative time-periodic solutions with spatially-periodic
or spatially-localized profiles are computed. This method also applies to
systems of ordinary differential equations, as is illustrated by its simple
computation of periodic orbits in the Lorenz equations. MATLAB codes for all
numerical examples are provided in appendices to illustrate the simple
implementation of the proposed method.

multicarrier detection scheme dynamically adapts to the sub-channel conditions
using a corresponding statistics which is provided by our sophisticated
sub-channel estimation procedure. The sub-channel estimation phase determines
the transmittance coefficients of the sub-channels, which information are used
further in the adaptive quadrature decoding process. We define the technique
called subcarrier spreading to estimate the transmittance conditions of the
sub-channels with a theoretical error-minimum in the presence of a Gaussian
noise. We introduce the terms of single and collective adaptive quadrature
detection. We also extend the results for a multiuser multicarrier CVQKD
scenario. We prove the achievable error probabilities, the signal-to-noise
ratios, and quantify the attributes of the framework. The adaptive detection
scheme allows to utilize the extra resources of multicarrier CVQKD and to
maximize the amount of transmittable valuable information in diverse
measurement and transmission conditions. The framework is particularly
convenient for experimental CVQKD scenarios.

source functions that require uniform resolution. However, FFT loses its
performance advantage when the source function has highly localized features
like internal sharp layers. FMM and GMG considerably outperform FFT for those

introducing the Non-Diffracting Waves (NDW), and by a definition of NDWs.
Afterwards we recall -besides ordinary waves (gaussian beams, gaussian pulses)-
the simplest non diffracting waves (Bessel beams, X-shaped pulses,...). In
Sec.2 we show how to eliminate any backward-traveling components, first in the
case of ideal NDW pulses, and then, in Sec.3, for realistic finite-energy NDW
pulses. In particular, in subsec.3.1 we forward a general functional expression
for any totally-forward non-diffracting pulses. Then, in Sec.4 an efficient
method is set forth for the analytic description of truncated beams, a
byproduct of its being the elimination of any need of lengthy numerical
calculations. In Sec.5 we explore the question of the subluminal NDWs, or
bullets, in terms of two different methods, the second one allowing the
analytic description of non-diffracting waves with a static envelope (""Frozen
Waves"", FW), in terms of continuous Bessel beam superpositions. The production
of such Frozen Waves (experimentally generated in recent time for Optics) is
theoretically developed in Sec.6 also for the case of absorbing media. Sec.7
discusses the role of Special Relativity and of Lorentz transformations,
relevant for the physical comprehension of the NDW issue. In Sec.8 we present
further analytic solutions to the wave equations, with use of higher-order
Bessel beams. Next, Sec.9 deals in detail with an application of NDWs to
Optical Tweezers. In Sec.10 we show that ""soliton-like"" solutions can be found
also in the different case of the ordinary linear Schroedinger equation within
standard Quantum Mechanics. Some complementary issues are just mentioned in the
last Section. This work also constitutes a part of a much longer Review in

constrained by the available energy at each channel use, which is driven by an
external energy harvesting process, the size of the battery, and the previous
channel inputs. We consider an abstraction where energy is harvested in binary
units and stored in a battery with the capacity of a single unit, and the
channel inputs are binary. Viewing the available energy in the battery as a
state, this is a state-dependent channel with input-dependent states, memory in
the states, and causal state information available at the transmitter only. We
find an equivalent representation for this channel based on the timings of the
symbols, and determine the capacity of the resulting equivalent timing channel
via an auxiliary random variable. We give achievable rates based on certain
selections of this auxiliary random variable which resemble lattice coding for
the timing channel. We develop upper bounds for the capacity by using a
genie-aided method, and also by quantifying the leakage of the state
information to the receiver. We show that the proposed achievable rates are
asymptotically capacity achieving for small energy harvesting rates. We extend
the results to the case of ternary channel inputs. Our achievable rates give
the capacity of the binary channel within 0.03 bits/channel use, the ternary
channel within 0.05 bits/channel use, and outperform basic Shannon strategies
that only consider instantaneous battery states, for all parameter values.

suitable applied field. The physical objective as a functional of the field
forms the quantum control landscape, whose topology, under certain conditions,
has been shown to contain no critical point suboptimal traps, thereby enabling
effective searches for fields that give the global maximum of the objective.
This paper addresses the structure of the landscape as a complement to
topological critical point features. Recent work showed that landscape
structure is highly favorable for optimization of state-to-state transition
probabilities, in that gradient-based control trajectories to the global
maximum value are nearly straight paths. The landscape structure is codified in
the metric $R\geq 1.0$, defined as the ratio of the length of the control
trajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial and optimal controls.
A value of $R=1$ would indicate an exactly straight trajectory to the optimal
observable value. This paper extends the state-to-state transition probability
results to the quantum ensemble and unitary transformation control landscapes.
Again, nearly straight trajectories predominate, and we demonstrate that $R$
can take values approaching 1.0 with high precision. However, the interplay of
optimization trajectories with critical saddle submanifolds is found to
influence landscape structure. A fundamental relationship necessary for
perfectly straight gradient-based control trajectories is derived wherein the
gradient on the quantum control landscape must be an eigenfunction of the
Hessian. This relation is an indicator of landscape structure and may provide a
means to identify physical conditions when control trajectories can achieve
perfect linearity. The collective favorable landscape topology and structure
provide a foundation to understand why optimal quantum control can be readily
achieved.

rotational symmetry of the crystal, leading to a subsidiary nematic order. We
predict that the spin-orbit interaction associated with hexagonal warping plays

reminiscent to the observed behavior of a soliton-like texture in related
experiments in cold fermion gases [T. Yefsah et al., Nature 499, 426, (2013)].
Furthermore, we calculate the full non-linear dispersion relation of the
soliton and solve the classical equations of motion in a trap. The strong
non-linearity at high velocities gives rise to anharmonic oscillatory motion of
the soliton. A careful analysis of this anharmonicity may provide a means to
experimentally measure the non-linear soliton spectrum in superfluids.

coherent Lagrangian (i.e., material) eddies in incompressible,
satellite-derived surface ocean velocity fields. Paradoxically, observed
drifting buoys and floating matter tend to create dissipative-looking patterns
near oceanic eddies, which appear to be inconsistent with the conservative
fluid particle patterns created by coherent Lagrangian eddies. Here we show
that inclusion of inertial effects (i.e., those produced by the buoyancy and
size finiteness of an object) in a rotating two-dimensional incompressible flow
context resolves this paradox. Specifically, we obtain that anticyclonic
coherent Lagrangian eddies attract (repel) negatively (positively) buoyant
finite-size particles, while cyclonic coherent Lagrangian eddies attract
(repel) positively (negatively) buoyant finite-size particles. We show how
these results explain dissipative-looking satellite-tracked surface drifter and
subsurface float trajectories, as well as satellite-derived \emph{Sargassum}
distributions.

many examples, we find evidence that the tunneling matrices are powerful
quantities to classify different types of gapped domain walls. Since a gapped
boundary is a gapped domain wall between a bulk topological order and the
vacuum, regarded as the trivial topological order, our theory of gapped domain
walls inclusively contains the theory of gapped boundaries. In addition, we
derive a topological ground state degeneracy formula, applied to arbitrary

in N=1 supergravity models with a spectator sector not involved in
supersymmetry breaking. Motivated by the supergravity description of complex
structure moduli in Large Volume Compactifications of type IIB-superstrings, we
concentrate on models where the interactions are consistent with the
supersymmetric truncation of the spectator fields, and we describe their
couplings by a random ensemble of generic supergravity theories. We
characterise the mass spectrum of the spectator fields in terms of the
statistical parameters of the ensemble and the geometry of the scalar manifold.
Our results show that the non-generic couplings between the spectator and the
supersymmetry breaking sectors can stabilise all the tachyons which typically
appear in the spectator sector before including the supersymmetry breaking
effects, and we find large regions of the parameter space where the
supersymmetric sector remains stable with probability close to one. We discuss
these results about the stability of the supersymmetric sector in two
physically relevant situations: non-supersymmetric Minkowski vacua, and
slow-roll inflation driven by the supersymmetry breaking sector. For the class
of models we consider, we have reproduced the regimes in which the KKLT and
Large Volume Scenarios stabilise all supersymmetric moduli. We have also
identified a new regime in which the supersymmetric sector is stabilised at a
very robust type of dS minimum without invoking a large mass hierarchy.

(GRB) duration ($T_{\rm 90}$, $T_{\rm 50}$ and $T_{\rm R45}$) in a fixed rest
frame energy band for a sample of 232 Swift/BAT detected GRBs. Binning the data
in redshift we demonstrate a trend of increasing duration with increasing
redshift that can be modelled with a power-law for all three measures.
Comparing redshift defined subsets of rest-frame duration reveals that the
observed distributions of these durations are broadly consistent with
cosmological time dilation. To ascertain if this is an instrumental effect, a
similar analysis of Fermi/GBM data for the 57 bursts detected by both
instruments is conducted, but inconclusive due to small number statistics. We
then investigate under-populated regions of the duration redshift parameter
space. We propose that the lack of low-redshift, long duration GRBs is a
physical effect due to the sample being volume limited at such redshifts.
However, we also find that the high-redshift, short duration region of
parameter space suffers from censorship as any Swift GRB sample is
fundamentally defined by trigger criteria determined in the observer frame
energy band of Swift/BAT. As a result, we find that the significance of any
evidence for cosmological time dilation in our sample of duration measures
typically reduces to $<2\sigma$.

behaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitational
field in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes and
neutron stars, and the supra-nuclear densities in the interior of neutron
stars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector (LAD, 10 m 2

equipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. GRB) localization. The

superpartners of electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, based on final states with
missing transverse energy, a photon, and a dilepton pair, $\ell^+\,\ell^- +

which perform best when $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} -
m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1}, m_{\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}} - m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1}
> m_Z$, our search favors nearly degenerate spectra; degenerate electroweakinos
typically have a larger branching ratio to photons, and the cut $m_{\ell\ell}
\ll m_Z$ effectively removes on-shell Z boson backgrounds while retaining the
signal. This feature makes our technique optimal for `well-tempered' scenarios,
where the dark matter relic abundance is achieved with inter-electroweakino
splittings of $\sim 20 - 70\,\text{GeV}$. Additionally, our strategy applies to
a wider range of scenarios where the lightest neutralinos are almost
degenerate, but only make up a subdominant component of the dark matter -- a
spectrum we dub `well-forged'. Focusing on bino-Higgsino admixtures, we present
optimal cuts and expected efficiencies for several benchmark scenarios. We find
bino-Higgsino mixtures with $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} \lesssim
190\,\text{GeV}$ and $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} - m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1}
\cong 30\,\text{GeV}$ can be uncovered after roughly $600\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ of
luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC. Scenarios with lighter states require less data
for discovery, while scenarios with heavier states or larger mass splittings
are harder to discriminate from the background and require more data. Unlike
many searches for supersymmetry, electroweakino searches are one area where the
high luminosity of the next LHC run, rather than the increased energy, is
crucial for discovery.

detect transient sources to be observed by the LAD. However, thanks to its
unique combination of a wide field of view (FoV) and energy resolution (better

the long term variability of many classes of X-ray sources. The WFM consists of
10 independent and identical coded mask cameras arranged in 5 pairs to provide

colliders could provide key information on the Higgs self couplings and the
potential. As for single Higgs production the largest rates for multiple Higgs
production come from gluon-gluon fusion processes mediated by a top-quark loop.
However, at variance with single Higgs production, top-quark mass and width
effects from the loops cannot be neglected. Computations including the exact
top-quark mass dependence are only available at the leading order, and
currently predictions at higher orders are obtained by means of approximations
based on the Higgs-gluon effective field theory (HEFT). In this work we present
a reweighting technique that, starting from events obtained via the MC@NLO
method in the HEFT, allows to exactly include the top-quark mass and width
effects coming from one- and two-loop amplitudes. We describe our approach and
apply it to double Higgs production at NLO in QCD, computing the needed
one-loop amplitudes and using approximations for the unknown two-loop ones. The
results are compared to other approaches used in the literature, arguing that
they provide more accurate predictions for distributions and for total rates as
well. As a novel application of our procedure we present predictions at NLO in
QCD for triple Higgs production at hadron colliders.

Observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance within an open
cluster are typically only $\sim 0.01-0.05$ over many elements, significantly
smaller than the variation of $\sim 0.06-0.3$ seen in the interstellar medium
from which the stars form. It is unknown why clusters are so homogenous, and
whether homogeneity should also prevail in regions of lower star formation
efficiency that do not produce bound clusters. Here we report adaptive mesh
simulations using passively-advected scalars in order to trace the mixing of
chemical elements as star-forming clouds form and collapse. We show that
turbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally produces a stellar abundance
scatter at least ~5 times smaller than that in the gas, sufficient to fully
explain the observed chemical homogeneity of stars. Moreover, mixing occurs
very early, so that regions with efficiencies $\varepsilon \sim 10\%$ are
nearly as well-mixed as those with $\varepsilon\sim 50\%$. This implies that
even regions that do not form bound clusters are likely to be well-mixed, and
enhances the prospects for using chemical tagging to reconstruct dissolved star
clusters via their unique chemical signatures.

insight into the various anomalous results associated with these that have been
reported in the literature. For the case of bounces with radii much less that
the horizon distance $H^{-1}$ we find two distinct regimes, distinguished by
the magnitude of the bubble nucleation rate $\Gamma$. If $\Gamma/H^4 \gg 1$,
then the behavior of the modes contributing to the determinant factors in
$\Gamma$ is much as in flat spacetime, and the calculation of $\Gamma$ goes
over smoothly to the flat spacetime calculation as the gravitational coupling
is taken to zero. This is not the case if $\Gamma/H^4 \ll 1$. These two regimes
correspond to the two possible outcomes of de Sitter vacuum decay --- either a
rapidly completed transition or non-percolation and eternal inflation. For
bounces with radii comparable to the horizon length, we confirm previous
results concerning anomalous negative modes with support on the bounce wall. We
also find further evidence supporting previous claims, based on thin-wall
arguments, of the absence of expected negative modes for a class of bounces

possibility of combining the accuracy of grid-based numerical methods with the
flexibility and automatic resolution adaptivity of particle-based methods. Due
to their supersonic nature, Keplerian accretion discs are in principle a very
attractive system for applying such freely moving mesh techniques. However, the
high degree of symmetry of simple accretion disc models can be difficult to
capture accurately by these methods, due to the generation of geometric grid
noise and associated numerical diffusion, which is absent in polar grids. To
explore these and other issues, in this work we study the idealized problem of
two-dimensional planet-disc interaction with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We
explore the hydrodynamic evolution of discs with planets through a series of
numerical experiments that vary the planet mass, the disc viscosity and the
mesh resolution, and compare the resulting surface density, vortensity field
and tidal torque with results from the literature. We find that the performance
of the moving-mesh code in this problem is in accordance with published
results, showing good consistency with grid codes written in polar coordinates.
We also conclude that grid noise and mesh distortions do not introduce
excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, we show how the moving-mesh approach
can naturally increase resolution in regions of high densityaround planets and
planetary wakes, while retaining the background flow at low resolution. This
provides an alternative to the difficult task of implementing adaptive mesh
refinement in conventional polar-coordinate codes.

  This is the final version before the official publication by IEEE",,"10.1109/TAC.2015.2459191",,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A fundamental problem that the bearing rigidity theory studies is to
determine when a framework can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a
scaling factor by its inter-neighbor bearings. While many previous works
focused on the bearing rigidity of two-dimensional frameworks, a first
contribution of this paper is to extend these results to arbitrary dimensions.
It is shown that a framework in an arbitrary dimension can be uniquely
determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by the bearings if and only
if the framework is infinitesimally bearing rigid. In this paper, the proposed
bearing rigidity theory is further applied to the bearing-only formation
stabilization problem where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor
bearings and the feedback control uses only bearing measurements. Nonlinear
distributed bearing-only formation control laws are proposed for the cases with
and without a global orientation. It is proved that the control laws can almost
globally stabilize infinitesimally bearing rigid formations. Numerical
simulations are provided to support the analysis.

circumplanetary disks using atmospheric radiative transfer models.
Circumplanetary disks only accreting at $10^{-10} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ around a 1
M$_{J}$ planet can be brighter than the planet itself. A moderately accreting
circumplanetary disk ($\dot{M}\sim 10^{-8}M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$; enough to form a
10 M$_{J}$ planet within 1 Myr) around a 1 M$_{J}$ planet has a maximum
temperature of $\sim$2000 K, and at near-infrared wavelengths ($J$, $H$, $K$
bands), this disk is as bright as a late M-type brown dwarf or a 10 M$_{J}$
planet with a ""hot start"". To use direct imaging to find the accretion disks
around low mass planets (e.g., 1 M$_{J}$) and distinguish them from brown
dwarfs or hot high mass planets, it is crucial to obtain photometry at
mid-infrared bands ($L'$, $M$, $N$ bands) because the emission from
circumplanetary disks falls off more slowly towards longer wavelengths than
those of brown dwarfs or planets. If young planets have strong magnetic fields
($\gtrsim$100 G), fields may truncate slowly accreting circumplanetary disks
($\dot{M}\lesssim10^{-9} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$) and lead to magnetospheric
accretion, which can provide additional accretion signatures, such as
UV/optical excess from the accretion shock and line emission.

variations in the intensity are produced by opacity fluctuations rather than
intrinsic temperature oscillations, except for frequencies between 5 and 6.5

associated to wave propagation. Our results suggest that this is due to the low

chromospheric Ca II infrared triplet lines show striking variations as shock
waves travel through the formation height of the lines, including emission
self-reversals in the line core and highly abnormal Stokes V profiles. Magnetic
field oscillations inferred from the Ca II infrared lines using the weak field

between the photosphere and the chromosphere.

introduce a unified framework to jointly design the optimal sensor selection

received less emphasis than other properties of meteorites such as their

various physical properties of chondrules, chondrule size is especially
important for the classification of chondrites into chemical groups, since each
chemical group possesses a distinct size-frequency distribution of chondrules.
Knowledge of the physical properties of chondrules is also vital for the
development of astrophysical models for chondrule formation, and for
understanding how to utilize asteroidal resources in space exploration. To
examine our current knowledge of chondrule sizes, we have compiled and provide
commentary on available chondrule dimension literature data. We include all
chondrite chemical groups as well as the acapulcoite primitive achondrites,
some of which contain relict chondrules. We also compile and review current
literature data for other astrophysically-relevant physical properties
(chondrule mass and density). Finally, we briefly examine some additional
physical aspects of chondrules such as the frequencies of compound and
'cratered' chondrules. A purpose of this compilation is to provide a useful
resource for meteoriticists and astrophysicists alike.

describe the cost of CPU and I/O operations in the system. By treating these

nonlinear interactions and energy dissipation play important roles in these

improve on this phenomenology by introducing the dissipation through a viscous

Using a first order approximation, we solve the equations of motion in the low

{\bf 73}, 174501 (2006)], in which the Fermi surface is partially truncated
into four nodal hole-like Fermi pockets by the antinodal RVB gap, we show that
the CDW order at the wavevectors connecting the tips of the Fermi arcs (the
hotspots) induces Fermi surface reconstruction, giving rise to an electron-like
Fermi pocket ($\alpha$ orbit) and a new hole-like Fermi pocket ($\beta$ orbit).
The $\alpha$ orbit is formed by joining the Fermi arcs at the hotspots and it
dominates the quantum oscillation Fourier spectrum, while the $\beta$ orbit is
formed by joining the outer patches of the original hole pockets, which has
vanishingly small spectral weight. The areas enclosed by these orbits are
extracted from the density of states oscillation in magnetic field and
quantitatively agree with the experiments.

the electron/positron pairs, which are created by the magnetic pair-creation

magnetic field region around the polar cap region dominates in the observed
emissions. Furthermore, the inclination angle of the soft gamma-ray pulsar is
relatively small, $\alpha\leq 30$~degree, and our line of sight is out of the

the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have
been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has
been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the
heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing

within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy
disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights

traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark
residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To

interactions. Namely, when an agent introduces two unconnected friends, the
rate at which a connection actually occurs between them depends on the number
of their mutual acquaintances. As this transitive interaction rate is varied,
the social network undergoes a dramatic clustering transition. Close to the
transition, the network consists of a collection of well-defined communities.
As a function of time, the network can also undergo an \emph{incomplete}
gelation transition, in which the gel, or giant cluster, does not constitute
the entire network, even at infinite time. Some of the clustering properties of
our model also arise, but in a more gradual manner, in Facebook networks.

mass scale for the explosion of white dwarfs as type Ia supernovae, models
allowing type Ia supernovae to explode at other masses have attracted much
recent attention. Using an empirical relation between the ejected mass and the
light curve width, we derive ejected masses $M_\mathrm{ej}$ and $^{56}$Ni
masses $M_\mathrm{Ni}$ for a sample of 337 type Ia supernovae with redshifts $z
< 0.7$ used in recent cosmological analyses. We use hierarchical Bayesian
inference to reconstruct the joint $M_\mathrm{ej}$-$M_\mathrm{Ni}$
distribution, accounting for measurement errors. The inferred marginal
distribution of $M_\mathrm{ej}$ has a long tail towards sub-Chandrasekhar
masses, but cuts off sharply above 1.4 $M_\odot$. Our results imply that
25\%-50\% of normal type Ia supernovae are inconsistent with Chandrasekhar-mass
explosions, with almost all of these being sub-Chandrasekhar-mass;
super-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions make up no more than 1\% of all
spectroscopically normal type Ia supernovae. We interpret the type Ia supernova
width-luminosity relation as an underlying relation between $M_\mathrm{ej}$ and
$M_\mathrm{Ni}$, and show that the inferred relation is not naturally explained

Identifying the isolated galactic systems each of which consists of a single
host galaxy and its satellites from the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and reconstructing linearly the velocity shear field in the
local universe, we measure the alignments between the relative positions of the
satellites from their isolated hosts and the principal axes of the local
velocity shear tensors projected on to the plane of sky. We find a clear signal
that the galactic satellites in isolated systems are located preferentially
along the directions of the minor principal axes of the large-scale velocity
shear field. Those galactic satellites which are spirals, brighter, located at
distances larger than the projected virial radii of the hosts and belonging to
the spiral hosts yield stronger alignment signals, which implies that the
alignment strength depends on the formation and accretion epochs of the
galactic satellites. It is also shown that the alignment strength is quite
insensitive to the cosmic web environment as well as the size and luminosity of
the isolated hosts. Although this result is consistent with the numerical
finding of Libeskind et al. based on a N-body experiment, due to the very low
significance of the observed signals it remains inconclusive whether or not the
velocity shear effect on the satellite distribution is truly universal.

concerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL
perform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what
conditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task
during simultaneous learning?
  In particular, we investigate two types of task-group relatedness: the
observed discrepancy-dependence measure (ODDM) and the empirical
discrepancy-dependence measure (EDDM), both of which detect the dependence
between two groups of multiple related tasks (MRTs). We then introduce the
Cartesian product-based uniform entropy number (CPUEN) to measure the
complexities of vector-valued function classes. By applying the specific
deviation and the symmetrization inequalities to the vector-valued framework,
we obtain the generalization bound for RMTL, which is the upper bound of the
joint probability of the event that there is at least one task with a large
empirical discrepancy between the expected and empirical risks. Finally, we
present a sufficient condition to guarantee the consistency of each task in the
simultaneous learning process, and we discuss how task relatedness affects the
generalization performance of RMTL. Our theoretical findings answer the

J_3-J_2 rotation temperatures of ~44 K, a typical linear size of ~0.036 pc, and
a typical beam averaged methanol abundance of several 10^(-9) (the beam
corrected value could reach several 10^(-7)). The abundances of the latter
three species, normalized by that of methanol, are found to be correlated also
across a large variety of clouds such as EGO cloud cores, hot corinos, massive
hot cores and Galactic Center clouds. The chemical properties of the EGO cloud
cores lie between that of hot cores and hot corinos. However, the abundances
and abundance ratios of the four species can not be satisfactorily explained by
recent chemical models either among the EGO cloud cores or among the various
types of cloud cores from literature.

Its effectiveness depends on the reliability, accuracy, and speed of the crowd
workers that drive it. These objectives are frequently at odds with one
another. For instance, how much time should workers be given to discover and
propose new solutions versus deliberate over those currently proposed? How do
we determine if discovering a new answer is appropriate at all? And how do we
manage workers who lack the expertise or attention needed to provide useful
input to a given task? We present a mechanism that uses distinct payoffs for
three possible worker actions---propose,vote, or abstain---to provide workers
with the necessary incentives to guarantee an effective (or even optimal)
balance between searching for new answers, assessing those currently available,
and, when they have insufficient expertise or insight for the task at hand,
abstaining. We provide a novel game theoretic analysis for this mechanism and
test it experimentally on an image---labeling problem and show that it allows a
system to reliably control the balance betweendiscovering new answers and
converging to existing ones.

singularity in the reflectivity of the dielectric slab for the incident
evanescent wave. Under suitable conditions, the surface mode grows as a result
of interaction with the electron beam. We show that the interaction of the

up coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations for the system, in analogy with

within globular clusters is the ""Fast Rotating Massive Star"" (FRMS) scenario,
where the ejecta of rapidly rotating massive stars is mixed with primordial
material left over from the star-formation process, to form a second generation
of stars within the decretion discs of the high mass stars. A requirement of
this model, at least in its current form, is that young massive (i.e.
proto-globular) clusters are not able to eject the unused gas and dust from the
star-formation process from the cluster for 20-30 Myr after the formation of
the first generation of stars, i.e. the cluster remains embedded within the gas
cloud in which it forms. Here, we test this prediction by performing a
literature search for young massive clusters in nearby galaxies, which have
ages less than 20 Myr that are not embedded. We report that a number of such
clusters exist, with masses near, or significantly above 10^6 Msun, with ages
between a few Myr and ~15 Myr, suggesting that even high mass clusters are able
to clear any natal gas within them within a few Myr after formation.
Additionally, one cluster, Cluster 23 in ESO~338-IG04, has a metallicity below
that of some Galactic globular clusters that have been found to host multiple
stellar populations, mitigating any potential effect of differences in
metallicity in the comparison. The clusters reported here are in contradiction
to the expectations of the FRMS scenario, at least in its current form.

stability of the instantaneous flow field is studied and transition from a
stable to an unstable state is characterized by the noting the time when the
eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis. It is observed that the flow becomes
unstable due to long wavelength axial waves. We find a critical Reynolds number
($\approx 5.6$) based on the shell angular velocity at neutral stability with
the corresponding Taylor number being $\approx 125.4$. Remarkably, we find that
this critical value is independent of the dimensionless groups governing the

and is a very time consuming procedure. For the Scottish Football Association
(SFA), the allocation of referees and other officials to matches is governed by
a number of rules specifying the expertise required from the different types of
official at each level, e.g. Scottish Premiership League referee must be a
grade 1 with high experience. The allocation requires an SFA secretary to
expend several hours to find suitable officials, contact them and assign them.
Most of the time, the secretary is a volunteer who performs the allocation as a
hobby and it would be useful to reduce his costs and time.
  The project aims to reduce the burden on SFA, and potentially other
secretaries, by developing a program to assign SFA officials. A suitable
algorithm must be devised to search through the set of data about matches and
officials and find a potential allocation. The program then updates the
database with the new data, and provides a web interface for both secretaries
and officials.
  A prototype system using the new greedy algorithm has been implemented and
evaluated with SFA secretaries. A final usable referee allocation system has
been designed that uses the greedy algorithm, and is extended after evaluation
of the prototype. The final allocation system based provides both a command
line and a web interface and has also been evaluated by SFA secretaries. In
their letters of recommendation in Appendix F the SFA secretaries indicate that
the final allocation system it will be used again in the future.

(OTE) Cooper pairs and anomalous surface magnetic response in time-reversal
invariant (TRI) spin-triplet superfluids and superconductors. The spin
susceptibility generally consists of two contributions: Even-frequency
odd-parity pair amplitudes and odd-frequency even-parity pair amplitudes. The
OTE pair amplitudes are absent in the bulk region, but ubiquitously exist in
the surface and interface region as Andreev bound states. We here clarify that
additional discrete symmetries, originating from the internal symmetry and
point group symmetry, impose strong constraint on the OTE pair amplitudes
emergent in the surface of TRI superfluids and superconductors. As a result of
the symmetry constraint, the magnetic response of the OTE pairs yields
Ising-like anisotropy. For the topological phase of the $^3$He-B in a
restricted geometry, the coupling of the OTE pair amplitudes to an applied
field is prohibited by an additional discrete symmetry. Once the discrete
symmetry is broken, however, the OTE pairs start to couple to the applied
field, which anomalously enhances surface spin susceptibility. Furthermore, we
extend this theory to TRI superconductors, where the corresponding discrete
symmetry is the mirror reflection symmetry.

high dimensions because of its abysmally slow acceptance rate. The slow
acceptance rate results from the fact that RWMH separately updates each
coordinate of the chain at every step. Dutta and Bhattacharya (2013) proposed a
new technique called Transformation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC)
aimed at overcoming these problems. This method updates all co-ordinates at a
time- ensuring stable acceptance in all dimensions.
  We have shown here that geometric ergodicity is achieved for sub-exponential
targets for two versions of TMCMC- the additive and the additive-multiplicative
hybrid TMCMC schemes. Also, we obtain the optimal scaling by maximizing the
diffusion speed of the limiting time-scaled diffusion process for TMCMC. We
show that the optimal acceptance rate is 0.439 for TMCMC which is almost twice
as large as RWMH (0.234). We observe that convergence to stationarity for TMCMC
is faster than RWMH but the mixing property in RWMH is relatively better.
However TMCMC is more robust with respect to scaling and dimensionality. This
is attested by simulation runs on Gaussian and nearest neighbor models.

combining these approaches, we find that the structure factor is essentially
determined by hard-core and screened electrostatic interactions. Other soft
short-ranged interactions (van der Waals and solvation-related) are either
individually insignificant or tend to cancel out. The structure factor is also
not significantly affected by charge fluctuations. For Mb and IFABP, with small
net charge and relatively symmetric charge distribution, the structure factor
is well described by a hard-sphere model. For BPTI, with larger net charge,
screened electrostatic repulsion is also important, but the asymmetry of the
charge distribution reduces the repulsion from that predicted by a charged
hard-sphere model with the same net charge. Such charge asymmetry may also
amplify the effect of shape asymmetry on the protein-protein potential of mean
force.

a challenge in modern astrophysics for more than 30 yr and their amplitude in

look for standing gravity modes through solar neutrino fluxes. We note that due
to a resonance effect, the gravity modes of low degree and low order have the
largest impact on the $^{8}B$ neutrino flux. The strongest effect is expected
to occur for the dipole mode with radial order $2$, corresponding to periods of
about 1.5 hr. These standing gravity waves produce temperature fluctuations
that are amplified by a factor of 170 in the boron neutrino flux for the
corresponding period, in consonance with the gravity modes. From current
neutrino observations, we determine that the maximum temperature variation due
to the gravity modes in the Sun's core is smaller than $5.8\times 10^{-4}$.
This study clearly shows that due to their high sensitivity to the temperature,
the $^8B$ neutrino flux time series is an excellent tool to determine the
properties of gravity modes in the solar core. Moreover, if gravity mode
footprints are discovered in the $^{8}B$ neutrino flux, this opens a new line
of research to probe the physics of the solar core as non-standing gravity
waves of higher periods cannot be directly detected by helioseismology but
could leave their signature on boron neutrino or on other neutrino fluxes.

an ""entropy index"". This entropy index is invariant with respect to marginal
non-decreasing transformations and can be used to quantify the intensity of the
vector components association in arbitrary dimensions. We show the
applicability of our entropy index by an example with real data of 4 stock

high transverse momentum (P_T) observables has become available to study the
physics of the interaction of hard partons with a QCD medium. Similarly,
multiple theoretical models for this interaction exist and have been compared
with available data, and regularly physics conclusions are drawn based on the
agreement of a model with a particular data subset. However, such an agreement
is only a necessary condition to identify a physics mechanism, not a sufficient
one - it needs to be demonstrated that the agreement is not accidential or
generic, in other words the observable actually needs to measure the physics in
question. The aim of the study presented here is to illustrate this problem by
computing various high P_T observables in three different models, two of which
are known to be grossly wrong ab initio, and to study in which observables what
amount of discrepancy with the data appears. The surprising outcome is that jet
yield observables are not very sensitive to the physics mechanism of jet-medium

an algorithm is developed via iteratively majorizing the surrogate function by
a quadratic separable function, which at each iteration reduces to a regular

on smoothing is proposed to deal with the ""singularity issue"" that arises when
a quadratic function is used to majorize the nondifferentiable surrogate

discuss the abundances of eight elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Cr, Ni, and
Y). The trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar to
those in the solar neighbourhood. We find a natural division between alpha-rich
and alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [Mg/M] distributions
in bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,
respectively. With the possible exception of Al, the observed dispersion around
the trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room for
astrophysical dispersion. Using previously derived distances from Recio-Blanco
et al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended vertically
and is more centrally concentrated towards the inner Galaxy than the thin-disc,
which indicates a shorter scale-length. We derive the radial and vertical
gradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and Al for the
two populations, taking into account the identified correlation between R_GC
and |Z|. Radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. The positive
radial individual [alpha/M] gradients found are at variance from the gradients
observed in the RAVE survey. The thin disc also hosts a negative vertical
metallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/M] and [Al/M]
gradients. The thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallower
vertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-iron
radial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positive

exhibited a maximum blue-shift of 1.6 km/s, an area of 5.2 arcsec^2, and an
uninterrupted lifetime of 1 hr. The blue-shifted feature, when present, lies
parallel to red-shifts. Both blue and red shifts flank a highly
inclined/horizontal magnetic structure that is radially oriented in the
penumbra. The low-cadence SP maps reveal changes in size, radial position in
the penumbra and line-of-sight velocity of the blue-shifted feature, from one
scan to the other. There was an increase of nearly 500 G in the field strength
and a marginal reduction in the field inclination of about 10 deg with the
onset of the blue-shifts. In the chromosphere, intense, arc-shaped brightenings
were observed close to the location of the blue-shifts, that extend from the
edge of the umbral core to the penumbra-quiet Sun boundary. The strongest and
largest brightenings were observed about 30 min after the strongest blue-shifts
were detected at the photosphere. The close spatial proximity of the two
phenomenon strongly suggests a causal relationship. The blue-shifted feature
represents plasma motion that could be related to a magnetic structure that
rises in the solar atmosphere and subsequently reconnects with the ambient
chromospheric magnetic field of the sunspot or an inverse Evershed flow, which
would be unique in the photosphere. This transient phenomena is presumably
related to the dynamic stability of the sunspot because the corresponding
umbral core separated two days later at the location of the blue-shifts and
fragmented subsequently.

domain of linear independent component analysis. Despite its success, it is
observed that FastICA occasionally yields outcomes that do not correspond to
any true solutions (known as demixing vectors) of the ICA problem. These
outcomes are commonly referred to as spurious solutions. Although FastICA is
among the most extensively studied ICA algorithms, the occurrence of spurious
solutions are not yet completely understood by the community. In this
contribution, we aim at addressing this issue. In the first part of this work,
we are interested in the relationship between demixing vectors, local
optimizers of the contrast function and (attractive or unattractive) fixed
points of FastICA algorithm. Characterizations of these sets are given, and an
inclusion relationship is discovered. In the second part, we investigate the
possible scenarios where spurious solutions occur. We show that when certain
bimodal Gaussian mixtures distributions are involved, there may exist spurious
solutions that are attractive fixed points of FastICA. In this case, popular
nonlinearities such as ""gauss"" or ""tanh"" tend to yield spurious solutions,
whereas only ""kurtosis"" may give reliable results. Some advices are given for

We examine two popular approaches to this problem, the coalescent and the

birth rates in a population growing exponentially according to the birth-death
branching process. For sequences sampled at a single time, we found the
coalescent and the birth-death-sampling model gave virtually indistinguishable
results in terms of the growth rates and fraction of the population sampled,
even when sampling from a small population. For sequences sampled at multiple
time points, we find that the birth-death model estimators are subject to large
bias if the sampling process is misspecified. Since birth-death-sampling models
incorporate a model of the sampling process, we show how much of the
statistical power of birth-death-sampling models arises from the sequence of
sample times and not from the genealogical tree. This motivates the development
of a new coalescent estimator, which is augmented with a model of the known
sampling process and is potentially more precise than the coalescent that does
not use sample time information.

scheme under study is to extend the singlet $(S)$ - triplet $(T_0)$ qubit
decoherence time $T_2^{*}$ by dynamically transferring the polarization from
the electron spins to the nuclear spins. This polarization transfer is achieved
by cycling the electron spins over the $S-T_+$ anticrossing. Here, we
investigate, both quantitatively and qualitatively, how this hyperfine mediated
dynamical polarization transfer is influenced by the Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction. In addition to $T_2^*$, we determine the singlet return
probability $P_s$, a quantity that can be measured in experiments. Our results
suggest that the spin-orbit interaction establishes a mechanism that can
polarize the nuclear spins in the opposite direction compared to hyperfine
mediated nuclear spin polarization. In materials with relatively strong
spin-orbit coupling, this interplay of spin-orbit and hyperfine mediated
nuclear spin polarizations prevents any notable increase of the $S-T_0$ qubit

so-called extremely low-mass white dwarfs, has opened the unprecedented
opportunity of probing the internal structure of these ancient stars. We
present a detailed adiabatic pulsational study of these stars based on a new
set of He-core white-dwarf models with masses ranging from $0.1554$ to $0.4352
M_{\odot}$ derived by computing the non-conservative evolution of a binary
system consisting of an initially $1 M_{\odot}$ ZAMS star and a $1.4 M_{\odot}$
neutron star. We computed adiabatic radial ($\ell= 0$) and non-radial ($\ell=
1, 2$) $p$ and $g$ modes to assess the dependence of the pulsational properties
of these objects on stellar parameters such as the stellar mass and the
effective temperature, as well as the effects of element diffusion. We found
that for white dwarf models with masses below $\sim 0.18 M_{\odot}$, $g$ modes
mainly probe the core regions and $p$ modes the envelope, therefore pulsations
offer the opportunity of constraining both the core and envelope chemical
structure of these stars via asteroseismology. For models with $M_* \gtrsim
0.18 M_{\odot}$, on the other hand, $g$ modes are very sensitive to the He/H
compositional gradient and therefore can be used as a diagnostic tool for
constraining the H envelope thickness. Because both types of objects have not
only very distinct evolutionary histories (according to whether the progenitor
stars have experienced CNO-flashes or not), but also have strongly different
pulsation properties, we propose to define white dwarfs with masses below $\sim
0.18 M_{\odot}$ as ELM (extremely low-mass) white dwarfs, and white dwarfs with
$M_* \gtrsim 0.18 M_{\odot}$ as LM (low-mass) white dwarfs.

intersects itself and grows forever when run in the full-plane. At each time
step the walk chooses the next step uniformly from among the allowable nearest
neighbors of the current endpoint of the walk. In the full-plane a nearest
neighbor is allowable if it has not been visited before and there is a path
from the nearest neighbor to infinity through sites that have not been visited
before. It is well known that on the hexagonal lattice the SKSAW in a bounded
domain between two boundary points is equivalent to an interface in critical
percolation, and hence its scaling limit is the chordal Schramm-Loewner
evolution with kappa=6 (SLE_6). Like SLE there are variants of the SKSAW
depending on the domain and the initial and terminal points. On the hexagonal
lattice these variants have been shown to converge to the corresponding version
of SLE_6. We conjecture that the scaling limit of all these variants on any
regular lattice is the corresponding version of SLE_6. We test this conjecture
for the square lattice by simulating the SKSAW in the full-plane and find
excellent agreement with the predictions of full-plane SLE_6.

implementations of deterministic and randomized BSP sorting algorithms is
examined. The deterministic algorithm uses deterministic regular oversampling
and parallel sample sorting and is augmented to handle duplicate keys
transparently with optimal asymptotic efficiency. The randomized algorithm is
sample-sort based and uses oversampling and the ideas introduced with the
deterministic algorithm. The resulting randomized design, however, works
differently from traditional parallel sample-sort based algorithms and is also
augmented to transparently handle duplicate keys with optimal asymptotic
efficiency thus eliminating the need to tag all input keys and to double

work-load evenly among the processors and the use and precise tuning of
oversampling that the BSP analysis allows combined with the transparent
duplicate-key handling insures regular and balanced communication.

the series are called ""Artinian Gorenstein algebras with linear resolutions"",
(arXiv:1306.2523) and ""The explicit minimal resolution constructed from a
Macaulay inverse system"". In the present paper, we give the explicit minimal
resolution of an Artinian Gorenstein algebra with a linear resolution. This
minimal resolution is given in a polynomial manner in terms of the coefficients
of the Macaulay inverse system for the Gorenstein algebra.
  Let k be a field, A a standard-graded Artinian Gorenstein k-algebra, S the
standard-graded polynomial ring Sym(A_1), I the kernel of the natural
surjection from S to A, d the vector space dimension of A_1, and n the least
index with I_n not equal to 0. Assume that 3<= d and 2<= n. In this paper, we
give the structure of the minimal homogeneous resolution B of A by free
S-modules, provided B is Gorenstein-linear.
  Our description of B depends on a fixed decomposition of A_1 of the form k
x_1\oplus V_0, for some non-zero element x_1 and some d-1 dimensional subspace
V_0 of A_1. Much information about B is already contained in the complex
Bbar=B/x_1B, which we call the skeleton of B. One striking feature of B is the
fact that the skeleton of B is completely determined by the data (d,n); no
other information about A is used in the construction of Bbar.
  The skeleton Bbar is the mapping cone of zero: K->L, where L is a well known
resolution of Buchsbaum and Eisenbud; K is the dual of L; and L and K are
comprised of Schur and Weyl modules associated to hooks, respectively. The
decomposition of Bbar into Schur and Weyl modules lifts to a decomposition of
B; furthermore, B inherits the natural self-duality of Bbar.
  As an application we observe that every non-zero element of A_1 is a weak
Lefschetz element for A.

attribution of about 80 transitions of up to fifth order Raman processes are
proposed in the low temperature(95K)resonant Raman spectrum measured with the
excitation energy of 1.96 eV,which is slightly shifted from the A exciton. We
propose that the main contributions come from four
phonons:A1g(M),E12g(M2),E22g(M1)(TA'(M))and E22g (M2)(LA'(M)). The last three
are single degenerate phonons at M with an origin of the E12g(gamma)and
E22g(gamma)phonons. Among the four phonons, we identify in the resonant Raman
spectra all(but one) of the second order overtones,combination and difference
bands and many of the third order bands. Consistent with the expectation that
at the M point only combinations with the same inversion symmetry (g or u)are
Raman allowed, the contribution of combinations with the LA(M)phonon can not be
considered with the above four phonons. Although minor,contribution from K
point and possibly gamma point phonons are also evident. The ""2LA
band"",measured at ~460 cm-1 is reassigned.Supported by the striking similarity
between this band, measured under off resonant conditions, and recently
published two phonon density of states, we propose that the lower part of the
band,previously attributed to 2LA(M),is due to a van Hove singularity between K
and M. The higher part,previously attributed exclusively to the
A2u(gamma)phonon,is mostly due to the LA and LA' phonons at M. For the
monolayer MoS2, the second order phonon processes from M and gamma Brillouin
zone points are also analyzed and are discussed within similar framework to
that of the bulk.

L1688, Serpens Main, Serpens South, IRAS 20050+2720, IC1396A, and Ceph C).
There are ~29,000 unique objects with light curves in either or both IRAC
channels in the YSOVAR data set. We present the data collection and reduction
for the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the ""standard sample"" on which
we calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs about
twice per day for ~40d. We also define a ""standard sample of members"",
consisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. We
characterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral
energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the
fast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, and
significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales
possible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer
mission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each
cluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the
ratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a
higher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term
variables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,
we find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter
periods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability that
causes [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of members
and field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.

also shows big and significant regions of coherence inside 12-19 yr band. Our
results ruled out classical tidal effects in this problem; but suggest that, if
these rivers are trully related to solar barycentric motion, the physical
origin of this connection might be related to a working solar spin-orbit

correlation functions. Those functions can be computed by using molecular
simulations such as molecular dynamic or Monte Carlo. It is also possible to
use functions that have been determined experimentally. The functional
minimization gives access to the solvation free energy and to the equilibrium
solvent density. Some correction to the functional are also proposed to get the
proper tetrahedral order of solvent molecules around a charged solute and to
reproduce the correct long range hydrophobic behavior of big apolar solutes. To
proceed the numerical minimization of the functional, the theory has been
discretized on two tridimensional grids, one for the space coordinates, the
other for the angular coordinates, in a functional minimization code written in
modern Fortran, mdft. This program is used to study the solvation in water of
small solutes of several kind, atomic and molecular, charged or neutral. More
complex solutes, a neutral clay and a small protein have also been studied by
functional minimization. In each case the classical density functional theory
is able to reproduce the exact results predicted by MD. The computational cost
is at least three order of magnitude less than in explicit methods.

Hawaii Island, plus a site station at the center watching the lower night sky.
Sensitivities equivalent to $> 100$ km$^3$ water and pointing accuracy of $<
0.2^\circ$ can be achieved with Cherenkov-fluorescence stereoscopic observation
for PeV-EeV neutrinos that is almost background-free. With design based on
experience from Ashra-1 and the goal of clear discovery and identification of
astronomical $\nu_\tau$ sources, a new international collaboration is being

of interest in field theories and cosmology. We consider an interacting scalar
field and show that the vacuum energy naturally takes any value between its
maximum and zero because interaction affects the number of operating field
modes, the assertion that involves no assumptions or postulates. The mechanism
is similar to the recently discussed temperature evolution of collective modes
in liquids. The cosmological implication concerns the evolution of scalar field
$\phi$ during the inflation of the Universe. $\phi$ starts with all field modes
operating and maximal vacuum energy in the early inflation-dominated epoch. As
a result of inflation, $\phi$ undergoes a dynamical crossover and arrives in
the state with one long-wavelength longitudinal mode and small positive vacuum
energy predicted to be asymptotically decreasing to zero in the late epoch.
Accordingly, we predict that the currently observed cosmological constant will
decrease in the future, and comment on the possibility of a cyclic Universe.

defined for decades, now receives significant attention -- both theoretically,
in order to understand what happens to stars in the ~15-25Mo range, and
observationally, with two independent studies suggesting that they cannot be
cleanly separated photometrically from the regular hydrogen-rich SNe II-P
characterised by a marked plateau in their light curve. Here, we analyze the
multi-band light curves and extensive spectroscopic coverage of a sample of 35
SNe II and find that 11 of them could be SNe II-L. The spectra of these SNe are
hydrogen deficient, typically have shallow Halpha absorption, may show indirect
signs of helium via strong OI 7774 absorption, and have faster line velocities
consistent with a thin hydrogen shell. The light curves can be mostly
differentiated from those of the regular, hydrogen-rich SNe II-P by their
steeper decline rates and higher luminosity, and we propose as a defining
photometric characteristic the decline in the V band: SNe II-L seem to decline
by more than 0.5 mag from peak brightness by day 50 after explosion. Using our
sample we provide template light curves for SNe II-L and II-P in 4 photometric
bands.

  Vol. 5, 35-51","10.18052/www.scipress.com/IJARM.5.35",,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The investigation of the asymptotic behavior of trigonometric series near the
origin is a prominent topic in mathematical analysis. For trigonometric series
in one variable, this problem was exhaustively studied by various authors in a
series of publications dating back to the work of G. H. Hardy, 1928.
  Trigonometric series in several variables have got less attention. The aim of
the work is to partially fill this gap by finding the asymptotics of
trigonometric series in several variables with the terms, having a form of `one
minus the cosine' up to a decreasing power-like factor: \[
\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}^{d}\setminus\{0\}}\frac{1}{\|z\|^{d+\alpha}}\left(1-\cos\langle
z,\theta\rangle\right), \qquad \theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}, \] where
$\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is the standard inner product and $\|\cdot\|$ is
the max-norm on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
  The approach developed in the paper is quite elementary and essentially
algebraic. It does not rely on the classic machinery of the asymptotic analysis
such as slowly varying functions, Tauberian theorems or the Abel transform.
However, in our case, it allows to obtain explicit expressions for the
asymptotics and to extend to the general case $d\ge 1$ classical results of G.
H. Hardy and other authors known for $d=1$.

accurately incorporates reversible moist processes in flows whose features of
interest occur on advective rather than acoustic time scales. Total water is
used as a prognostic variable, so that water vapor and liquid water are
diagnostically recovered as needed from an exact Clausius--Clapeyron formula
for moist thermodynamics. Low Mach number models can be computationally more
efficient than a fully compressible model, but the low Mach number formulation
introduces additional mathematical and computational complexity because of the
divergence constraint imposed on the velocity field. Here, latent heat release
is accounted for in the source term of the constraint by estimating the rate of
phase change based on the time variation of saturated water vapor subject to
the thermodynamic equilibrium constraint. We numerically assess the validity of
the low Mach number approximation for moist atmospheric flows by contrasting
the low Mach number solution to reference solutions computed with a fully
compressible formulation for a variety of test problems.
