junctions. In order to investigate the heat dissipation in the electrodes and
the relationship between the transmission spectra and the electronic
structures, we consider a toy model that in which electrodes linked by a
two-level molecular bridge. By using of the Landauer approach, we show how heat
dissipation in the electrodes of a molecular junction is related to its
transmission characteristics. We show that in general heat is not equally
dissipated in the left and right electrodes of the junction and it depends on
the bias polarity and the positions of molecule's energy levels with respect to
the Fermi level. Also, we exploit the C$_{60}$ molecule as a junction and the
results show a good agreement with the toy model. Our results for the heat
dissipation are remarkable in the sense that they can be used to detect which
energy levels of a junction are dominated in the transport process.

variety is automatically understanding the underlying structures and patterns
of the data. Such an understanding is required as a pre-requisite to the
application of advanced analytics to the data. Further, big data sets often
contain anomalies and errors that are difficult to know a priori. Current
approaches to understanding data structure are drawn from the traditional
database ontology design. These approaches are effective, but often require too
much human involvement to be effective for the volume, velocity and variety of
data encountered by big data systems. Dimensional Data Analysis (DDA) is a
proposed technique that allows big data analysts to quickly understand the
overall structure of a big dataset, determine anomalies. DDA exploits
structures that exist in a wide class of data to quickly determine the nature
of the data and its statical anomalies. DDA leverages existing schemas that are
employed in big data databases today. This paper presents DDA, applies it to a
number of data sets, and measures its performance. The overhead of DDA is low

Safanov as a tool for analyzing robustness of system stability and performance
in the presence of structured uncertainty in the system parameters. While the
structured singular value provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for
robustness with respect to a structured ball of uncertainty, it is notoriously
difficult to actually compute. The method of diagonal (or simply ""D"") scaling,
on the other hand, provides an easily computable upper bound (which we call
$\hat \mu$) for the structured singular value, but provides an exact evaluation
of $\mu$ (or even a useful upper bound for $\mu$) only in special cases.
However it was discovered in the 1990s that a certain enhancement of the
uncertainty structure (i.e., letting the uncertainty parameters be freely
noncommuting linear operators on an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert
space) resulted in the $D$-scaling procedure leading to an exact evaluation of
$\mu_{\text{enhanced}}$ ($\mu_{\text{enhanced}} = \hat \mu$), at least for the
tractable special cases which were analyzed in complete detail. On the one hand
this enhanced uncertainty has some appeal from the physical point of view: one
can allow the uncertainty in the plant parameters to be time-varying, or more
generally, one can catch the uncertainty caused by the designer's decision not
to model the more complex (e.g. nonlinear) dynamics of the true plant. On the
other hand, the precise mathematical formulation of this enhanced uncertainty
structure makes contact with developments in the growing theory of analytic
functions in freely noncommuting arguments and associated formal power series
in freely noncommuting indeterminates. In this article we obtain the
$\widetilde \mu = \hat \mu$ theorem for a more satisfactory general setting.

for the existence of these HVTs. He derived an inequality, which must be

incompatible with any local-realistic theory. Later it has been shown that

family of $m \geq 1$ Bloch bands, separated by a gap from the rest of the
spectrum, and we investigate the localization properties of the corresponding
composite Wannier functions. To this aim, we show that in dimension $d \leq 3$
there exists a global frame consisting of smooth quasi-Bloch functions which
are both periodic and time-reversal symmetric. Aiming to applications in
computational physics, we provide a constructive algorithm to obtain such a
Bloch frame. The construction yields the existence of a basis of composite
Wannier functions which are real-valued and almost-exponentially localized.
  The proof of the main result exploits only the fundamental symmetries of the
projector on the relevant bands, allowing applications, beyond the model
specified above, to a broad range of gapped periodic quantum systems with a
time-reversal symmetry of bosonic type.

  Yuan","Answering Regular Path Queries on Workflow Provenance",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel approach for efficiently evaluating regular path
queries over provenance graphs of workflows that may include recursion. The
approach assumes that an execution g of a workflow G is labeled with
query-agnostic reachability labels using an existing technique. At query time,
given g, G and a regular path query R, the approach decomposes R into a set of
subqueries R1, ..., Rk that are safe for G. For each safe subquery Ri, G is
rewritten so that, using the reachability labels of nodes in g, whether or not
there is a path which matches Ri between two nodes can be decided in constant
time. The results of each safe subquery are then composed, possibly with some
small unsafe remainder, to produce an answer to R. The approach results in an
algorithm that significantly reduces the number of subqueries k over existing
techniques by increasing their size and complexity, and that evaluates each
subquery in time bounded by its input and output size. Experimental results
demonstrate the benefit of this approach.

to find a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ of minimum weight. Let $h(w)$ denote the
average weight of a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ for the weighting $w$. Vizing
(1973) asked whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm which always finds a
Hamilton cycle of weight at most $h(w)$. He answered this question in the
affirmative and subsequently Rublineckii (1973) and others described several
other TSP heuristics satisfying this property. In this paper, we prove a
considerable generalisation of Vizing's result: for each fixed $k$, we give an
algorithm that decides whether, for any input edge weighting $w$ of $K_n$,
there is a Hamilton cycle of $K_n$ of weight at most $h(w)-k$ (and constructs
such a cycle if it exists). For $k$ fixed, the running time of the algorithm is

the computation of optimal conditional and robust projection estimates in a
nonlinear estimation setting where the operator relating the data and the

function and the uncertainties affecting the data are assumed to belong to
semialgebraic sets. By noticing that the computation of both the conditional

optimization problems that share the same structure, we propose a unified
two-stage approach based on semidefinite-relaxation techniques for solving such
estimation problems. The key idea of the proposed procedure is to recognize
that the optimal functional of the inner optimization problems can be
approximated to any desired precision by a multivariate polynomial function by
suitably exploiting recently proposed results in the field of parametric
optimization. Two simulation examples are reported to show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

provide numerical evidences that support ETH in this strong sense. Finally,
periodically driving the Ising Hamiltonian, we show that the eigenstates of the

standard path loss model where received power decays like $\|x\|^{-\alpha}$
over a distance $\|x\|$. This standard path loss model is quite idealized, and
in most scenarios the path loss exponent $\alpha$ is itself a function of
$\|x\|$, typically an increasing one. Enforcing a single path loss exponent can
lead to orders of magnitude differences in average received and interference
powers versus the true values. In this paper we study \emph{multi-slope} path
loss models, where different distance ranges are subject to different path loss
exponents. We focus on the dual-slope path loss function, which is a piece-wise
power law and continuous and accurately approximates many practical scenarios.
We derive the distributions of SIR, SNR, and finally SINR before finding the
potential throughput scaling, which provides insight on the observed
cell-splitting rate gain. The exact mathematical results show that the SIR
monotonically decreases with network density, while the converse is true for
SNR, and thus the network coverage probability in terms of SINR is maximized at
some finite density. With ultra-densification (network density goes to
infinity), there exists a \emph{phase transition} in the near-field path loss
exponent $\alpha_0$: if $\alpha_0 >1$ unbounded potential throughput can be
achieved asymptotically; if $\alpha_0 <1$, ultra-densification leads in the
extreme case to zero throughput.

message-passing networks (the CONGEST model). Let $\lambda$ be the minimum cut,
$n$ be the number of nodes in the network, and $D$ be the network diameter. Our
algorithm can compute $\lambda$ exactly in $O((\sqrt{n} \log^{*} n+D)\lambda^4
\log^2 n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that
explicitly studies computing the exact minimum cut in the distributed setting.
Previously, non-trivial sublinear time algorithms for this problem are known
only for unweighted graphs when $\lambda\leq 3$ due to Pritchard and
Thurimella's $O(D)$-time and $O(D+n^{1/2}\log^* n)$-time algorithms for
computing $2$-edge-connected and $3$-edge-connected components.
  By using the edge sampling technique of Karger's, we can convert this
algorithm into a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation $O((\sqrt{n}\log^{*}
n+D)\epsilon^{-5}\log^3 n)$-time algorithm for any $\epsilon>0$. This improves
over the previous $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation $O((\sqrt{n}\log^{*}

$O(\epsilon^{-1})$-approximation $O(D+n^{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}
\mathrm{poly}\log n)$-time algorithm of Ghaffari and Kuhn. Due to the lower
bound of $\Omega(D+n^{1/2}/\log n)$ by Das Sarma et al. which holds for any
approximation algorithm, this running time is tight up to a $ \mathrm{poly}\log
n$ factor.
  To get the stated running time, we developed an approximation algorithm which
combines the ideas of Thorup's algorithm and Matula's contraction algorithm. It
saves an $\epsilon^{-9}\log^{7} n$ factor as compared to applying Thorup's tree
packing theorem directly. Then, we combine Kutten and Peleg's tree partitioning
algorithm and Karger's dynamic programming to achieve an efficient distributed
algorithm that finds the minimum cut when we are given a spanning tree that
crosses the minimum cut exactly once.

Particles interact according to a long-range attractive and a short-range

force between particles and their carrier fluid, and find analytic
single-peaked traveling solutions for the spatial density of particles in the
catastrophic phase. In steady flow conditions the streaming velocity of
particles is identical to their carrier fluid, but we show that particle
streaming is asynchronous with an unsteady carrier fluid. Using linear
perturbation analysis, the stability of traveling solutions is investigated in
unsteady conditions. It is shown that the resulting dispersion relation is an
integral equation of the Fredholm type, and yields two general families of
stable modes: singular modes whose eigenvalues form a continuous spectrum, and
a finite number of discrete global modes. Depending on the value of drag
coefficient, stable modes can be over-damped, critically damped, or decaying
oscillatory waves. The results of linear perturbation analysis are confirmed
through the numerical solution of the fully nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation.

system with both inherent quantum noises and non-perturbative nonlinearity. Due
to the possibly drastic intensity increase of an input coherent light in the
gain-loss waveguide couplers with parity-time (PT) symmetry, the Kerr effect
from a nonlinearity added into the systems can be greatly enhanced, and is
expected to create the macroscopic entangled states of the output light fields
with huge photon numbers. Meanwhile, the quantum noises also coexist with the
amplification and dissipation of the light fields. Under the interplay between
the quantum noises and nonlinearity, the quantum dynamical behaviors of the
systems become rather complicated. However, the important quantum noise effects
have been mostly neglected in the previous studies about nonlinear PT-symmetric
systems. Here we present a solution to this non-perturbative quantum nonlinear
problem, showing the real-time evolution of the system observables. The
enhanced Kerr nonlinearity is found to give rise to a previously unknown
decoherence effect that is irrelevant to the quantum noises, and imposes a
limit on the emergence of macroscopic nonclassicality. In contrast to what
happen in the linear systems, the quantum noises exert significant impact on
the system dynamics, and can create the nonclassical light field states in
conjunction with the enhanced Kerr nonlinearity. This first study on the noise
involved quantum nonlinear dynamics of the coupled gain-loss waveguides can
help to better understand the quantum noise effects in the broad nonlinear

networks (BANs) using a finite repeated non-cooperative game, in which BANs are
rational players but act selfishly. A game-theoretic based transmit power
control scheme employing a novel utility function is proposed to maximize each
network's packet delivery ratio (PDR) at low transmit power. The proposed
utility function penalizes players with high transmission power, which reduces
the interference caused to other coexisting BANs. Considering the purpose of
inter-BAN interference mitigation, PDR is expressed as a compressed exponential
function of inverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), so it is
essentially a function of transmit powers of all coexisting BANs. It is proven
that a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists and hence there is a subgame-perfect
equilibrium, considering best-response at each stage independent of history.
Realistic and extensive on- and inter-body channel models are employed. Results
confirm that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in better interference
management, greater reliability and reduced transmit power, comparing with
other schemes commonly applied in BAN.

construction of off-shell amplitudes satisfying the desired factorization

hole and wormhole space times is studied. In particular, the self force of a
point charge in the geometry is characterized analitically. The differences
between the self force in both cases is a theoretical experiment for
distinguishing both geometries, which otherwise are locally indistinguishable.
This idea was applied before to four and higher dimensional black holes by the
present and other authors. However, the particularities of the BTZ geometry
makes the analysis considerable more complicated than usual electrostatic in a
flat geometry, and its even harder than its four dimensional counterparts.
First, the BTZ space times are not asymptotically flat but instead
asymptotically AdS. In addition, the relative distance $d(r,r+1)$ between two
particles located at a radius $r$ and $r+1$ in the geometry tends to zero when
$r\to\infty$. This behavior, which is radically different in a flat geometry,
changes the analysis of the asymptotic conditions for the electrostatic field.
In addition, there are no summation formulas that allow a closed analytic
expression for the self force. We find a method to calculate such force in
series, and the resulting expansion is convergent to the real solution.
However, we suspect that the convergence is not uniform. In other, for points
that are far away from the black hole the calculation of the force requires
higher order summation. These subtleties are carefully analyzed in the paper,
and it is shown that they lead to severe problems when calculating the self
force for asymptotic points in the geometry.

coupling between ferroelectric (FE) and magnetic orders in several prototypical
types of multiferroic manganites. The model was constructed for the
magnetically active Mn $3d$ bands in the basis of Wannier functions and include
the effect of screened on-site Coulomb interactions. The essence of our
approach for the FE polarization is to use the Berry phase theory, formulated
in terms of occupied Wannier functions, and to evaluate the asymmetric
spin-dependent change of these functions in the framework of the DE model. This
enables us to quantify the effect of the magnetic symmetry breaking and derive
several useful expressions for the electronic polarization ${\bf P}$, depending
on the relative directions of spins. The proposed theory is applied to the
solution of three major problems: (i) The magnetic-state dependence of ${\bf
P}$ in hexagonal manganites; (ii) The microscopic relationship between canted
ferromagnetism and ${\bf P}$ in monoclinic BiMnO$_3$; (iii) The origin of FE
activity in orthorhombic manganites. We show that for an arbitrary noncollinear
magnetic structure, propagating along the orthorhombic $\boldsymbol{b}$ axis
and antiferromagnetically coupled $\boldsymbol{c}$, ${\bf P}$ can be obtained
by scaling the one of the E-phase with the prefactor depending only on the
relative directions of spins and being the measure of the spin inhomogeneity.
This picture works equally well for the twofold (HoMnO$_3$) and fourfold

periodic magnetic structure is strongly inhomogeneous, that leads to large
${\bf P}$. On the contrary, the fourfold periodic magnetic structure can be
viewed as a moderately distorted homogeneous spin spiral, which corresponds to
weaker ${\bf P}$.

parabolic subgroup deforms to define a module $\mathcal{M}^J$ of the group's
Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}$ with a particularly simple form. Rains and
Vazirani have introduced the notion of a quasiparabolic set to characterize
$W$-sets for which analogous deformations exist; a motivating example is the
conjugacy class of fixed point free involutions in the symmetric group. Deodhar
has shown that the module $\mathcal{M}^J$ possesses a certain antilinear
involution, called the bar operator, and a certain basis invariant under this
involution, which generalizes the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of $\mathcal{H}$. The
well-known significance of this basis in representation theory makes it natural
to seek to extend Deodhar's results to the quasiparabolic setting. In general,
the obstruction to finding such an extension is the existence of an appropriate
quasiparabolic analogue of the ""bar operator."" In this paper, we consider the
most natural definition of a quasiparabolic bar operator, and develop a theory
of ""quasiparabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig bases"" under the hypothesis that such a bar
operator exists. Giving content to this theory, we prove that a bar operator in
the desired sense does exist for quasiparabolic $W$-sets given by twisted
conjugacy classes of twisted involutions. Finally, we prove several results
classifying the quasiparabolic conjugacy classes in a Coxeter group.

  Role of Polymers with Sacrificial Bonds and Hidden Length",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sacrificial bonds and hidden length (SBHL) in structural molecules provide a
mechanism for energy dissipation at the nanoscale. It is hypothesized that
their presence leads to greater fracture toughness than what is observed in
materials without such features. Here, we investigate this hypothesis using a
simplified model of a mineralized collagen fibril sliding on a polymeric
interface with SBHL systems. A 1D coarse-grained nonlinear spring-mass system
is used to model the fibril. Rate-and-displacement constitutive equations are
used to describe the mechanical properties of the polymeric system. The model
quantifies how the interface toughness increases as a function of polymer
density and number of sacrificial bonds. Other characteristics of the SBHL
system, such as the length of hidden loops and the strength of the bonds, are
found to influence the results. The model also gives insight into the
variations in the mechanical behavior in response to physiological changes,
such as the degree of mineralization of the collagen fibril and polymer density
in the interfibrillar matrix. The model results provide constraints relevant
for bio-mimetic material design and multiscale modeling of fracture in human
bone.

in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been investigated on grounds of
Grand-Canonical Quantized Liquid Density-Functional Theory (GC-QLDFT)
calculations. For this purpose, we have carefully validated classical H2 -host
interaction potentials that are obtained by fitting Born-Oppenheimer ab initio
reference data. The hydrogen adsorption has first been assessed classically
using Liquid Density-Functional Theory (LDFT) and the Grand-Canonical Monte
Carlo (GCMC) methods. The results have been compared against the semi-classical
treatment of quantum effects by applying the Feynman-Hibbs correction to the
Born-Oppenheimer-derived potentials, and by explicit treatment within the
Grand-Canonical Quantized Liquid Density-Functional Theory (GC-QLDFT). The
results are compared with experimental data and indicate pronounced quantum and
possibly many-particle effects. After validation calculations have been carried
out for IRMOF-1 (MOF-5), GC-QLDFT is applied to study the adsorption of H2 in a
series of MOFs, including IRMOF-4, -6, -8, -9, -10, -12, -14, -16, -18 and
MOF-177. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the H2 quantum fluid with
increasing pressure and lowering temperature.

paper we present the experimental DC and AC characterization of several coils
assembled from a 5 meter long Roebel cable built at KIT, which differ in the
number of turns and turn-to-turn spacing. Our experiments, supported by
finite-element method (FEM) calculations, show that a more tightly wound Roebel
coil, despite having a lower critical (and therefore operating) current, can
produce a higher magnetic field than a loosely wound one. For a given magnetic
field produced at the coil's center, all the coils have similar AC losses, with
the exception of the most loosely wound one, which has much higher losses due
to the relatively large current needed to produce the desired field. The
experiments presented in this paper are carried out on the geometry of pancake
coils made of Roebel cables, but they are exemplary of a more general strategy
that, coupling experiments and numerical simulations, can be used to optimize
the coil design with respect to different parameters, such as tape quantity,
size, or AC loss, the relative importance of which is dictated by the specific
application.

  Algorithms",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the approximate consensus problem in highly
dynamic networks in which topology may change continually and unpredictably. We
prove that in both synchronous and partially synchronous systems, approximate
consensus is solvable if and only if the communication graph in each round has
a rooted spanning tree, i.e., there is a coordinator at each time. The striking
point in this result is that the coordinator is not required to be unique and
can change arbitrarily from round to round. Interestingly, the class of
averaging algorithms, which are memoryless and require no process identifiers,
entirely captures the solvability issue of approximate consensus in that the
problem is solvable if and only if it can be solved using any averaging
algorithm. Concerning the time complexity of averaging algorithms, we show that
approximate consensus can be achieved with precision of $\varepsilon$ in a
coordinated network model in $O(n^{n+1} \log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ synchronous
rounds, and in $O(\Delta n^{n\Delta+1} \log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ rounds when
the maximum round delay for a message to be delivered is $\Delta$. While in
general, an upper bound on the time complexity of averaging algorithms has to
be exponential, we investigate various network models in which this exponential
bound in the number of nodes reduces to a polynomial bound. We apply our
results to networked systems with a fixed topology and classical benign fault
models, and deduce both known and new results for approximate consensus in
these systems. In particular, we show that for solving approximate consensus, a
complete network can tolerate up to 2n-3 arbitrarily located link faults at
every round, in contrast with the impossibility result established by Santoro
and Widmayer (STACS '89) showing that exact consensus is not solvable with n-1
link faults per round originating from the same node.

problem) and combinatorics, around the minimum degree (number of occurrences)
of variables in various forms of redundancy-free boolean conjunctive normal
forms (clause-sets).
  Lean clause-sets do not have non-trivial autarkies, that is, it is not
possible to satisfy some clauses and leave the other clauses untouched. The
deficiency of a clause-set is the difference of the number of clauses and the
number of variables. We prove a precise upper bound on the minimum variable
degree of lean clause-sets in dependency on the deficiency. If a clause-set
does not fulfil this upper bound, then it must have a non-trivial autarky; we
show that the autarky-reduction (elimination of affected clauses) can be done
in polynomial time, while it is open to find the autarky itself in polynomial
time.
  Then we investigate this upper bound for the special case of minimally
unsatisfiable clause-sets. We show that the bound can be improved here,
introducing a general method to improve the underlying recurrence.
  We consider precise relations, and thus the investigations have a
number-theoretical flavour. We try to build a bridge from logic to
combinatorics (especially to hypergraph colouring), and we discuss thoroughly
the background and open problems, and provide many examples and explanations.

atoms in bcc tungsten are investigated systematically using first-principles
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The most stable configuration for
the interstitial neon, argon, krypton and xenon atoms is the tetrahedral site,
similarly to what was found earlier for helium in W. The calculated formation
energies for single inert-gas atoms at interstitial sites as well as at
substitutional sites are much larger for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe than for He. While
the variation of the energy of insertion of inert-gas defects into interstitial
configurations can be explained by a strong effect of their large atomic size,
the trend exhibited by their substitutional energies is more likely related to
the covalent interaction between the noble gas impurity atoms and the tungsten
atoms. There is a remarkable variation exhibited by the energy of interaction
between inert-gas impurities and vacancies, where a pronounced size effect is
observed when going from He to Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe. The origin of this trend is
explained by electronic structure calculations showing that p-orbitals play an
important part in the formation of chemical bonds between a vacancy and an atom
of any of the four inert-gas elements in comparison with helium, where the
latter contains only 1s2 electrons in the outer shell. The binding energies of
a helium atom trapped by five different defects (He-v, Ne-v, Ar-v, Kr-v, Xe-v,
where v denotes a vacancy in bcc-W) are all in excellent agreement with
experimental data derived from thermal desorption spectroscopy. Attachment of
He clusters to inert gas impurity atom traps in tungsten is analysed as a
function of the number of successive trapping helium atoms. Variation of the
Young modulus due to inert-gas impurities is analysed on the basis of data
derived from DFT calculations.

also found by density parameter that the model becomes of negative curvature

neutrinos in an energy range of $60\,\mathrm{TeV}$ to the $\mathrm{PeV}$-scale.
The origin of those events, being a key to understanding the origin of cosmic
rays, is still an unsolved question. So far, analyses have not succeeded to
resolve the diffuse signal into point-like sources. Searches including a
maximum-likelihood-ratio test, based on the reconstructed directions and
energies of the detected down- and up-going neutrino candidates, were also
performed on IceCube data leading to the exclusion of bright point sources. In
this paper, we present two methods to search for faint neutrino point sources
in three years of IceCube data, taken between 2008 and 2011. The first method
is an autocorrelation test, applied separately to the northern and southern
sky. The second method is a multipole analysis, which expands the measured data
in the northern hemisphere into spherical harmonics and uses the resulting
expansion coefficients to separate signal from background. With both methods,
the results are consistent with the background expectation with a slightly more
sparse spatial distribution, corresponding to an underfluctuation. Depending on
the assumed number of sources, the resulting upper limit on the flux per source
in the northern hemisphere for an $E^{-2}$ energy spectrum ranges from $1.5
\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{GeV}/(\mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{s})$, in the case of one
assumed source, to $4 \cdot 10^{-10} \,\mathrm{GeV}/(\mathrm{cm}^2

diffusion constant in the last diffusive regime naturally increases with
activity and decreases with packing fraction, we exhibit an intriguing
non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the ratio between the finite
density and the single particle diffusion constants. At fixed packing fraction,
the time-integrated linear response function depends non-monotonically on
activity strength. The effective temperature extracted from the ratio between
the integrated linear response and the mean-square displacement in the last
diffusive regime is always higher than the ambient temperature, increases with
increasing activity and, for small active force it monotonically increases with
density while for sufficiently high activity it first increases to next
decrease with the packing fraction. We ascribe this peculiar effect to the
existence of finite-size clusters for sufficiently high activity and density at
the fixed (low) temperatures at which we worked. The crossover occurs at lower
activity or density the lower the external temperature. The finite density
effective temperature is higher (lower) than the single dumbbell one below

exploits differential equations, which model the time evolution of infective
stages and strains. Being sensitive to initial values, the method produces
asymptotically correct solutions. The computations are fast, with time
complexity being quadratic. We apply the reconstruction to data of measles

information. The dengue example deals with the failure of vector-control
measures in reducing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Thailand. Two competing
mechanisms have been held responsible: strain interaction and demographic
transitions. Our reconstruction reveals that both explanations are possible,
showing that the increase in DHF cases is consistent with decreasing
transmission rates resulting from reduced vector counts. The flu example
focuses on the 1918/19 pandemic, examining the transmission rate evolution for

\alpha(n)=\lambda n(N-n)/N which corresponds to an SIS epidemic model in a
homogeneously mixing community of fixed size N. The processes are assumed to
start with a single individual, i.e. in state 1. Let T, A_n, C and S denote the

driven tissue invasion by cancer cells. The model employed is a system of
advection-reaction-diffusion equations that features the role of the serine
protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The analytical and numerical
study of this system constitutes a challenge due to the merging, emerging, and
travelling concentrations that the solutions exhibit.
  Classical numerical methods applied to this system necessitate very fine
discretization grids to resolve these dynamics in an accurate way. To reduce
the computational cost without sacrificing the accuracy of the solution, we
apply adaptive mesh refinement techniques, in particular h-refinement. Extended
numerical experiments exhibit that this approach provides with a higher order,
stable, and robust numerical method for this system. We elaborate on several
mesh refinement criteria and compare the results with the ones in the
literature.
  We prove, for a simpler version of this model, $L^\infty$ bounds for the
solutions, we study the stability of its conditional steady states, and
conclude that it can serve as a test case for further development of mesh
refinement techniques for cancer invasion simulations.

supercritical conditions, thermal conduction, compressibility effects and shock
wave propagation is exploited to deal with the dynamics of a cavitation bubble.
At variance with previous descriptions, the model is uniformly valid for all
phases (liquid, vapor and supercritical) and phase transitions involved,
allowing to describe the non-equilibrium processes ongoing during the collapse.
As consequence of this unitary description, rather unexpectedly for pure vapor
bubbles, the numerical experiments show that the collapse is accompanied by the
emission of a strong shock wave in the liquid and by the oscillation of the
bubble that periodically disappears and reappears, due to transition to
super/sub critical conditions. The mechanism of shock wave formation is
strongly related to the transition of the vapor to supercritical state, with a
progressive steepening of the compression wave to form the shock which is
eventually reflected as an outward propagating wave in the liquid.

applying trend and jump correction and outlier removal. Standard Fourier
technique is used to analyze the frequency content of our targets and follow
the time dependent phenomena. The most comprehensive collection of CoRoT RR

alternating maxima and in some cases half-integer frequencies in four CoRoT
Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, as clear signs of the presence of period doubling. This
reinforces that period doubling is an important ingredient to understand the
Blazhko effect - a premise we derived previously from the Kepler RR Lyrae
sample. As expected, period doubling is detectable only for short time
intervals in most modulated RRab stars. Our results show that the temporal
variability of the additional frequencies in all RR Lyrae sub-types is
ubiquitous. The ephemeral nature and the highly variable amplitude of these
variations suggest a complex underlying dynamics of and an intricate interplay
between radial and possibly nonradial modes in RR Lyrae stars. The omnipresence

stars - implies that asteroseismology of these objects should be feasible in

nonextensive entropic indices $q_{K}$ derived from the modified Kawaler's

$q$'s are related through a heuristic single relation given by $q\approx
q_{0}(1-\Delta t/q_{K})$, where $t$ is the cluster age. In a nonextensive
scenario, these indices are quantities that measure the degree of
nonextensivity present in the system. Recent studies reveal that the index $q$
is correlated to the formation rate of high-energy tails present in the
distribution of rotation velocity. On the other hand, the index $q_{K}$ is
determined by the stellar rotation-age relationship. This depends on the
magnetic field configuration through the expression $q_{K}=1+4aN/3$, where $a$
and $N$ denote the saturation level of the star magnetic field and its
topology, respectively. In the present study, we show that the connection
$q-q_{K}$ is also consistent with 548 rotation period data for single

  Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Fuzzy Controller",,,,"SYSU -- 201103","cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Due to that the existing traffic facilities can hardly be extended,
developing traffic signal control methods is the most important way to improve
the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts. This paper proposes a novel
traffic signal controller with two fuzzy layers for signalizing the roundabout.
The outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all the phase
subsets and then activates the most urgent subset. This mechanism helps to
instantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout so as to
improve real-timeness. The inner layer of the controller computes extension
time of the current phase. If the extension value is larger than a threshold
value, the current phase is maintained; otherwise the next phase in the running
phase subset (selected by the outer layer) is activated. The inner layer adopts
well-designed phase sequences, which helps to smooth the traffic flows and to
avoid traffic jam. In general, the proposed traffic signal controller is
capable of improving real-timeness as well as reducing traffic congestion.
Moreover, an offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed
to optimize the membership functions adopted in the proposed controller. By
using optimal membership functions, the performance of the controller can be
further improved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller
outperforms previous traffic signal controllers in terms of improving the
traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts.

Johannsen-Psaltis metric has been the most common framework to study possible

Recently, Cardoso, Pani and Rico have proposed a more general parametrization.
The aim of the present paper is to study this new metric in a specific context,
namely the thermal spectrum of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion
disks. The most relevant finding is that the spacetime geometry around objects
that look like very fast-rotating Kerr black holes may still have large
deviations from the Kerr solution. This was not the case with the
Johannsen-Psaltis metric, which means the latter was missing an important class
of non-Kerr spacetimes.

user-specified target parameter. The FMSC mimics the situation faced by an
applied researcher who begins with a set of relatively mild ""baseline""
assumptions and must decide whether to impose any of a collection of stronger
but more controversial ""suspect"" assumptions. When the (correctly specified)
baseline moment conditions identify the model, the FMSC provides an
asymptotically unbiased estimator of asymptotic MSE, allowing us to select over
the suspect moment conditions. I go on to show how the framework used to derive
the FMSC can address the problem of inference post-moment selection. Treating
post-selection estimators as a special case of moment-averaging, in which
estimators based on different moment sets are given data-dependent weights, I
propose simulation-based procedures for inference that can be applied to a
variety of formal and informal moment-selection and averaging procedures. Both
the FMSC and confidence interval procedures perform well in simulations. I
conclude with an empirical example examining the effect of instrument selection

conditions, reveal that the component functions of the generalized ADD have
\emph{zero} means and are hierarchically orthogonal. By exploiting these
properties, a simple, alternative approach is presented to derive a coupled
system of equations that the generalized ADD component functions satisfy. The
coupled equations, which subsume as a special case the classical ADD, reproduce
the component functions for independent probability measures. To determine the
component functions of the generalized ADD, a new constructive method is
proposed by employing measure-consistent, multivariate orthogonal polynomials
as bases and calculating the expansion coefficients involved from the solution
of linear algebraic equations. New generalized formulae are presented for the
second-moment characteristics, including triplets of global sensitivity
indices, for dependent probability distributions. Furthermore, the generalized
ADD leads to extended definitions of effective dimensions, reported in the
current literature for the classical ADD. Numerical results demonstrate that
the correlation structure of random variables can significantly alter the
composition of component functions, producing widely varying global sensitivity
indices and, therefore, distinct rankings of random variables. An application
to random eigenvalue analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed
approximation.

vertical and L-shaped ancient Egyptian sundials, developed their models, on the
basis of which the reconstruction of the sundial was carried out. An original
scheme of a simple method for a fairly accurate time measurement with their
help is also proposed. The model proposed by us, which describes a vertical
sundial, is a vertical sundial with an inclined gnomon that takes into account
the latitude of the area. The model proposed by us is characterized by marking
the hour lines from 6 to 12 o'clock every hour. From 12:00 a shift is made in
the marking of the hour lines for half an hour, and then the marking is
repeated every hour. As a consequence of the reconstruction of the vertical
sundial, we have developed and proposed a model that describes the design
features and operation of two types of L-shaped sundial. They had to work in
conjunction with an inclined gnomon, like a vertical sundial, or directly with
a vertical sundial. In this case, the L-shaped sundial could complement the
vertical sundial by providing the ability to read hour markers and interpret
the readings of the vertical sundial, as there were no inscriptions on the
vertical sundial. The article also provides a decoding of the inscription from
the tomb of Seti I, which has long intrigued researchers. It is proved that the
inscription contains the lengths of the intervals between adjacent marks of the
L-shaped sundial of the second type, where the first interval corresponds not
to one hour, but to half an hour.

Theoretically, it is an ideal therapeutic way of killing tumor by only vascular
embolization. However, most of the existing vascular embolic agents are still
rather insufficient to fulfill the real clinical need due to the reasons like:
incomplete filling of target vasculature, being easily washed away by blood or
body solution, or just producing toxicity to tissues. Here from an alternative
way, the body temperature liquid metal, a kind of soft and highly compliant
material, was proposed for the first time as blood vessel embolization agent
for tumor physical therapy. With its unique capability of easy phase transition
between liquid and solid state and sub-cooling behavior, such material can be
fluently injected into the tiny vessels including ending capillaries and fully
block them. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments were performed which showed
that treating localized diseased tissues through liquid metal embolic agent is
acceptable. Endowed with a high density, the liquid metal-filled vessels are
highly visible under the CT scan, which offers the potential of
diagnosis-treatment integration. To further demonstrate the new conceptual
liquid metal vascular embolization therapy, several experiments on in vivo
vasculatures of rabbit ears and mouse tails were performed to provide evidences
of destroying the targeted tissues. To interpret the liquid metal starvation
therapy effects, a theoretical model was established to simulate the tumor
growth with zero, partial or complete filling of the metal agent inside the
vessels. All the results support that, given appropriate administration, the
liquid metal embolization is able to destruct the target regions and might
starve the tumors to death through a relatively easy way. This study lays the
foundation of a promising tumor starvation therapy in the coming time.

and it is shown that observed effects, usually ascribed to a dark matter, can
by explained by such stretching only. Increasing by time radius of the
gravitationally-bound region (GBR) and conservation of gravitational energy
lead to a new scenario in which values of NP in expanding volume are
maintained, while in physical volume are stretched. Really, the energy
conservation in expanding volume requires for NP values to be comoving to the
expanding shells. In addition, the radius of gravitationally-bound region
increases by time due to decreasing of expansion velocity and different shells
around galaxy cease expansion at different times. Thus, as far a shell placed
from galaxy, as longer it was expanded and thickened, while potential
difference on its boundaries remained unchanged. This shifts the values of NP
around galaxy proportional to the distance r and, as the result, the
gravitational acceleration, from NP's $1/r^2$ dependence, turned to 1/r
dependence, as for centrifugal acceleration. This fact naturally explains the
known empirical facts, such as flatness of rotation curves and velocity-mass
relationships for galaxies and velocity dispersion in clusters.
