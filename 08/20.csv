multi-valley effective mass theory, dealing non-perturbatively with

allows us to obtain a very reliable picture of the donor wave function within a
relatively simple framework. Variational optimization of the 1s donor binding
energies calculated with a new trial wave function, in a pseudopotential with
two fitting parameters, allows an accurate match of the experimentally
determined donor energy levels, while the correct limiting behavior for the
electronic density, both close to and far from each impurity nucleus, is
captured by fitting the measured contact hyperfine coupling between the donor
nuclear and electron spin.
  We go on to include an external uniform electric field in order to model
Stark physics: With no extra ad hoc parameters, variational minimization of the
complete donor ground energy allows a quantitative description of the
field-induced reduction of electronic density at each impurity nucleus.
Detailed comparisons with experimental values for the shifts of the contact
hyperfine coupling reveal very close agreement for all the donors measured (P,
As, Sb and Bi). Finally, we estimate field ionization thresholds for the donor
ground states, thus setting upper limits to the gate manipulation times for
single qubit operations in Kane-like architectures: the Si:Bi system is shown
to allow for A gates as fast as around 10 MHz.

thereby determine where collection actions are most efficient. We specify the

restricted nature of the independent-particle model underlying such
calculations, even in single-reference-based correlated approaches. On the
other hand, previous works on some of these molecules using model Hamiltonians
have clearly indicated the importance of short-range inter-atomic spin-spin
correlations. In this work, we consider {\em ab initio} non-collinear
Hartree--Fock (HF) solutions for representative fullerene systems: the bowl,
cage, ring, and pentagon isomers of C$_{20}$, and the larger C$_{30}$,
C$_{36}$, C$_{60}$, C$_{70}$, and C$_{84}$ fullerene cages. In all cases but
the ring we find that the HF minimum corresponds to a truly non-collinear
solution with a torsional spin density wave. Optimized geometries at the
generalized HF (GHF) level lead to fully symmetric structures, even in those
cases where Jahn-Teller distortions have been previously considered. The nature
of the GHF solutions is consistent with the $\pi$-electron space becoming
polyradical in nature: each $p$-orbital remains effectively singly occupied.
The spin frustration, induced by the pentagon rings in an otherwise
anti-ferromagnetic background, is minimized at the HF level by aligning the
spins in non-collinear arrangements. The long-range magnetic ordering observed
is reminiscent of the character of broken symmetry HF solutions in polyacene
systems.

for a detection of the line at 3.53 keV with a statistical significance greater
than ~3 sigma and for the identification of several known atomic lines in the

increased uncertainty, thus decreasing the significance of the detection. We

non-symmetric structures described by the Szekeres metric. The Szekeres exact
solution of Einstein's equations, which is inhomogeneous and anisotropic,
allows us to capture potentially relevant effects on light propagation due to
nontrivial evolution of structures in an exact framework. Light beams
traversing a single Szekeres structure in different ways can experience either
magnification or demagnification, depending on the particular path, and we
explore a small additional effect due time evolution of the structures. We
study the probability distributions of $\Delta\mu=\mu_{LCDM}-\mu_{SC}$ for
sources at different redshifts in various Swiss-cheese constructions, where the
light beams travel through a large number of randomly oriented holes with
random impact parameters. We find for $\Delta\mu$ the dispersions $0.004\le
\sigma_{\Delta\mu} \le 0.008$ mag for sources with redshifts $1.0\le z \le
1.5$, which are smaller than the intrinsic dispersion of, for example,
magnitudes of type Ia supernovae. The shapes of the distributions we obtain for
our Swiss-cheese constructions are peculiar in the sense that they are not
consistently skewed toward the demagnification side, as they are in analyses of
lensing in cosmological simulations, reflecting a limitation of these
constructions. This could be the result of requiring the continuity of
Einstein's equations throughout the overall spacetime patchwork, which imposes

bispectrum. It is shown that, in contrast to the strong dissipative regime, the
amplitude of non-Gaussianity is strongly dependent on the parameters governing
the microscopic physics in the intermediate and weak dissipation warm inflation
regimes. The most important results concern the shape of the bispectrum, which
has two different, but distinct, forms in the weak and strong dissipative
regimes. Comparison of shape functions could permit discrimination between the
warm and cold paradigms of inflation from future precision data on primordial
non-Gaussianity.

by Daya Bay, RENO and T2K experiments with a moderately large value. However,
the standard form of neutrino mixing patterns such as bimaximal, tri-bimaximal,
golden ratio of types A and B, hexagonal etc., which are based on certain
flavor symmetries, predict vanishing $\theta_{13}$. Using the fact that the
neutrino mixing matrix can be represented as $V_{\rm PMNS}=U_l^{\dagger} U_\nu
P_\nu$, where $U_l$ and $U_\nu$ result from the diagonalization of the charged
lepton and neutrino mass matrices and $P_\nu$ is a diagonal matrix containing
Majorana phases, we explore the possibility of accounting for the large reactor
mixing angle by considering deviations both in the charged lepton and neutrino
sector. In the charged lepton sector we consider the deviation as an additional
rotation in the (12) and (13) planes, whereas in neutrino sector we consider
deviations to various neutrino mixing patterns through (13) and (23) rotations.
We find that with the inclusion of these deviations it is possible to
accommodate the observed large reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, and one can
also obtain limits on the CP violating Dirac phase $\delta_{CP}$ and Jarlskog
invariant $J_{CP}$ for most of the cases. We then explore whether our findings
can be tested in the currently running NO$\nu$A experiment with 3 years of data
taking in neutrino mode followed by 3 years with anti-neutrino mode.

temperature T_D in two spin subbands with essentially different electron
populations. Firstly, we found that the product (m*T_D) that determines damping
of quantum oscillations, to the first approximation, is the same in the
majority and minority subbands even at the spin polarization degree as high as
66\%. This result confirms the theoretical predictions that the interaction
takes place at high energies ~ E_F rather than within a narrow strip of
energies E_F\pm k_BT. Secondly, to the next approximation, we revealed a
difference in the damping factor of the two spin subbands, which causes
skewness of the oscillation lineshape. In the absence of the in-plane magnetic
field, the damping factor (m*T_D) is systematically smaller in the
spin-majority subband. The difference, quantified with the skew factor \gamma =
(T_{D\downarrow}-T_{D\uparrow})/2T_{D0} can be as large as 20%. The skew factor
tends to decrease as B_\parallel or temperature grow, or perpendicular field
decreases; for low electron densities and high in-plane fields the skew factor
even changes sign. Finally, we compared the temperature and magnetic field
dependencies of the magneto-oscillations amplitude with predictions of the
interaction correction theory, and found, besides some qualitative
similarities, several quantitative and qualitative differences. To explain
qualitatively our results, we suggested an empirical model that assumes the
existence of easily magnetized triplet scatterers on the Si/SiO_2 interface.

subsystem in a larger closed system, are explored by looking at simple
examples. This is a new kind of symmetry in the open quantum dynamics of a
subsystem
  Each symmetry implies a particular form for the results of the open dynamics.
The forms exhibit the symmetries very simply. It is shown directly, without
assuming anything about the symmetry, that the dynamics produces the form, but
knowing the symmetry and the form it implies can reduce what needs to be done
to work out the dynamics; pieces can be deduced from the symmetry rather that
calculated from the dynamics.
  Symmetries can be related to constants of the motion in new ways. A quantity
might be a dependent constant of the motion, constant only for particular
situations of the subsystem in the larger system. In particular, a generator of
dependent symmetries could represent a quantity that is a dependent constant of
the motion for the same situations as for the symmetries. The examples present
a variety of possibilities. Sometimes a generator of dependent symmetries does
represent a dependent constant of the motion. Sometimes it does not. Sometimes
no quantity is a dependent constant of the motion. Sometimes every quantity is.

Remarkably, this equation is formally equivalent to a classical mechanical

EUV emission-line fluxes from four individual AGN with $0.49 \le z \le 0.64$,
two AGN with $0.32 \le z \le 0.40$, and a composite of 159 AGN. With the Cloudy
photoionization code, we calculated emission-line fluxes from BLR clouds with a
range of density, hydrogen ionizing flux and incident continuum spectral
indices. The photoionization grids were fit to the observations using
single-component and locally optimally emitting cloud (LOC) models. The LOC
models provide good fits to the measured fluxes, while the single-component

consistent with those measured from COS spectra. EUV emission lines such as N

manufacturing processes is very important for process and product development
because design of downstream processes as well as final product properties
strongly depend on these geometrical particle attributes. However, recovery of
particle size and shape information in situ during crystallisation processes
has been a major challenge. The focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM)
provides the chord length distribution (CLD) of a population of particles in a
suspension flowing close to the sensor window. Recovery of size and shape
information from the CLD requires a model relating particle size and shape to
its CLD as well as solving the corresponding inverse problem.
  This paper presents a comprehensive algorithm which produces estimates of
particle size distribution and particle aspect ratio from measured CLD data.
While the algorithm searches for a global best solution to the inverse problem
without requiring further a priori information on the range of particle sizes
present in the population or aspect ratio of particles, suitable regularisation
techniques based on relevant additional information can be implemented as
required to obtain physically reasonable size distributions. We used the
algorithm to analyse CLD data for samples of needle-like crystalline particles
of various lengths using two previously published CLD models for ellipsoids and
for thin cylinders to estimate particle size distribution and shape. We found
that the thin cylinder model yielded significantly better agreement with
experimental data, while estimated particle size distributions and aspect
ratios were in good agreement with those obtained from imaging.

during the late phases of stellar evolution of a massive star culminating in a
supernova explosion. Recently the microscopic calculation of weak-interaction
mediated rates on key isotopes of iron was introduced using the proton-neutron
quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) theory with improved model
parameters. Here I discuss in detail the improved calculation of $\beta^{\pm}$
decay rates for iron isotopes ($^{54,55,56}$Fe) in stellar environment. The
pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic ""state-by-state"" calculation of stellar
rates as explained later in text. Excited state Gamow-Teller distributions are
much different from ground state and a microscopic calculation of decay rates
from these excited states greatly increases the reliability of the total decay
rate calculation specially during the late stages of stellar evolution. The
reported decay rates are also compared with earlier calculations. The positron
decay rates are in reasonable agreement with the large-scale shell model
calculation. The main finding of this work includes that the stellar
$\beta$-decay rates of $^{54,55,56}$Fe are around 3 -- 5 orders of magnitude
smaller than previously assumed and hence irrelevant for the determination of
the evolution of $Y_{e}$ during the presupernova phase of massive stars. The
current work discourages the inclusion of $^{55,56}$Fe in the list of key
stellar $\beta$-decay nuclei as suggested by former simulation results.

governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an
autonomous dynamical system, and is a powerful tool for the analysis and
decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a
data driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions,
and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot
pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit
governing equations or interaction with a ""black box"" integrator. We will show
that this approach is, in effect, an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes.
Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov
process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates
the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be
considered as the ""stochastic Koopman operator"" [1]. Finally, four illustrative
examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the
method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data, and two
that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.

as ""runaway solutions"" and violation of causality. The Landau-Lifshitz
approximation to the exact equation introduced by Lorentz, Abraham and Dirac is
widely used, though questions remain regarding its domain of validity. This
thesis explores an alternative treatment of the motion of a radiating electron,
based on an equation first proposed by Ford and O'Connell. A general condition
is found for solutions of this equation to deviate from those of
Landau-Lifshitz.
  By exploring radiation reaction effects on a particle colliding with an
ultra-intense laser pulse we show that the regime where there is a significant
deviation of these two approaches can never be reached with existing or
proposed laser facilities. The methods used to explore single particle
interaction with an intense laser pulse are extended to describe the
interaction of a particle bunch with various realistic laser pulses. We find
that the interaction leads to a decrease in average momentum and relative
momentum spread. However, the decrease appears to be independent of the length
of the pulse and depends only on the energy in the pulse regardless of how it
is distributed. Radiation reaction effects occuring during the scattering of an
electron by a heavy, highly-charged nucleus are studied. Radiation reaction is
seen to affect the particle's motion. We find noticeable differences between
the predictions of the Ford-O'Connell and Landau-Lifshitz equations, albeit in
regimes where quantum effects would be important.

$k$ the spectrum grows with the same growth rate. Signatures of large-scale
dynamo action can be identified through the excess of magnetic energy at small
$k$, of one of the two oppositely polarized constituents. Also a suitably
defined planar average of the magnetic field can be chosen such that its rms
value isolates the strength of the mean field. However, these different means
of analysis suggest that the strength of the large-scale field diminishes with
increasing magnetic Reynolds number ${\rm Re}_{\rm M}$ like ${\rm Re}_{\rm

the DNS show that this arises due to the magnetic energy spectrum still peaking
at resistive scales, even when helicity is present. As expected, the amplitude
of the large-scale field increases with increasing fractional helicity,
enabling us to determine the onset of large scale dynamo action and
distinguishing it from that of the small-scale dynamo. Our DNS show that,
contrary to earlier results for smaller scale separation (only 1.5 instead of

many orders of magnitudes slower at relevant experimental temperatures than in
the perpendicular direction. The observation can be rationalized by the
underlying charge pattern of the electrostatically heterogeneous surface which
imposes direction-dependent energy barriers to the motion of the molecule.
Furthermore, the diffusive behavior is found to be normal and Arrhenius-like,
governed by thermally activated energy barrier crossings. The detailed analysis
of the underlying potential energy landscape shows, however, that in general
the activation barriers cannot be estimated from idealized zero-temperature
trajectories but must include the conformational and positional excursion of
the molecule along its pathway. Furthermore, the corresponding (Helmholtz) free
energy barriers are significantly smaller than the pure energetic barriers with
implications on absolute rate prediction at experimentally relevant

measurements of the fine structure constant and of the proton-electron mass
ratio suggest that basic quantities of the standard model, such as the QCD
scale parameter $\Lambda_{QCD}$, might not be conserved in the course of the
cosmological evolution. The masses of the nucleons and of the atomic nuclei
would be time-evolving. This can be consistent with General Relativity provided
the vacuum energy itself is a dynamical quantity. Another framework realizing
this possibility is QHD (Quantum Haplodynamics), a fundamental theory of bound

that such scale changes slowly with cosmic time, the masses of the nucleons and

with additional knowledge of the quasiparticle band structure from angle
resolved photoemission measurements, one can extract the wavevector and energy
dependence of the important electronic scattering processes thereby obtaining
direct information both about the fermiology and the interactions. In
2H-NbSe$_{2}$, we use this combination to show that the important
near-Fermi-surface electronic physics is dominated by the coupling of the
quasiparticles to soft mode phonons at a wave vector different from the CDW
ordering wave vector.

back in time and determine the absolute number and stellar masses of disrupted

nucleus-to-galaxy mass and nucleation fraction of galaxies similar to that
observed in the present day universe. Our results show stripped nuclei follow a
mass function $N(M) \sim M^{-1.5}$ in the mass range $10^6 < M/M_\odot < 10^8$,
significantly flatter than found for globular clusters. The contribution of
stripped nuclei will therefore be most important among high-mass GCs and UCDs.
For the Milky Way we predict between 1 and 3 star clusters more massive than
$10^5 M_\odot$ come from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies, with the most
massive cluster formed having a typical mass of a few times $10^6 M_\odot$,
like omega Centauri. For a galaxy cluster with a mass $7 \times 10^{13}
M_\odot$, similar to Fornax, we predict $\sim$19 UCDs more massive than
$2\times10^6 M_\odot$ and $\sim$9 UCDs more massive than $10^7 M_\odot$ within
a projected distance of 300 kpc come from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies. The

quantified by a distance between a given two-mode Gaussian state and the set of
all the zero-discord two-mode Gaussian states. However, as this set consists
only of product states, such a distance captures all the correlations (quantum
and classical) between modes. Therefore it is merely un upper bound for the
geometric discord, no matter which is the employed distance. In this work we
choose for this purpose the Hellinger metric that is known to have many
beneficial properties recommending it as a good measure of quantum behaviour.
In general, this metric is determined by affinity, a relative of the Uhlmann
fidelity with which it shares many important features. As a first step of our
work, the affinity of a pair of $n$-mode Gaussian states is written. Then, in
the two-mode case, we succeeded in determining exactly the closest Gaussian
product state and computed the Gaussian discord accordingly. The obtained
general formula is remarkably simple and becomes still friendlier in the
significant case of symmetric two-mode Gaussian states. We then analyze in
detail two special classes of two-mode Gaussian states of theoretical and
experimental interest as well: the squeezed thermal states and the mode-mixed
thermal ones. The former are separable under a well-known threshold of
squeezing, while the latter are always separable. It is worth stressing that
for symmetric states belonging to either of these classes, we find consistency
between their geometric Hellinger discord and the originally defined discord in
the Gaussian approach. At the same time, the Gaussian Hellinger discord of such

random diffusive like events and ballistic like motion. In many cases, such
systems exhibit strong anomalous diffusion, where low order moments $< |x(t)|^q

$q>q_c$ a ballistic scaling emerges. The mixed dynamics constitutes a
theoretical challenge since it does not fall into a unique category of motion,
e.g., the known diffusion equations and central limit theorems fail to describe
both aspects. In this paper we resolve this problem by resorting to the concept
of infinite density. Using the widely applicable L\'evy walk model, we find a
general expression for the corresponding non-normalized density which is fully
determined by the particles velocity distribution, the anomalous diffusion
exponent $\alpha$ and the diffusion coefficient $K_\alpha$. We explain how
infinite densities play a central role in the description of dynamics of a
large class of physical processes and discuss how they can be evaluated from

a combination of relative arrangement and bonding patterns of atoms in
molecule. Nowadays, the structure of atoms in molecules is derived from the
topological analysis of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). In
this context a molecular structure is varied by large geometrical variations
and concomitant reorganization of electronic structure that are usually taking
place in chemical reactions or under extreme hydrostatic pressure. In this
report a new mode of structural variation is introduced within the context of
the newly proposed multi-component QTAIM (MC-QTAIM) that originates from mass
variation of nuclei. Accordingly, XCN and CNX series of species are introduced
where X stands for a quantum particle with a unit of positive charge and a
variable mass that is varied in discrete steps between the masses of proton and
positron. Ab initio non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) calculations are done on both
series of species and the resulting non-BO wavefunctions are used for the
MC-QTAIM analysis revealing a triatomic structure for the proton mass and a
diatomic structure for the positron mass. In both series of species a critical
mass between that of proton and positron mass is discovered where the
transition from triatomic to diatomic structure takes place. This abrupt
structural transformation has a topological nature resembling the usual phase
transitions in thermodynamics. The discovered mass induced structural
transformation is a hidden aspect of the Structural theory which is revealed
only beyond the BO paradigm when nuclei are treated as quantum waves instead of
clamped point charges.

the presence of surface polarization effects. Upon the penetration of a DNA

electroneutrality of DNA sets a lower boundary for the ionic current,
explaining the weak salt dependence of blocked pore conductivities at dilute
ion concentrations. The addition of multivalent counterions into the solution
results in the reversal of the polymer charge and the direction of the
electroosmotic flow. With trivalent spermidine or quadrivalent spermine
molecules, the charge inversion is strong enough to stop the translocation of
the polymer and to reverse its motion. This mechanism can be used efficiently
in translocation experiments in order to improve the accuracy of DNA sequencing
by minimizing the translocation velocity of the polymer.

two-step process with two candidate pathways to a one-step process with also
two candidate pathways to a one-step process with a single pathway as $\mu$ is

emerges that is a mixture of a two-step pathway and a one-step pathway.
Interestingly, we find that the total transition rate depends nonmonotonically

Moreover, in the presence of weak coupling the rate also exhibits an unexpected

of freedom. We investigate both the short time (non-depleted pump) and long
time (depleted pump) regimes of the quantum state and its impact on the Holevo
channel capacity for communicating information from the far past to the far
future in the presence of Hawking radiation. The new feature introduced in this
work is the coupling of the emitted Hawking radiation modes through the common
black hole `source pump' mode which phenomenologically represents a quantized
energy degree of freedom of the gravitational field. This (zero-dimensional)
model serves as a simplified arena to explore BH particle
production/evaporation and back-action effects under an explicitly unitary
evolution which enforces quantized energy/particle conservation. Within our
analogous quantum optical model we examine the entanglement between two emitted
particle/anti-particle and anti-particle/particle pairs coupled via the black
hole (BH) evaporating `pump' source. We also analytically and dynamically
verify the `Page information time' for our model which refers to the
conventionally held belief that the information in the BH radiation becomes
significant after the black hole has evaporated half its initial energy into
the outgoing radiation. Lastly, we investigate the effect of BH particle
production/evaporation on two modes in the exterior region of the BH event
horizon that are initially maximally entangled, when one mode falls inward and
interacts with the black hole, and the other remains forever outside and
non-interacting.

Prog., DOI: 10.1007/s10107-014-0784-y, 2013]. The first focal point of this
paper is a new variant of the approach that employs a line search rather than a
trust region strategy, where a critical algorithmic feature for the line search
strategy is the use of convexified piecewise quadratic models of the AL
function for computing the search directions. We prove global convergence
guarantees for our line search algorithm that are on par with those for the
previously proposed trust region method. A second focal point of this paper is
the practical performance of the line search and trust region algorithm
variants in Matlab software, as well as that of an adaptive penalty parameter
updating strategy incorporated into the Lancelot software. We test these
methods on problems from the CUTEst and COPS collections, as well as on
challenging test problems related to optimal power flow. Our numerical
experience suggests that the adaptive algorithms outperform traditional AL
methods in terms of efficiency and reliability. As with traditional AL
algorithms, the adaptive methods are matrix-free and thus represent a viable
option for solving extreme-scale problems.

hydrogen-burning limit. No blueshifted emission around the brown dwarf position
is detected. The redshifted gas lobe that is elongated in the northeast

angle of about 36 degrees. Assuming that the redshifted emission is outflow
emission from GM Tau, we then estimate a molecular outflow mass in the range
from 1.9x10^-6 M_Sun to 2.9x10^-5 M_Sun and an outflow mass-loss rate from
2.7x10^-9 M_Sun yr^-1 to 4.1x10^-8 M_Sun yr^-1. These values are comparable to

low-mass objects. This may provide us with important implications that clarify
the formation process of brown dwarfs.

this calculation; one is a zigzag edge and the other is an armchair edge. The
complex wave numbers and the boundary condition give the analytic equations for
the energies and the wave functions of the edge states. The numerical solutions
of the equations reveal the intriguing spatial behaviors of the edge state. We
define an edge-state width for analyzing the spatial variation of the
edge-state wave function. Our results show that the edge-state width can be
easily controlled by a couple of parameters such as the spin-orbit coupling and
the sublattice potential. The parameter dependences of the edge-state width
show substantial differences depending on the edge types. These demonstrate
that, even if the edge states are protected by the topological property of the
bulk, their detailed properties are still discriminated by their edges. This
edge dependence can be crucial in manufacturing small-sized devices since the
length scale of the edge state is highly subject to the edges.

debated resulting in large uncertainty over the jet composition. Both
magnetohydrodynamical and neutrino annihilation models have been proposed for
the energy extraction in a black hole/accretion-disc central engine. In
particular, for the extreme accretion rates $\dot M\sim 0.1-1$~
M$_\odot$s$^{-1}$ expected for bursts of duration $T\lesssim 100$~s, the disc
can be an efficient neutrino emitter. Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation
results in an energy deposition rate at the jet that can, in principle, account
for the burst's energetics. Recent discoveries of X-ray flares hours after the
burst and of ultra-long GRBs suggest that GRB activity can last for $\sim
10^4$~s or longer. These long-lived events have fluence similar to that of
classical GRBs. In view of these findings, we re-evaluate the neutrino
annihilation model. We derive the maximum possible energy of a neutrino-powered
jet as a function of the burst duration and show that the available energy
drops fast for longer bursts. For a standard choice of the parameters, the
model falls short by three to four orders of magnitude in explaining the
observed energetics of events that last longer than $\sim 10^3$~s.

jets in the radio galaxy Hydra A with the intracluster medium. We consider the
jet kinetic power, the galaxy and cluster atmosphere, and the inner structure
of the radio source. Analysing radio observations of the inner lobes of Hydra A
by Taylor et al. (1990) we confirm the jet power estimates of about 1e45 ergs/s
derived by Wise et al. (2007) from dynamical analysis of the X-ray cavities.
With this result and a model for the galaxy halo, we explore the
jet-intracluster medium interactions occurring on a scale of 10 kpc using
two-dimensional, axisymmetric, relativistic pure hydrodynamic simulations. A
key feature is that we identify the three bright knots in the northern jet as
biconical reconfinement shocks, which result when an over pressured jet starts
to come into equilibrium with the galactic atmosphere. Through an extensive
parameter space study we deduce that the jet velocity is approximately 0.8 c at
a distance 0.5 kpc from the black hole. The combined constraints of jet power,
the observed jet radius profile along the jet, and the estimated jet pressure
and jet velocity imply a value of the jet density parameter approximately 13
for the northern jet. We show that for a jet velocity = 0.8c and angle between
the jet and the line of sight = 42 deg, an intrinsic asymmetry in the
emissivity of the northern and southern jet is required for a consistent
brightness ratio approximately 7 estimated from the 6cm VLA image of Hydra A.

implement this strategy. Is this assumption correct? What do people really do?
  We ran an experiment where we asked people to find some relevant links, but
we prevented them from using the most obvious search terms, which we termed
taboo words. To make the experiment more interesting we also provided the
traditional forms of assistance: spelling suggestions and related search
suggestions. We assigned participants using a magic square to get no
assistance, one kind of assistance, or both. Forty eight people participated in
the experiment.
  What emerged from the analysis was that when people are frustrated in their
searching attempts, a minority soldier on, attempting to find other terms, but
the majority will stick with their original query term and simply progress from
page to page in a vain attempt to find something relevant. This confirms
findings by other researchers about the difficulties of query re-formulation.
Our finding will serve to inform the developers of user interfaces to search

the stripping rate and tail structure. We run the first magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of ram pressure stripping that include a galactic magnetic field,
using 159 pc resolution throughout our entire domain in order to resolve mixing
throughout the tail. We find very little difference in the total amount of gas
removed from the unmagnetized and magnetized galaxies, although a magnetic
field with a radial component will initially accelerate stripped gas more
quickly. In general, we find that magnetic fields in the disk lead to slower
velocities in the stripped gas near the disk and faster velocities farther from
the disk. We also find that magnetic fields in the galactic gas lead to larger
unmixed structures in the tail. Finally, we discuss whether ram pressure
stripped tails can magnetize the ICM. We find that the total magnetic energy
density grows as the tail lengthens, likely through turbulence. There are
microGauss-strength fields in the tail in all of our MHD runs, which survive to
at least 100 kpc from the disk (the edge of our simulated region), indicating
that the area-filling factor of magnetized tails in a cluster could be large.

expected. In particular, $t\to cZ$ branching ratio of order of $10^{-5}$ is
generic for this class of models. Thus, this framework can be tested in the

top flavor violation is weakly correlated with the increase amount of fine

supply field for wireless sensor networks in order to free sensors from wires
and batteries, where the multi-point scheme is employed to overcome path-loss
attenuation, while the carrier shift diversity is introduced to mitigate the
effect of interference between multiple wave sources. As we focus on the energy
transmission part, sensor or communication schemes are out of scope of this
paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed wireless energy
transmission, this paper conducts indoor experiments in which we compare the
power distribution and the coverage performance of different energy
transmission schemes including conventional single-point, simple multi-point
and our proposed multi-point scheme. To easily observe the effect of the
standing-wave caused by multipath and interference between multiple wave
sources, 3D measurements are performed in an empty room. The results of our
experiments together with those of a simulation that assumes a similar antenna
setting in free space environment show that the coverage of single-point and
multi-point wireless energy transmission without carrier shift diversity are
limited by path-loss, standing-wave created by multipath and interference
between multiple wave sources. On the other hand, the proposed scheme can
overcome power attenuation due to the path-loss as well as the effect of
standing-wave created by multipath and interference between multiple wave
sources.

A major challenge in this area is the requirement of a high sampling rate in

method is presented that utilizes a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme to bring
substantial savings in terms of the sampling rate. The correlation matrix of a
finite number of noisy samples is computed and used by a non-linear least
square (NLLS) estimator to detect the occupied and vacant channels of the
spectrum. We provide an expression for the detection threshold as a function of
sampling parameters and noise power. Also, a sequential forward selection
algorithm is presented to find the occupied channels with low complexity. The
method can be applied to both correlated and uncorrelated wideband multichannel
signals. A comparison with conventional energy detection using Nyquist-rate
sampling shows that the proposed scheme can yield similar performance for SNR
above 4 dB with a factor of 3 smaller sampling rate.

spins in GaAs double quantum well (DQW) nanostructures. The spin dynamics was
investigated by optically generating spins using a focused, circularly
polarized light spot and by probing their spatial distribution using spatially
and polarization resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Optically injected
exciton spins precess while diffusing over distances exceeding 20 {\mu}m from
the excitation spot with a spatial precession frequency that depends on the
spin transport direction as well as on the bias applied across the DQW
structure. This behavior is attributed to the spin precession in the effective
magnetic field induced by the spin-orbit interaction. From the dependence of
the spin dynamics on the transport direction, bias and external magnetic fields
we directly determined the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin splitting coefficients
for the structure. The precession dynamics is essentially independent on the IX
density, thus indicating that the long spin lifetimes are not associated with
IX collective effects. The latter, together with the negligible contribution of
holes to the spin dynamics, are rather attributed to spatial separation of the
electron and hole wave functions by the electric field, which reduces the
electron-hole exchange interaction. Coherent spin precession over long
transport distances as well as the control of the spin vector using electric
and magnetic fields open the way for the application of IX spins in the quantum
information processing.

stars in five bulge fields as determined from the Gaia-ESO survey data (iDR1).
We use VISTA Variables in The Via Lactea (VVV) photometry to obtain reddening
values by using a semi-empirical T_eff-color calibration. From a Gaussian
decomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clear
bimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of the
specific position on the sky. In agreement with some previous studies, we find
a mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)
that arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poor
components. The number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poor
stars with increasing b. The K-magnitude distribution of the metal-rich
population splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersects
the near and far branches of the X-shaped bulge structure. In addition, two
lateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrasting
characteristics. In the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated by
metal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poor
population and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. Finally, we
find systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-rich
and the metal-poor components of each field. Our chemo-kinematical analysis is
consistent with a varying field-to-field proportion of stars belonging to (i) a
metal-rich boxy/peanut X-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics, and (ii) a
metal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersion
that dominates far from the Galactic plane. These first GES data allow studying
the detailed spatial dependence of the Galactic bulge populations, thanks to
the analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.

  space models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A method for sequential Bayesian inference of the static parameters of a
dynamic state space model is proposed. The method is based on the observation
that many dynamic state space models have a relatively small number of static
parameters (or hyper-parameters), so that in principle the posterior can be
computed and stored on a discrete grid of practical size which can be tracked
dynamically. Further to this, this approach is able to use any existing
methodology which computes the filtering and prediction distributions of the
state process. Kalman filter and its extensions to non-linear/non-Gaussian
situations have been used in this paper. This is illustrated using several
applications: linear Gaussian model, Binomial model, stochastic volatility
model and the extremely non-linear univariate non-stationary growth model.
Performance has been compared to both existing on-line method and off-line
methods.

is much smaller than its invariant mass, the QCD perturbative expansion is
affected by large logarithmic terms that must be resummed to all-orders. This
behavior is well known from the simpler case of hadroproduction of colourless
high-mass systems, such as vector or Higgs boson(s). In the case of $Q{\bar Q}$
production, the final-state heavy quarks carry colour charge and are
responsible for additional soft radiation (through direct emission and
interferences with initial-state radiation) that complicates the evaluation of
the logarithmically-enhanced terms in the small-$q_T$ region. We present the
all-order resummation structure of the logarithmic contributions, which
includes colour flow evolution factors due to soft wide-angle radiation.
Resummation is performed at the completely differential level with respect to
the kinematical variables of the produced heavy quarks. Soft-parton radiation
produces azimuthal correlations that are fully taken into account by the
resummation formalism. These azimuthal correlations are entangled with those
that are produced by initial-state collinear radiation. We present explicit
analytical results up to next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy.

and the transition itself becomes milder. Furthermore, we study the chiral
magnetic conductivity in different phases and find that it grows both in the

chiral symmetry. In the strong coupling regime the chiral magnetic effect is
saturated by vector-like bound states (vector mesons) with mixed transverse

foundation of adaptive (wavelet) algorithms for the numerical treatment of

naturally leads to function spaces of Besov type. But, especially when dealing
with equations on non-smooth manifolds, the definition of these spaces is not
straightforward. Nevertheless, motivated by applications, recently Besov-type
spaces $B^\alpha_{\Psi,q}(L_p(\Gamma))$ on certain two-dimensional, patchwise
smooth surfaces were defined and employed successfully. In the present paper,
we extend this definition (based on wavelet expansions) to a quite general
class of $d$-dimensional manifolds and investigate some analytical properties
(such as, e.g., embeddings and best $n$-term approximation rates) of the
resulting quasi-Banach spaces. In particular, we prove that different prominent
constructions of biorthogonal wavelet systems $\Psi$ on domains or manifolds
$\Gamma$ which admit a decomposition into smooth patches actually generate the
same Besov-type function spaces $B^\alpha_{\Psi,q}(L_p(\Gamma))$, provided that
their univariate ingredients possess a sufficiently large order of cancellation
and regularity (compared to the smoothness parameter $\alpha$ of the space).
For this purpose, a theory of almost diagonal matrices on related sequence
spaces $b^\alpha_{p,q}(\nabla)$ of Besov type is developed.

Thus
far most studies in the radio regime concentrated on the 10 kpc ring. The
central region of M31 has significantly different properties than the outer
parts: The star formation rate is low, and inclination and position angle are
largely different from the outer disk. The existing model of the magnetic field
in the radial range 6<=r<=14 kpc is extended to the innermost part r<=0.5 kpc
to ultimately achieve a picture of the entire magnetic field in M31. We
combined observations taken with the VLA at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm with data from
the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to fill the missing spacings of the synthesis
data. The resulting polarization maps were averaged in sectors to analyse the
azimuthal behaviour of the polarized intensity (PI), rotation measure (RM), and
apparent pitch angle (\phi_obs). We developed a simplified 3-D model for the
magnetic field in the central region to explain the azimuthal behaviour of the
three observables. Our 3-D model of a quadrupolar or dipolar dynamo field can
explain the observed patterns in PI, RM, and \phi_obs, while a 2-D
configuration is not sufficient to explain the azimuthal behaviour. In addition
and independent of our model, the RM pattern shows that the spiral magnetic
field in the inner 0.5 kpc points outward, which is opposite to that in the
outer disk, and has a pitch angle of about 33 degrees, which is much larger
than that of 8-19 degrees in the outer disk. The physical conditions in the
central region differ significantly from those in the 10 kpc ring. In addition,
the orientation of this region with respect to the outer disk is completely
different. The opposite magnetic field directions suggest that the central
region is decoupled from the outer disk, and we propose that an independent
dynamo is active in the central region.

recently been analyzed in the framework of first order perturbation theory
following the standard approach of Regge, Wheeler and Zerilli. In the present
paper we complete this analysis by numerically constructing and discussing the
lines of force of the ""effective"" electric field of the sole particle with the
subtraction of the dominant contribution of the black hole. We also give the
total field due to the black hole and the particle. As the black hole becomes
extreme an effect analogous to the Meissner effect arises for the electric
field, with the ""effective field"" lines of the point charge being expelled by
the outer horizon of the black hole. This effect existing at the level of test
field approximation, i.e. by neglecting the backreaction on the background
metric and electromagnetic field due to the particle's mass and charge, is here
found also at the complete perturbative level. We point out analogies with
similar considerations for magnetic fields by Bi{\v c}\'ak and Dvo{\v r}\'ak.
We also explicitly show that the linearization of the recently obtained
Belinski-Alekseev exact solution coincides with our solution in the
Regge-Wheeler gauge. Our solution thus represents a ""bridge"" between the test
field solution, which neglects all the feedback terms, and the exact two-body

non-volatile resistive memory, therefore, the same architectures, circuits,
select transistor or diodes like in ReRAM or PCRAM can be considered as
implementation. The big advantage of carbon memory might be the high
temperature retention of 250 C, which makes it attractive for automotive and
harsh conditions. This is a white paper for the ITRS meeting on emerging

flat spacetime metric and a squared null vector field, say $\boldsymbol{k}$,
multiplied by some scalar function, say $H$. The basic assumption which led to
Kerr solution was that $\boldsymbol{k}$ be both geodesic and shearfree. This
condition is relaxed here and Kerr-Schild ansatz is revised by treating
Kerr-Schild metrics as {\it exact linear perturbations} of Minkowski spacetime.
The scalar function $H$ is taken as the perturbing function, so that Einstein's
field equations are solved order by order in powers of $H$. It turns out that
the congruence must be geodesic and shearfree as a consequence of third and
second order equations, leading to an alternative derivation of Kerr solution.

the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope is combined with co-spatial and co-temporal
data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics

have always been thought to be radial wave propagation that occurs within
sunspots. Recent research has suggested that they are in fact upwardly
propagating field-aligned waves (UPWs). Here, RPWs within a solar pore are
observed for the first time and are interpreted as UPWs due to the lack of a
penumbra that is required to support RPWs. These UPWs are also observed
co-spatially and co-temporally within several SDO/AIA elemental lines that
sample the transition region and low corona. The observed UPWs are traveling at
a horizontal velocity of around 17 +- 0.5 km s-1 and a minimum vertical
velocity of 42 +- 21 km s-1. The estimated energy of the waves is around 150 W
m-2, which is on the lower bound required to heat the quiet-Sun corona. This is
a new, yet unconsidered source of wave energy within the solar chromosphere and

using a Bayesian approach. Since the early work of Jonas Mockus and Antanas
\v{Z}ilinskas in the 70's, the problem of optimization is usually formulated by
considering the loss function $\max f - M_n$ (where $M_n$ denotes the best
function value observed after $n$ evaluations of $f$). This loss function puts
emphasis on the value of the maximum, at the expense of the location of the
maximizer. In the special case of a one-step Bayes-optimal strategy, it leads
to the classical Expected Improvement (EI) sampling criterion. This is a
special case of a Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) strategy, where the risk
associated to a certain uncertainty measure (here, the expected loss) on the
quantity of interest is minimized at each step of the algorithm. In this
article, assuming that $f$ is defined over a measure space $(\mathbb{X},
\lambda)$, we propose to consider instead the integral loss function
$\int_{\mathbb{X}} (f - M_n)_{+}\, d\lambda$, and we show that this leads, in
the case of a Gaussian process prior, to a new numerically tractable sampling
criterion that we call $\rm EI^2$ (for Expected Integrated Expected
Improvement). A numerical experiment illustrates that a SUR strategy based on
this new sampling criterion reduces the error on both the value and the
location of the maximizer faster than the EI-based strategy.

subsample (SDSS sample) includes ~4000 compact star-forming galaxies from the
SDSS, which were also detected in all four bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum of
the WISE all-sky survey. The second subsample (Herschel sample) is a sample of
28 compact star-forming galaxies observed with Herschel in the FIR range. Data
of the Herschel sample were supplemented by the photometric data from the
Spitzer observations, GALEX, SDSS, WISE, 2MASS, NVSS, and FIRST surveys, as
well as optical and Spitzer spectra and data in sub-mm and radio ranges. It is
found that warm dust luminosities of galaxies from the SDSS sample and cold and
warm dust luminosities of galaxies from the Herschel sample are strongly
correlated with Hbeta luminosities, which implies that one of the main sources
of dust heating in star-forming galaxies is ionising UV radiation of young
stars. Using the relation between warm and cold dust masses for estimating the
total dust mass in star-forming galaxies with an accuracy better than ~0.5 dex
is proposed. On the other hand, it is shown for both samples that dust
temperatures do not depend on the metallicities. The dust-to-neutral gas mass
ratio strongly declines with decreasing metallicity, similar to that found in
other studies of local emission-line galaxies, high-redshift GRB hosts, and
DLAs. On the other hand, the dust-to-ionised gas mass ratio is about one
hundred times as high implying that most of dust is located in the neutral gas.
It is found that thermal free-free emission of ionised gas in compact
star-forming galaxies might be responsible for the sub-mm emission excess. This
effect is stronger in galaxies with lower metallicities and is also positively
affected by an increased star-formation rate.

  In this review we argue that exploiting the full potential of ELTs will

the soon to be commissioned MUSE and VIRUS instruments for the Very Large

for ELTs.
  Design principles for replication are explored along with lessons learned,

engineering friendly and computationally fast but can also be very accurate and

Quadrupole-Ioffe magnetic trap (QUIC Trap). More than 5$\times$$10^{8}$ atoms
from a Magneto-optical trap are loaded into a spherical quadrupole trap and
then these atoms are transferred into an Ioffe trap by moving the Ioffe coil
towards the center of the quadrupole coil, thereby, changing the distance
between quadrupole trap center and the Ioffe coil. The transfer efficiency is
more than 80 \%. This approach is different from a conventional approach of
loading the atoms into a QUIC trap wherein the spherical quadrupole trap is
transformed into a QUIC trap by changing the currents in the quadrupole and the
Ioffe coils. The phase space density is then increased by forced rf evaporative
cooling to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation having more than $10^{5}$

topological semimetals and nodal superconductors that are protected, not only
by nonspatial (i.e., global) symmetries, but also by a crystal reflection

codimension of the Fermi surface (nodal line or point) of the semimetal

with the nonspatial symmetries and (iii) how the Fermi surfaces (nodal lines or

classification is derived by examining all possible symmetry-allowed mass terms
that can be added to the Bloch or Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in a given
symmetry class and by explicitly deriving topological invariants. We discuss
several examples of reflection symmetry protected topological semimetals and
nodal superconductors, including topological crystalline semimetals with mirror
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ numbers and topological crystalline nodal superconductors with

paper deals with a problem of estimation of spectral projectors of the

projectors of $\hat \Sigma_n$ (empirical spectral projectors). The focus is on
the problems where both the sample size $n$ and the effective rank ${\bf

high-dimensional spiked covariance models. Given a spectral projector $P_r$
corresponding to an eigenvalue $\mu_r$ of covariance operator $\Sigma$ and its
empirical counterpart $\hat P_r,$ we derive sharp concentration bounds for
bilinear forms of empirical spectral projector $\hat P_r$ in terms of sample
size $n$ and effective dimension ${\bf r}(\Sigma).$ Building upon these
concentration bounds, we prove the asymptotic normality of bilinear forms of
random operators $\hat P_r -{\mathbb E}\hat P_r$ under the assumptions that
$n\to \infty$ and ${\bf r}(\Sigma)=o(n).$ In a special case of eigenvalues of
multiplicity one, these results are rephrased as concentration bounds and
asymptotic normality for linear forms of empirical eigenvectors. Other results
include bounds on the bias ${\mathbb E}\hat P_r-P_r$ and a method of bias

issues, employing video optical microscopy to study hyperuniformity phenomena
in disordered two-dimensional jammed packings of soft spheres. Using a
combination of experiment and simulation we characterize the detrimental
effects of particle polydispersity, image noise, and finite-size effects on the

improved diagnosis of hyperuniformity from real-space measurements. The key to
this improvement is a simple packing reconstruction algorithm that incorporates
particle polydispersity to minimize free volume. In addition, simulations show
that hyperuniformity can be ascertained more accurately in direct space than in
reciprocal space as a result of finite sample-size. Finally, experimental
colloidal packings of soft polymeric spheres are shown to be hyperuniform.

arise in the dependence of the BAOs on the angle between the orientation of the
galaxy pair and the line of sight. We do so with a derivation of the
configuration-space 2PCF using streaming model. We find that, contrary to
common belief, the locations of BAO peaks in the redshift-space 2PCF are
anisotropic even in the linear theory. Anisotropies in BAO depend strongly on
the method of extracting the peak, showing maximum 3 % angular variation. We
also find that extracting the BAO peak of $r^2\xi(r,\mu)$ significantly reduces
the anisotropy to sub-percent level angular variation. When subtracting the
tilt due to the broadband behavior of the 2PCF, the BAO bump is enhanced along
the line of sight because of local infall velocities toward the BAO bump.
Precise measurement of the angular dependence of the redshift-space 2PCF will
allow new geometrical tests of dark energy beyond the BAO.

gas. In this paper we reanalyze the nebular shock model of chondrule formation
and focus on the downstream boundary condition. We show that for large-scale
plane-parallel chondrule-melting shocks the postshock equilibrium temperature
is too high to avoid volatile loss. Even if we include radiative cooling in
lateral directions out of the disk plane into our model (thereby breaking
strict plane-parallel geometry) we find that for a realistic vertical extent of
the solar nebula disk the temperature decline is not fast enough. On the other
hand, if we assume that the shock is entirely optically thin so that particles
can radiate freely, the cooling rates are too high to produce the observed
chondrules textures. Global nebular shocks are therefore problematic as the
primary sources of chondrules.

The application of periodic boundary conditions to the RVE in tensorial form
enables a simple access to consider tilted fibres and catch the anisotropy

envelopes in the late AGB or post-AGB phase of stellar evolution, which include
a rare class of objects - the ""water fountains"". Our method considers the OH
and H2O maser spectra, the near infrared Q-parameters (these are colour indices
accounting for the effect of extinction), and far-infrared AKARI colours. Here
we first present the results of a new survey on OH and H2O masers. There were
108 colour-selected objects: 53 of them were observed in the three OH maser
lines (1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz), with 24 detections (16 new for 1612 MHz); and
106 of them were observed in the H2O maser line (22 GHz) with 24 detections (12
new). We identify a new potential water fountain source, IRAS19356+0754, with
large velocity coverages of both OH and H2O maser emission. In addition,
several objects with high velocity OH maser emission are reported for the first
time. The Q-parameters as well as the infrared [09]-[18] and [18]-[65] AKARI
colours of the surveyed objects are then calculated. We suggest that these
infrared properties are effective in isolating aspherical from spherical
objects, but the morphology may not necessarily be related to the evolutionary
status. Nonetheless, by considering altogether the maser and infrared
properties, the efficiency of identifying oxygen-rich late/post-AGB stars could
be improved.

the relevant stop search channels in the low-mass region. The SUSY-QCD

effects of final state bottom quarks and $\tau$ leptons have been taken into
account, which are not available in the literature so far. The resulting
branching ratios are investigated in detail. We find that in either of the
decay channels the branching ratios can deviate significantly from one in large
parts of the allowed parameter range. Taking this into account, the
experimental exclusion limits on the stop, which are based on the assumption of
branching ratios equal to one, are considerably weakened. This should be taken
into account in future searches for light stops at the next run of the LHC,

sense that the likelihood function cannot easily be evaluated. Bayesian
estimation in this setting remains challenging, with a lack of computational
methodology to fully exploit modern processing capabilities. In this paper we
introduce novel control variates for intractable likelihoods that can
dramatically reduce the Monte Carlo variance of Bayesian estimators. We prove
that our control variates are well-defined and provide a positive variance
reduction. Furthermore we show how to optimise these control variates for
variance reduction. The methodology is highly parallel and offers a route to
exploit multi-core processing architectures that complements recent research in
this direction. Indeed, our work shows that it may not be necessary to
parallelise the sampling process itself in order to harness the potential of
massively multi-core architectures. Simulation results presented on the Ising

equation models support our theoretical findings.

near-surface layers of the Sun by measuring wave travel times between points on
the solar surface. Specific spatial averages of travel times have been proposed
for distinguishing between flows in the east-west and north-south directions
and measuring the horizontal divergence of the flows. No specific measurement
technique has, however, been developed to measure flow vorticity. Here we
propose a new measurement technique tailored to measuring the vertical
component of vorticity. Fluid vorticity is a fundamental property of solar
convection zone dynamics and of rotating turbulent convection in particular.
The method consists of measuring the travel time of waves along a closed
contour on the solar surface in order to approximate the circulation of the
flow along this contour. Vertical vorticity is related to the difference
between clockwise and counter-clockwise travel times. We applied the method to
characterize the vortical motions of solar convection using helioseismic data
from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO/HMI) and from the Michelson Doppler Imager onboard the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI). Away from the equator, a clear
correlation between vertical vorticity and horizontal divergence is detected.
Horizontal outflows are associated with negative vorticity in the northern
hemisphere and positive vorticity in the southern hemisphere. The signal is
much stronger for HMI than for MDI observations. We characterize the spatial
power spectrum of the signal by comparison with a noise model. Vertical
vorticity at horizontal wavenumbers below 250/R_Sun can be probed with this
helioseismic technique.

Such oscillations arise in models of warm dark matter composed of an ultralight

and Rubakov (2014). In the monochromatic approximation, the stringent upper
limit (95% c.l.) on the variable gravitational potential amplitude is found to
be Psi_c<1.14 10^{-15}, corresponding to the characteristic strain
h_c=2\sqrt{3}\Psi_c < 4 10^{-15} at frequency f=1.75 10^{-8} Hz. In the

ultrasound (HIFU) requires the numerical simulation of nonlinear ultrasound
propagation through heterogeneous and absorbing media. This is a
computationally demanding problem due to the large distances travelled by the
ultrasound waves relative to the wavelength of the highest frequency harmonic.
Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to solve a set of coupled
partial differential equations equivalent to a generalised Westervelt equation.
The model is implemented in C++ and parallelised using the message passing
interface (MPI) for solving large-scale problems on distributed clusters. The
domain is partitioned using a 1D slab decomposition, and global communication
is performed using a sparse communication pattern. Operations in the spatial
frequency domain are performed in transposed space to reduce the communication
burden imposed by the 3D fast Fourier transform. The performance of the model
is evaluated using grid sizes up to 4096 x 2048 x 2048 grid points distributed
over a cluster using up to 1024 compute cores. Given the global nature of the
gradient calculation, the model shows good strong scaling behaviour, with a
speed-up of 1.7x whenever the number of cores is doubled. This means
large-scale simulations can be distributed across high numbers of cores on a
cluster to minimise execution times with a relatively small computational
overhead. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by simulating the
ultrasound beam pattern for a HIFU sonication of the kidney.

verify this interpretation, we applied a simple, fairly generic model (one
integro-differential equation) emphasizing via Gaussian kernels non-local
facilitative and competitive feedbacks of the vegetation biomass density on its
own dynamics. We show that under realistic assumptions and parameter values

first focus on the eigenvalues for an operator linearized at an approximate
solution. An excluding theorem is presented such that we know under some
condition, and there is no eigenvalue in some disks. Some computable criteria
are constructed to apply the theorem in a computer. And also the invertibility
of some operator is proved theoretically in the paper. However, we need the

coagulation found in our previous work to the modelling of the wavelength
dependence of interstellar linear polarization. We especially focus on the
parameters of the Serkowski curve $K$ and $\lambda_{\max}$ characterizing the
width and the maximum wavelength of this curve, respectively. We use aligned
silicate and non-aligned carbonaceous spheroidal particles with different
aspect ratios $a/b$. The imperfect alignment of grains with sizes larger than a
cut-off size $r_{V,\rm cut}$ is considered. We find that the evolutionary
effects on the polarization curve are negligible in the original model with
commonly used material parameters (hydrogen number density $n_\mathrm{H}=10^3$
cm$^{-3}$, gas temperature $T_\mathrm{gas}=10$~K, and the sticking probability
for accretion $S_\mathrm{acc}=0.3$). Therefore, we apply the tuned model where
the coagulation threshold of silicate is removed. In this model,
$\lambda_{\max}$ displaces to the longer wavelengths and the polarization curve
becomes wider ($K$ reduces) on time-scales $\sim (30 - 50) (n_\mathrm{H}/10^3
\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1}$ Myr. The tuned models at $T < 30 (n_\mathrm{H}/10^3
\mathrm{cm}^{-3})^{-1} $ Myr and different values of the parameters $r_{V,\rm
cut}$ can also explain the observed trend between $K$ and $\lambda_{\max}$. It
is significant that the evolutionary effect appears in the perpendicular
direction to the effect of $r_{V,\rm cut}$ on the $K$ - $\lambda_{\max}$
diagram. Very narrow polarization curves can be reproduced if we change the
type of particles (prolate/oblate) and/or vary $a/b$.

its performance. Examples include power-grid, sensor, and neuron networks as

interaction revealed that improvements in the network connectivity such as
making the network more connected and homogeneous enhances synchronization.
However, real-world networks have directed and weighted connections. In such
directed networks, understanding the impact of structural changes on the

For instance, introducing new links to reduce the minimum distance between

challenge for those wishing to make a detection of the Epoch of Reionization

levels of assumption have been trialled and shown promising recoveries on
simulated data. Recently however there has been increased discussion of using
the expected shape of the foregrounds in Fourier space to define an EoR window
free of foreground contamination. By carrying out analysis within this window
only, one can avoid the foregrounds and any statistical bias they might
introduce by instead removing these foregrounds. In this paper we discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of both foreground removal and foreground
avoidance. We create a series of simulations with noise levels in line with
both current and future experiments and compare the recovered statistical
cosmological signal from foreground avoidance and a simplified, frequency
independent foreground removal model. We find that while, for current
generation experiments, foreground avoidance enables a better recovery at
$k_{perp} > 0.6 \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, foreground removal is able to recover
significantly more signal at small $k_{los}$ for both current and future
experiments. We also relax the assumption that the foregrounds are smooth by
introducing a Gaussian random factor along the line-of-sight and then also
spatially. We find that both methods perform well for foreground models with
line-of-sight and spatial variations around $0.1\%$ however at levels larger
than this foregrounds removal shows a greater signal recovery.

interference downlink transmission and physical layer multicasting is
established. In this context, novel constructive interference precoding
techniques that tackle the transmit power minimization (min power) with
individual SINR constraints at each user's receivers is proposed. Furthermore,
fairness through maximizing the weighted minimum SINR (max min SINR) of the
users is addressed by finding the link between the min power and max min SINR
problems. Moreover, heuristic precoding techniques are proposed to tackle the
weighted sum rate problem. Finally, extensive numerical results show that the
proposed schemes outperform other state of the art techniques.

(OFDFT) that simultaneously provides access to all-electron values and
preserves the OFDFT linear scaling as a function of the system size. Using the
projector augmented-wave method (PAW) in combination with real-space methods we
overcome some obstacles faced by other available implementation schemes.
Specifically, the advantages of using the PAW method are two fold. First, PAW
reproduces all-electron values offering freedom in adjusting the convergence
parameters and the atomic setups allow tuning the numerical accuracy per
element. Second, PAW can provide a solution to some of the convergence problems
exhibited in other OFDFT implementations based on Kohn-Sham codes. Using PAW
and real-space methods, our orbital-free results agree with the reference
all-electron values with a mean absolute error of 10~meV and the number of
iterations required by the self-consistent cycle is comparable to the KS
method. The comparison of all-electron and pseudopotential bulk modulus and
lattice constant reveal an enormous difference, demonstrating that in order to
assess the performance of OFDFT functionals it is necessary to use
implementations that obtain all-electron values. The proposed combination of
methods is the most promising route currently available. We finally show that a
parametrized kinetic energy functional can give lattice constants and bulk
moduli comparable in accuracy to those obtained by the KS PBE method,
exemplified with the case of diamond.

fitness dynamics on the slower time-scales at which the relevant genetic

switches, the population manages to adapt on the fast time-scales yielding a
finite positive contribution to the fitness. However, such contribution is
balanced by the continuous loss in fitness due to the varying selection so that
the statistics of the global fitness can be described neglecting the details of
the fast environmental process. The occurrence of adaptation on fast
time-scales would be undetectable if one were to consider only the effective
genotype and fitness dynamics on the slow time-scales. We therefore propose an
experimental observable to detect it.
