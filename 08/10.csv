misconception. If $K$ is a field, $f\in K[X]$ is separable and irreducible over
$K$, and $g$ is a polynomial dividing $f$, whose coefficients lie in some
finite Galois extension of $K$, it may seem natural to assert that the product
of the conjugates of $g$ over $K[X]$ is $f$. But this assertion is wrong,
except in one particular case. In this note, we make the relation between $K$,
$f$, the product of the conjugates of $g$, and the coefficient field of $g$,
precise. In particular, it is shown that the product of the conjugates of $g$
over $K[X]$ is equal to $f^n$, with $n\in \mathbb N$.

Restricting attention to one-dimensional geometries, the asymmetric simple
exclusion process (ASEP) plays a paradigmatic role to describe noise-activated
driven motion of entities subject to an excluded volume interaction and many
variants have been studied in recent years. While in the standard ASEP the
noise is Poissonian and the process is therefore Markovian, in many
applications the statistics of the activating noise has non-standard
distribution with possible memory effects resulting from internal degrees of
freedom or external sources. This leads to temporal correlations and can
significantly affect the shape of the current-density relation as has been
studied recently for a number of scenarios. In this paper we report a general
framework to derive the fundamental diagram of ASEPs driven by non-Poissonian
noise by using effectively only two simple quantities, viz., the mean residual
lifetime of the jump distribution and a suitably defined temporal correlation
length. We corroborate our results by detailed numerical studies for various
noise statistics under periodic boundary conditions and discuss how our
approach can be applied to more general driven diffusive systems.

magnetic fields is commonly invoked in atmospheric and inner magnetospheric
models of x-ray and soft gamma-ray emission in high-field pulsars and
magnetars. A major influence of the field is to introduce resonances at the
cyclotron frequency and its harmonics, where the incoming photon accesses
thresholds for the creation of virtual electrons or positrons in intermediate
states with excited Landau levels. At these resonances, the effective cross
section typically exceeds the classical Thomson value by over 2 orders of
magnitude. Near and above the quantum critical magnetic field of 44.13
TeraGauss, relativistic corrections must be incorporated when computing this
cross section. This paper presents formalism for the QED magnetic Compton
differential cross section valid for both subcritical and supercritical fields,
yet restricted to scattered photons that are below pair creation threshold.
Calculations are developed for the particular case of photons initially
propagating along the field, mathematically simple specializations that are
germane to interactions involving relativistic electrons frequently found in
neutron star magnetospheres. This exposition of relativistic, quantum, magnetic
Compton cross sections treats electron spin dependence fully, since this is a
critical feature for describing the finite decay lifetimes of the intermediate
states. The formalism employs both the Johnson and Lippmann (JL) wave functions
and the Sokolov and Ternov (ST) electron eigenfunctions of the magnetic Dirac
equation. The ST states are formally correct for self-consistently treating
spin-dependent effects that are so important in the resonances. Relatively
compact analytic forms for the cross sections are presented that will prove
useful for astrophysical modelers.

mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT). Dynamical processes that
are mainly entropic in origin slow down mass transport (as expressed through
self diffusion) in the mixture as compared to the ideal-mixing contribution.
Interdiffusion of chemical species is a competition of slow kinetic modes with
a strong thermodynamic driving force that is caused by non-entropic
interactions. The combination of both dynamic and thermodynamic effects causes
qualitative differences in the concentration dependence of self-diffusion and
interdiffusion coefficients. At high temperatures, the thermodynamic
enhancement of interdiffusion prevails, while at low temperatures, kinetic
effects dominate the concentration dependence, rationalized within MCT as the
approach to its ideal-glass transition temperature $T_c$. The Darken equation
relating self- and interdiffusion qualitatively reproduces the
concentration-dependence in both Zr-Ni and Al-Ni, but quantitatively, the
kinetic contributions to interdiffusion can be slower than the lower bound
suggested by the Darken equation. As temperature is decreased, the agreement
with Darken's equation improves, due to a strong coupling of all kinetic modes
that is a generic feature predicted by MCT.

theory (DMFT). At lower doping around $x$=0.3, rather close to Mott-critical
half-filling, the single-particle spectral function of Na$_x$CoO$_2$ displays
an upper Hubbard band which is captured within DMFT. Momentum-dependent
self-energy effects beyond DMFT become dominant at higher doping. Around a
doping level of $x\sim 0.67$, the incoherent excitations give way to
finite-energy spin-polaron excitations in close agreement with optics
experiments. These excitations are a direct consequence of the formation of
bound states between quasiparticles and paramagnons in the proximity to
in-plane ferromagnetic ordering.

In this article, we have formulated the population size estimation problem in
DRS as a missing data analysis under both the known and unknown directional
nature of underlying behavioral response effect. Two simple empirical Bayes
approaches are proposed and investigated their performances for this complex
model along with a fully Bayes treatment. Extensive simulation studies are
carried out to compare the performances of these competitive approaches and a

\subseteq V$ an ordered subset of vertices. The metric representation of a
vertex $u\in V$ with respect to $S$ is the $t$-vector $r(u|S) = (d_G(u, w_1),
\cdots, d_G(u, w_t))$, where $d_G(u, v)$ represents the length of a shortest
$u-v$ path in $G$. The set $S$ is called a resolving set for $G$ if $r(u|S) =
r(v|S)$ implies $u = v$ for every $u, v \in V$. The smallest cardinality of a
resolving set is the metric dimension of $G$. In this article we propose, to
the best of our knowledge, a new problem in Graph Theory that resembles to the
aforementioned metric dimension problem. We call $S$ a $k$-antiresolving set if
$k$ is the largest positive integer such that for every vertex $v \in V-S$
there exist other $k-1$ different vertices $v_1, \cdots, v_{k-1} \in V-S$ with
$r(v|S) = r(v_1|S) = \cdots = r(v_{k-1}|S)$, \emph{i.e.}, $v$ and $v_1, \cdots,
v_{k-1}$ have the same metric representation with respect to $S$. The
$k$-metric antidimension of $G$ is the minimum cardinality among all the
$k$-antiresolving sets for $G$.
  In this article, we introduce a novel privacy measure, named $(k,
\ell)$-anonymity and based on the $k$-metric antidimension problem, aimed at
evaluating the resistance of social graphs to active attacks. We, therefore,
propose a true-biased algorithm for computing the $k$-metric antidimension of
random graphs. The success rate of our algorithm, according to empirical
results, is above $80 \%$ and $90 \%$ when looking for a $k$-antiresolving
basis and a $k$-antiresolving set respectively. We also investigate theoretical
properties of the $k$-antiresolving sets and the $k$-metric antidimension of

renormalization. In this paper we propose a detailed and exact scaling picture
for critical region of the model with cyclic boundary. Unlike the previous
papers our approach is based on a comparison with the existing exact and
rigorous results for the FK-random-cluster model on a complete graph. Based on
those results we identify several distinct scaling regions in an $L$-dependent
window around the critical point. We test these predictions by comparing with
data from Monte Carlo simulations and find a good agreement. The main feature
which differs between the complete graph and the five dimensional model with
free boundary is the existence of a bimodal energy distribution near the
critical point in the latter. This feature was found by the same authors in an
earlier paper in the form of a quasi-first order phase transition for the same

domain of attraction of any global maximizer of the population likelihood. This
characterization is based on a novel view of the EM updates as a perturbed form
of likelihood ascent, or in parallel, of the gradient EM updates as a perturbed

provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the EM and gradient EM algorithms when
applied to a finite set of samples. We develop consequences of our general
theory for three canonical examples of incomplete-data problems: mixture of
Gaussians, mixture of regressions, and linear regression with covariates
missing completely at random. In each case, our theory guarantees that with a
suitable initialization, a relatively small number of EM (or gradient EM) steps

settings where spreading requires the influence by two or more neighbors. In a
$k$-complex contagion, a cluster of nodes are initially infected, and
additional nodes become infected in the next round if they have at least $k$
already infected neighbors. It has been argued that complex contagions better
model behavioral changes such as adoption of new beliefs, fashion trends or
expensive technology innovations. This has motivated rigorous understanding of
spreading of complex contagions in social networks. Despite simple contagions
($k=1$) that spread fast in all small world graphs, how complex contagions
spread is much less understood. Previous work~\cite{Ghasemiesfeh:2013:CCW}
analyzes complex contagions in Kleinberg's small world
model~\cite{kleinberg00small} where edges are randomly added according to a
spatial distribution (with exponent $\gamma$) on top of a two dimensional grid
structure. It has been shown in~\cite{Ghasemiesfeh:2013:CCW} that the speed of
complex contagions differs exponentially when $\gamma=0$ compared to when
$\gamma=2$.
  In this paper, we fully characterize the entire parameter space of $\gamma$
except at one point, and provide upper and lower bounds for the speed of
$k$-complex contagions. We study two subtly different variants of Kleinberg's
small world model and show that, with respect to complex contagions, they
behave differently. For each model and each $k \geq 2$, we show that there is
an intermediate range of values, such that when $\gamma$ takes any of these
values, a $k$-complex contagion spreads quickly on the corresponding graph, in
a polylogarithmic number of rounds. However, if $\gamma$ is outside this range,
then a $k$-complex contagion requires a polynomial number of rounds to spread
to the entire network.

latest, by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), on any given day (distortion due

na\""ive assumption that the sun always sets latest at the westernmost point,
the point of last sunset changes cyclically over the course of a year due to
the changing orientation of the axis of the Earth with respect to the sun.
Specifically, between the winter and summer solstices the last sunset shifts
successively from Cabo de Sao Vicente (Portugal) to Cabo da Roca (Portugal) to
Cabo Tourinan (Spain) to a site near Aglapsvik (Norway) to a location in the
Norwegian municipality of Masoy south of Havoysund; and it shifts back again
between the summer and winter solstices. There are two days in the year (April
24th and August 18th) on which the last sunset of mainland Europe (shared in
those days effectively by Cabo Tourinan and the Aglapsvik area) coincides with
the last sunset of mainland Africa, at a site in Western Sahara near Cap Blanc.

demonstrate that an unknown state of the three-level quantum system can be
universally protected against both colored phase and amplitude noises when the
control-pulse sequences and control operators are properly designed. The
advantage of using non-Markovian quantum state diffusion equations is that the
control dynamics of open quantum systems can be treated exactly without using

and full Haar measure to arbitrary (not necessarily locally compact) Polish
groups. The main goal of the paper is to answer the following question: What
can we say about the Hausdorff and packing dimension of the fibers of prevalent
continuous maps?
  Let $K$ be an uncountable compact metric space. We prove that the prevalent
$f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$ has many fibers with almost maximal Hausdorff
dimension. This generalizes a theorem of Dougherty and yields that the
prevalent $f\in C(K,\mathbb{R}^d)$ has graph of maximal Hausdorff dimension,
generalizing a result of Bayart and Heurteaux. We obtain similar results for
the packing dimension.
  We show that for the prevalent $f\in C([0,1]^m,\mathbb{R}^d)$ the set of
$y\in f([0,1]^m)$ for which $\dim_H f^{-1}(y)=m$ contains a dense open set
having full measure with respect to the occupation measure $\lambda^m \circ
f^{-1}$, where $\dim_H$ and $\lambda^m$ denote the Hausdorff dimension and the
$m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, respectively. We also prove an analogous
result when $[0,1]^m$ is replaced by any self-similar set satisfying the open
set condition.
  We cannot replace the occupation measure with Lebesgue measure in the above
statement: We show that the functions $f\in C[0,1]$ for which positively many
level sets are singletons form a non-shy set in $C[0,1]$. In order to do so, we
generalize a theorem of Antunovi\'c, Burdzy, Peres and Ruscher. As a
complementary result we prove that the functions $f\in C[0,1]$ for which
$\dim_H f^{-1}(y)=1$ for all $y\in (\min f,\max f)$ form a non-shy set in
$C[0,1]$.
  We also prove sharper results in which large Hausdorff dimension is replaced
by positive measure with respect to generalized Hausdorff measures, which
answers a problem of Fraser and Hyde.

walks (SBRW), this setup is modeled both via partial differential equations and
by Monte-Carlo simulations. The problem is non-interacting until the opposite
particles visit the same cell of the considered particle. In this situation,
delays on the residence time of the particles per cell depends on the
concentration of particles of opposite species. We analyzed the fluctuations on
the position of particles and our results show a non-regular diffusion
characterized by long-tailed and asymmetric distributions which is better
fitted by some chromatograph distributions found in the literature. We also
show that effects of the reverse crowd particles is able to enlarge the

wireless sensor network with a coherent multiple access channel, when the
fusion center (FC) is configured with a large number of antennas and the
wireless channels between the sensor nodes and FC experience Rayleigh fading.
For the detection problem, we study the Neyman-Pearson (NP) Detector and Energy
Detector (ED), and find optimal values for the sensor transmission gains. For
the NP detector which requires channel state information (CSI), we show that
detection performance remains asymptotically constant with the number of FC
antennas if the sensor transmit power decreases proportionally with the
increase in the number of antennas. Performance bounds show that the benefit of
multiple antennas at the FC disappears as the transmit power grows. The results
of the NP detector are also generalized to the linear minimum mean squared
error estimator. For the ED which does not require CSI, we derive optimal gains
that maximize the deflection coefficient of the detector, and we show that a
constant deflection can be asymptotically achieved if the sensor transmit power
scales as the inverse square root of the number of FC antennas. Unlike the NP
detector, for high sensor power the multi-antenna ED is observed to empirically
have significantly better performance than the single-antenna implementation. A
number of simulation results are included to validate the analysis.

variations in this source ceased some time between June 2006 and February 2007.
The evolution of the source spectrum and the long-term lightcurve, and the
persistent compactness of the source VLBI structure indicates that the
cessation of rapid variability was associated with the passage of the
scattering material out of the line of sight to the quasar. We present an
analysis of the linear polarization variations and their relation to total
intensity variations. The proper motion of polarized features in the quasar jet
is found to be subluminal. Systematic time delays between Stokes I, Q and U, in
combination with the structure of the source obtained from 8.4GHz VLBI data,
confirm the estimate of the screen distance: 1-2pc, making the screen one of
the nearest objects to the Solar System.
  We determine the physical properties of this scattering material. The
electron density in the scattering region is extremely high with respect to the
warm ionized ISM, with an estimated density of $n_e \sim 97 \, l_0^{1/3}
{\Delta L}_{100}^{-1/2}$cm$^{-3}$, where $l_0$ is the outer scale of the
turbulence in AU and $\Delta L = 100 \Delta L_{100}$ AU is the depth of the
scattering region. If this plasma is in pressure balance with the local
magnetic field, one expects a ~2 rad/m^2 rotation measure change associated
with the passage of this material past the quasar. We examine the rotation
measures of sources and the diffuse polarized emission in the surrounding
region. We place a limit of 10 rad/m^2 on the RM change. The variability of
sources near J1819+3845 is used to deduce that the screen must therefore be
either very small (~100 AU) or patchy.

researchers' recent attention due to their surprising reliability and
computational efficiency in different application areas. Typically, such
algorithms are shown to compute with very high probability low-rank

perform even better in many practical situations. In this paper, we present a
novel error analysis that considers randomized algorithms within the subspace
iteration framework and show with very high probability that highly accurate

quickly for matrices with rapidly decaying singular values. Such matrices
appear frequently in diverse application areas such as data analysis, fast
structured matrix computations and fast direct methods for large sparse linear

control channels; an example for such a system is that of an inertial particle
experiencing random ""white noise"" forcing. We show that a target probability
distribution can always be achieved in finite time. The optimal control is
given in state-feedback form and is computed explicitely by solving a pair of
differential Lyapunov equations that are coupled through their boundary values.
This result, given its attractive algorithmic nature, appears to have several
potential applications such as to active control of nanomechanical systems and
molecular cooling. The problem to steer a diffusion process between end-point
marginals has a long history (Schr\""odinger bridges) and therefore, the present
case of steering a linear stochastic system constitutes a Schr\""odinger bridge
for possibly degenerate diffusions. Our results, however, provide the first
implementable form of the optimal control for a general Gauss-Markov process.
Illustrative examples of the optimal evolution and control for inertial
particles and a stochastic oscillator are provided. A final result establishes
directly the property of Schr\""{o}dinger bridges as the most likely random
evolution between given marginals to the present context of linear stochastic

strongly constrained by background and scalar perturbations, $0\le \alpha_{M}<

such tight bounds are weakened and the B modes can provide useful constraints

brighter than the flux limit due to instrumental noise and (smooth) sky
background. We have investigated the possibility of de-confusing simulated
\Herschel PACS-160\micron images by using strong Bayesian priors on the
positions and weak priors on the flux of sources. We find the blended sources
and group them together and simultaneously fit their fluxes. We derive the
posterior probability distribution function of fluxes subject to these priors
through Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling by fitting the image. Assuming
we can predict FIR flux of sources based on ultraviolet-optical part of their
SEDs to within an order of magnitude, the simulations show that we can obtain
reliable fluxes and uncertainties at least a factor of three fainter than the
confusion noise limit of $3\sigma_{c} $=2.7 mJy in our simulated PACS-160

source confusion in any situation where one has prior information of positions

have used simplified versions of the precoder to obtain promising performance
gains. These gains have been hypothesized to stem from the additional degrees
of freedom that allow for interference mitigation through interference
relegation to orthogonal subspaces. However, no conclusive or rigorous
understanding has yet been developed. In this paper, we build on an intuitive
interference induction trade-off and the aforementioned precoding structure to
propose an interference aware RZF (iaRZF) precoding scheme for multi cell
downlink systems and we analyze its rate performance. Special emphasis is
placed on the induced interference mitigation mechanism of iaRZF. For example,
we will verify the intuitive expectation that the precoder structure can either
completely remove induced inter-cell or intra-cell interference. We state new
results from large-scale random matrix theory that make it possible to give
more intuitive and insightful explanations of the precoder behavior, also for
cases involving imperfect channel state information (CSI). We remark especially
that the interference-aware precoder makes use of all available information
about interfering channels to improve performance. Even very poor CSI allows
for significant sum-rate gains. Our obtained insights are then used to propose
heuristic precoder parameters for arbitrary systems, whose effectiveness are
shown in more involved system scenarios. Furthermore, calculation and
implementation of these parameters does not require explicit inter base station
cooperation.

number of parameters, not all of equal macroscopic relevance. We examine a
decorated $(1+3)$ Ising spin chain containing two microscopic parameters: a
""stiff"" $K$ mediating the long-range interactions, and a ""sloppy"" $J$ operating
within local spin groups. $K$ dominates the macroscopic behavior, and varying
$J$ has weak effect except in regions where $J$ brings about transitions
between phases through its conditioning of the local spin groups with which $K$
interacts. We calculate the heat capacity $C_H$, the magnetic susceptibility
$\chi_T$, and the thermodynamic curvature $R$. For large $|J/K|$, we identify
four magnetic phases: ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and two ferrimagnetic
ones, according to the signs of $K$ and $J$. We argue that for characterizing
these phases, the strongest picture is offered by the thermodynamic geometric
invariant $R$, proportional to the correlation length $\xi$. This picture has
correspondences to other cases, such as fluids.

  operations",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we introduce a framework to study the effect of random
operations on the combinatorial list-decodability of a code. The operations we
consider correspond to row and column operations on the matrix obtained from
the code by stacking the codewords together as columns. This captures many
natural transformations on codes, such as puncturing, folding, and taking
subcodes; we show that many such operations can improve the list-decoding
properties of a code. There are two main points to this. First, our goal is to
advance our (combinatorial) understanding of list-decodability, by
understanding what structure (or lack thereof) is necessary to obtain it.
Second, we use our more general results to obtain a few interesting corollaries
for list decoding:
  (1) We show the existence of binary codes that are combinatorially
list-decodable from $1/2-\epsilon$ fraction of errors with optimal rate
$\Omega(\epsilon^2)$ that can be encoded in linear time.
  (2) We show that any code with $\Omega(1)$ relative distance, when randomly
folded, is combinatorially list-decodable $1-\epsilon$ fraction of errors with
high probability. This formalizes the intuition for why the folding operation
has been successful in obtaining codes with optimal list decoding parameters;
previously, all arguments used algebraic methods and worked only with specific
codes.
  (3) We show that any code which is list-decodable with suboptimal list sizes
has many subcodes which have near-optimal list sizes, while retaining the error
correcting capabilities of the original code. This generalizes recent results
where subspace evasive sets have been used to reduce list sizes of codes that
achieve list decoding capacity.

reproduces a conformal superalgebra structure which has been considered in the
literature before. The tractor approach, however, makes clear that the failure
of this object to be a Lie superalgebra in certain cases is due to purely
algebraic identities on the spinor module and to special properties of the
conformal holonomy representation. Moreover, it naturally generalizes to higher
signatures. This yields new formulas for constructing new twistor spinors and
higher order normal conformal Killing forms out of existing ones, generalizing
the well-known spinorial Lie derivative. Moreover, we derive restrictions on

independent broad band at $\sim $~2750 cm$^{-1}$ with a large band-width $\sim
1800$~cm$^{-1}$. For Na$_2$IrO$_3$ the broad band is seen for temperatures $
\leq 200$~K and persists inside the magnetically ordered state. For Li doped
samples, the intensity of this mode increases, shifts to lower wave-numbers and
persists to higher temperatures. Such a mode has recently been predicted
(Knolle et.al.) as a signature of the Kitaev spin liquid. We assign the
observation of the broad band to be a signature of strong Kitaev-exchange
correlations. The fact that the broad band persists even inside the
magnetically ordered state suggests that dynamically fluctuating moments
survive even below $T_{N}$. This is further supported by our mean field
calculations. The Raman response calculated in mean field theory shows that the
broad band predicted for the spin liquid state survives in the magnetically
ordered state near the zigzag-spin liquid phase boundary. A comparison with the
theoretical model gives an estimate of the Kitaev exchange interaction
parameter to be $J_K\approx 57$~meV.

the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand co-ordinates and are well suited to numerical studies
of black hole formation.
  We then use these equations of motion for the massless scalar field to study
the formation of general relativistic black holes in four to eight dimensions
and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes in five and six dimensions. We study
Choptuik scaling, a phenomenon which relates the initial conditions of a matter
distribution to the final observables of small black holes.
  In both higher dimensional general relativity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity we confirm the existence of cusps in the mass scaling relation which
had previously only been observed in four dimensional general relativity. In
the general relativistic case we then calculate the critical exponents for four
to eight dimensions and find agreement with previous calculations by Bland et.
al. but not Sorkin et. al. who both worked in null co-ordinates.
  For the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet case we find that the self-similar behaviour
seen in the general relativistic case is destroyed. We find that it is replaced
by some other form of scaling structure. In five dimensions we find that the
period of the critical solution at the origin is proportional to roughly the
cube root of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter and that there is evidence for a
minimum black hole radius. In six dimensions we see evidence for a new type of
scaling. We also show, from the equations of motion, that there is reason to

small number of spectral atoms with arbitrary frequencies on the unit interval.
In this paper we study the problem of line spectrum denoising and estimation
with an ensemble of spectrally-sparse signals composed of the same set of
continuous-valued frequencies from their partial and noisy observations. Two
approaches are developed based on atomic norm minimization and structured
covariance estimation, both of which can be solved efficiently via semidefinite
programming. The first approach aims to estimate and denoise the set of signals
from their partial and noisy observations via atomic norm minimization, and
recover the frequencies via examining the dual polynomial of the convex
program. We characterize the optimality condition of the proposed algorithm and
derive the expected convergence rate for denoising, demonstrating the benefit
of including multiple measurement vectors. The second approach aims to recover
the population covariance matrix from the partially observed sample covariance
matrix by motivating its low-rank Toeplitz structure without recovering the
signal ensemble. Performance guarantee is derived with a finite number of
measurement vectors. The frequencies can be recovered via conventional spectrum
estimation methods such as MUSIC from the estimated covariance matrix. Finally,
numerical examples are provided to validate the favorable performance of the
proposed algorithms, with comparisons against several existing approaches.

generalized so that it acquires a well-defined z-component of the orbital
angular momentum (OAM), while may not acquire a typical ""doughnut"" spatial
profile. Such quantum states and beams, in contrast to the Bessel ones, may
have an azimuthal-angle-dependent probability density and finite quantum
uncertainty of the OAM, which is determined by the packet's width. We construct
a well-normalized Airy wave-packet, which can be interpreted as a one-particle
state for relativistic massive boson, show that its center moves along the same
quasi-classical straight path and, what is more important, spreads with time
and distance exactly as a Gaussian wave-packet does, in accordance with the
uncertainty principle. It is explained that this fact does not contradict the
well-known ""non-spreading"" feature of the Airy beams. While the effective OAM
for such states is zero, its quantum uncertainty (or the beam's OAM bandwidth)
is found to be finite, and it depends on the packet's parameters. A link
