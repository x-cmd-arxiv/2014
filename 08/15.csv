simultaneous drawing is one in which each graph is drawn planar, there are no
edge overlaps and the crossings between the two graphs form right angles. The
geometric version restricts the problem to straight-line drawings. It is known,
however, that there exists a wheel and a matching which do not admit a
geometric RAC simultaneous drawing.
  In order to enlarge the class of graphs that admit RAC simultaneous drawings,
we allow bends in the resulting drawings. We prove that two planar graphs
always admit a RAC simultaneous drawing with six bends per edge each, in
quadratic area. For more restricted classes of planar graphs (i.e., matchings,
paths, cycles, outerplanar graphs and subhamiltonian graphs), we manage to
significantly reduce the required number of bends per edge, while keeping the
area quadratic.

creates plausible deformations in an interactive manner. However, this method
is susceptible to artifacts, in particular close to the deformation handles.
These artifacts often correlate with strong gradients of the deformation
energy.In this work, we propose a novel formulation of harmonic surface
deformation, which incorporates a regularization of the deformation energy. To
do so, we build on and extend a recently introduced generic linear
regularization approach. It can be expressed as a change of norm for the linear
optimization problem, i.e., the regularization is baked into the optimization.
This minimizes the implementation complexity and has only a small impact on
runtime. Our results show that a moderate use of regularization suppresses many
deformation artifacts common to the well-known harmonic surface deformation
method, without introducing new artifacts.

galaxies it is important to study the hosts when the SMBH is near its peak
activity. A method to investigate the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars
is to obtain optical spectra at positions offset from the nucleus where the
relative contribution of the quasar and host are comparable. However, at these
extended radii the galaxy surface brightness is often low (20-22 mag per
arcsec$^{2}$) and the resulting spectrum might have such low S/N that it
hinders analysis with standard stellar population modeling techniques. To
address this problem we have developed a method that can recover galaxy star
formation histories (SFHs) from rest frame optical spectra with S/N $\sim$
5~\AA$^{-1}$. This method uses the statistical technique diffusion k-means to
tailor the stellar population modeling basis set. Our diffusion k-means minimal
basis set, composed of 4 broad age bins, is successful in recovering a range of
galaxy SFHs. Additionally, using an analytic prescription for seeing
conditions, we are able to simultaneously model scattered quasar light and the
SFH of quasar host galaxies (QHGs). We use synthetic data to compare results of
our novel method with previous techniques. We also present the modeling results
on a previously published QHG and show that galaxy properties recovered from a
diffusion k-means basis set are less sensitive to noise added to this quasar
host galaxy spectrum. Our new method has a clear advantage in recovering
information from QHGs and could also be applied to the analysis of other low
S/N galaxy spectra such as those typically obtained for high redshift objects

strong Seebeck and Peltier effects, and consider their use as heat-engines and
refrigerators with finite power outputs. This article gives detailed
derivations of the results summarized in Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 130601 (2014).
It shows how to use the scattering theory to find (i) the quantum
thermoelectric with maximum possible power output, and (ii) the quantum
thermoelectric with maximum efficiency at given power output. The latter
corresponds to a minimal entropy production at that power output. These
quantities are of quantum origin since they depend on system size over
electronic wavelength, and so have no analogue in classical thermodynamics. The
maximal efficiency coincides with Carnot efficiency at zero power output, but
decreases with increasing power output. This gives a fundamental lower bound on
entropy production, which means that reversibility (in the thermodynamic sense)
is impossible for finite power output. The suppression of efficiency by
(nonlinear) phonon and photon effects is addressed in detail; when these
effects are strong, maximum efficiency coincides with maximum power. Finally,
we show in particular limits (typically without magnetic fields) that
relaxation within the quantum system does not allow the system to exceed the
bounds derived for relaxation-free systems, however, a general proof of this
remains elusive.

non-cooperative self-assembly. We define a generalization of the abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM), such that a tile system consists of a collection of
polyomino tiles, the Polyomino Tile Assembly Model (polyTAM), and investigate
the computational powers of polyTAM systems at temperature 1, where attachment
among tiles occurs without glue cooperation. Systems composed of the
unit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of
Turing universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1,
are able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino $P$ of size 3 or
greater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-$P$
tiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric
properties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to
effectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of
assemblies, while allowing others to complete.
  To round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e.
aTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally
universal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit-reading,
which is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1
computationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyominoes with
a limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally
universal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems. Finally,
we connect our work with other work on domino self-assembly to show that
temperature-1 assembly with at least 2 distinct shapes, regardless of the
shapes or their sizes, allows for universal computation.

regime of weak gravitational fields. In this approach, Einstein's equations are
expanded in terms of metric perturbations about a Friedmann-Lema\^itre
background, which are assumed to remain small. The metric perturbations
themselves are only kept to linear order, but we keep their first spatial
derivatives to second order and treat their second spatial derivatives as well
as sources of stress-energy fully non-perturbatively. The evolution of matter
is modelled by an N-body ensemble which can consist of free-streaming
nonrelativistic (e.g. cold dark matter) or relativistic particle species (e.g.
cosmic neutrinos), but the framework is fully general and also allows for other
sources of stress-energy, in particular additional relativistic sources like
modified-gravity models or topological defects. We compare our method with the
traditional Newtonian approach and argue that relativistic methods are
conceptually more robust and flexible, at the cost of a moderate increase of
numerical difficulty. However, for a LambdaCDM cosmology, where nonrelativistic
matter is the only source of perturbations, the relativistic corrections are
expected to be small. We quantify this statement by extracting post-Newtonian
estimates from Newtonian N-body simulations.

their binary counterparts, but unfortunately their decoding complexity is a
significant challenge. The iterative hard- and soft-reliability based
majority-logic decoding algorithms are attractive for non-binary LDPC codes,
since they involve only finite field additions and multiplications as well as
integer operations and hence have significantly lower complexity than other
algorithms. In this paper, we propose two improvements to the majority-logic
decoding algorithms. Instead of the accumulation of reliability information in
the existing majority-logic decoding algorithms, our first improvement is a new
reliability information update. The new update not only results in better error
performance and fewer iterations on average, but also further reduces
computational complexity. Since existing majority-logic decoding algorithms
tend to have a high error floor for codes whose parity check matrices have low
column weights, our second improvement is a re-selection scheme, which leads to
much lower error floors, at the expense of more finite field operations and
integer operations, by identifying periodic points, re-selecting intermediate
hard decisions, and changing reliability information.

quantum channel and a ""replacer"" channel that discards its input and replaces
it with a fixed state. We show that, in this particular setting, the most
general adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over
non-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a
quantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a
constant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to
zero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy
registered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states
that any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than
the channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily
converges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal
strong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we
can establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted
capacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our
channel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a
non-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as
was used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is a
key tool in our analysis. Finally, by combining our results with recent results

mutual information of a quantum channel N as the optimal type II error exponent

  By using the two-temperature mean opacity one does obtain the proper
equilibrium gas temperature in a circumstellar environment, which is in a
chemical equilibrium. A careful consideration of a radiative transfer problem
reveals that the equilibrium temperature solution can be degenerate in an
optically thin gaseous environment.
  We compute mean gas opacities based on the publicly available code DFSYNTHE

thermodynamic equilibrium and an ideal gas equation of state. The values were
derived by direct integration of the high-resolution opacity spectrum.

holes to produce logical qubits, potentially reducing spacetime volume
required. Dislocations induce defects which, in many respects, behave like
Majorana quasi-particles. We construct circuits to implement these codes and
present fault-tolerant measurement methods for these and other defects which
may reduce spatial overhead. One advantage of these codes is that Hadamard
gates take exactly $0$ time to implement. We numerically study the performance
of these codes using a minimum weight and a greedy decoder using finite-size
scaling. Second, we consider state injection of arbitrary ancillas to produce
arbitrary rotations. This avoids the logarithmic (in precision) overhead in
online cost required if $T$ gates are used to synthesize arbitrary rotations.
While this has been considered before, we consider also the parallel
performance of this protocol. Arbitrary ancilla injection leads to a
probabilistic protocol in which there is a constant chance of success on each
round; we use an amortized analysis to show that even in a parallel setting
this leads to only a constant factor slowdown as opposed to the logarithmic
slowdown that might be expected naively.

solution of general ill-posed linear inverse problems. Construction of an
adaptive optimal solution for such problems usually relies either on a singular
value decomposition or representation of the solution via an orthonormal basis.
The shortcoming of both approaches lies in the fact that, in many situations,
neither the eigenbasis of the linear operator nor a standard orthonormal basis
constitutes an appropriate collection of functions for sparse representation of
the unknown function. In the context of regression problems, there have been an
enormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using an overcomplete
dictionary. One of the most popular methods, Lasso, is based on minimizing the
empirical likelihood and requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the,
so called, compatibility conditions. While these conditions may be satisfied
for the original dictionary functions, they usually do not hold for their
images due to contraction imposed by the linear operator. In what follows, we
bypass this difficulty by a novel approach which is based on inverting each of
the dictionary functions and matching the resulting expansion to the true
function, thus, avoiding unrealistic assumptions on the dictionary and using
Lasso in a predictive setting. We examine both the white noise and the
observational model formulations and also discuss how exact inverse images of
the dictionary functions can be replaced by their approximate counterparts.
Furthermore, we show how the suggested methodology can be extended to the
problem of estimation of a mixing density in a continuous mixture. For all the
situations listed above, we provide the oracle inequalities for the risk in a
finite sample setting. Simulation studies confirm good computational properties
of the Lasso-based technique.

present an analysis of observations from the Donald C. Backer Precision Array

on the HI power spectrum over the redshift range of $7.5<z<10.5$, extending
previously published single redshift results to cover the full range accessible

take advantage of the large instrumental bandwidth to isolate and suppress
foreground leakage into the interesting regions of $k$-space. Our 500 hour
integration is the longest such yet recorded and demonstrates this method to a

with the fluctuations due to thermal noise. Relative to this thermal noise,
most spectra exhibit an excess of power at a few sigma. The likely sources of
this excess include residual foreground leakage, particularly at the highest

high energy collisions. Models describing these collisions need these
correlation measurements to tune the strengths of the underlying QCD processes
which influence all observables. Detectors, however, often possess limited
coverage or reduced efficiency that influence correlation measurements in
obscure ways. In this paper, the effects of non-uniform detection acceptance
and efficiency on the measurement of multiplicity correlations between two
distinct detector regions (termed forward-backward correlations) are derived.
An analysis method with such effects built-in is developed and subsequently
verified using different event generators. The resulting method accounts for
acceptance and efficiency in a model independent manner with high accuracy
thereby shedding light on the relative contributions of the underlying

a combination of observations with imaging and non-imaging instruments. In this

combine spectra from four different imaging instruments with no data gaps, and
we successfully applied the Comptonization scenario to explain the broadband
X-ray spectra of this source in the low/hard state. For two of the three
observations, our analysis also shows that, models including Compton reflection
can adequately fit the data, in agreement with previous reports. We show that
the observations can also be modeled by a more detailed Comptonization scheme.
Furthermore, we find the presence of an iron K-edge absorption feature in one
occasion, which confirms what had been previously observed by Suzaku. Our
broadband analysis of this limited sample shows a rich spectral variability in

characterize frustrations and gauge equivalent classes. For a special
equivalent class, we identify a new spin-orbital entangled commensurate ground
state. It supports not only commensurate magnons, but also a new gapped
elementary excitation: in-commensurate magnons with two gap minima continuously
tuned by the SOC strength. At low temperatures, these magnons lead to dramatic
effects in many physical quantities such as density of states, specific heat,
magnetization, uniform susceptibility, staggered susceptibility and various
spin correlation functions. The commensurate magnons lead to a pinned central
peak in the angle resolved light or atom Bragg spectroscopy. However, the
in-commensurate magnons split it into two located at their two gap minima. At
high temperatures, the transverse spin structure factors depend on the SOC
strength explicitly. The whole set of Wilson loops can be mapped out by
measuring the specific heat at the corresponding orders in the high temperature
expansion. We argue that one gauge may be realized in current experiments and
other gauges may also be realized in near future experiments. The results
achieved along the exact solvable line sets up the stage to investigate
dramatic effects when tuning away from it by various means. We sketch the
crucial roles to be played by these magnons at other equivalent classes, with
spin anisotropic interactions and in the presence of finite magnetic fields.

The spectrograph modules provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over the

channels: blue, red, and near infrared (NIR). A camera in each channel images
the multi-object spectra onto a 4k x 4k, 15 um pixel, detector format. The two
visible cameras use a pair of Hamamatsu 2k x 4k CCDs with readout provided by
custom electronics, while the NIR camera uses a single Teledyne HgCdTe 4k x 4k
detector and ASIC Sidecar to read the device.
  The CCD readout system is a custom design comprised of three electrical
subsystems: the Back End Electronics (BEE), the Front End Electronics (FEE),
and a Pre-amplifier. The BEE is an off-the-shelf PC104 computer, with an
auxiliary Xilinx FPGA module. The computer serves as the main interface to the
Subaru messaging hub and controls other peripheral devices associated with the
camera, while the FPGA is used to generate the necessary clocks and transfer
image data from the CCDs. The FEE board sets clock biases, substrate bias, and
CDS offsets. It also monitors bias voltages, offset voltages, power rail
voltage, substrate voltage and CCD temperature. The board translates LVDS clock
signals to biased clocks and returns digitized analog data via LVDS. Monitoring
and control messages are sent from the BEE to the FEE using a standard serial
interface. The Pre-amplifier board resides behind the detectors and acts as an
interface to the two Hamamatsu CCDs. The Pre-amplifier passes clocks and biases
to the CCDs, and analog CCD data is buffered and amplified prior to being
returned to the FEE.

combined with detailed models of stellar atmospheres and automated fitting
techniques allow for the analysis of large number of stars. These datasets
contain a wealth of information that require new analysis techniques to bridge
the gap between observations and stellar evolution models. To that end, we
develop BONNSAI (BONN Stellar Astrophysics Interface), a Bayesian statistical
method, that is capable of comparing all available observables simultaneously
to stellar models while taking observed uncertainties and prior knowledge such
as initial mass functions and distributions of stellar rotational velocities
into account. BONNSAI can be used to (1) determine probability distributions of
fundamental stellar parameters such as initial masses and stellar ages from
complex datasets, (2) predict stellar parameters that were not yet
observationally determined and (3) test stellar models to further advance our
understanding of stellar evolution. An important aspect of BONNSAI is that it
singles out stars that cannot be reproduced by stellar models through
$\chi^{2}$ hypothesis tests and posterior predictive checks. BONNSAI can be
used with any set of stellar models and currently supports massive
main-sequence single star models of Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic
Cloud composition. We apply our new method to mock stars to demonstrate its
functionality and capabilities. In a first application, we use BONNSAI to test
the stellar models of Brott et al. (2011a) by comparing the stellar ages
inferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing Milky Way binaries.
Ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii that are known to better
than 3%. We find that the stellar models reproduce the Milky Way binaries well.

introducing and studying its stratification, focusing on four-point amplitudes.
The new stratification exhibits interesting combinatorial properties and
positivity is neatly captured by permutations. As explicit examples, we find
all boundaries for the two and three loop amplitudes and related geometries. We
recover the stratifications of some of these geometries from the singularities

can be viewed as driving a spin chain from a symmetry protected phase to a
trivial phase, and this perspective offers an avenue to generalise the
adiabatic quantum transistor and to design several improvements. The
performance of quantum logic gates is shown to depend only on universal
symmetry properties of a symmetry-protected phase rather than fine tuned parent
Hamiltonians, and it is possible to implement a universal set of logic gates in

complementing the $K_\mathrm{s}$-band selected UltraVISTA catalog with objects
detected in IRAC only. With the aim of identifying massive (i.e.,
$\log(M_*/M_\odot)>11$) galaxies at $4<z<7$, we consider the systematic effects
on the measured photometric redshifts from the introduction of an old and dusty
SED template and from the introduction of a bayesian prior taking into account
the brightness of the objects, as well as the systematic effects from different
star formation histories (SFHs) and from nebular emission lines in the recovery
of stellar population parameters. We show that our results are most affected by
the bayesian luminosity prior, while nebular emission lines and SFHs only
introduce a small dispersion in the measurements. Specifically, the number of
$4<z<7$ galaxies ranges from 52 to 382 depending on the adopted configuration.
Using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of the
massive end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) at $4<z<7$. Given the rarity
of very massive galaxies in the early universe, major contributions to the
total error budget come from cosmic variance and poisson noise. The SMF
obtained without the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior does not
show any evolution from $z\sim6.5$ to $z\sim 3.5$, implying that massive
galaxies could already be present when the Universe was $\sim0.9$~Gyr old.
However, the introduction of the bayesian luminosity prior reduces the number
of $z>4$ galaxies with best fit masses $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>11$ by 83%, implying
a rapid growth of very massive galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history.
From the stellar-mass complete sample, we identify one candidate of a very
massive ($\log(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11.5$), quiescent galaxy at $z\sim5.4$, with
MIPS $24\mu$m detection suggesting the presence of a powerful obscured AGN.

infinity. Null infinity on the conformal boundary may extend to an extremal
horizon in the bulk. For example it does so for Poincare-AdS, although does not
for planar Schwarzschild-AdS. If null infinity does extend into an extremal
horizon in the bulk, we show that the bulk near-horizon geometry is determined
by the geometry of the boundary null infinity. Hence the `infra-red' geometry
of the bulk is fixed by the large scale behaviour of the CFT spacetime. In
addition the boundary stress tensor must have a particular decay at null
infinity. As an application, we argue that for CFT on asymptotically flat
backgrounds, any static bulk dual containing an extremal horizon extending from
the boundary null infinity, must have the near-horizon geometry of
Poincare-AdS. We also discuss a class of boundary null infinity that cannot
extend to a bulk extremal horizon, although we give evidence that they can
extend to an analogous null surface in the bulk which possesses an associated
scale-invariant `near-geometry'.

measurements of intelligence, introducing the idea of a ""general factor"" or g
score. The main results concern the stability, validity (predictive power), and
heritability of adult g. The largest component of genetic variance for both
height and intelligence is additive (linear), leading to important
simplifications in predictive modeling and statistical estimation. Due mainly
to the rapidly decreasing cost of genotyping, it is possible that within the
coming decade researchers will identify loci which account for a significant
fraction of total g variation. In the case of height analogous efforts are well
under way. I describe some unpublished results concerning the genetic
architecture of height and cognitive ability, which suggest that roughly 10k
moderately rare causal variants of mostly negative effect are responsible for
normal population variation. Using results from Compressed Sensing
(L1-penalized regression), I estimate the statistical power required to
characterize both linear and nonlinear models for quantitative traits. The main
unknown parameter s (sparsity) is the number of loci which account for the bulk
of the genetic variation. The required sample size is of order 100s, or roughly

sector contains fermions and scalars charged under dark SU(2) x U(1) gauge
interactions. Radiative breaking of the dark gauge group triggers electroweak
symmetry breaking through the Higgs portal coupling. Requiring both a Higgs
boson mass of 125.5 GeV and stability of the Higgs potential up to the Planck
scale implies that the radiative breaking of the dark gauge group occurs at the
TeV scale. We present a particular model which features a long-range abelian
dark force. The dominant dark matter component is neutral dark fermions, with
the correct thermal relic abundance, and in reach of future direct detection
experiments. The model also has lighter stable dark fermions charged under the
dark force, with observable effects on galactic-scale structure. Collider
signatures include a dark sector scalar boson with mass < 250 GeV that decays
through mixing with the Higgs boson, and can be detected at the LHC. The Higgs
boson, as well as the new scalar, may have significant invisible decays into

  This allows to bring to bear techniques developed for tasks, to one-shot

Transforming the object into a task relieves the prover of an implementation

ultrafast laser pulse can demagnetize a sample and switch its spins within a
few hundred femtoseconds, but no consensus has been reached. In this paper, we
propose that an ultrafast reduction in the exchange interaction by a
femtosecond laser pulse is mainly responsible for demagnetization and spin
switching. The key physics is that the dipole selection rule demands two
distinctive electron configurations for the ground and excited states and
consequently changes the exchange interaction. Although the exchange
interaction change is almost instantaneous, its effect on the spin is delayed
by the finite spin wave propagation. Consistent with the experimental
observation, the delay becomes longer with a stronger exchange interaction
pulse. In spin-frustrated systems, the effect of the exchange interaction
change is even more dramatic, where the spin can be directly switched from one
direction to the other. Therefore, our theory has the potential to explain the
essence of major observations in rare-earth transition metal compounds for the
last seven years. Our findings are likely to motivate further research in the
quest of the origin of femtomagnetism.

interact and behave in various political, ecological and economic scenarios.
Agent-based models are ideal for understanding such models involving
interacting individuals producing emergent phenomenon. Sugarscape is one of the
most famous examples of a social agent-based model which has been used to show
how societies grow in the real world.
  This paper builds on the Sugarscape model, using the Flexible Large scale
Agent-based modelling Environment (FLAME) to simulate three different scenarios
of the experiment, which are based on the Sugar and Citizen locations. FLAME is
an agent-based modelling framework which has previously been used to model
biological and economic models. The paper includes details on how the model was
written and the various parameters set for the simulation. The results of the
model simulated are processed for three scenarios and analysed to see what
affect the initial starting states of the agents had on the overall result
obtained through the model and the variance in simulation time of processing
the model on multicore architectures.
  The experiments highlight that there are limitations of the FLAME framework
and writing simulation models in general which are highly dependent on initial
starting states of a model, also raising further potential work which can be
built into the Sugarscape model to study other interesting phenomenon in social
and economic laws.

travel time that the users of the network experience to complete their
journeys. Travel times on road traffic networks are stochastic, highly
variable, and dependent on several parameters. It is, therefore, necessary to
have good indicators and measures of their variations. In this article, we
extend a recent approach for the derivation of deterministic bounds on the
travel time in a road traffic network (Farhi, Haj-Salem and Lebacque 2013). The
approach consists in using an algebraic formulation of the cell-transmission
traffic model on a ring road, where the car-dynamics is seen as a linear
min-plus system. The impulse response of the system is derived analytically,
and is interpreted as what is called a service curve in the network calculus
theory (where the road is seen as a server). The basic results of the latter
theory are then used to derive an upper bound for the travel time through the
ring road.
  We consider in this article open systems rather than closed ones. We define a
set of elementary traffic systems and an operator for the concatenation of such
systems. We show that the traffic system of any road itinerary can be built by
concatenating a number of elementary traffic systems. The concatenation of
systems consists in giving a service guarantee of the resulting system in
function of service guarantees of the composed systems. We illustrate this
approach with a numerical example, where we compute an upper bound for the
travel time on a given route in a urban network.

evolution, but elevated temperature cycling did alter the grain boundary
network. In addition to mechanically-driven grain growth, mechanical cycling at
100 $\deg$C led to a 48% increase in $\Sigma$3 boundaries, determined with

First, in contrast to gold standards such as WordSim-353 and MEN, it explicitly
quantifies similarity rather than association or relatedness, so that pairs of
entities that are associated but not actually similar [Freud, psychology] have
a low rating. We show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999
incentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider
range of applications than those which reflect conceptual association. Second,
SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete and abstract adjective, noun and verb
pairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness and (free)
association strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained
analyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types, and
consequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved. Further,
unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which automatic approaches have
reached or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-the-art

of scope for SimLex-999 to quantify future improvements to distributional

systems are of both fundamental and practical interest. For example, aspects of
work fluctuations will be an important factor in designing nanoscale heat
engines. In this work, an optimal control approach directly exploiting
Jarzynski's equality is proposed to effectively suppress the fluctuations in
the work statistics, for systems (initially at thermal equilibrium) subject to
a work protocol but isolated from a bath during the protocol. The control
strategy is to minimize the deviations of individual values of exp(-\beta W)
from their ensemble average given by exp(-\beta \Delta F}, where W is the work,
\beta\ is the inverse temperature, and \Delta F is the free energy difference
between two equilibrium states. It is further shown that even when the system
Hamiltonian is not fully known, it is still possible to suppress work
fluctuations through a feedback loop, by refining the control target function
on the fly through Jarzynski's equality itself. Numerical experiments are based
on linear and nonlinear parametric oscillators. Optimal control results for
linear parametric oscillators are also benchmarked with early results based on
accelerated adiabatic processes.

irreversible matter creation processes, which could be validated by fundamental
particle physics. Thus particle creation corresponds to an irreversible energy
flow from the gravitational field to the created matter constituents, with the
second law of thermodynamics requiring that space-time transforms into matter.
The equivalent particle number creation rates, the creation pressure and the

topic for fine-grained visual comprehension. In this paper we study the problem
of how to estimate such visual properties from a ranking perspective with the
help of the annotators from online crowdsourcing platforms. The main challenges
of our task are two-fold. On one hand, the annotations often contain
contaminated information, where a small fraction of label flips might ruin the
global ranking of the whole dataset. On the other hand, considering the large
data capacity, the annotations are often far from being complete. What is
worse, there might even exist imbalanced annotations where a small subset of
samples are frequently annotated. Facing such challenges, we propose a robust
ranking framework based on the principle of Hodge decomposition of imbalanced
and incomplete ranking data. According to the HodgeRank theory, we find that
the major source of the contamination comes from the cyclic ranking component
of the Hodge decomposition. This leads us to an outlier detection formulation
as sparse approximations of the cyclic ranking projection. Taking a step
further, it facilitates a novel outlier detection model as Huber's LASSO in
robust statistics. Moreover, simple yet scalable algorithms are developed based
on Linearized Bregman Iteration to achieve an even less biased estimator.
Statistical consistency of outlier detection is established in both cases under
nearly the same conditions. Our studies are supported by experiments with both
simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a
promising tool for robust ranking with large scale crowdsourcing data arising
from computer vision.

2.2~\mu$m). Combined with all available spectroscopy, our $K-$band selected

low-redshift pair fraction and merger rate of galaxies over a wide range in
$K-$band luminosity. We find the major-merger pair fraction to be flat at $\sim
2\%$ as a function of $K-$band luminosity for galaxies in the range $10^8 -
10^{12} L_{\odot}$, in contrast to recent results from studies in the local
group that find a substantially higher low-mass pair fraction. This
low-redshift major-merger pair fraction is $\sim 40-50\%$ higher than previous

Aloha protocol is the set of all arrival rates for which there exists some

Although testing membership in $\Lambda$ of a given arrival rate can be posed

$i)$ an equivalence between membership in $\Lambda$ and the existence of a

  Networks","PhD Dissertation",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The technique of cooperative communications is finding its way in the next
generations of many wireless communication applications. Due to the distributed
nature of cooperative networks, acquiring fading channels information for
coherent detection is more challenging than in the traditional point-to-point
communications. To bypass the requirement of channel information, differential
modulation together with non-coherent detection can be deployed. This thesis is
concerned with various issues related to differential modulation and
non-coherent detection in cooperative networks. Specifically, the thesis
examines the behaviour and robustness of non-coherent detection in mobile
environments (i.e., time-varying channels). The amount of channel variation is
related to the normalized Doppler shift which is a function of user's mobility.
The Doppler shift is used to distinguish between slow time-varying
(slow-fading) and rapid time-varying (fast-fading) channels. The performance of
several important relay topologies, including single-branch and multi-branch
dual-hop relaying with/without a direct link that employ amplify-and-forward
relaying and two-symbol non-coherent detection, is analyzed. For this purpose,
a time-series model is developed for characterizing the time-varying nature of
the cascaded channel encountered in amplify-and-forward relaying.

velocities for planetary-mass companions located within a few AU of stars
younger than the Sun. Based on a sample of >150 stars, we define a floor in the
radial velocity scatter, sigma_RV, as a function of the chromospheric activity
level R'_{HK}. This lower bound to the jitter, which increases with increasing
stellar activity, sets the minimum planet mass that could be detected. Adopting
a median activity-age relationship reveals the astrophysical limits to planet
masses discernable via radial velocity monitoring, as a function of stellar
age. Considering solar-mass primaries having the mean jitter-activity level,
when they are younger than 100 / 300 / 1000 Myr, the stochastic jitter
component in radial velocity measurements restricts detectable companion masses
to > 0.3 / 0.2 / 0.1 M_Jupiter. These numbers require a large number -- several
tens -- of radial velocity observations taken over a time frame longer than the
orbital period. Lower companion mass limits can be achieved for stars with less

the various stages of stellar evolution of massive stars. Neutrino losses from
proto-neutron stars play a crucial role in deciding whether these stars would
be crushed into black holes or explode as supernovae. Both pure leptonic and
weak-interaction processes contribute to the neutrino energy losses in stellar
matter. At low temperatures and densities, characteristic of the early phase of
presupernova evolution, cooling through neutrinos produced via the
weak-interaction is important. Proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase
approximation (pn-QRPA) theory has recently being used for calculation of
stellar weak-interaction rates of $fp$-shell nuclide with success. The
lepton-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) during early phases of stellar evolution of
massive stars changes substantially alone due to electron captures on
$^{56}$Ni. The stellar matter is transparent to the neutrinos produced during
the presupernova evolution of massive stars. These neutrinos escape the site
and assist the stellar core in maintaining a lower entropy. Here I present the
expanded calculation of weak-interaction mediated neutrino and antineutrino
cooling rates due to $^{56}$Ni in stellar matter using the pn-QRPA theory. This
detailed scale is appropriate for interpolation purposes and of greater utility
for simulation codes. The calculated rates are compared against earlier

matter the reported rates show little differences with the shell model rates
and might contribute in fine-tuning of the lepton-to-baryon ratio during the
presupernova phases of stellar evolution of massive stars.

causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Although H3N2 incidence is highly
seasonal, how such seasonality contributes to global phylogeographic migration
dynamics has not yet been established.
  Results: Incorporating seasonally varying migration rates improves the
modeling of migration. In our global model, windows of increased immigration
map to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased
emigration map to epidemic decline. Seasonal patterns also correlate with the
probability that local lineages go extinct and fail to contribute to long term
viral evolution, as measured through the trunk of the phylogeny. However, the
fraction of the trunk in each community was found to be better determined by
its overall human population size
  Conclusions: Seasonal migration and rapid turnover within regions is
sustained by the invasion of 'fertile epidemic grounds' at the end of older
epidemics. Thus, the current emphasis on connectivity, including air-travel,
should be complemented with a better understanding of the conditions and timing
required for successful establishment.Models which account for migration
seasonality will improve our understanding of the seasonal drivers of
influenza,enhance epidemiological predictions, and ameliorate vaccine updating
by identifying strains that not only escape immunity but also have the seasonal
opportunity to establish and spread. Further work is also needed on additional
conditions that contribute to the persistence and long term evolution of
influenza within the human population,such as spatial heterogeneity with

communication system is modeled as a MIMO transceiver, which consists of three
parts: an encoder, a MIMO channel, and a decoder. In the spirit of MIMO
communication, the number of SISO subchannels in the transceiver is often
greater than the number of data streams to be transmitted. Moreover, the
subchannel capacities are assumed to be fixed a priori. In this case, the
encoder/decoder pair gives an additional design freedom on top of the
controller, leading to a stabilization problem via coding/control co-design. It
turns out that how to take the best advantage of the coding mechanism is quite
crucial. From a demand/supply perspective, the design of the coding mechanism
boils down to reshaping the demands for communication resource from different
control inputs to match the given supplies. We study the problem for the case
of AWGN subchannels and fading subchannels, respectively. In both cases, we
arrive at a unified necessary and sufficient condition on the capacities of the
subchannels under which the coding/control co-design problem is solvable. The
condition is given in terms of a majorization type relation. As we go along,
systematic procedures are also put forward to implement the coding/control

violent convections in the outer layers of pre-collapse stars. Moreover, Couch

perturbations may lead to a successful supernova even for a progenitor that
fails to explode without the fluctuations. This study investigated the linear
growth of perturbations during the infall onto a stalled shock wave. The
linearized equations are solved as an initial and boundary value problem with
the use of Laplace transform. The background is a Bondi accretion flow whose
parameters are chosen to mimic the 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor model by
Woosley & Heger (2007), which is supposed to be a typical progenitor of CCSNe.
We found that the perturbations that are given at a large radius grow as they
flow down to the shock radius; the density perturbations can be amplified by a
factor of 30, for example. We analytically showed that the growth rate is
proportional to $l$, the index of the spherical harmonics. We also found that
the perturbations oscillate in time with frequencies that are similar to those

normal phase and a superconducting phase in the intermediate state led to the
concept itself. It was followed by a focus on geometrically inhomogeneous
systems like point contacts, which provided a very clear manifestation of the
energy- and directional dependence of the Andreev reflection process. The point
contacts have in recent years evolved towards the atomic scale by using
mechanical break-junctions, revealing in a very detailed way the dependence of
Andreev reflection on the macroscopic phase of the superconducting state. In
present day research the superconducting inhomogeneity is constructed by clean
room technology and combines superconducting materials with, for example,
low-dimensional materials and topological insulators. Alternatively the
superconductor is combined with nano-objects, such as graphene, carbon
nanotubes, or semiconducting nanowires. Each of these 'inhomogeneous systems'
provides a very interesting range of properties, all rooted in some

of infinite spin $S$), we find that upon decreasing the transverse field
$\Gamma$ this model exhibits a phase transition from the fully polarized state
into an eight-fold degenerate translational symmetry breaking state. This phase
can be identified to correspond to plaquette order in the dimer language and
remains the lowest-energy state in the entire range of fields below the
critical one, $\Gamma_c$. The eight-fold degenerate solution which corresponds
to columnar order in the dimer language is a saddle point of the classical
energy. It is degenerate with the plaquette solution at $\Gamma=0$ and is only
slightly higher in energy in the whole interval $0<\Gamma<\Gamma_c$. The effect
of quantum fluctuations is investigated in the context of a large S expansion
both for the plaquette and columnar structures. For this purpose we employ an
approximate method allowing to estimate from above the fluctuation-induced
correction to the energy of a configuration which at the classical level is a
saddle point of the energy, \textit{not} a local minimum. Although the
convergence of the $1/S$ expansion in the $\Gamma/J\rightarrow 0$ limit remains
an open question, harmonic quantum fluctuations show a clear tendency to
overcome the energy difference between the two states and to change the
classical picture favoring the columnar order over the plaquette one in a wide

the cosmic evolution was standard $\Lambda$CDM in the past and that the present
matter density and power spectrum normalization are the same as in a
$\Lambda$CDM model. Here we examine how the constraints change when these
assumptions are lifted. We focus in particular on the parameter $Y$ (also
called $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$) that quantifies the deviation from the Poisson
equation. This parameter can be estimated by comparing with the
model-independent growth rate quantity $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ obtained through
redshift distortions. We reduce the model dependency in evaluating $Y$ by
marginalizing over $\sigma_{8}$ and over the initial conditions, and by
absorbing the degenerate parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$ into $Y$. We use all
currently available values of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$. We find that the combination
$\hat{Y}=Y\Omega_{m,0}$, assumed constant in the observed redshift range, can
be constrained only very weakly by current data, $\hat{Y}=0.28_{-0.23}^{+0.35}$
at 68\% c.l. We also forecast the precision of a future estimation of $\hat{Y}$
in a Euclid-like redshift survey. We find that the future constraints will
reduce substantially the uncertainty, $\hat{Y}=0.30_{-0.09}^{+0.08}$ , at 68\%
c.l., but the relative error on $\hat{Y}$ around the fiducial remains quite
high, of the order of 30\%. The main reason for these weak constraints is that
$\hat{Y}$ is strongly degenerate with the initial conditions, so that large or
small values of $\hat{Y}$ are compensated by choosing non-standard initial
values of the derivative of the matter density contrast.
  Finally, we produce a forecast of a cosmological exclusion plot on the Yukawa
strength and range parameters, which complements similar plots on laboratory
scales but explores scales and epochs reachable only with large-scale galaxy
surveys. (abridged)

cosmogenic 21Ne. This makes it possible, for the first time, to determine
robust cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages in these fossil micrometeorites, on the
order of a few hundred-thousand years. These ages are similar to the CRE ages
measured in chromite grains from cm-sized fossil meteorites recovered from
coeval sediments in Sweden. As the CRE ages are shorter than the orbital decay
time of grains of this size by Poynting-Robertson drag, this suggests that the
grains were delivered to Earth through direct injection into an orbital
resonance. We demonstrate how CRE ages of fossil micrometeorites can be used,
in principle, to determine sedimentation rates, and to correlate the sediments
at Lynna River with the fossil meteorite-bearing sediment layers in Sweden.

  minimax estimation of sparse correlation matrices",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a sparse high-dimensional elliptical model we consider a hard threshold
estimator for the correlation matrix based on Kendall's tau with threshold
level $\alpha(\frac{\log p}{n})^{1/2}$. Parameters $\alpha$ are identified such
that the threshold estimator achieves the minimax rate under the squared
Frobenius norm and the squared spectral norm. This allows a reasonable
calibration of the estimator without any quantitative information about the
tails of the underlying distribution. For Gaussian observations we even
establish a critical threshold constant $\alpha^\ast$ under the squared
Frobenius norm, i.e. the proposed estimator attains the minimax rate for
$\alpha>\alpha^\ast$ but in general not for $\alpha<\alpha^\ast$. To the best
of the author's knowledge this is the first work concerning critical threshold
constants. The main ingredient to provide the critical threshold level is a
sharp large deviation expansion for Kendall's tau sample correlation evolved
from an asymptotic expansion of the number of permutations with a certain
number of inversions.
  The investigation of this paper also covers further statistical problems like
the estimation of the latent correlation matrix in the transelliptical and
nonparanormal family.

electroweak phase transition within the minimal classically scale invariant
extension of the standard model (SM), previously proposed and analyzed as a
potential solution to the hierarchy problem. By introducing one complex singlet
scalar and three right-handed Majorana neutrinos, the scenario was successfully
capable of achieving a radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry
(Coleman-Weinberg Mechanism), inducing non-zero masses for the SM neutrinos
(seesaw mechanism), presenting a pseudoscalar dark matter candidate, and
predicting the existence of a second $CP$-even boson in addition to the 125 GeV
scalar. We construct the full finite-temperature one-loop effective potential
of the model, including the resummed thermal daisy loops, and demonstrate that
finite-temperature effects induce a first-order electroweak phase transition.
Requiring the thermally-driven first-order phase transition to be sufficiently
strong further constrains the model's parameter space; in particular, an
$\mathcal O(0.01)$ fraction of the dark matter in the universe may be
simultaneously accommodated with a strongly first-order electroweak phase
transition. Moreover, such a phase transition disfavors right-handed Majorana
neutrino masses above several hundreds of GeV, confines the pseudoscalar dark
matter masses to $\sim 1$-2 TeV, predicts the mass of the second $CP$-even
scalar to be $\sim 100$-300 GeV, and requires the mixing angle between the
$CP$-even components of the SM doublet and the complex singlet to lie within
the range $0.2 \lesssim \sin\omega \lesssim 0.4$. The obtained results are
displayed in comprehensive exclusion plots, identifying the viable regions of
the parameter space. Many of these predictions lie within the reach of the next

is introduced within the framework of a finite-dimensional set of ordinary

in fluid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a

nonconvex optimisations. We propose a convexification procedure relying on an
efficient iterative re-weighted $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithm that uses
general sparsity inducing priors on the parameters of the system and marginal
likelihood maximisation. Using this approach, we also show how convex
constraints on the parameters can be easily added to our proposed iterative
re-weighted $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithm. In the supplementary material

on the nature of the sQGP produced at RHIC. In order to explore the properties
of the QCD phase diagram, since 2010, the experiment has collected sizable data

Massive stars are among the brightest infrared stars in such regions; their

the associated cloud as well as constraining the location of stellar aggregates
and hence their occurrence as a function of global environment. We present a
stellar spectroscopic survey in the direction of the giant molecular cloud

several HII regions and supernova remnants. We discovered 11 OfK+ stars, one
candidate Luminous Blue Variable, several OB stars, and candidate red
supergiants. Stars with K-band extinction from ~1.3 - 1.9 mag appear to be
associated with the GMC G23.3-0.3; O and B-types satisfying this criterion have
spectro-photometric distances consistent with that of the giant molecular
cloud. Combining near-IR spectroscopic and photometric data allowed us to
characterize the multiple sites of star formation within it. The O-type stars
have masses from 25 - 45 Msun, and ages of 5-8 Myr. Two new red supergiants
were detected with interstellar extinction typical of the cloud; along with the
two RSGs within the cluster GLIMPSE9, they trace an older burst with an age of
20--30 Myr. Massive stars were also detected in the core of three supernova
remnants - W41, G22.7-0.2, and G22.7583-0.4917. A large population of massive

Using interrupted time series and a regression discontinuity design, we find
that the introduction of the trending feature had no statistically significant
effect on the overall number of signatures per day, but that the distribution
of signatures across petitions changes: the most popular petitions gain even
more signatures at the expense of those with less signatories. We find
significant differences between petitions trending at different ranks, even
after controlling for each petition's individual growth prior to trending. The
findings suggest a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of
the site looking for petitions to sign and therefore see the list of trending
petitions, and a significant proportion of this group responds to the social
information that it provides. These findings contribute to our understanding of
how social information, and the form in which it is presented, affects
individual political behaviour in digital settings.

  Astrophysics","A&A 570, A116 (2014)","10.1051/0004-6361/201423757",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: KUV 05134+2605 is one of the 21 pulsating DB white dwarfs (V777 Her
or DBV variables) known so far. The detailed investigation of the short-period
and low-amplitude pulsations of these relatively faint targets requires
considerable observational efforts from the ground, long-term single-site or
multisite observations. The observed amplitudes of excited modes undergo
short-term variations in many cases, which makes the determination of pulsation
modes difficult.
  Methods: We re-analysed the data already published, and collected new
measurements. We compared the frequency content of the different datasets from
the different epochs and performed various tests to check the reliability of
the frequency determinations. The mean period spacings were investigated with
linear fits to the observed periods, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Inverse Variance
significance tests, and Fourier analysis of different period sets, including a
Monte Carlo test simulating the effect of alias ambiguities. We employed fully
evolutionary DB white dwarf models for the asteroseismic investigations.
  Results: We identified 22 frequencies between 1280 and 2530 microHz. These
form 12 groups, which suggests at least 12 possible frequencies for the
asteroseismic investigations. Thanks to the extended observations, KUV
05134+2605 joined the group of rich white dwarf pulsators. We identified one
triplet and at least one doublet with a ~9 microHz frequency separation, from
which we derived a stellar rotation period of 0.6 d. We determined the mean
period spacings of ~31 and ~18 s for the modes we propose as dipole and
quadrupole, respectively. We found an excellent agreement between the stellar
mass derived from the l=1 period spacing and the period-to-period fits, all
providing M_* = 0.84-0.85 M_Sun solutions. Our study suggests that KUV
05134+2605 is the most massive amongst the known V777 Her stars.

networks where each node has the same fixed out-degree. We model a network
generated by three mechanisms that are present in various networked systems;
growth, global rewiring and local rewiring. During a rewiring phase a node is
randomly selected, one of its out-going edges is detached from its destination
then re-attached to the network in one of two possible ways; either globally to
a randomly selected node, or locally to a descendant of a descendant of the
originally selected node. Although the probability of attachment to a node
increases with its connectivity, the probability of detachment also increases,
the result is an exponential degree distribution with a small number of
outlying nodes that have extremely large degree. We explain these outliers by
identifying the circumstances for which a set of nodes can grow to very high
degree.

entropy theory for it. Examples include manifolds admitting a compact quotient
under isometries and generic leaves of a compact foliation. We prove that the
entropy of an ergodic stationary random manifold is zero if and only if the
manifold satisfies the Liouville property almost surely, and is positive if and
only if it admits an infinite dimensional space of bounded harmonic functions
almost surely. Upper and lower bounds for the entropy are provided in terms of
the linear drift of Brownian motion and average volume growth of the manifold.
Other almost sure properties of these random manifolds are also studied.

The strain applied leads to a shift in the Dirac point without changing the
pre-existing conducting states, on the surface of a topological insulator.
Strain applied can be tuned to form a $\pi$ junction in such a structure.
Combining two such junctions in a ring architecture leads to the ground state
of the ring being in doubly degenerate state- the ""0"" and ""1"" states of a
qubit. A qubit designed this way is quite easily controlled via the tunable
strain applied. We report on the conditions necessary to design such a qubit.
Finally the operating time of a single qubit phase gate is derived.

World Wide Web consortium stated that, HTML does not provide a better
description of semantic structure of the web page contents. To overcome this
draw backs, Web developers started to develop Web pages using new technologies
like XML, Flash etc. It makes a way for new research methods. Therefore, we
require an approach to reconstruct these Web pages suitable for SSDs. However,
existing approaches in literature do not perform well for Web pages erected

typical machine learning techniques ignore feature evaluation cost, and focus
solely on the accuracy of the machine learning models obtained utilizing all
the features available. We develop algorithms and indexes to support
cost-sensitive prediction, i.e., making decisions using machine learning models
taking feature evaluation cost into account. Given an item and a online
computation cost (i.e., time) budget, we present two approaches to return an
appropriately chosen machine learning model that will run within the specified
time on the given item. The first approach returns the optimal machine learning
model, i.e., one with the highest accuracy, that runs within the specified
time, but requires significant up-front precomputation time. The second
approach returns a possibly sub- optimal machine learning model, but requires
little up-front precomputation time. We study these two algorithms in detail
and characterize the scenarios (using real and synthetic data) in which each
performs well. Unlike prior work that focuses on a narrow domain or a specific
algorithm, our techniques are very general: they apply to any cost-sensitive
prediction scenario on any machine learning algorithm.

Nucleosynthesis (BBN) has been investigated. We find that the non-extensive
parameter $q$ may deviate by, at most, $|\delta q|$=6$\times$10$^{-4}$ from
unity for BBN predictions to be consistent with observed primordial abundances;
$q$=1 represents the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. This constraint
arises primarily from the {\em super}sensitivity of endothermic rates on the
value of $q$, which is found for the first time. As such, the implications of
non-extensive statistics in other astrophysical environments should be
explored. This may offer new insight into the nucleosynthesis of heavy
elements.
