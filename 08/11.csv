solutions to the Einstein field equations for a spatially flat FLRW universe in
the context of stochastic eternal inflation where the stochastic mechanism is
modelled by adding a stochastic forcing term representing Gaussian white noise
to the Klein-Gordon equation. We show that under these considerations, the
Klein-Gordon equation actually becomes a stochastic differential equation.
Therefore, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Einstein's equations
depend on whether the coefficients of this stochastic differential equation
obey Lipschitz continuity conditions. We show that for any choice of $V(\phi)$,
the Einstein field equations are not globally well-posed, hence, any solution
found to these equations is not guaranteed to be unique. Instead, the
coefficients are at best locally Lipschitz continuous in the physical state
space of the dynamical variables, which only exist up to a finite explosion
time. We further perform Feller's explosion test for an arbitrary power-law
inflaton potential and prove that all solutions to the EFE explode in a finite
time with probability one. This implies that the mechanism of stochastic
inflation thus considered cannot be described to be eternal, since the very
concept of eternal inflation implies that the process continues indefinitely.
We therefore argue that stochastic inflation based on a stochastic forcing term
would not produce an infinite number of universes in some multiverse ensemble.
In general, since the Einstein field equations in both situations are not
well-posed, we further conclude that the existence of a multiverse via the
stochastic eternal inflation mechanism considered in this paper is still very
much an open question that will require much deeper investigation.

headphones that bypass the ear canal and the middle ear. Furthermore,
otoacoustic emissions, sounds generated inside the ear and measured in the ear

can be applied to any quantity in the reciprocal space. The unfolding of the

half-metallicity rather than the observed narrow gap insulating behavior.
Including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leaves a half-semimetallic spectrum which
is essentially Mott insulating. SOC is crucial for the Mott insulating
character of the V d^1 ion, breaking the d_{m=\pm 1} degeneracy and also giving
a substantial orbital moment. Evidence is obtained of the large orbital moments
on Co that have been inferred from the measured susceptibility. Switching to
the orbital polarization (OP) functional, GGA+OP+SOC also displays clear
tendencies toward very large orbital moments but in its own distinctive manner.
In both approaches, application of SOC, which requires specification of the
direction of the spin, introduces large differences in the orbital moments of
the three Co ions in the primitive cell. We study a fictitious but simpler
cousin compound Ca3CoV4O12 (Ca replacing two of the Co atoms) to probe in more
transparent fashion the interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom with
the local environment of the planar CoO4 units. The observation that the
underlying mechanisms seems to be local to a CoO4 plaquette, and that there is
very strong coupling of the size of the orbital moment to the spin direction,
strongly suggest non-collinear spins, not only on Co but on the V sublattice as

the fermion sign problem in interacting fermion models by employing Majorana
representation of complex fermions. We call it ""Majorana QMC"" (MQMC).
Especially, MQMC is fermion sign free in simulating a class of spinless fermion
models on bipartite lattices at half filling and with arbitrary range of
(unfrustrated) interactions. To the best of our knowledge, MQMC is the first
auxiliary field QMC method to solve fermion sign problem in spinless (more
generally, odd number of species) fermion models. MQMC simulations can be
performed efficiently both at finite and zero temperatures. We believe that
MQMC could pave a new avenue to solve fermion sign problem in more generic
fermionic models.

difficulty that couples have when trying to decide with which parents should
they spend the holiday. Our goal is to schedule the family gatherings so that
the parents that will be {\em happy}, i.e.\ all their children will be home
{\em simultaneously} for the holiday festivities, while minimizing the number
of consecutive holidays in which parents are not happy.
  The holiday gathering problem is closely related to several classical
problems in computer science, such as the {\em dining philosophers problem} on
a general graph and periodic scheduling,and has applications in scheduling of
transmissions made by cellular radios. We also show interesting connections
between periodic scheduling, coloring, and universal prefix free encodings.
  The combinatorial definition of the Holiday Gathering Problem is: given a
graph $G$, find an infinite sequence of independent-sets of $G$. The objective
function is to minimize, for every node $v$, the maximal gap between two
appearances of $v$. In good solutions this gap depends on local properties of
the node (i.e., its degree) and the the solution should be periodic, i.e.\ a
node appears every fixed number of periods. We show a coloring-based
construction where the period of each node colored with the $c$ is at most
$2^{1+\log^*c}\cdot\prod_{i=0}^{\log^*c} \log^{(i)}c$ (where $\log^{(i)}$ means
iterating the $\log$ function $i$ times). This is achieved via a connection
with {\it prefix-free encodings}. We prove that this is the best possible for
coloring-based solutions. We also show a construction with period at most $2d$
for a node of degree $d$.

paper introduces an algorithm for the SSSP problem using compression method.
Owning to precomputing and storing all-pairs shortest path (APSP), the process
of solving SSSP problem is a simple lookup of a little data from precomputed
APSP and decompression. APSP without compression needs at least 1TB memory for
a road network with one million vertices. Our algorithm can compress such an
APSP into several GB, and ensure a good performance of decompression. In our
experiment on a dataset about Northwest USA (with 1.2 millions vertices), our
method can achieve about three orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra

and compared within a coherent framework; some fresh insights are provided and
new enhancements/modifications are proposed. It is shown that the replacement
of resonators by (non-recursive) modulators in sliding DFT (SDFT) analyzers
with either a finite impulse response (FIR), or an infinite impulse response

as the cancellation of marginally stable poles by zeros is still involved. The
FIR deadbeat observer is shown to be more reliable than the SDFT methods, an
IIR variant is presented, and ways of fine-tuning its response are discussed. A
novel technique for stabilizing IIR SDFT analyzers with a fading memory, so
that all poles are inside the unit circle, is also derived. Slepian and
sum-of-cosine windows are adapted to improve the frequency responses for the
various FIR and IIR DFT methods.

extrapolating the TFF $f_+^{B_c \to \eta_c}(q^2)$ to its allowable $q^2$

power-law WTD. The power-law index is $\gamma_{1} =$ 0.99 for the short waiting
times ($<$70 hours) and $\gamma_{2} =$ 1.92 for large waiting times ($>$100

is derived for the WTD of SPEs that is consistent with the WTD of type II radio

temperature (T_c) is observed. The low-T_c phase emerges as x >= 0.031, and the
T_c value increases to its maximum value of about 20 K at x = 0.083, the
maximum doping level in our study. As x >= 0.060, the high-T_c phase with a T_c
value of about 40 K is observed. The structure transition (STr) from tetragonal
to orthorhombic phase vanishes suddenly around x = 0.060, where a new STr from
tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal phase begins to turn up. Compared to the
low-T_c phase, the end point of SC transition of the high-T_c phase is more
sensitive to the magnetic field, showing a characteristic of Josephson
weak-link behavior. Possible scenarios about this system are discussed based on
our observations. We also find that the non-uniform SC properties cannot be
attributed to the heterogeneous Nd distribution on the micro scale, as revealed
by the detailed energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements.

breaking out of a rut. Mathematical and computational models of CF supported
this hypothesis, showing that CF is conducive to making creative connections by
placing concepts in new contexts. This paper proposes that CF was made possible
by mutation of the FOXP2 gene in the Paleolithic. FOXP2, once thought to be the

takes into account the multilevel structure of the data (i.e., students in
schools) in a suitable way. This approach allows us to cluster both students
and schools into homogeneous classes of ability and effectiveness, and to
assess the effect of certain students and school characteristics on the
probability to belong to such classes. The approach relies on an extended class
of multidimensional latent class IRT models characterized by: (i) latent traits
defined at student level and at school level, (ii) latent traits represented
through random vectors with a discrete distribution, (iii) the inclusion of
covariates at student level and at school level, and (iv) a two-parameter
logistic parametrization for the conditional probability of a correct response
given the ability. The approach is applied for the analysis of data collected
by two national tests administered in Italy to middle school students in June
2009: the INVALSI Italian Test and Mathematics Test. Results allow us to study
the relationships between observed characteristics and latent trait standing
within each latent class at the different levels of the hierarchy. They show
that examinees and school expected observed scores, at a given latent trait

time and charging time of the vehicles determine their expected charging demand
profile from the power grid. In this paper, we first present a model for
uncoordinated charging power demand of EVs based on a stochastic process and
accordingly we characterize an EV's expected daily power demand profile. Next,
we illustrate it for different charging time distributions through simulations.
This gives us useful insights into the long-term planning for upgrading power
systems' infrastructure to accommodate EVs. Then, we incorporate departure time
as another random variable into this modelling and introduce an autonomous
demand response (DR) technique to manage the EVs' charging demand. Our results
show that, it is possible to accommodate a large number of EVs and achieve the

further significantly when we add vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability in the

literature can be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the
zero-one, absolute, or squared loss functions. A key property that allows to
study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher
consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss
functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability
distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the
surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will
characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss
functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector
ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that,
for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal
regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the
derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex
margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk
bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk
bounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel
surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with
competing approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly
competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9

theoretical models, the saturated bolometric luminosity of such sources is
proportional to the BH mass which can be used to obtain their distance. Here we

three sources from our earlier work, we now have six new sources of this type.
We use a novel method based on a minimal radiation efficiency to identify nine
additional SEAMBHs from earlier RM-based mass measurements. We use a Bayesian
analysis to determine the parameters of the new distance expression, and the
method uncertainties, from the observed properties of the objects in the
sample. The ratio of the newly measured distances to the standard cosmological
ones has a mean scatter of 0.14 dex, indicating that SEAMBHs can be use as
cosmological distance probes. With their high luminosity, long period of

extend the cosmic distance ladder beyond the range now explored by type Ia

luminosity has been established in about 50 active galactic nuclei studied
through reverberation mapping of the broad Hbeta emission line. The R_blr-L
relation arises from simple photoionization considerations. Using a general
relativistic model of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk, we
show that the ionizing luminosity jointly depends on black hole mass, accretion
rate, and spin. The non-monotonic relation between the ionizing and optical
luminosity gives rise to a complicated relation between the BLR size and the
optical luminosity. We show that the reverberation lag of Hbeta to the varying
continuum depends very sensitively to black hole spin. For retrograde spins,
the disk is so cold that there is a deficit of ionizing photons in the BLR,
resulting in shrinkage of the hydrogen ionization front with increasing optical
luminosity, and hence shortened Hbeta lags. This effect is specially striking
for luminous quasars undergoing retrograde accretion, manifesting in strong
deviations from the canonical R_blr-L relation. This could lead to a method to
estimate black hole spins of quasars and to study their cosmic evolution. At
the same time, the small scatter of the observed R_blr-L relation for the
current sample of reverberation-mapped active galaxies implies that the
majority of these sources have rapidly spinning black holes.

distribution of ferromagnetic clusters, we suggest a novel disordered metallic
state, where Weyl metallic islands appear to form inhomogeneous mixtures with
topological insulating phases. Performing the renormalization group analysis
combined with experimental results, we propose a phase diagram in
$(\lambda_{so},\Gamma,T)$, where the spin-orbit coupling $\lambda_{so}$
controls a topological phase transition from a topological semiconductor to a
semiconductor with temperature $T$ and the distribution for ferromagnetic
clusters $\Gamma$ gives rise to a novel insulator-metal transition from either
a topological insulating or band insulating phase to an inhomogeneously
distributed Weyl metallic state with such insulating islands. Since
electromagnetic properties in Weyl metal are described by axion
electrodynamics, the role of random axion electrodynamics in transport
phenomena casts an interesting problem beyond the physics of percolation in
conventional disorder-driven metal-insulator transitions. We also discuss how

theory corrected with an on-site Coulomb interaction U, it is established that

in flux between the direct and the reflected radiation, the so-called
reflection fraction, is determined directly from the geometry and location of

of $d$ gapped patterns $P_1,\ldots,P_d$ over alphabet $\Sigma$, where each
gapped pattern $P_i$ is a sequence of subpatterns separated by bounded
sequences of don't cares. Then, given a query text $T$ of length $n$ over
alphabet $\Sigma$, the goal is to output all locations in $T$ in which a
pattern $P_i\in D$, $1\leq i\leq d$, ends. There is a renewed current interest
in the gapped matching problem stemming from cyber security. In this paper we
solve the problem where all patterns in the dictionary have one gap with at
least $\alpha$ and at most $\beta$ don't cares, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
given parameters. Specifically, we show that the dictionary matching with a
single gap problem can be solved in either $O(d\log d + |D|)$ time and
$O(d\log^{\varepsilon} d + |D|)$ space, and query time $O(n(\beta -\alpha

of patterns found, or preprocessing time and space: $O(d^2 + |D|)$, and query
time $O(n(\beta -\alpha ) + occ)$, where $occ$ is the number of patterns found.
As far as we know, this is the best solution for this setting of the problem,
where many overlaps may exist in the dictionary.

operations in 2015. Gravitational-wave signatures of compact binary
coalescences could be used to accurately test the strong-field dynamical
predictions of general relativity. Computationally expensive data analysis
pipelines, including TIGER, have been developed to carry out such tests. As a
means to cheaply assess whether a particular deviation from general relativity
can be detected, Cornish et al. and Vallisneri recently proposed an approximate
scheme to compute the Bayes factor between a general-relativity
gravitational-wave model and a model representing a class of alternative
theories of gravity parametrised by one additional parameter. This approximate
scheme is based on only two easy-to-compute quantities: the signal-to-noise
ratio of the signal and the fitting factor between the signal and the manifold
of possible waveforms within general relativity. In this work, we compare the
prediction from the approximate formula against an exact numerical calculation
of the Bayes factor using the lalinference library. We find that, using
frequency-domain waveforms, the approximate scheme predicts exact results with
good accuracy, providing the correct scaling with the signal-to-noise ratio at
a fitting factor value of 0.992 and the correct scaling with the fitting factor
at a signal-to-noise ratio of 20, down to a fitting factor of $\sim$ 0.9. We
extend the framework for the approximate calculation of the Bayes factor which
significantly increases its range of validity, at least to fitting factors of

sine-Gordon (SG) equation on a spatially localized $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
perturbation (defect) with a balanced gain and loss is investigated
numerically. It is demonstrated that if a kink passes the defect, it always
restores its initial momentum and energy and the only effect of the interaction
with the defect is a phase shift of the kink. A kink approaching the defect
from the gain side always passes, while in the opposite case it must have
sufficiently large initial momentum to pass through the defect instead of being
trapped in the loss region. The kink phase shift and critical velocity are
calculated with the use of the collective variable method. Kink-kink
(kink-antikink) collisions at the defect are also briefly considered, showing
how their pairwise repulsive (respectively, attractive) interaction can modify
the collisional outcome of a single kink within the pair with the defect. For
the breather, the result of its interaction with the defect strongly depends on
the breather parameters (velocity, frequency and initial phase) and on the
defect parameters. The breather can gain some energy from the defect and as a
result potentially even split into a kink-antikink pair or it can lose a part
of its energy. Interestingly, the breather translational mode is very weakly
affected by the dissipative perturbation, so that a breather penetrates more
easily through the defect when it comes from the lossy side, than a kink. In
all studied soliton-defect interactions the energy loss to radiation of
small-amplitude extended waves is negligible.

follow the evolution of network and internetwork flux elements. We find that
14% of the quiet Sun flux is in the form of internetwork fields, with little
temporal variations. Internetwork elements interact with network patches and
modify the flux budget of the network, either by adding flux (through merging
processes) or by removing it (through cancellation events). Mergings appear to
be dominant, so the net flux contribution of the internetwork is positive. The
observed rate of flux transfer to the network is 1.5 x 10^24 Mx day^-1 over the
entire solar surface. Thus, the internetwork supplies as much flux as is
present in the network in only 9-13 hours. Taking into account that not all the
transferred flux is incorporated into the network, we find that the
internetwork would be able to replace the entire network flux in approximately
18-24 hours. This renders the internetwork the most important contributor to
the network, challenging the view that ephemeral regions are the main source of
flux in the quiet Sun. About 40% of the total internetwork flux eventually ends

ideal MHD in non-turbulent cores with aligned magnetic field and rotation axis.
A promising way to resolve this so-called ""magnetic braking catastrophe"" is
through turbulence. The reason for the turbulence-enabled disk formation is
usually attributed to the turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection, which is
thought to reduce the magnetic flux accumulated in the disk-forming region. We
advance an alternative interpretation, based on magnetic decoupling-triggered
reconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central protostar and
turbulence-induced warping of the pseudodisk of Galli and Shu. Such
reconnection weakens the central split magnetic monopole that lies at the heart
of the magnetic braking catastrophe under flux freezing. We show, through
idealized numerical experiments, that the pseudodisk can be strongly warped,
but not completely destroyed, by a subsonic or sonic turbulence. The warping
decreases the rates of angular momentum removal from the pseudodisk by both
magnetic torque and outflow, making it easier to form a rotationally supported
disk. More importantly, the warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk-forming,
equatorial plane greatly reduces the amount of magnetic flux threading the
circumstellar, disk-forming region, further promoting disk formation. The
beneficial effects of pseudodisk warping can also be achieved by a misalignment
between the magnetic field and rotation axis. These two mechanisms of disk
formation, enabled by turbulence and field-rotation misalignment respectively,
are thus unified. We find that the disks formed in turbulent magnetized cores
are rather thick and significantly magnetized. Implications of these findings,
particularly for the thick young disk inferred in L1527, are briefly discussed.

broadened disc-like X-ray spectra, and known optical counterparts. We
simultaneously fit optical and X-ray data from ULXs with a new spectral model
of emission from an irradiated, colour-temperature-corrected accretion disc
around a black hole, with a central Comptonising corona. We find that the ULXs
require reprocessing fractions of $\sim 10^{-3}$, which is similar to
sub-Eddington thermal dominant state BHBs, but less than has been reported for
ULXs with soft ultraluminous X-ray spectra. We suggest that the reprocessing
fraction may be due to the opposing effects of self-shielding in a
geometrically thick super-critical accretion disc, and reflection from far
above the central black hole by optically thin material ejected in a natal
super-Eddington wind. Then, the higher reprocessing fractions reported for ULXs
with wind-dominated X-ray spectra may be due to enhanced scattering onto the
outer disc via the stronger wind in these objects. Alternatively, the accretion
discs in these ULXs may not be particularly geometrically thick, rather they
may be similar in this regard to the thermal dominant state BHBs.

vision and graphics, which encompasses several applications including facial
attractiveness enhancement, makeup transfer, face replacement, and expression
manipulation. Simply applying image-based warping algorithms to video-based
face editing produces temporal incoherence in the synthesized videos because it
is impossible to consistently localize facial features in two frames
representing two different faces in two different videos (or even two
consecutive frames representing the same face in one video). Therefore, high
performance face editing usually requires significant manual manipulation. In
this paper we propose a novel temporal-spatial-smooth warping (TSSW) algorithm
to effectively exploit the temporal information in two consecutive frames, as
well as the spatial smoothness within each frame. TSSW precisely estimates two
control lattices in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from
the corresponding control lattices in the previous frame, by minimizing a novel
energy function that unifies a data-driven term, a smoothness term, and feature
point constraints. Corresponding warping surfaces then precisely map source
frames to the target frames. Experimental testing on facial attractiveness
enhancement, makeup transfer, face replacement, and expression manipulation
demonstrates that the proposed approaches can effectively preserve spatial
smoothness and temporal coherence in editing facial geometry, skin detail,
identity, and expression, which outperform the existing face editing methods.
In particular, TSSW is robust to subtly inaccurate localization of feature
points and is a vast improvement over image-based warping methods.

spectra of SN~2012fr are consistent with an extinction law with a low value of
R_V~1.4. The high reddening causes the detected photon distribution in the
broadband UV filters to have a much longer effective wavelength than for an
unreddened SN. The light curve evolution is consistent with this shift and does
not show a flattening due to photons being scattered back into the line of
sight. The light curve shapes and color evolution are inconsistent with a
contribution scattered into the line of sight by circumstellar dust. We
conclude that most or all of the high reddening must come from interstellar
dust. We show that even for a single dust composition, there is not a unique
reddening law caused by circumstellar scattering. Rather, when considering
scattering from a time-variable source, we confirm earlier studies that the
reddening law is a function of the dust geometry, column density, and epoch. We
also show how an assumed geometry of dust as a foreground sheet in mixed
stellar/dust systems will lead to a higher inferred R_V. Rather than assuming
the dust around SNe is peculiar, SNe may be useful probes of the interstellar
reddening laws in other galaxies.

HMI data for a single AR and confirmed presence of this precursor plasma flow

conducted a statistical analysis of the HDFs to further investigate their
characteristics and better determine the properties. From SDO/HMI data, we
picked up 23 flux emergence events over a period of 14 months, the total flux
of which ranges from 10^{20} to 10^{22} Mx. Out of 23 selected events, 6 clear
HDFs were detected by the method we developed in our earlier study, and 7 HDFs
detected by visual inspection were added to this statistic analysis. We found
that the duration of the HDF is on average 61 minutes and the maximum HDF speed
is on average 3.1 km s^{-1}. We also estimated the rising speed of the
subsurface magnetic flux to be 0.6-1.4 km s^{-1}. These values are highly

results. The observation results lead us to the conclusion that the HDF is
rather a common feature in the earliest phase of AR emergence. Moreover, our
HDF analysis has capability of determining the subsurface properties of
emerging fields that cannot be directly measured.

physics computational model with weak ubiquitous short-ranged self attraction
and stronger sparse bridging interactions. Combining theoretical arguments and
simulations, we study the general phenomenology of polymer collapse induced by
these dual contributions, in the case of regularly-spaced bridging. Our results
distinguish a regime of classical Flory-like coil-globule collapse dictated by
the interplay of excluded volume and attractive energy and a switch-like
collapse where bridging interaction compete with entropy loss terms from the
looped arms of a star-like rosette. Additionally, we show that bridging can
induce stable compartmentalized domains. In these configurations, different
""cores"" of bridging proteins are kept separated by star-like polymer loops in
an entropically favorable multi-domain configuration, with a mechanism that
parallels micellar polysoaps. Such compartmentalized domains are stable, and do
not need any intra-specific interactions driving their segregation. Domains can
be stable also in presence of uniform attraction, as long as the uniform
collapse is above its theta point.

is located near the center of the young (~2000 yr) compact supernova remnant

the expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich
spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained
open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be
used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.
  In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator (generalizing
the Laplacian matrix of graphs)and study its spectra. We prove a Cheeger-type
inequality for hypergraphs, relating the second smallest eigenvalue of this
operator to the expansion of the hypergraph. We bound other hypergraph
expansion parameters via higher eigenvalues of this operator. We give bounds on
the diameter of the hypergraph as a function of the second smallest eigenvalue
of the Laplacian operator. The Markov process underlying the Laplacian operator
can be viewed as a dispersion process on the vertices of the hypergraph that
might be of independent interest. We bound the {\em Mixing-time} of this
process as a function of the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian
operator. All these results are generalizations of the corresponding results
for graphs.
  We show that there can be no linear operator for hypergraphs whose spectra
captures hypergraph expansion in a Cheeger-like manner. For any $k$, we give a
polynomial time algorithm to compute an approximation to the $k^{th}$ smallest
eigenvalue of the operator. We show that this approximation factor is optimal
under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by \cite{rs10}) for constant values of
$k$.
  Finally, using the factor preserving reduction from vertex expansion in
graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs
extend to vertex expansion in graphs.

with special emphasis in image denoising. A new approach for internal image
representation is outlined together with two new interfaces:
classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical. The new quantum-Boolean image
denoising called quantum Boolean mean filter (QBMF) works with computational
basis states (CBS), exclusively. To achieve this, we first decompose the image
into its three color components, i.e., red, green and blue. Then, we get the
bitplanes for each color, e.g., 8 bits-per-pixel, i.e., 8 bitplanes-per-color.
From now on, we will work with the bitplane corresponding to the most
significant bit (MSB) of each color, exclusive manner. After a
classical-to-quantum interface (which includes a classical inverter), we have a
quantum Boolean version of the image within the quantum machine. This
methodology allows us to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters
the results of the measured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended
to quantum algorithms outside image processing too. After filtering of the
inverted version of MSB (inside quantum machine) the result passes through a
quantum-classical interface (which involves another classical inverter) and
then proceeds to reassemble each color component and finally the ending
filtered image. Finally, we discuss the more appropriate metrics for image
denoising in a set of experimental results.

non-zero entries in each row) is called image partition regular if, whenever
the natural numbers are finitely coloured, there is a vector $x$, with entries
in the natural numbers, such that $Ax$ is monochromatic. Many of the classical
results of Ramsey theory are naturally stated in terms of image partition
regularity.
  Our aim in this paper is to investigate maximality questions for image
partition regular matrices. When is it possible to add rows on to $A$ and
remain image partition regular? When can one add rows but `nothing new is
produced'? What about adding rows and also new variables? We prove some results
about extensions of the most interesting infinite systems, and make several
conjectures.
  Perhaps our most surprising positive result is a compatibility result for
Milliken-Taylor systems, stating that (in many cases) one may adjoin one
Milliken-Taylor system to a translate of another and remain image partition
regular. This is in contrast to earlier results, which had suggested a strong
inconsistency between different Milliken-Taylor systems. Our main tools for
this are some algebraic properties of the $\beta N$, the Stone-Cech
compactification of the natural numbers.

basis of the representations space of the Coxeter group. In several recent
studies, the more general based root system is considered, where the simple
roots are only required to be positively independent. In this paper, we propose
a geometric version of ""level"" for the root system to replace Maxwell's graph
theoretical ""level."" Then we show that Maxwell's results naturally extend to
the more general root systems with positively independent simple roots. In
particular, the space-like extreme rays of the Tits cone correspond to a ball
packing if and only if the root system is of level $2$. We also present a
partial classification of level-$2$ root systems, namely the Coxeter
$d$-polytopes of level-$2$ with $d+2$ facets.

  Using Sequential Kriging-Based Optimization","30 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are used as statistical models in
many disciplines. However, intractable likelihood functions for SDEs make
inference challenging, and we need to resort to simulation-based techniques to
estimate and maximize the likelihood function. While sequential Monte Carlo
methods have allowed for the accurate evaluation of likelihoods at fixed
parameter values, there is still a question of how to find the maximum
likelihood estimate. In this article we propose an efficient
Gaussian-process-based method for exploring the parameter space using estimates
of the likelihood from a sequential Monte Carlo sampler. Our method accounts
for the inherent Monte Carlo variability of the estimated likelihood, and does
not require knowledge of gradients. The procedure adds potential parameter
values by maximizing the so-called expected improvement, leveraging the fact
that the likelihood function is assumed to be smooth. Our simulations
demonstrate that our method has significant computational and efficiency gains
over existing grid- and gradient-based techniques. Our method is applied to
modeling the closing stock price of three technology firms.

a spatially structured flow in the supersonic domain. Numerical simulations
reveal that this zero-frequency undulation suppresses the instability when its
spatial extension is infinite, and when its phase is near that of a ""shadow

the condensation of rotons in flowing superfluid helium-4 when exceeding the

method for deducing the inclination of magnetic elements and use it to test
magnetic field inclinations from inversions. We determine accurate positions of
a set of small, bright magnetic elements in high spatial resolution images
sampling different photospheric heights obtained by the Sunrise balloon-borne
solar observatory. Together with estimates of the formation heights of the
employed spectral bands, these provide us with the inclinations of the magnetic
features. We also compute the magnetic inclination angle of the same magnetic
features from the inversion of simultaneously recorded Stokes parameters. Our
new, geometric method returns nearly vertical fields (average inclination of
around 14 deg with a relatively narrow distribution having a standard deviation
of 6 deg). In strong contrast to this, the traditionally used inversions give
almost horizontal fields (average inclination of 75+-8 deg) for the same small
magnetic features, whose linearly polarised Stokes profiles are adversely
affected by noise. The almost vertical field of bright magnetic features from
our geometric method is clearly incompatible with the nearly horizontal
magnetic fields obtained from the inversions. This indicates that the amount of
magnetic flux in horizontal fields deduced from inversions is overestimated in
the presence of weak Stokes signals, in particular if Stokes Q and U are close
to or under the noise level. By combining the proposed method with inversions
we are not just improving the inclination, but also the field strength. This
technique allows us to analyse features that are not reliably treated by
inversions, thus greatly extending our capability to study the complete
magnetic field of the quiet Sun.

traditional thermodynamic treatment of plasticity by Ziegler is introduced,
where the plastic deformation is an internal variable, leading to the reduction
of thermostatic stress. Then a simple thermodynamic treatment of static and
dynamic friction follows, because the continuum generalization of these
phenomena leads to viscosity and plasticity in our interpretation. Finally,
plasticity is treated in the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The
yield condition is the consequence of the dependence of the Onsagerian

treatment unifies rheology and plasticity in a common framework.

Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) in the FUV, B, I and H bands, using
the Gini (G) and M20 parameters to quantitatively estimate the distribution and
concentration of flux as a function of wavelength. HST images provide an
average spatial resolution of ~80 pc. While our LIRGs can be reliably
classified as mergers across the entire range of wavelengths studied here,
there is a clear shift toward more negative M20 (more bulge-dominated) and a
less significant decrease in G values at longer wavelengths. We find no
correlation between the derived FUV G-M20 parameters and the global measures of
the IR to FUV flux ratio, IRX. Given the fine resolution in our HST data, this
suggests either that the UV morphology and IRX are correlated on very small
scales, or that the regions emitting the bulk of the IR emission emit almost no
FUV light. We use our multi-wavelength data to simulate how merging LIRGs would
appear from z~0.5-3 in deep optical and near-infrared images such as the HUDF,
and use these simulations to measure the G-M20 at these redshifts. Our
simulations indicate a noticeable decrease in G, which flattens at z >= 2 by as
much as 40%, resulting in mis-classifying our LIRGs as disk-like, even in the
rest-frame FUV. The higher redshift values of M20 for the GOALS sources do not
appear to change more than about 10% from the values at z~0. The change in
G-M20 is caused by the surface brightness dimming of extended tidal features
and asymmetries, and also the decreased spatial resolution which reduced the
number of individual clumps identified. This effect, seen as early as z~0.5,
could easily lead to an underestimate of the number of merging galaxies at
high-redshift in the rest-frame FUV.

heap implementation.

$1^3{\rm D}_3$ and $1^3{\rm D}_1$ $c\bar{s}$ states, respectively, study their
strong decays with the heavy meson effective theory by including the chiral
symmetry breaking corrections. We can reproduce the experimental data ${\rm
Br}\left(D_{sJ}^*(2860)\to D^*K\right)/{\rm Br}\left(D_{sJ}^*(2860)\to D
K\right) =1.10 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.19$ with suitable hadronic coupling constants,
the assignment of the $D_{sJ}^*(2860)$ as the $D_{s3}^*(2860)$ is favored, the
chiral symmetry breaking corrections are large. Furthermore, we obtain the
analytical expressions of the decay widths, which can be confronted with the
experimental data in the future to fit the unknown coupling constants. The
predictions of the ratios among the decay widths can be used to study the decay
properties of the $D_{s3}^*(2860)$ and $D_{s1}^*(2860)$ so as to identify them
unambiguously. On the other hand, if the chiral symmetry breaking corrections
are small, the large ratio $R=1.10 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.19$ requires that the
$D_{sJ}^*(2860)$ consists of at least four resonances $D_{s1}^*(2860)$,
$D_{s2}^*(2860)$, $D_{s2}^{*\prime}(2860)$, $D_{s3}^*(2860)$.

be represented using computational approaches. Our aim is to construct computer
models that exhibit creativity in an artistic context, that is, that are
capable of generating or evaluating an artwork (visual or linguistic), an
interesting new idea, a subjective opinion. The research was conducted in
2008-2012 at the Computational Linguistics Research Group (CLiPS, University of
Antwerp) under the supervision of Prof. Walter Daelemans. Prior research was
also conducted at the Experimental Media Research Group (EMRG, St. Lucas
University College of Art & Design Antwerp) under the supervision of Lucas
Nijs.
  Modeling Creativity examines creativity in a number of different
perspectives: from its origins in nature, which is essentially blind, to humans
and machines, and from generating creative ideas to evaluating and learning
their novelty and usefulness. We will use a hands-on approach with case studies
and examples in the Python programming language.
