detonations based on asymptotic analysis of the reactive compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We show that these equations can be reduced to a model
consisting of a forced, unsteady, small disturbance, transonic equation and a
rate equation for the heat release. In one spatial dimension, the model
simplifies to a forced Burgers equation. Through analysis, numerical
calculations and comparison with the reactive Euler equations, the model is
demonstrated to capture such essential dynamical characteristics of detonations
as the steady-state structure, the linear stability spectrum, the
period-doubling sequence of bifurcations and chaos in one-dimensional
detonations and cellular structures in multi- dimensional detonations.

oxide films, grown by dc sputtering, to evaluate their suitability for use as
on-chip resistors in nanoelectronics. By increasing the level of oxygen doping,
the room-temperature sheet resistance of the chromium oxide films was varied
from 28$\Omega / \square$ to 32.6k$\Omega / \square$. The variation in
resistance with cooling to 4.2K in liquid helium was investigated; the sheet
resistance at 4.2K varied with composition from 65$\Omega / \square$ to above
20G$\Omega / \square$. All of the films measured displayed ohmic behaviour at
all measured temperatures. For on-chip devices for quantum phase-slip
measurements using niobium-silicon nanowires, interfaces between
niobium-silicon and chromium oxide are required. By characterising the
interface contact resistance, we found that a gold intermediate layer is
favourable: the specfic contact resistivity of chromium-oxide-to-gold
interfaces was 0.15 m$\Omega$cm$^2$, much lower than the value for direct
chromium-oxide to niobium-silicon interfaces, 65m$\Omega$cm$^2$. We conclude
that these chromium oxide films are suitable for use in nanoscale circuits as
high-value resistors, with resistivity tunable by oxygen content.

quantum systems. In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body
localized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals
of motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in
these systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local
integrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a
local particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's
Hamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such
operators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL
system to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents
a density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes
how this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely
defined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for
characterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and
numerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an
extensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model. We
show that the resulting LIOMs are quasi-local, and use their decay to extract
the localization length and establish the location of the transition between
the MBL and ergodic phases.

effects, decreasing the reliability of the fit, especially in the cases when a
correleated Doppler noise is involved. We introduce a regularization of the
additive noise model that can gracefully eliminate its singularities together
with the associated non-linearity effects.
  We apply this approach to Doppler time-series data of several exoplanetary
systems. It demonstrates that our new regularized noise model yields orbital
fits that have either increased or at least the same statistical robustness, in
comparison with the simple additive jitter. Various statistical uncertainties
in the parametric estimations are often reduced, while planet detection
significance is often increased.
  Concerning the 55 Cnc five-planet system, we show that its Doppler data
contain significant correlated (""red"") noise. Its correlation timescale is in
the range from days to months, and its magnitude is much larger than the effect
of the planetary N-body perturbations in the radial velocity (these
perturbations thus appear undetectable). Characteristics of the red noise
depend on the spectrograph/observatory, and also show a cyclic time variation
in phase with the public Ca II H & K and photometry measurements. We interpret
this modulation as a hint of the long-term activity cycle of 55 Cnc, similar to
the Solar 11-year cycle. We estimate the 55 Cnc activity period by

the observational and theoretical studies of the Milky Way and the Magellanic
Clouds, which will be the topic of this contribution. Over past years, a large
volume of observations with unprecedented spatial resolution has been
accumulated for the Milky Way. It permits investigations of different stages of
the life cycle of dust, from its formation in stellar sources to destruction in
star-forming regions and supernovae shocks. Observations of dust emission,
extinction, polarisation of light, and interstellar element depletions in the
solar neighbourhood provide the most accurate constraints for the reference
dust models applied to study extragalactic systems. However, global spatial
studies of the circumstellar and interstellar dust are complicated in the Milky
Way disk because of high extinction, confusion along the line of sight and
large uncertainties in distances. In contrast, the favourable location in the
sky and the proximity of the Magellanic Clouds allow detailed multi-wavelength
studies of the dust-forming stellar populations and the investigation of
variations of the interstellar grain properties for the entire galaxies. They
enable the first comparison between the global stardust production rates from
theoretical calculations and those from observations, which confirm discrepancy
between accumulated stardust mass and observed interstellar dust mass - ""the
missing dust-source"" problem. Modelling of the life cycle of dust in the Large
Magellanic Cloud showed that dust growth by mantle accretion in the ISM, a
major dust source in the Milky Way, can be responsible for the existing dust
mass in the LMC. We will present comparison of the dust input from different
sources to the dust budgets of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, which
reveals how the role of these dust sources depends on metallicity.

ordered structure due to the formation of lattice defects and grain boundaries.
The properties of the resulting polycrystal can differ remarkably from those of
the ideal single crystal. Here we investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system of
colloidal spheres containing a small fraction of aspherical impurities and
characterise the resulting polycrystalline monolayer. We find that, in the
vicinity of an impurity, the underlying hexagonal lattice is deformed due to a
preference for 5-fold co-ordinated particles adjacent to impurities. This
results in a reduction in local hexagonal ordering around an impurity.
Increasing the concentration of impurities leads to an increase in the number
of these defects and consequently a reduction in system-wide hexagonal ordering
and a corresponding increase in entropy as measured from the distribution of
Voronoi cell areas. Furthermore, through both considering orientational
correlations and directly identifying crystalline domains we observe a decrease
in the average polycrystalline grain size on increasing the concentration of
impurities. Our data show that, for the concentrations considered, local
structural modifications due to the presence of impurities are independent of
their concentration, while structure on longer lengthscales (i.e. the size of
polycrystalline grains) is determined by the impurity concentration.

$D$-dimensional manifold (bulk) carrying out the principal bundle structure. As
a result, this space-time manifold is foliated in the covariant way by the
$(D-4)$-dimensional submanifolds, realized as the space-like internal spaces,
that are smooth copies of the Lie group $G$ considered in this paper as the
special unitary group. The submanifolds being transversal to the internal
spaces are realized as the external spaces and in fact identified as the usual
$4$-dimensional world. The fundamental degrees of freedom determining the
geometrical dynamics of the bulk corresponding with short distance gravity are
given by the gauge fields, the external metric field and the modulus fields
setting dynamically the volume of the internal spaces. These gauge fields
laying the bulk is to point precisely out the local directions of the external
spaces which depend on the topological non-triviality of the space-time
principal bundle. The physical size of the internal spaces is fixed dynamically
by the moduli stabilization potential which completely arise from the intrinsic
geometry of the bulk. A detail description of the low energy bulk gravity in
the weak field limit is given around the classical ground state of the bulk.
Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of the fundamentally $4$-dimensional
Weyl spinor fields and the fields of carrying out the non-trivial
representations of the Lie group $G$ propagating in the bulk in a detail study.

Here we explain the transition between these two regimes and the power law in
the $Ro >> 1$ regime by constructing an expression for the coronal luminosity
based on dynamo magnetic field generation and magnetic buoyancy. We explain the
$Ro<<1$ behavior from the inference that observed rotation is correlated with
internal differential rotation and argue that once the shear time scale is
shorter than the convective turnover time, eddies will be shredded on the shear
time scale and so the eddy correlation time actually becomes the shear time and
the convection time drops out of the equations. We explain the $Ro >> 1$

and buoyant loss.

empirical evidences for its significance. In this article, we investigate the

viability and mutual connectivity is emphasized and exploited for setting up
proper analytic framework. A rich phase diagram for viability is obtained and
greatly diversified patterns of hysteretic behavior in viability are observed
in the presence of link overlap. Mutual percolation with link overlap is
revisited as a limit of multiplex viability problem, and controversy between
existing results is clarified. The distinctive role of overlapping links is
further demonstrated by the different responses of networks under random
removals of overlapping and non-overlapping links, respectively, as well as
under several removal strategies. Our results show that the link overlap
strongly facilitates viability and mutual percolation; at the same time, the

Schwinger model is determined by the axial current anomaly of massless Dirac
fermions. A similar bosonized description applies to the 2D conformal trace
anomaly of the fermion stress tensor. For both the chiral and conformal
anomalies, correlation functions involving anomalous currents, $j^{\mu}_5$ or
$T^{\mu\nu}$ of massless fermions exhibit a massless boson $1/k^2$ pole, and
the associated spectral functions obey a UV finite sum rule, becoming
$\delta$-functions in the massless limit. In both cases the corresponding
effective action of the anomaly is non-local, but may be expressed in a local
form by the introduction of a new bosonic field, which becomes a bona fide
propagating quantum field in its own right. In both cases this is expressed in
Fock space by the anomalous Schwinger commutators of currents becoming the
canonical commutation relations of the corresponding boson. The boson has a
Fock space operator realization as a coherent superposition of massless fermion
pairs, which saturates the intermediate state sums in quantum correlation
functions of fermion currents. The Casimir energy of fermions on a finite
spatial interval $[0,L]$ can also be described as a coherent scalar
condensation of pairs, and the one-loop correlation function of any number $n$

indicated significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations. Accurate
predictions can be achieved at large K*-meson recoil for an optimised set of
observables designed to have no sensitivity to hadronic input in the
heavy-quark limit at leading order in alpha_s. However, hadronic uncertainties
reappear through non-perturbative Lambda_QCD/m_b power corrections, which must
be assessed precisely. In the framework of QCD factorisation we present a
systematic method to include factorisable power corrections and point out that
their impact on angular observables depends on the scheme chosen to define the
soft form factors. Associated uncertainties are found to be under control,
contrary to earlier claims in the literature. We also discuss the impact of
possible non-factorisable power corrections, including an estimate of
charm-loop effects. We provide results for angular observables at large recoil
for two different sets of inputs for the form factors, spelling out the
different sources of theoretical uncertainties. Finally, we comment on a recent
proposal to explain the anomaly in B->K*mu+mu- observables through
charm-resonance effects, and we propose strategies to test this proposal

the standard athermal, quasistatic (AQ) approach and our recently developed
self-learning metabasin escape (SLME) method to account for the finite
temperature and strain-rate effects. In the AQ, or strain-driven limit, the
nonaffine displacement fields of surface STZs decay exponentially away from
their centers at similar decay rates as their bulk counterparts, though the
direction of maximum nonaffine displacement is tilted away from the tensile
axis due to surface effects. Using the SLME method at room temperature and at
the high strain rates that are seen in classical molecular dynamics
simulations, the characteristics for both bulk and surface STZs are found to be
identical to those seen in the AQ simulations. However, using the SLME method
at room temperature and experimentally-relevant strain rates, we find a
transition in the surface STZ characteristics where a loss in the
characteristic angular tensile-compression symmetry is observed. Finally, the
thermally-activated surface STZs exhibit a slower decay rate in the nonaffine
displacement field than do strain-driven surface STZs, which is characterized
by a larger drop in potential energy resulting from STZ nucleation that is
enabled by the relative compliance of the surface as compared to the bulk.

boundary conditions are set to enforce that the incoming eigenfields don't
introduce spurious reflections and, more importantly, that there are no fields
introduced at the boundary that violate the constraint equations. In order to
do this we adopt two different approaches to set boundary conditions for the
extrinsic curvature, by expressing either the radial or the time derivative of
its associated outgoing eigenfield in terms of the constraints. We find that
these boundary conditions are very robust in practice, allowing us to perform
long lasting evolutions that remain accurate and stable, and that converge to a
solution that satisfies the constraints all the way to the boundary.

introduced recently by Povolotsky. That is, we establish a Plancherel type
isomorphism result which implies completeness and biorthogonality statements
for the Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the system. Owing to a Markov duality
with the q-Hahn TASEP (a discrete-time generalization of TASEP with particles'
jump distribution being the orthogonality weight for the classical q-Hahn
orthogonal polynomials), we write down moment formulas which characterize the
fixed time distribution of the q-Hahn TASEP with general initial data.
  The Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the q-Hahn system degenerate into
eigenfunctions of other (not necessarily stochastic) interacting particle
systems solvable by the coordinate Bethe ansatz. This includes the ASEP, the
(asymmetric) six-vertex model, and the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain (all models
are on the infinite lattice). In this way, each of the latter systems possesses
a spectral theory, too. In particular, biorthogonality of the ASEP
eigenfunctions which follows from the corresponding q-Hahn statement implies
symmetrization identities of Tracy and Widom (for ASEP with either step or step
Bernoulli initial configuration) as corollaries. Another degeneration takes the
q-Hahn system to the q-Boson particle system (dual to q-TASEP) studied in
detail in our previous paper (2013).
  Thus, at the spectral theory level we unify two discrete-space
regularizations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation / stochastic heat equation,
namely, q-TASEP and ASEP.

first defender scheduling policy, the defender selects the active platform in

this least similar platform when facing a randomization defense. Additionally,
it is demonstrated that the diversity-maximizing defense is superior for

Dynamical systems modeling often involves neglecting certain characteristics of

frequently treated as symmetric about the sagittal plane. In this work, we test
this assumption by examining human walking dynamics around the steady-state
(limit-cycle). Here we adapt statistical cross validation in order to examine
whether there are statistically significant asymmetries, and even if so, test
the consequences of assuming bilateral symmetry anyway. Indeed, we identify
significant asymmetries in the dynamics of human walking, but nevertheless show
that ignoring these asymmetries results in a more consistent and predictive

conditions of such groups. The molecular clumps in our models assumed to be

gravitational waves (GWs), as well as candidate progenitors for short Gamma-Ray
Bursts (SGRBs). Depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the NS
equation of state (EOS), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to a
black hole, or the formation of a supramassive NS, or even a stable NS. In the
case of post-merger NS (PMNS) formation, magnetic field amplification during
the merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,
and millisecond spin. If the timescale for orthogonalization of the magnetic
symmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the NS will radiate its
spin down energy primarily via GWs. Here we study this scenario for various
outcomes of NS formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for a
twisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixed
exterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hence
compute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected GW signal
as a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. The relative
number of GW detections from PMNSs and from binary NSs is a strong function of
the NS equation of state (EOS), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest EOSs and
negligibly small for the softest ones. For intermediate-stiffness EOSs, such as
the n=4/7 polytrope recently used by Giacomazzo \& Perna or the GM1 used by
Lasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a GW
detection rate from stable PMNSs of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with Advanced
detectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors such
as the Einstein Telescope. Measurement of such GW signal would provide strong
constraints on the NS EOS and on the nature of the binary progenitors giving
rise to SGRBs.

string theory, often accompanied by the presence of extra spatial dimensions.
In this note we investigate a toy scenario where the hidden photon extends into

the hidden photon is massive. In four dimensions this mass needs to be
generated via a Higgs or Stueckelberg mechanism. However, in a situation with

theoretical studies of the resonance employ an RPA-type approach in the

$\chi_S (\mathbf{q}, \omega)$ at momentum ${\bf Q} = (\pi,\pi)$ with the
spin-exciton of an $s^{+-}$ superconductor, pulled below $2\Delta$ by residual
attraction associated with the sign change of the gap between Fermi points
connected by ${\bf Q}$. Here we explore the effect of fluctuations in the
particle-particle channel on the spin resonance. Particle-particle and
particle-hole channels are coupled in a superconductor and to what extent the
spin resonance can be viewed as a particle-hole exciton needs to be addressed.
In the case of purely repulsive interactions we find that the particle-particle
channel at total momentum ${\bf Q}$ (the $\pi $channel) contributes little to
the resonance. However, if the interband density-density interaction is
attractive and the $\pi-$resonance is possible on its own, along with the
spin-exciton, we find a much stronger shift of the resonance frequency from the
position of the would-be spin-exciton resonance. We also show that the expected
double-peak structure in this situation does not appear because of the strong
coupling between particle-hole and particle-particle channels, and $\mathrm{Im}

semi-metal and a band insulator which are connected to the weak-coupling limit,
and a magnetically ordered N\'eel phase and a valence bond crystal (VBC) which
are linked to the strong-coupling Mott limit. The phase diagram is obained by
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and continuous unitary transformations (CUTs). The
CUT is performed in a two-step process: Non-perturbative graph-based CUTs are
used in the Mott insulating phase to integrate out charge fluctuations. The
resulting effective spin model is tackled by perturbative CUTs about the
isolated dimer limit yielding the breakdown of the VBC by triplon condensation.
We find three scenarios when varying the interaction for a fixed anisotropy of
hopping amplitudes: i) one direct phase transition from N\'eel to semi-metal,
ii) two phase transitions VBC to N\'eel and N\'eel to semi-metal, or iii) a
smooth crossover from VBC to the band insultor. Our results are consistent with

suppressed the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$ and increased

by the power - law function, $\Delta \lambda (T) = A(T/T_c)^n$. While
substantial suppression of $T_c$ supports $s_{\pm}$ pairing mechanism, in
samples close to the optimal doping, $x=$ 0.26 and 0.34, the exponent $n$
remained high ($n \geq 3$) indicating robust full superconducting gaps. For the

also suppressed the temperature of structural/magnetic transition, $T_{sm}$,

fundamental limit for the number of measurements in compressive phase retrieval

the measurement matrix is constrained to be a cascade of Fourier matrices and

thought to have led to weaker polar field strengths, producing the extended
solar minimum and the unusually weak cycle 24. To determine the impact of
meridional flow variations on the sunspot cycle, we have simulated the Sun's
surface magnetic field evolution with our newly developed surface flux
transport model. We investigate three different cases: a constant average
meridional flow, the observed time-varying meridional flow, and a time-varying
meridional flow in which the observed variations from the average have been
doubled. Comparison of these simulations shows that the variations in the
meridional flow over cycle 23 have a significant impact (~20%) on the polar
fields. However, the variations produced polar fields that were stronger than
they would have been otherwise. We propose that the primary cause of the
extended cycle 23/24 minimum and weak cycle 24 was the weakness of cycle 23
itself - with fewer sunspots, there was insufficient flux to build a big cycle.
We also find that any polar counter-cells in the meridional flow (equatorward
flow at high latitudes) produce flux concentrations at mid-to-high latitudes
that are not consistent with observations.

While searching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) for diffuse radio
emission, we have serendipitously discovered extended radio emission close to
the Galactic plane. The radio morphology suggests the presence of a previously
unknown Galactic supernova remnant. An unclassified {\gamma}-ray source
detected by EGRET (3EG J1744-3934) is present in the same location and may stem
from the interaction between high-speed particles escaping the remnant and the
surrounding interstellar medium.
  Aims. Our aim is to confirm the presence of a previously unknown supernova
remnant and to determine a possible association with the {\gamma}-ray emission
3EG J1744-3934.
  Methods. We have conducted optical and radio follow-ups of the target using
the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) and the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope
(GMRT). We then combined these data with archival radio and {\gamma}-ray
observations.
  Results. While we detected the extended emission in four different radio
bands (325, 1400, 2417, and 4850 MHz), no optical counterpart has been
identified. Given its morphology and brightness, it is likely that the radio
emission is caused by an old supernova remnant no longer visible in the optical
band. Although an unclassified EGRET source is co-located with the supernova
remnant, Fermi-LAT data do not show a significant {\gamma}-ray excess that is
correlated with the radio emission. However, in the radial distribution of the
{\gamma}-ray events, a spatially extended feature is related with SNR at a
confidence level $\sim 1.5$ {\sigma}.
  Conclusions. We classify the newly discovered extended emission in the radio
band as the old remnant of a previously unknown Galactic supernova: SNR
G351.0-5.4.

the normal regime, the effect of the perturbations is small, in line with

photon orbits, we obtain an explicit characterization of all McVittie
spacetimes for which such orbits exist: there is a 2-parameter class of such
spacetimes, and so the existence of a circular photon orbit is a highly
specialised feature of a McVittie spacetime. However, we prove that in two
large classes of McVittie spacetimes, there are bound particle and photon
orbits: future-complete non-radial timelike and null geodesics along which the
areal radius $r$ has a finite upper bound. These geodesics are asymptotic at
large times to circular orbits of a corresponding Schwarzschild or
Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. The existence of these geodesics lays the
foundations for and shows the theoretical possibility of the formation of
accretion disks in McVittie spacetimes. We also summarize and extend some
previous results on the global structure of McVittie spacetimes. The results on

especially for increasing the channel capacity of long-distance quantum
communication. Hyperentanglement purification is an important method to obtain
high-fidelity nonlocal hyperentangled states from mixed hyperentangled states
in a long-distance quantum communication process with noisy channels. Here, we
present a two-step hyperentanglement purification protocol for nonlocal mixed
hyperentangled states with polarization bit-flip errors and spatial-mode
phase-flip errors, resorting to polarization-spatial phase-check quantum
nondemolition detectors and the quantum-state-joining method (QSJM). With QSJM,
the protocol can preserve the states that are discarded in the previous
hyperentanglement purification protocols. It has the advantage of a high
efficiency, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems
with several degrees of freedom in long-distance high-capacity quantum
communication.

theory of rings and modules. They provide useful technical tools for studying

couniserial dimension that measures how close a ring or module is to being
uniform. Despite their different objectives, it turns out that there are
certain common properties between the couniserial dimension and Krull dimension
like each module having such a dimension contains a uniform submodule and has
finite uniform dimension, among others. Like all dimensions, this is an ordinal

its value lies between the uniform dimension and the length of the module.
Modules with countable couniserial dimension are shown to possess
indecomposable decomposition. In particular, von Neumann regular ring with
countable couniserial dimension is semisimple artinian. If the maximal right
quotient ring of a non-singular ring R has a couniserial dimension as an

First, a group of algorithms for learning formation strategy based on limited
features will be presented. Due to distributed and complex nature of many
multi-agent systems, it is impossible to include all features directly in the
learning process; thus, a modular scheme is proposed in order to reduce the
number of features. In this method, some important features have indirect
influence in learning instead of directly involving them as input features.
This framework has the ability to dynamically assign a group of positions to a
group of agents to improve system performance. In addition, it can change the

automatically produce many complex and flexible formation strategy algorithms
without directly involving an expert to present and implement such complex

Ultimately, this enhancement is achieved by transferring the quantum state of
squeezed light to one or more of the atomic input beams, thereby allowing
operation below the standard quantum limit. We analyze in detail three specific
schemes that utilize (1) single-mode squeezed optical vacuum (i.e. low
frequency squeezing), (2) two-mode squeezed optical vacuum (i.e. high frequency
squeezing) transferred to both atomic inputs, and (3) two-mode squeezed optical
vacuum transferred to a single atomic input. Crucially, our analysis considers
incomplete quantum state transfer (QST) between the optical and atomic modes,
and the effects of depleting the initially-prepared atomic source.
Unsurprisingly, incomplete QST degrades the sensitivity in all three schemes.
We show that by measuring the transmitted photons and using information
recycling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 053002 (2013)], the degrading effects of
incomplete QST on the sensitivity can be substantially reduced. In particular,
information recycling allows scheme (2) to operate at the Heisenberg limit
irrespective of the QST efficiency, even when depletion is significant.
Although we concentrate on Bose-condensed atomic systems, our scheme is equally
applicable to ultracold thermal vapors.

range of stresses and then viscous flow. Tests in small ratio geometries
however showed more complex responses. Effects attributed to the cup wall
included delayed softening, slip, multiple yielding and stick-slip events, and
unsteady flow. The conclusion was that cups have to be relatively large to
eliminate wall artefacts. A diameter ratio of three was sufficient in practice,
although the minimum ratio must be material dependent.

gene-based analysis has even greater potential in pharmacogenetics. Motivated
by a study from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, we
develop a gene-trait similarity regression for survival analysis to assess the
effect of a gene or pathway on time-to-event outcomes. The similarity
regression has a general framework that covers a range of survival models, such
as the proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model. The
inference procedure developed under the proportional hazards model is robust
against model misspecification. We derive the equivalence between the
similarity survival regression and a random effects model, which further
unifies the current variance component-based methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation studies. In addition,
we apply the method to the VISP trial data to identify the genes that exhibit
an association with the risk of a recurrent stroke. The TCN2 gene was found to
be associated with the recurrent stroke risk in the low-dose arm. This gene may
impact recurrent stroke risk in response to cofactor therapy.

recent times for measuring the impact of scientific publications and their
social outreach to intended audiences. The popular social networks such as
Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin and social bookmarks such as Mendeley and
CiteULike are nowadays widely used for communicating research to larger
transnational audiences. In 2012, the San Francisco Declaration on Research
Assessment got signed by the scientific and researchers communities across the
world. This declaration has given preference to the ALM or altmetrics over
traditional but faulty journal impact factor (JIF)-based assessment of career
scientists. JIF does not consider impact or influence beyond citations count as
this count reflected only through Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database.
Furthermore, JIF provides indicator related to the journal, but not related to
a published paper. Thus, altmetrics now becomes an alternative metrics for
performance assessment of individual scientists and their contributed scholarly
publications. This paper provides a glimpse of genesis of altmetrics in
measuring efficacy of scholarly communications and highlights available
altmetric tools and social platforms linking altmetric tools, which are widely
used in deriving altmetric scores of scholarly publications. The paper thus

revisited. The low- and high-frequency regimes of a helicon plasma source
operation are distinguished. In the low-frequency regime with $\omega <
\sqrt{\omega_{ci}\omega_{ce}}$ the density limit is deduced from the
Golant-Stix criterion of the accessibility of the lower hybrid resonance. In
the high-frequency case, $\omega > \sqrt{\omega_{ci}\omega_{ce}}$, an
appropriate limit is given by the Shamrai-Taranov criterion. Both these
criteria are closely related to the phenomenon of the coalescence of the
helicon wave with the Trivelpiece-Gould mode. We argue that theoretical density

Peaks are then picked using a mixture of probability distribution to deal with

spectral similarities among the peaks within the same peak group. The algorithm
is evaluated using experimental data to study the effect of different cutoffs

using a trial-and-error approach. We then compare the new algorithm with two

environments characterized by very long delays and frequent network partitions.
To allow devices to communicate in such environments, delay-tolerant networking
solutions have been proposed by exploiting opportunistic message forwarding,
with limited expectations of end-to-end connectivity and node resources. Such
solutions envision non-traditional communication scenarios, such as disaster
areas and development regions. Several forwarding algorithms have been
investigated, aiming to offer the best trade-off between cost (number of
message replicas) and rate of successful message delivery. Among such
proposals, there has been an effort to employ social similarity inferred from
user mobility patterns in opportunistic routing solutions to improve
forwarding. However, these research effort presents two major limitations:
first, it is focused on distribution of the intercontact time over the complete
network structure, ignoring the impact that human behavior has on the dynamics
of the network; and second, most of the proposed solutions look at challenging
networking environments where networks have low density, ignoring the potential
use of delay-tolerant networking to support low cost communications in networks
with higher density, such as urban scenarios. This paper presents a study of
the impact that human behavior has on opportunistic forwarding. Our goal is
twofold: i) to show that performance in low and high density networks can be
improved by taking the dynamics of the network into account; and ii) to show
that the delay-tolerant networking can be used to reduce communication costs in
networks with higher density by taking the behavior of the user into account.

their respective carrying capacities, taking into account that this influence
can be quite strong and requires a nonlinear functional framework. We
distinguish three variants of mutual influence, representing the main types of
relations between species: (i) passive symbiosis, when the mutual carrying
capacities are influenced by other species without their direct interactions;
(ii) active symbiosis, when the carrying capacities are transformed by
interacting species; and (iii) mixed symbiosis, when the carrying capacity of
one species is influenced by direct interactions, while that of the other
species is not. The approach allows us to describe all kinds of symbiosis,
mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism within a unified scheme. The case of
two symbiotic species is analysed in detail, demonstrating several dynamical
regimes of coexistence, unbounded growth of both populations, growth of one and
elimination of the other population, convergence to evolutionary stable states,
and everlasting population oscillations. The change of the dynamical regimes
occurs by varying the system parameters characterising the destruction or
creation of the mutual carrying capacities. The regime changes are associated
with several dynamical system bifurcations.

three-dimensional toroidal geometry were performed using the global gyro
kinetic turbulence code, GKW . The results were benchmarked against a
cylindrical ideal MHD and analytical theory calculations. The stability, growth
rate and frequency of the mode were investigated by varying the current
profile, collisionality and the pressure gradients. Both collision-less and
semi-collisional tearing modes were found with a smooth transition between the
two. A residual, finite, rotation frequency of the mode even in the absense of
a pressure gradient is observed which is attributed to toroidal finite
Larmor-radius effects. When a pressure gradient is present at low
collisionality, the mode rotates at the expected electron diamagnetic
frequency. However the island rotation reverses direction at high
collisionality. The growth rate is found to follow a $\eta^{1/7}$ scaling with
collisional resistivity in the semi-collisional regime, closely following the
semi-collisional scaling found by Fitzpatrick. The stability of the mode
closely follows the stability using resistive MHD theory, however a
modification due to toroidal coupling and pressure effects is seen.

i.e. if there exists an embedding of the curve in projective three space such
that the tropicalization maps the skeleton of the curve isometrically to its
image. Baker, Payne and Rabinoff showed that the skeleton of every analytic
curve can be tropicalized faithfully. However the dimension of the ambient

  We will define a map from the skeleton to the tropicalization of the
Jacobian, which is an isometry on the cycles. It allows us to find principal
divisors and simultanously to determine the retractions of their support on the
skeleton which is necessary to calculate their tropicalization.
  It turns out that a Mumford curve of genus two whose cycles of its skeleton
are either disjoint or share an edge of length at most half of the length of
the cycles, can be tropicalized faithfully in dimension three.

times. We introduce a new service discipline, mixed gated/exhaustive service,
that can be used for queues with two types of customers: high and low priority
customers. At the beginning of a visit of the server to such a queue, a gate is
set behind all customers. High priority customers receive priority in the sense
that they are always served before any low priority customers. But high
priority customers have a second advantage over low priority customers. Low
priority customers are served according to the gated service discipline, i.e.
only customers standing in front of the gate are served during this visit. In
contrast, high priority customers arriving during the visit period of the queue
are allowed to pass the gate and all low priority customers before the gate.
  We study the cycle time distribution, the waiting time distributions for each
customer type, the joint queue length distribution of all priority classes at
all queues at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length
distributions for each customer type. Through numerical examples we illustrate
that the mixed gated/exhaustive service discipline can significantly decrease
waiting times of high priority jobs. In many cases there is a minimal negative
impact on the waiting times of low priority customers but, remarkably, it turns
out that in polling systems with larger switch-over times there can be even a
positive impact on the waiting times of low priority customers.

with the classical technology, where the relative reduction in the course of
drawing drops more than twice. It is shown that the use of experimental
technology allows varying the size of a ferrite grain (increase or decrease)

results in grain reduction. Furthermore, the experimental technology allows
reducing the number of pores in a wire of small diameter. To prevent heating of

result, the workability of the process will be enhanced and the efforts of

having received service. The probability that a certain customer leaves the
queue, depends on the queue in which the customer is waiting, and on the
location of the server. We show that this system can be analysed by introducing
customer subtypes, depending on their arrival periods, and keeping track of the
moment when they abandon the system. In order to determine waiting time
distributions, we regard the system as a polling model with varying arrival
rates, and apply a generalised version of the distributional form of Little's

state of the system (position of the server, and whether it is serving or

shock modelling in high density environments. For densities higher than
\sim10^5 cm-3, shattering becomes a self-enhanced process that imposes severe
chemical and dynamical consequences on the shock characteristics. Shattering is
accompanied by the vaporization of grains, which can directly release SiO to
the gas phase. Given that SiO rotational line radiation is used as a major
tracer of shocks in dense clouds, it is crucial to understand the influence of
vaporization on SiO line emission. We have developed a recipe for implementing
the effects of shattering and vaporization into a 2-fluid shock model,
resulting in a reduction of computation time by a factor \sim100 compared to a
multi-fluid modelling approach. This implementation was combined with an
LVG-based modelling of molecular line radiation transport. Using this model we
calculated grids of shock models to explore the consequences of different
dust-processing scenarios. Grain-grain processing is shown to have a strong
influence on C-type shocks for a broad range of magnetic fields: they become
hotter and thinner. The reduction in column density of shocked gas lowers the
intensity of molecular lines, at the same time as higher peak temperatures
increase the intensity of highly excited transitions compared to shocks without
grain-grain processing. For OH the net effect is an increase in line
intensities, while for CO and H2O it is the contrary. The intensity of H2
emission is decreased in low transitions and increased for highly excited
lines. For all molecules, the highly excited lines become sensitive to the
value of the magnetic field. Although vaporization increases the intensity of
SiO rotational lines, this effect is weakened by the reduced shock width. The
release of SiO early in the hot shock changes the excitation characteristics of
SiO radiation.

version of FastICA has been shown to have the potential to achieve the
Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity
functions in its parallel implementations of one-unit FastICA. In spite of this
appealing property, a rigorous study of the asymptotic error of the generalized
symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing in the community. In fact, all the
existing results exhibit certain limitations, such as ignoring the impact of
data standardization on the asymptotic statistics or being based on a heuristic

  The first result of this contribution is the characterization of the limits
of the generalized symmetric FastICA. It is shown that the algorithm optimizes
a function that is a sum of the contrast functions used by traditional one-unit
FastICA with a correction of the sign. Based on this characterization, we
derive a closed-form analytic expression of the asymptotic covariance matrix of
the generalized symmetric FastICA estimator using the method of estimating

output is transmitted through the communication channel at once. The scheduling
of sensor information towards the controller is ruled by a weighted
Try-Once-Discard (TOD) or by Round-Robin (RR) protocols. Differently from the
existing results on NCSs in the presence of scheduling protocols (in the
frameworks of hybrid and discrete-time systems), we allow the communication
delays to be greater than the sampling intervals. A novel hybrid system model
for the closed-loop system is presented that contains {\it time-varying delays
in the continuous dynamics and in the reset conditions}. A new
Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, which is based on discontinuous in time Lyapunov
functionals is introduced for the stability analysis of the delayed hybrid
systems. Polytopic type uncertainties in the system model can be easily
included in the analysis. The efficiency of the time-delay approach is
illustrated on the examples of uncertain cart-pendulum and of batch reactor.

from the same scalar field. The history of the Universe describes a crossover
from a scale invariant ""past fixed point"" where all particles are massless, to
a ""future fixed point"" for which spontaneous breaking of the exact scale
symmetry generates the particle masses. The cosmological solution can be
extrapolated to the infinite past in physical time - the universe has no
beginning. This is seen most easily in a frame where particle masses and the
Planck mass are field-dependent and increase with time. In this ""freeze frame""
the Universe shrinks and heats up during radiation and matter domination. In
the equivalent, but singular Einstein frame cosmic history finds the familiar
big bang description. The vicinity of the past fixed point corresponds to
inflation. It ends at a first stage of the crossover. A simple model with no
more free parameters than $\Lambda$CDM predicts for the primordial fluctuations
a relation between the tensor amplitude $r$ and the spectral index
$n,r=8.19(1-n)-0.137$. The crossover is completed by a second stage where the
beyond-standard-model sector undergoes the transition to the future fixed
point. The resulting increase of neutrino masses stops a cosmological scaling
solution, relating the present dark energy density to the present neutrino
mass. At present our simple model seems compatible with all observational
tests. We discuss how the fixed points can be rooted within quantum gravity in
a crossover between ultraviolet and infrared fixed points. Then quantum
properties of gravity could be tested both by very early and late cosmology.

L\'evy processes. The method is based on the accurate numerical formulas for
Fourier transform proposed by Ooura. These formulas are combined with
nonuniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) and fractional FFT to speed up the
numerical computations. Moreover, we propose a formula for numerical indefinite
integration on equispaced grids as a component of the method. The proposed
integration formula is based on the sinc-Gauss sampling formula, which is a
function approximation formula. This integration formula is also combined with
the FFT. Therefore, all steps of the proposed method are executed using the FFT
and its variants. The proposed method allows us to be free from some special
treatments for a non-smooth initial condition and numerical time integration.
The numerical solutions obtained by the proposed method appeared to be
exponentially convergent on the interval if the corresponding exact solutions
do not have sharp cusps. Furthermore, the real computational times are
approximately consistent with the theoretical estimates.

aggregation. Using a majority rule generally results in dominant classes
becoming more pronounced and rare classes becoming less pronounced. Using
nearest neighbor techniques generally maintains the global proportion of each

implement the spatial scan statistic for spatial aggregation of categorical

(aggregation unit) and global level (map). We also contrast the spatial scan
statistic technique with the majority rule and nearest neighbor approaches. In
general, the scan statistic technique behaved inverse the majority rule

suggest the scan statistic techniques should be used for spatial aggregation of

significant small-body encounter events in the near future and offers a good
opportunity for in situ exploration to determine the asteroid's surface
properties and measure any tidal effects that might alter its regolith
configuration. Resurfacing mechanics has become a new focus for asteroid
researchers due to its important implications for interpreting surface
observations, including space weathering effects. This paper provides a
prediction for the tidal effects during the 2029 encounter, with an emphasis on
whether surface refreshing due to regolith movement will occur. The potential
shape modification of the object due to the tidal encounter is first confirmed
to be negligibly small with systematic simulations, thus only the external
perturbations are taken into account for this work (despite this, seismic
shaking induced by shifting blocks might still play a weak role and we will
look into this mechanism in future work). A two-stage approach is developed to
model the responses of asteroid surface particles (the regolith) based on the
soft-sphere implementation of the parallel N-body gravity tree code pkdgrav. A
full-body model of Apophis is sent past the Earth on the predicted trajectory
to generate the data of all forces acting at a target point on the surface. A
sandpile constructed in the local frame is then used to approximate the
regolith materials; all the forces the sandpile feels during the encounter are
imposed as external perturbations to mimic the regolith's behavior in the full
scenario. The local mechanical environment on the asteroid surface is
represented in detail, leading to an estimation of the change in global surface
environment due to the encounter. Typical patterns of perturbation are
presented that depend on the asteroid orientation and sense of rotation at
perigee.

Observatory between January 2010 and December 2012. We perform $K_s$-band
differential photometry of our targets (with typical errors of $\pm$15-30~mmag
at the 1$\sigma$ level) by subtracting a reference flux from each photometric
measurement. This reference flux is computed using three nearby, probably
constant stars in the target's field-of-view. We then construct and visually
inspect the light curves to search for variability, and use four different
periodogram algorithms to look for possible periods in our photometric data.
Our targets do not display long-term variability over 1$\sigma$ compared to
other nearby stars of similar brightness, nor do the periodograms unveil any
possible periodicity for these objects, with two exceptions:
2MASS~J02411151-0326587 and G196-3B. In the case of 2MASS~J02411151-0326587

level, which seems to be associated with peak-to-peak variability of
44$\pm$10~mmag. This object may also display variability in timescales of
years, as suggested by the comparison of our Ks-band photometry with 2MASS. For
G196-3B (L3), we find peak-to-peak variations of 42$\pm$10~mmag, with a
possible photometric period of 442$\pm$7~days, at 95% confidence level. This is
roughly the double of the astrometric period reported by Zapatero Osorio
(2014). Given the significance of these results, further photometric data are
required to confirm the long-term variability.These results suggest that early-
to mid-L dwarfs are fairly stable in the $K_s$-band within $\pm$90 mmag at the
3 $\sigma$ level over months to years, which covers hundreds to tens of
thousands of rotation cycles.

However, the spatial extent decreases with energy, which we attribute to
synchrotron energy losses as the particles move away from the shock. The
hard-band maps show a relative deficit of counts in the northern region towards
the RCW 89 thermal remnant, with significant asymmetry. We find that the
integrated PWN spectra measured with NuSTAR and Chandra suggest that there is a
spectral break at 6 keV which may be explained by a break in the
synchrotron-emitting electron distribution at ~200 TeV and/or imperfect cross
calibration. We also measure spatially resolved spectra, showing that the
spectrum of the PWN softens away from the central pulsar B1509-58, and that
there exists a roughly sinusoidal variation of spectral hardness in the
azimuthal direction. We discuss the results using particle flow models. We find
non-monotonic structure in the variation with distance of spectral hardness

roughness parameter of the $\mathcal G_I^0$ distribution. It has been shown
that this distribution is able to characterize a large number of targets in
monopolarized SAR imagery, deserving the denomination of ""Universal Model"" It
is indexed by three parameters: the number of looks (which can be estimated in
the whole image), a scale parameter, and the roughness or texture parameter.
The latter is closely related to the number of elementary backscatters in each
pixel, one of the reasons for receiving attention in the literature. Although
there are efforts in providing improved and robust estimates for such quantity,
its dependable estimation still poses numerical problems in practice. We
discuss estimators based on the minimization of stochastic distances between
empirical and theoretical densities, and argue in favor of using an estimator
based on the Triangular distance and asymmetric kernels built with Inverse
Gaussian densities. We also provide new results regarding the heavytailedness
of this distribution.

the Landauer-B\""uttiker formula to a setup where the sample S is replaced by a
periodic structure whose unit cell is S. We argue that these crystalline
currents are closely related to the Thouless currents. For example, the
crystalline heat current is bounded above by the Thouless heat current, and
this bound saturates iff the coupling between the reservoirs and the sample is
reflectionless. Our analysis leads to a rigorous derivation of the Thouless

the medical images have the potential to enhance diagnosis of disease,

methodological and computational challenges for representation and selection of
features in image cluster analysis. To address these challenges, we first
extend one dimensional functional principal component analysis to the two
dimensional functional principle component analyses (2DFPCA) to fully capture
space variation of image signals. Image signals contain a large number of
redundant and irrelevant features which provide no additional or no useful
information for cluster analysis. Widely used methods for removing redundant
and irrelevant features are sparse clustering algorithms using a lasso-type
penalty to select the features. However, the accuracy of clustering using a
lasso-type penalty depends on how to select penalty parameters and a threshold
for selecting features. In practice, they are difficult to determine. Recently,
randomized algorithms have received a great deal of attention in big data
analysis. This paper presents a randomized algorithm for accurate feature
selection in image cluster analysis. The proposed method is applied to ovarian
and kidney cancer histology image data from the TCGA database. The results
demonstrate that the randomized feature selection method coupled with

sparse clustering algorithms in image cluster analysis.

utility provider (UP) in almost real-time, providing a much more detailed
depiction of the consumer's energy consumption compared to their analog
counterparts. This increased rate of information flow to the UP, together with
its many potential benefits, raise important concerns regarding user privacy.
This work investigates, from an information theoretic perspective, the privacy
that can be achieved in a multi-user SM system in the presence of an
alternative energy source (AES). To measure privacy, we use the mutual
information rate between the users' real energy consumption profile and the SM
readings that are available to the UP. The objective is to characterize the
\textit{privacy-power function}, defined as the minimal information leakage
rate that can be obtained with an average power limited AES. We characterize
the privacy-power function in a single-letter form when the users' energy
demands are assumed to be independent and identically distributed over time.
Moreover, for binary and exponentially distributed energy demands, we provide
an explicit characterization of the privacy-power function. For any discrete
energy demands, we demonstrate that the privacy-power function can always be
efficiently evaluated numerically. Finally, for continuous energy demands, we
derive an explicit lower-bound on the privacy-power function, which is tight
for exponentially distributed loads.

outbreaks in France from 2008-2011 is of particular interest due to the
documented disparity in regional vaccination coverage. The impact of
heterogeneous vaccine coverage on disease transmission is a broad interest and
the focus of this study. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR)

vaccination rates and mixing is introduced. The mathematical analysis of a

population are studied using a compartmental model. In this study we consider
three solar power options commonly available to consumers: the community block,
leasing, and buying. In particular we are interested in studying how social
influence affects the dynamics within these compartments. As a result of this
research a threshold value is determined, beyond which solar panels persist in
the population. In addition, as is standard in this type of study, we perform
equilibrium analysis, as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analyses on the
threshold value. We also perform uncertainty analysis on the population levels
of each compartment. The analysis shows that social influence plays an
important role in the adoption of residential solar panels.

  fails, an illustration using Google Flu Trends","5 pages",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Obtaining an accurate picture of the current state of the economy is
particularly important to central banks and finance ministries, and of
epidemics to health ministries. There is increasing interest in the use of
search engine data to provide such 'nowcasts' of social and economic
indicators. However, people may search for a phrase because they independently
want the information, or they may search simply because many others are
searching for it. We consider the effect of the motivation for searching on the
accuracy of forecasts made using search engine data of contemporaneous social
and economic indicators. We illustrate the implications for forecasting
accuracy using four episodes in which Google Flu Trends data gave accurate
predictions of actual flu cases, and four in which the search data
over-predicted considerably. Using a standard statistical methodology, the Bass
diffusion model, we show that the independent search for information motive was
much stronger in the cases of accurate prediction than in the inaccurate ones.
Social influence, the fact that people may search for a phrase simply because
many others are, was much stronger in the inaccurate compared to the accurate
cases. Search engine data may therefore be an unreliable predictor of
contemporaneous indicators when social influence on the decision to search is
strong.

  Abstraction of Natural Language Text","31 pages",,,,"cs.CL cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  MindMapping is a well-known technique used in note taking, which encourages
learning and studying. MindMapping has been manually adopted to help present
knowledge and concepts in a visual form. Unfortunately, there is no reliable
automated approach to generate MindMaps from Natural Language text. This work
firstly introduces MindMap Multilevel Visualization concept which is to jointly
visualize and summarize textual information. The visualization is achieved
pictorially across multiple levels using semantic information (i.e. ontology),
while the summarization is achieved by the information in the highest levels as
they represent abstract information in the text. This work also presents the
first automated approach that takes a text input and generates a MindMap
visualization out of it. The approach could visualize text documents in
multilevel MindMaps, in which a high-level MindMap node could be expanded into
child MindMaps. \ignore{ As far as we know, this is the first work that view
MindMapping as a new approach to jointly summarize and visualize textual
information.} The proposed method involves understanding of the input text and
converting it into intermediate Detailed Meaning Representation (DMR). The DMR
is then visualized with two modes; Single level or Multiple levels, which is
convenient for larger text. The generated MindMaps from both approaches were
evaluated based on Human Subject experiments performed on Amazon Mechanical
Turk with various parameter settings.

series solutions are obtained by means of the Variational Iteration Method
(VIM). We find the series solutions for different cases of the source term, in
a form that is readily implementable on the computer where symbolic computation
platform is available. The error in truncated solution $c_n$ diminishes
exponentially fast for a given $\alpha$ as the number of terms in the series
increases. VIM has several advantages over other methods that produce solutions
in the series form. The truncated VIM solutions often converge rapidly
requiring only a few terms for fast and accurate approximations.

holonomy Lie algebra associated to hyperplane arrangement $\Delta$ is
essentially equivalent to the classification of $\vee$-systems associated to
$\Delta.$ The flat sections of the corresponding $\vee$-connection can be
interpreted as vector fields, which are both logarithmic and gradient. We
conjecture that the hyperplane arrangement of any $\vee$-system is free in
Saito's sense and show this for all known $\vee$-systems and for a special
class of $\vee$-systems called harmonic, which includes all Coxeter systems. In
the irreducible Coxeter case the potentials of the corresponding gradient
vector fields turn out to be Saito flat coordinates, or their one-parameter
deformations. We give formulas for these deformations as well as for the
potentials of the classical families of harmonic $\vee$-systems.
