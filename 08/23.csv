checkerboard-like optical lattices possessing nontrivial topological
properties. By simple tuning of the parameters these lattices can have a
topological insulating phase, a topological semi-metallic phase, or a trivial
insulating phase. This allows study of different topological phase transitions
within a single cold atom system. In the topologically nontrivial phases flat
bands appear at the surfaces of the system. These surface states possess short
localization lengths such that they are observable even in systems with small
lattice dimensions. Our proposed lattices neither need spin-orbit coupling nor
non-Abelian gauge fields to reach topologically nontrivial states.

the 1950s, scientists have developed ever-diversifying families of black box
optimisation algorithms designed to address any optimisation problem, requiring
only that quality of a candidate solution is calculated via a fitness function
specific to the problem. For such algorithms to be successful, at least three
properties are required: an effective informed sampling strategy, that guides
generation of new candidates on the basis of fitnesses and locations of
previously visited candidates; mechanisms to ensure efficiency, so that same
candidates are not repeatedly visited; absence of structural bias, which, if
present, would predispose the algorithm towards limiting its search to some
regions of solution space. The first two of these properties have been
extensively investigated, however the third is little understood. In this
article we provide theoretical and empirical analyses that contribute to the
understanding of structural bias. We prove a theorem concerning dynamics of
population variance in the case of real-valued search spaces. This reveals how
structural bias can manifest as non-uniform clustering of population over time.
Theory predicts that structural bias is exacerbated with increasing population
size and problem difficulty. These predictions reveal two previously
unrecognised aspects of structural bias. Respectively, increasing population
size, though ostensibly promoting diversity, will magnify any inherent
structural bias, and effects of structural bias are more apparent when faced
with difficult problems. Our theoretical result also suggests that two commonly
used approaches to enhancing exploration, increasing population size and
increasing disruptiveness of search operators, have quite distinct implications
in terms of structural bias.

constraint on any high-scale model for the generation of the observed baryon
asymmetry. In a standard leptogenesis scenario, the corresponding washout
factor would strongly decrease a pre-existing lepton asymmetry and thus would
render leptogenesis models that generate a (B-L) asymmetry far above the LHC
scale ineffective. Therefore, LHC searches focused on LNV processes without
missing energy are powerful probes for high-scale leptogenesis models and

which the global solution is hard to obtain. To address this issue, one popular
approach is convex relaxation. However, such an approach may produce suboptimal
estimators due to the relaxation effect. To optimally estimate sparse principal
subspaces, we propose a two-stage computational framework named ""tighten after
relax"": Within the 'relax' stage, we approximately solve a convex relaxation of
sparse PCA with early stopping to obtain a desired initial estimator; For the
'tighten' stage, we propose a novel algorithm called sparse orthogonal
iteration pursuit (SOAP), which iteratively refines the initial estimator by
directly solving the underlying nonconvex problem. A key concept of this
two-stage framework is the basin of attraction. It represents a local region
within which the `tighten' stage has desired computational and statistical
guarantees. We prove that, the initial estimator obtained from the 'relax'
stage falls into such a region, and hence SOAP geometrically converges to a
principal subspace estimator which is minimax-optimal within a certain model
class. Unlike most existing sparse PCA estimators, our approach applies to the
non-spiked covariance models, and adapts to non-Gaussianity as well as
dependent data settings. Moreover, through analyzing the computational
complexity of the two stages, we illustrate an interesting phenomenon that
larger sample size can reduce the total iteration complexity. Our framework
motivates a general paradigm for solving many complex statistical problems
which involve nonconvex optimization with provable guarantees.

shall demonstrate, the resulting picture can vary from model to model,
indicating that the effect of collisional matter in $f(R)$ theories is strongly
model dependent. Particularly, in a few cases, may give better fit to the
$\mathrm{\Lambda}\mathrm{CDM}$ model. In all studied cases, the effective
equation of state parameter does not cross the phantom divide, both in the
collisional matter and pressure-less matter $f(R)$ theories. Finally, we
thoroughly study the effects of collisional matter on one of the $f(R)$ models

time acceleration. The overall picture of the evolution of the universe is not
drastically affected, apart from the matter era which is further enhanced with
an additional matter energy density term, which is of leading order. However, a
fully consistent description of the universe's evolution requires the
introduction of a dark energy compensate in the total energy density, a concept

chiral symmetry breaking in 2+1 dimensions, leading to generating dynamical
fermion mass even at weakest attraction. In this work we investigate the
collective modes associated with the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in a
constant magnetic field in the (2+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with
continuous U(1) chiral symmetry. We introduce a self-consistent scheme to
evaluate the propagators of the collective modes at the leading order in 1/N.
The contributions from the vacuum and from the magnetic field are separated
such that we can employ the well-established regularization scheme for the case
of vanishing magnetic field. The same scheme can be applied to the study of the
next-to-leading order correction in 1/N. We show that the sigma mode is always
a lightly bound state with its mass being twice the dynamical fermion mass for
arbitrary strength of the magnetic field. Since the dynamics of the collective
modes is always 2+1 dimensional, the finite temperature transition should be of
the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type. We determine the KT transition temperature
$T_{\rm KT}$ as well as the mass melting temperature $T^*$ as a function of the
magnetic field. It is found that the pseudogap domain $T_{\rm KT}<T<T^*$ is
enlarged with increasing strength of the magnetic field. The influence of a
chiral imbalance or axial chemical potential $\mu_5$ is also studied. We find
that even a constant axial chemical potential $\mu_5$ can lead to inverse
magnetic catalysis of the KT transition temperature in 2+1 dimensions. The
inverse magnetic catalysis behavior is actually the de Haas--van Alphen
oscillation induced by the interplay between the magnetic field and the Fermi
surface.

$L\subset\mathbb{E}$, which is involutive with respect to the Courant bracket.
In particular, $L$ inherits the structure of a Lie algebroid. In this paper, we
introduce the more general notion of a pseudo-Dirac structure: an arbitrary
subbundle, $W\subset\mathbb{E}$, together with a pseudo-connection on its
sections, satisfying a natural integrability condition. As a consequence of the
definition, $W$ will be a Lie algebroid. Allowing non-isotropic subbundles of
$\mathbb{E}$ incorporates non-skew tensors and connections into Dirac geometry.
Novel examples of pseudo-Dirac structures arise in the context of quasi-Poisson
geometry, Lie theory, generalized K\""ahler geometry, and Dirac Lie groups,
among others. Despite their greater generality, we show that pseudo-Dirac
structures share many of the key features of Dirac structures. In particular,
they behave well under composition with Courant relations.

strategic agents. Specifically, we prove that without a proper control the
total demand of an inefficient system is at most twice the total demand of the
optimal outcome. We propose an incentives scheme that promotes optimal outcomes
in the inefficient electricity market. The economic incentives can be seen as
an indirect revelation mechanism that allocates resources using a
one-dimensional message space per resource to be allocated. The mechanism does
not request private information from users and is valid for any concave
customer's valuation function. We propose a distributed implementation of the
mechanism using population games and evaluate the performance of four popular
dynamics methods in terms of the cost to implement the mechanism. We find that
the achievement of efficiency in strategic environments might be achieved at a
cost, which is dependent on both the users' preferences and the dynamic

geometry that is particularly apt for expressing the standard model of particle
physics coupled to Einstein gravity. In a previous paper, we suggested a
reformulation of this framework that is: (i) simpler and more unified in its
axioms, and (ii) allows the Lagrangian for the standard model of particle
physics (coupled to Einstein gravity) to be specified in a way that is tighter
and more explanatory than the traditional algorithm based on effective field
theory. Here we explain how this same reformulation yields a new perspective on
the symmetries of a given NCG. Applying this perspective to the NCG
traditionally used to describe the standard model we find, instead, an
extension of the standard model by an extra $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, and a
single extra complex scalar field $\sigma$, which is a singlet under
$SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$, but has $B-L=2$. This field has
cosmological implications, and offers a new solution to the discrepancy between
the observed Higgs mass and the NCG prediction.

eigenvector is sparse. An impressive range of estimators have been proposed;
some of these are fast to compute, while others are known to achieve the
minimax optimal rate over certain Gaussian or sub-Gaussian classes. In this
paper, we show that, under a widely-believed assumption from computational
complexity theory, there is a fundamental trade-off between statistical and
computational performance in this problem. More precisely, working with new,
larger classes satisfying a restricted covariance concentration condition, we
show that there is an effective sample size regime in which no randomised
polynomial time algorithm can achieve the minimax optimal rate. We also study
the theoretical performance of a (polynomial time) variant of the well-known
semidefinite relaxation estimator, revealing a subtle interplay between
statistical and computational efficiency.

between cognitive states emerge from the dynamic activity of functional brain
networks. However, current methodologies cannot easily evaluate both the
spatial and temporal changes in brain networks with cognitive state. Here we
combine a simple data reorganization with spatial ICA, enabling a
spatiotemporal ICA (stICA) which captures the consistent evolution of networks
during onset and offset of a task. The technique was applied to FMRI datasets
involving alternating between rest and task and to simple synthetic data.
Starting and finishing time-points of periods of interest (anchors) were
defined at task block onsets and offsets. For each subject, the ten volumes
following each anchor were extracted and concatenated spatially, producing a
single 3D sample. Samples for all anchors and subjects were concatenated along
the fourth dimension. This 4D dataset was decomposed using ICA into
spatiotemporal components. One component exhibited the transition with task
onset from a default mode network (DMN) becoming less active to a
fronto-parietal control network (FPCN) becoming more active. We observed other
changes with relevance to understanding network dynamics, e.g., the DMN showed
a changing spatial distribution, shifting to an anterior/superior pattern of
deactivation during task from a posterior/inferior pattern during rest. By
anchoring analyses to periods associated with the onsets and offsets of task,
our approach reveals novel aspects of the dynamics of network activity
accompanying these transitions. Importantly, these findings were observed
without specifying a priori either the spatial networks or the task time
courses.

non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a 'top-down' approach to evolving small

more complex, modular GRNs. We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use
differential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target
dynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the
search and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of
each generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known
small GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include
these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more
complex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we
truncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty
term, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by
incorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find
minimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.

this approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived N-body+SPH

of the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such a
realistic system. Leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived by
Bovy & Rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the SDSS
observations cannot be explained, assuming Newtonian gravity, by visible matter
alone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distances
of 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed to
purely visible matter. We also show that the SDSS data provide a strong
constraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. Within
galactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is well
described as an oblate halo with axis ratio qDM=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds to
an axis ratio qDM=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution. Because
of our precise two-dimensional measurements of the acceleration of the halo

supernova that interacts with its progenitor wind. Using the radiative transfer
code CMFGEN, we investigate the recently-reported 15.5 h post-explosion
spectrum of the type IIb SN 2013cu. For the first time, we are able to directly
measure the chemical abundances of a SN progenitor and find a relatively H-rich
wind, with H and He abundances (by mass) of X=0.46 +- 0.2 and Y=0.52 +- 0.2,
respectively. The wind is enhanced in N and depleted in C relative to solar
values (mass fractions of 8.2e-3 and 1e-5). We obtain that a dense
wind/circumstellar medium, with a mass-loss rate of Mdot= 3e-3 Msun/yr and wind
velocity vwind=100 km/s, surrounds the star at the pre-SN stage. These values
are lower than previous analytical estimates, although we find Mdot/vinf
consistent with previous work. We also compute a CMFGEN model to constrain the
progenitor spectral type and find that the high Mdot and low vwind imply that
the star had an effective temperature of ~8000 K immediately before the SN
explosion. Our models suggest that the progenitor was either an unstable
luminous blue variable or a yellow hypergiant undergoing an eruptive phase, and
rule out a WR star. We classify the post-explosion spectra at 15.5 h as XWN5(h)
and advocate for the use of the prefix `X' (eXplosion) to avoid confusion
between post-explosion, non-stellar spectra with those of massive stars. We
show that the progenitor spectral type is significantly different than the
early post-explosion spectral type owing to the huge differences in the
ionization structure before and after the SN event. We find the following
temporal evolution: LBV/YHG -> XWN5(h) -> SN IIb. Future early-time
spectroscopy in the UV will give access to additional spectroscopic diagnostics

focuses on study of complex interactions in a biological system, such as gene
regulatory networks. The discovery of gene regulatory networks leads to a wide
range of applications, such as pathways related to a disease that can unveil in
what way the disease acts and provide novel tentative drug targets. In
addition, the development of biological models from discovered networks or
pathways can help to predict the responses to disease and can be much useful
for the novel drug development and treatments. The inference of regulatory
networks from biological data is still in its infancy stage. This paper
proposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based gene regulatory network (GRN)
model hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in
backpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural
network that gives a better settlement between the biological closeness and
mathematical flexibility to model GRN. The RNN is able to capture complex,
non-linear and dynamic relationship among variables. Gene expression data are
inherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation even in noisy
data. Hence, non-linear version of Kalman filter, i.e., generalized extended
Kalman filter has been applied for weight update during network training. The
developed model has been applied on DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and
two synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We compared our results with other
state-of-the-art techniques that show superiority of our model. Further, 5%
Gaussian noise has been added in the dataset and result of the proposed model
shows negligible effect of noise on the results.

propagate in the bulk of a compact AdS$_5$ space are conjectured to be dual to
models featuring a partially composite Higgs boson. They offer a framework with
which to investigate the implications of changing the scaling dimension of the
Higgs operator, which can be used to reduce the constraints from electroweak
precision data. In the context of such models, we calculate the cross section
for Higgs production in gluon fusion and the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay rate and
show that they are finite (at one-loop order) as a consequence of gauge
invariance. The extended scalar sector comprising the Kaluza-Klein excitations
of the Standard Model scalars is constructed in detail. The largest effects are
due to virtual KK fermions, whose contributions to the cross section and decay
rate introduce a quadratic sensitivity to the maximum allowed value $y_\ast$ of
the random complex entries of the 5D anarchic Yukawa matrices. We find an
enhancement of the gluon-fusion cross section and a reduction of the
$H\to\gamma\gamma$ rate as well as of the tree-level Higgs couplings to
fermions and electroweak gauge bosons. We perform a detailed study of the
correlated signal strengths for different production mechanisms and decay
channels as functions of $y_\ast$, the mass scale of Kaluza-Klein resonances

by color, with blue centrals having a SHMR above the one of red centrals; at
logMh~12, the Ms/Mh ratio of the blue centrals is ~0.05, which is ~1.7 times
larger than the value of red centrals. 2) The intrinsic scatters of the SHMRs
of red and blue centrals are ~0.14 and ~0.11dex, respectively. The intrinsic
scatter of the average SHMR of all central galaxies changes from ~0.20dex to
~0.14dex in the 11.3<logMh<15 range. 3) The fraction of halos hosting blue
centrals at Mh=1E11Msun is 87%, but at 2x1E12Msun decays to ~20%, approaching
to a few per cents at higher masses. The characteristic mass at which this
fraction is the same for blue and red galaxies is Mh~7x1E11Msun. Our results
suggest that the SHMR of central galaxies at large masses is shaped by halo
mass quenching (likely through shock virial heating and AGN feedback), but
group richness also plays an important role: central galaxies living in less
dense environments quenched their star formation later or did not quench it
yet. At low masses, processes that delay star formation without invoking too
strong supernova-driven outflows could explain the high Ms/Mh ratios of blue
centrals as compared to those of the scarce red centrals.

Josephson junction integrated circuits have emerged as the key technology to
implement such a universal digital quantum computer. Indeed, prior experiments
have demonstrated simple Josephson qubit configurations with quantized energy
levels and long coherence times, which are a necessary prerequisite for a
practical quantum computer. However, these quantized states do not directly
prove the presence of entanglement or macroscopic superposition, which are
essential for the superior speed of such a digital quantum computer. On the
contrary, an alternative realistic foundation for quantum mechanics has
recently been proposed, with coherent transitions between quantized states, but
without entanglement. A new experiment is proposed that may test whether
superconducting quantum circuits can exhibit quantized states without
macroscopic entanglement or superposition. Specifically, a flux qubit (a
bi-stable SQUID) may be configured with a resonant input line for excitation
and a single-flux quantum output line for simultaneous direct measurement of
quantized energy and flux states, which are incompatible measurements in
standard quantum theory. Such an observation could undermine the assumptions of
superposition and entanglement, bringing into question the foundation and the
ultimate performance of a universal digital quantum computer.

Compton-thick material. Due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsic
continuum components are not formally required by the data in any of the

the reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. Using
archival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic X-ray luminosities
consistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. Our results are
consistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with a
relatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency of
the order of 1%. Given the unambiguous confirmation of the Compton-thick nature

free group $F$ with equal normal closures $\langle x\rangle^F=\langle

this property, called the Magnus property, has been generalized to oriented
surface groups.
  In this paper, we consider an analogue property for profinite surface groups.
While Magnus property, in general, does not hold in the profinite setting, it
does hold in some restricted form. In particular, for ${\mathscr S}$ a class of
finite groups, we prove that, if $x$ and $y$ are \emph{algebraically simple}
elements of the pro-${\mathscr S}$ completion $\hat{\Pi}^{\mathscr S}$ of an
orientable surface group $\Pi$, such that, for all $n\in{\mathbb N}$, there
holds $\langle x^n\rangle^{\hat{\Pi}^{\mathscr S}}=\langle
y^n\rangle^{\hat{\Pi}^{\mathscr S}}$, then $x$ is conjugated to $y^s$ for some
$s\in(\hat{\mathbb Z}^{\mathscr S})^\ast$. As a matter of fact, a much more
general property is proved and further extended to a wider class of profinite
completions.
  The most important application of the theory above is a generalization of the

system of extreme introverts and extroverts - the XIE model. Surprising
phenomena appear, even in this minimal model, where the only control parameters
are the numbers of each subgroup: $N_{I,E}$. Specifically, an extraordinary
transition emerges when $N_I$ crosses $N_E$. For example, the fraction of total
number of I-E links jumps from $\thicksim 0$ to $\thicksim 1$. In a $N_I=N_E$
system, this fraction performs a pure random walk so that its distribution
displays a flat plateau across most of $[0,1]$, with the edges vanishing as
$(N_{I,E})^{-0.38}$ for large systems. Thus, we believe the XIE model exhibits
an extreme Thouless effect. For this limiting model, we show that detailed
balance is restored and explicitly find the microscopic steady-state
distribution. We then use a mean-field approach to find analytic expressions
for the degree distributions that are in reasonably good agreement with
simulations, provided $N_I$ is not too close to $N_{E}$.

Nearby isolated planetary mass objects are beginning to be
discovered, but their individual properties are poorly constrained because
their low surface temperatures and strong molecular self-absorption make them
extremely faint.
  Aims. We aimed to detect the near infrared emission of the coldest brown
dwarf (BD) found so far, WISE0855$-$0714, located $\sim$2.2 pc away, and to
improve its temperature estimate (T$_{\rm eff}$= 225-260 K) from a comparison
with state-of-the-art models of BD atmospheres.
  Methods. We observed the field containing WISE0855-0714 with HAWK-I at the
VLT in the $Y$ band. For BDs with T$_{\rm eff}<$500\,K theoretical models
predict strong signal (or rather less molecular absorption) in this band.
  Results. WISE0855-0714 was not detected in our Y-band images, thus placing an
upper limit on its brightness to Y>24.4 mag at 3-$\sigma$ level, leading to
Y-[4.5]>10.5. Combining this limit with previous detections and upper limits at
other wavelengths, WISE0855$-$0714 is confirmed as the reddest BD detected,
further supporting its status as the coldest known brown dwarf. We applied
spectral energy distribution fitting with collections of models from two

  Interacting Random Walkers with and without Confinement",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theory of the spread of epidemics is formulated on the basis of pairwise
interactions in a dilute system of random walkers (infected and susceptible
animals) moving in n dimensions. The motion of an animal pair is taken to obey
a Smoluchowski equation in 2n-dimensional space that combines diffusion with
confinement of each animal to its particular home range. An additional
(reaction) term that comes into play when the animals are in close proximity
describes the process of infection. Analytic solutions are obtained, confirmed
by numerical procedures, and shown to predict a surprising effect of
confinement. The effect is that infection spread has a non-monotonic dependence
on the diffusion constant and/or the extent of the attachment of the animals to
the home ranges. Optimum values of these parameters exist for any given
distance between the attractive centers. Any change from those values,
involving faster/slower diffusion or shallower/steeper confinement, hinders the
transmission of infection. A physical explanation is provided by the theory.
Reduction to the simpler case of no home ranges is demonstrated. Effective
infection rates are calculated and it is shown how to use them in complex
systems consisting of dense populations.

discs. To date, these sources have not been studied comprehensively at the
longest far-infrared and shortest submillimetre wavelengths. This paper
presents Herschel SPIRE FTS spectroscopic observations toward 18 protoplanetary
discs, covering the entire 450-1540 GHz (666-195 $\mu$m) range at R~400-1300.
The spectra reveal clear detections of the dust continuum and, in six targets,
a significant amount of spectral line emission primarily attributable to
$^{12}$CO rotational lines. Other targets exhibit little to no detectable
spectral lines. Low signal-to-noise detections also include signatures from
$^{13}$CO, [CI] and HCN. For completeness, we present upper limits of
non-detected lines in all targets, including low-energy transitions of H2O and
CH$^+$ molecules. The ten $^{12}$CO lines that fall within the SPIRE FTS bands
trace energy levels of ~50-500 K. Combined with lower and higher energy lines
from the literature, we compare the CO rotational line energy distribution with
detailed physical-chemical models, for sources where these are available and
published. Our 13CO line detections in the disc around Herbig Be star HD 100546
exceed, by factors of ~10-30, the values predicted by a model that matches a
wealth of other observational constraints, including the SPIRE $^{12}$CO
ladder. To explain the observed $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, it may be necessary
to consider the combined effects of optical depth and isotope selective
(photo)chemical processes. Considering the full sample of 18 objects, we find
that the strongest line emission is observed in discs around Herbig Ae/Be
stars, although not all show line emission. In addition, two of the six T Tauri
objects exhibit detectable $^{12}$CO lines in the SPIRE range.

known that this inverse scattering problem is both ill posed and nonlinear. It
is common practice to overcome the ill posedness through the use of a penalty
method or Tikhonov regularization. Here, we present a more physical
regularization, based simply on restricting the unknown boundary to be
band-limited in a suitable sense. To overcome the nonlinearity of the problem,
we use a variant of Newton's method. When multiple frequency data is available,
we supplement Newton's method with the recursive linearization approach due to
Chen.

chemical systems due to an instability of the homogeneous steady state. The
type of the instability usually prescribes the resulting spatio-temporal
patterns and their characteristic length scales. However, patterns resulting
from the simultaneous occurrence of instabilities cannot be expected to be
simple superposition of the patterns associated with the considered
instabilities. To address this issue we design two simple models composed by
two asymmetrically coupled equations of non-conserved (Swift-Hohenberg
equations) or conserved (Cahn-Hilliard equations) order parameters with
different characteristic wave lengths. The patterns arising in these systems
range from coexisting static patterns of different wavelengths to traveling
waves. A linear stability analysis allows to derive a two parameter phase
diagram for the studied models, in particular revealing for the Swift-Hohenberg
equations a co-dimension two bifurcation point of Turing and wave instability
and a region of coexistence of stationary and traveling patterns. The nonlinear
dynamics of the coupled evolution equations is investigated by performing
accurate numerical simulations. These reveal more complex patterns, ranging
from traveling waves with embedded Turing patterns domains to spatio-temporal
chaos, and a wide hysteretic region, where waves or Turing patterns coexist.
For the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations the presence of an weak coupling is
sufficient to arrest the coarsening process and to lead to the emergence of
purely periodic patterns. The final states are characterized by domains with a
characteristic length, which diverges logarithmically with the coupling
amplitude.

events, but could not distinguish between multiple heating events on a single
strand, or multiple strands each experiencing a single heating event. We
present here a similar study, but with EUV data of Active Region 11520 from the
High Resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) sounding rocket. Hi- C provides an order
of magnitude improvement to the spatial resolution of XRT, and a cooler
temperature sensitivity, which combine to provide significant improvements to
our ability to detect and model microflare activity around active regions. We

for Sc, Ti, V, Fe and Mo isotopes for $E_\gamma<4$ MeV. This enhancement was
not observed in subsequent analyses on Sn isotopes, but a Pygmy Dipole

$\gamma$-ray strength functions measured for Cd isotopes exhibit both features
over the range of isotopes, with the low-energy enhancement decreasing- and PDR
strength increasing as a function of neutron number. This suggests a
transitional region for the onset of low-energy enhancement, and also that the
PDR strength depends on the number of neutrons. The $\gamma$-ray strength
functions of $^{105-108}$Pd have been measured in order to further explore the
proposed transitional region. Experimental data were obtained at the Oslo
Cyclotron Laboratory by using the charged particle reactions ($^{3}$He,
$^{3}$He$^{\prime}\gamma$) and ($^{3}$He, $\alpha$$\gamma$) on $^{106,108}$Pd
target foils. Particle$-\gamma$ coincidence measurements provided information
on initial excitation energies and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray spectra,
which were used to extract the level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength
functions according to the Oslo method. The $\gamma$-ray strength functions
indicate a sudden increase in magnitude for $E_{\gamma}>4$ MeV, which is
interpreted as a PDR centered at $E_{\gamma}\approx8$ MeV. An enhanced
$\gamma$-ray strength at low energies is also observed for $^{105}$Pd, which is
the lightest isotope measured in this work. Further, the results correspond and
agree very well with the observations from the Cd isotopes, and support the
suggested transitional region for the onset of low-energy enhancement with
decreasing mass number. The neutron number dependency of the PDR strength is

detail and insight to important questions in chemical physics that cannot be

is insufficient, as researchers must be able to transform the data in a
simulation trajectory into specific scientific insights. Although this analysis

large-scale simulations become increasingly routine. In this perspective, we
discuss the application of Markov models to the analysis of large-scale

sites. Quantifying the effects of 'linked selection' on levels of genetic
diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null
model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of
natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers
parameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection
and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations
and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and
recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples
using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach
yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To
illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing
data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity
levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction
of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They
allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of
selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive
sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a
substantial effect of linked selection from non-classic sweeps. More generally,
we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing
diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than

the spin-$1/2$ system behaves quite differently from the harmonic system in
that they obey two typical quantum statistics, the efficiencies at maximum
power based on these two different kinds of quantum systems are bounded from
the upper side by the same expression of the efficiency at maximum power:
$\eta_{mp}\leq\eta_+\equiv \eta_C^2/[\eta_C-(1-\eta_C)\ln(1-\eta_C)]$, with
$\eta_C=1-T_c/T_h$ the Carnot efficiency, which displays the same universality

calculate the Onsager coefficients and, we show that the value of $\eta_{CA}$

in the past decades. The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
provides a unique means to deduce outflow velocities at coronal heights via
direct Doppler shift measurements of coronal emission lines. Such direct
Doppler shift measurements were not possible with previous spectrometers. We
measure the outflow velocity at coronal heights in several on-disk
long-duration plumes, which are located in coronal holes and show significant
blue shifts throughout the entire observational period. In one case, a plume is
measured 4 hours apart. The deduced outflow velocities are consistent,
suggesting that the flows are quasi-steady. Furthermore, we provide an outflow
velocity profile along the plumes, finding that the velocity corrected for the
line-of-sight effect can reach 10 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.02 $R_{\odot}$, 15 km
s$^{-1}$ at 1.03 $R_{\odot}$, and 25 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.05 $R_{\odot}$. This
clear signature of steady acceleration, combined with the fact that there is no
significant blue shift at the base of plumes, provides an important constraint
on plume models. At the height of 1.03 $R_{\odot}$, EIS also deduced a density
of 1.3$\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$, resulting in a proton flux of about
4.2$\times10^9$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ scaled to 1AU, which is an order of magnitude
higher than the proton input to a typical solar wind if a radial expansion is
assumed. This suggests that, coronal hole plumes may be an important source of
the solar wind.

use the coordinate time itself as a parameter. The relation between relative

very simple equation to show how the inhibitors in particular, can switch off
certain areas, to allow other areas to become the prominent ones and thereby
define the current brain state. This allows for a small amount of control over
what appears to be a chaotic structure inside of the brain. It is attractive
because it is still mostly mechanical and therefore can be added as an
automatic process, or the modelling of that. The paper also describes how the
nested pattern structure can be used as a basic counting mechanism. Another
mathematical conclusion provides a basis for maintaining memory or concept
patterns. The self-organisation can space itself through automatic processes.
This might allow new neurons to be added in a more even manner and could help
to maintain the concept integrity. The process might also help with finding

conditions for the existence of optimal policies in the class of all randomized

the forward Kolmogorov equation in the form of conditional expectation, we show
that the finite-horizon optimal value function is the unique solution to the
optimality equation and obtain the existence of an optimal deterministic Markov
policy. For the constrained case, employing the technique of occupation
measures, we first give an equivalent characterization of the occupation
measures, and derive that for each occupation measure generated by a randomized
history-dependent policy, there exists an occupation measure generated by a
randomized Markov policy equal to it. Then using the compactness and convexity
of the set of all occupation measures, we obtain the existence of a
constrained-optimal randomized Markov policy. Moreover, the constrained
optimization problem is reformulated as a linear program, and the strong
duality between the linear program and its dual program is established.

We introduce a 'destroyeddisk' model to simulate the effect of direct disk

lifetimes in the domain of the rare R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, before a
fast evolution through the domain of the hotter extreme helium (EHe) stars.
Surface chemistries of the resulting giants are in partial agreement with the
observed abundances of RCB and EHe stars. The production of 3He, 18O and 19F

rates from binary-star population synthesis are consistent with present-day
numbers of RCBs and EHes, provided that the majority come from relatively
recent (< 2Gyr) star formation. However, most RCBs should be produced by CO-WD
+ low-mass HeWD mergers, with the He-WD having a mass in the range 0.20-0.35
Msolar. Whilst, previously, a high He-WD mass (> 0.40 Msolar) was required to
match the carbon-rich abundances of RCB stars, the 'destroyed-disk' model
yields a high-carbon product with He-WD mass > 0.30 Msolar, in better agreement

demonstrates that switching between these regimes occurs as a result of a

alternative theory has promoted a $L^{5/2}$ scaling, as would be the case for
cyclic boundary. In this paper we present results from simulation of the far
largest systems used so far, up to side $L=160$ and find that this data clearly

for displaying voltage and current variables. With this powerful means of
investigation, he first studies the phenomena of the arc then used for the
coastal and urban lighting and then, the singing arc used as a transmitter of
radio waves in wireless telegraphy. In 1905, he highlights a new type of
non-sinusoidal oscillations in the singing arc. Twenty years later, Balthasar
van der Pol will recognize that such oscillations were in fact ""relaxation
oscillations"". To explain this phenomenon, he uses a representation in the
phase plane and shows that its evolution takes the form of small cycles. During
World War I the triode gradually replaces the singing arc in transmission
systems. At the end of the war, using analogy, Blondel transposes to the triode
most of the results he had obtained for the singing arc. In April 1919, he
publishes a long memoir in which he introduces the terminology ""self-sustained
oscillations"" and proposes to illustrate this concept starting from the example
of the Tantalus cup which is then picked up by Van der Pol and Philippe Le
Corbeiller. He then provides the definition of a self sustained system which is
quite similar to that given later by Aleksandr Andronov and Van der Pol. To
study the stability of oscillations sustained by the triode and by the singing
arc he uses, this time, a representation in the complex plane and he expresses
the amplitude in polar coordinates. He then justifies the maintaining of
oscillations by the existence cycles which nearly present all the features of
Poincar\'e's limit cycles. Finally, in November 1919, Blondel performs, a year
before Van der Pol, the setting in equation of the triode oscillations. In
March 1926, Blondel establishes the differential equation characterizing the
oscillations of the singing arc, completely similar to that obtained
concomitantly by Van der Pol for the triode. Thus, throughout his career,
Blondel, has made fundamental and relatively unknown contributions to the
development of the theory of nonlinear oscillations. The purpose of this
article is to analyze his main work in this area and to measure their
importance or influence by placing them in the perspective of the development
of this theory.
