superconductors based on the Jacobs and Rebbi variation method using
Ginzburg-Landau theory. With one condensation, we get attraction interaction
between the vortices for type I and repulsion for type II superconductors. With
two condensation states such as Mg B_{2} superconductors the behavior is quite
different. There is attraction at large distances and repulsion when the
vortices are close to each other. A stability point at distance
2.7/{\lambda}_{1} is obtained. In the case of three condensation states such as
iron based superconductors,we see different behavior depending on penetration
depth and correlation length. The formation energy of a vortex with three
condensation states is larger than the one with one condensation state with
comparable penetration and correlation length. We obtain two stability points
for the superconductors with three condensation states.

periodic case, the Galerkin Fock matrix is shown to have the three-level block
circulant structure, that allows the FFT-based diagonalization. The proposed
tensor techniques manifest the twofold benefits: (a) the entries of the Fock

low-rank tensor representation of arising multidimensional functions. Lattice
type systems in a box with open boundary conditions are treated by our previous

mechanical stability and acoustic transmission of granular media. However,
despite their relevance for predicting bulk properties of materials, there is
no agreement on a quantitative description of force chains. Consequently, it is
difficult to compare the force-chain structures in different materials or
experimental conditions. To address this challenge, we treat granular materials
as spatially-embedded networks in which the nodes (particles) are connected by
weighted edges that represent contact forces. We use techniques from community
detection, which is a type of clustering, to find sets of closely connected
particles. By using a geographical null model that is constrained by the
particles' contact network, we extract chain-like structures that are
reminiscent of force chains. We propose three diagnostics to measure these
chain-like structures, and we demonstrate the utility of these diagnostics for
identifying and characterizing classes of force-chain network architectures in
various materials. To illustrate our methods, we describe how force-chain
architecture depends on pressure for two very different types of packings: (1)
ones derived from laboratory experiments and (2) ones derived from idealized,
numerically-generated frictionless packings. By resolving individual force
chains, we quantify statistical properties of force-chain shape and strength,
which are potentially crucial diagnostics of bulk properties (including
material stability). These methods facilitate quantitative comparisons between
different particulate systems, regardless of whether they are measured
experimentally or numerically.

Extended Theories of Gravity. In particular, we take into account models
derived from $f(R)$ and $f(\cal G)$ extensions of General Relativity where
functions of the Ricci curvature invariant $R$ and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant
${\cal G}$ are respectively considered. Dense matter in magnetic mean field,
generated by magnetic properties of particles, is described by assuming a model
with three meson fields and baryons octet. As result, the considerable
increasing of maximal mass of neutron stars can be achieved by cubic
corrections in $f(R)$ gravity. In principle, massive stars with $M> 4
M_{\odot}$ can be obtained. On the other hand, stable stars with high
strangeness fraction (with central densities $\rho_{c}\sim 1.5-2.0$
GeV/fm$^{3}$) are possible considering quadratic corrections of $f(\cal {G})$
gravity. The magnetic field strength in the star center is of order $6-8\times
10^{18}$ G. In general, we can say that other branches of massive neutron stars
are possible considering the extra pressure contributions coming from gravity
extensions. Such a feature can constitute both a probe for alternative theories
and a way out to address anomalous self-gravitating compact systems.

suitable combinatorial structure inside the decomposition, and then embed the
tree $T$ into $G$ using this structure. Since for sparse graphs $G$, the
decomposition given by the regularity lemma is not helpful, we use a more
general decomposition technique. We show that each graph can be decomposed into
vertices of huge degree, regular pairs (in the sense of the regularity lemma),
and two other objects each exhibiting certain expansion properties. In this

$\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. We are concerned with the acoustic scattering
problem with a very large number of obstacles, as $M:=M(a):=O(a^{-1})$,
$a\rightarrow 0$, when they are arbitrarily distributed in $\Omega$ with a
minimum distance between them of the order $d:=d(a):=O(a^t)$ with $t$ in an
appropriate range. We show that the acoustic farfields corresponding to the
scattered waves by this collection of obstacles, taken to be soft obstacles,
converge uniformly in terms of the incident as well the propagation directions,
to the one corresponding to an acoustic refraction index as $a\rightarrow 0$.
This refraction index is given as a product of two coefficients $C$ and $K$,
where the first one is related to the geometry of the obstacles (precisely
their capacitance) and the second one is related to the local distribution of
these obstacles. In addition, we provide explicit error estimates, in terms of
$a$, in the case when the obstacles are locally the same (i.e. have the same
capacitance, or the coefficient $C$ is piecewise constant) in $\Omega$ and the
coefficient $K$ is H$\ddot{\mbox{o}}$lder continuous. These approximations can
be applied, in particular, to the theory of acoustic materials for the design
of refraction indices by perforation using either the geometry of the holes,

as a classification system for patterns represented as labeled graphs. However,
since ODSE is founded on the dissimilarity space representation of the input
data, the classifier can be easily adapted to any input domain where it is
possible to define a meaningful dissimilarity measure. Here we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the ODSE classifier for sequences by considering an
application dealing with the recognition of the solubility degree of the
Escherichia coli proteome. Solubility, or analogously aggregation propensity,
is an important property of protein molecules, which is intimately related to
the mechanisms underlying the chemico-physical process of folding. Each protein
of our dataset is initially associated with a solubility degree and it is
represented as a sequence of symbols, denoting the 20 amino acid residues. The
herein obtained computational results, which we stress that have been achieved
with no context-dependent tuning of the ODSE system, confirm the validity and
generality of the ODSE-based approach for structured data classification.

indicates disk flaring and a possible pre-transitional evolutionary stage. We
present mid- and near-IR interferometric results collected with MIDI, AMBER and
PIONIER with the aim of constraining the spatial structure of the 0.1-10 AU
disk region and assess its possible multi-component structure. A two-component
disk model composed of an optically thin 2-AU wide inner disk and an outer
temperature-gradient disk starting at 5.6 AU reproduces well the observations.
This is an additional argument to the idea that group-I HAeBe inner disks could
be already in the disk-clearing transient stage. HD 139614 will become a prime
target for mid-IR interferometric imaging with the second-generation instrument
MATISSE of the VLTI.

The calculated carrier mobility for a graphene nanoribbon as a function of the

properties, such as lattice temperature, linear density, impurity scattering
strength, ribbon width, and correlation length for the line-edge roughness.
Analysis of non-equilibrium carrier distribution function confirms that the
difference between linear and nonlinear transport is due to sweeping electrons
from the right to left Fermi one through elastic scattering as well as moving
electrons from low to high-energy ones through field-induced heating. The
plasmons, as well as the electron-hole continuum are determined by both energy
gap and the magnetic field, showing very specific features, which have been

steady granular flows, including grain-size-dependent shear features, in a wide

cell. A related problem in granular flow is that of mechanically-induced creep,
in which shear deformation in one region of a granular medium fluidizes its
entirety, including regions far from the sheared zone, effectively erasing the
yield condition everywhere. This enables creep deformation when a force is
applied in the nominally quiescent region through an intruder such as a
cylindrical or spherical probe. We show that the nonlocal fluidity model is
capable of capturing this phenomenology. Specifically, we explore creep of a
circular intruder in a two-dimensional annular Couette cell and show that the

faster-than-linear increase in the creep speed with the force applied to the

adaptive finite element methods with isotropic h-refinements. It is known from
the seminal work of Binev, Dahmen, DeVore and Petrushev that such classes are
related to Besov spaces. The range of parameters for which the inverse
embedding results hold is rather limited, and recently, Gaspoz and Morin have
shown, among other things, that this limitation disappears if we replace Besov
spaces by suitable approximation spaces associated to finite element
approximation from uniformly refined triangulations. We call the latter spaces
*multievel approximation spaces*, and argue that these spaces are placed
naturally halfway between adaptive approximation classes and Besov spaces, in
the sense that it is more natural to relate multilevel approximation spaces
with either Besov spaces or adaptive approximation classes, than to go directly
from adaptive approximation classes to Besov spaces. In particular, we prove
embeddings of multilevel approximation spaces into adaptive approximation
classes, complementing the inverse embedding theorems of Gaspoz and Morin.
  Furthermore, in the present paper, we initiate a theoretical study of
adaptive approximation classes that are defined using a modified notion of
error, the so-called *total error*, which is the energy error plus an
oscillation term. Such approximation classes have recently been shown to arise
naturally in the analysis of adaptive algorithms. We first develop a
sufficiently general approximation theory framework to handle such
modifications, and then apply the abstract theory to second order elliptic
problems discretized by Lagrange finite elements, resulting in
characterizations of modified approximation classes in terms of memberships of
the problem solution and data into certain approximation spaces, which are in
turn related to Besov spaces.

considered. We find the phases consisting of an array of uncorrelated spin-1
clusters separated by singlet dimers. Except in the simplest case where the
cluster consists of a single $S=1$ spin, this type of ground state breaks the
translational symmetry spontaneously. Although the mechanism leading to this
type of ground state is the same as that in the isotropic case, it is
nonmagnetic or paramagnetic depending on the competition between two types of
anisotropy. We also find the N\'eel, period-doubled N\'eel, Haldane, and
large-$D$ phases, where the ground state is a single spin cluster of infinite
size equivalent to the spin-1 Heisenberg chain with alternating anisotropies.
The ground-state phase diagrams are determined for typical sets of parameters
by numerical analysis. In various limiting cases, the ground-state phase
diagrams are determined analytically. The low-temperature behaviors of magnetic
susceptibility and entropy are investigated to distinguish each phase by
observable quantities. The relationship of the present model with the
anisotropic rung-alternating ladder with spin-1/2 is also discussed.

posed on hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N=2,3$. The method uses traces of
bulk finite element functions on a surface embedded in a volumetric domain. The
bulk finite element space is defined on an octree grid which is locally refined
or coarsened depending on error indicators and estimated values of the surface
curvatures. The cartesian structure of the bulk mesh leads to easy and
efficient adaptation process, while the trace finite element method makes
fitting the mesh to the surface unnecessary. The number of degrees of freedom
involved in computations is consistent with the two-dimension nature of surface
PDEs. No parametrization of the surface is required; it can be given implicitly
by a level set function. In practice, a variant of the marching cubes method is
used to recover the surface with the second order accuracy. We prove the
optimal order of accuracy for the trace finite element method in $H^1$ and
$L^2$ surface norms for a problem with smooth solution and quasi-uniform mesh
refinement. Experiments with less regular problems demonstrate optimal
convergence with respect to the number of degrees of freedom, if grid
adaptation is based on an appropriate error indicator. The paper shows results
of numerical experiments for a variety of geometries and problems, including
advection-diffusion equations on surfaces. Analysis and numerical results of
the paper suggest that combination of cartesian adaptive meshes and the
unfitted (trace) finite elements provide simple, efficient, and reliable tool

electron-electron and spin fluctuation contributions have been suggested as
playing important roles in the microscopic mechanism for its superconductivity
(4-8). However, the lack of high quality single crystals has thus far prevented
systematic investigation of their transport properties (9). Here, we report a
careful study of transport and tunneling spectroscopy in epitaxial LTO thin
films. In the superconducting state, the energy gap was found to decrease as a
quadratic function of magnetic field. In the normal state, an unusual
magnetoresistance (MR) was observed where it changes from anisotropic positive
to isotropic negative as the temperature is increased. A constant charge
carrier concentration without any abrupt change in lattice parameters as a
function of temperature suggests that the isotropic MR stems from the
suppression of spin scattering/fluctuations, while the anisotropic term
originates from an orbital contribution. These observations point to an
important role strong correlations play in this unique superconductor.

continuous-time Lyapunov equation
$\underline{A}\underline{X}+\underline{X}\underline{A}^{T}=\underline{P}$,
where the coefficient matrices $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{P}$ are large,
symmetric banded matrices. The (sparsity) pattern of $\underline{A}$ describes
the interconnection structure of a large-scale interconnected system. Recently,
it has been shown that the entries of the solution $\underline{X}$ are
spatially localized or decaying away from a banded pattern. We show that the
decay of the entries of $\underline{X}$ is faster if the condition number of
$\underline{A}$ is smaller. By exploiting the decay of entries of
$\underline{X}$, we develop two computationally efficient methods for
approximating $\underline{X}$ by a banded matrix. For a well-conditioned and
sparse banded $\underline{A}$, the computational and memory complexities of the
methods scale linearly with the state dimension. We perform extensive numerical
experiments that confirm this, and that demonstrate the effectiveness of the
developed methods. The methods proposed in this paper can be generalized to
(sparsity) patterns of $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{P}$ that are more
general than banded matrices. The results of this paper open the possibility
for developing computationally efficient methods for approximating the solution
of the large-scale Riccati equation by a sparse matrix.

displacement of particles induced by the passage of an obstacle in a
two-dimensional incompressible and inviscid fluid. In addition to the
trajectories of individual particles, we also study their drift and the
corresponding total drift areas in the F\""oppl and Kirchhoff potential flow
models. Our findings, which are obtained numerically and in some regimes are
also supported by asymptotic analysis, are compared to the wakeless potential
flow which serves as a reference. We show that in the presence of the F\""oppl
vortex wake some of the particles follow more complicated trajectories
featuring a second loop. The appearance of an additional stagnation point in
the F\""oppl flow is identified as a source of this effect. It is also
demonstrated that, while the total drift area increases with the size of the
wake for large vortex strengths, it is actually decreased for small circulation
values. On the other hand, the Kirchhoff flow model is shown to have an
unbounded total drift area. By providing a systematic account of the wake
effects on the drift, the results of this study will allow for more accurate
modeling of hydrodynamic stirring.

converge uniformly at the same rate as $\sum(n\ln^m\!n)^{-2}$, where $m=1, 2,

several estimations and full asymptotics for Gregory's coefficients, for Cauchy

azimuthal anisotropy of open heavy-flavor hadrons in Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200~{\rm GeV}$. Explaining the simultaneously large suppression

heavy-flavor transport in the hot and dense medium, it is imperative to also
measure cold nuclear matter effects which affect the initial distribution of

also. While it is not yet possible to constrain the atmospheric states of small
planets such as the Earth or cold planets like Jupiter, this may become
practical in the coming decades and if so, it is of interest to determine what
we might infer from such measurements. Here we have constructed atmospheric
models of the Solar System planets from 0.4 - 15.5 microns that are consistent
with ground-based and satellite observations and from these calculate the
primary transit and secondary eclipse spectra (with respect to the Sun and
typical M-dwarfs) that would be observed by a 'remote observer', many light

infer about their atmospheres and compare these with the 'ground truths' in
order to assess: a) the inherent uncertainties in transit spectra observations;
b) the relative merits of primary transit and secondary eclipse spectra; and c)
the advantages of directly imaged spectra. We find that secondary eclipses
would not give sufficient information, but that primary transits give much
better determination. We find that a single transit of Jupiter in front of the
Sun could potentially be used to determine temperature and stratospheric
composition, but for the Earth the mean atmospheric composition could only be
determined if it were orbiting an M-dwarf. For both planets we note that direct
imaging with sufficient nulling of the light from the parent star provides the
best method of determining the atmospheric properties of such planets.

of integers $k,m,n$ such that $m\equiv n \pmod{2}$, we explicitly construct a
Brunnian embedding $f_{k,m,n}:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3 \rightarrow {\mathbb
R}^6$ such that the following theorem holds.
  Theorem: Any Brunnian embedding $f:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow
{\mathbb R}^6$ is isotopic to $f_{k,m,n}$ for some integers $k,m,n$ such that
$m\equiv n \pmod{2}$. Two embeddings $f_{k,m,n}$ and $f_{k',m',n'}$ are
isotopic if and only if $k=k'$, $m\equiv m' \pmod{2k}$ and $n\equiv n'
\pmod{2k}$.
  We use Haefliger's classification of embeddings $S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow
{\mathbb R}^6$ in our proof. The following corollary shows that the relation
between the embeddings $(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6$ and
$S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6$ is not trivial.
  Corollary: There exist embeddings $f:(S^2\times S^1)\sqcup S^3\rightarrow
{\mathbb R}^6$ and $g,g':S^3\sqcup S^3\rightarrow {\mathbb R}^6$ such that the
componentwise embedded connected sum $f\#g$ is isotopic to $f\#g'$ but $g$ is
not isotopic to $g'$.

well-understood in certain cases. Artin groups are closely related to Coxeter
groups. There is a faithful representation of a Coxeter group $W$ as a linear
reflection group on a real vector space $V$. The group acts properly and fixes
a union of hyperplanes. The $W$-action extends as the covering space action to
the complexified complement of these hyperplanes. The fundamental groups of the
complement and the orbit space are the pure Artin group and the Artin group
respectively. For the Artin groups of finite type Deligne proved that the
associated complement is aspherical. Using the Coxeter group data Salvetti gave
a construction of a cell complex which is a $W$-equivariant deformation retract
of the complement. This construction was independently generalized by Charney
and Davis to the Artin groups of infinite type. A lot of algebraic properties
of these groups were discovered using combinatorial and topological properties
of this cell complex.
  In this paper we represent a Coxeter group as a subgroup of diffeomorphisms
of a smooth manifold. These so-called Coxeter transformation groups fix a union
of codimension-$1$ (reflecting) submanifolds and permute the connected
components of the complement. Their action naturally extends to the tangent
bundle of the ambient manifold and fixes the union of tangent bundles of these
reflecting submanifolds. Fundamental group of the tangent bundle complement and
that of its quotient serve as the analogue of pure Artin group and Artin group
respectively. The main aim of this paper is to prove Salvetti's theorems in
this context. We show that the combinatorial data of the Coxeter transformation
group can be used to construct a cell complex homotopy equivalent to the
tangent bundle complement and that this homotopy equivalence is equivariant.

resulting in anisotropic inclusion structures with the formation of chains of
magnetite particles parallel to the faces of the layers. In one kind of
bilayers, a composite layer was formed on top of a resin layer while their

helicity, which helps to avert catastrophic quenching of the dynamo, and
advection of the large-scale magnetic field, which suppresses dynamo action.
For realistic galactic parameters, the net consequence of outflows being
stronger in the gaseous arms is higher saturation large-scale field strengths
in the interarm regions as compared to in the arms. By incorporating rather

study of previously reported modes that have also been observed in the

of ""magneto-rotons"" and the number is the same as the number of filled
effective Landau-like levels of composite fermions. The higher energy modes at
$\nu =1/3$ merge with the lowest mode at long-wavelength. The spin-conserving
modes do not merge at other filling factors. Apart from showing zero-energy
spin-wave mode at zero momentum, thanks to Larmor's theorem, the lowest
spin-reversed modes at the ferromagnetic ground states of $\nu=2/5$, 3/7, and
4/9 display one or more ""spin-rotons"" at negative energies signalling the
unstable fully polarized ground states at sufficiently small Zeeman energies.
The high energy spin-reversed modes also have spin-rotons but at positive
energies. The energies of these excitations depend on the finite width of the
quantum well as the Coulomb interaction gets screened. We determine finite
thickness correction to the Coulomb interaction by the standard method of local
density approximation and use them to calculate the critical energies such as
rotons, long-wavelength, and short-wavelength modes which are detectable in
inelastic light scattering experiments.

interspecies competition is weak, the island species are a sample of the
mainland species. For higher values of the competition parameter the system
still admit an equilibrium community, but now some of the mainland species are
absent on the island. Further increase in competition leads to an intermittent
""chaotic"" phase, where the dynamics is controlled by invadable combinations of
species and the turnover rate is governed by the migration. Finally, the strong
competition phase is glassy, dominated by uninvadable state and noise-induced
transitions. Our model contains, as a spatial case, the celebrated neutral
island theories of Wilson-MacArthur and Hubbell. Moreover, we show that slight

optimal base station (BS) density to reduce the network power consumption. In
contrast to previous works with similar purpose, we consider Poisson traffic
for users' traffic model. In such situation, each BS can be viewed as M/G/1
queuing model. Based on theory of stochastic geometry, we analyze users'
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and obtain the average
transmission time of each packet. While most of the previous works on SINR
analysis in academia considered full buffer traffic, our analysis provides a
basic framework to estimate the performance of cellular networks with burst
traffic. We find that the users' SINR depends on the average transmission
probability of BSs, which is defined by a nonlinear equation. As it is
difficult to obtain the closed-form solution, we solve this nonlinear equation
by bisection method. Besides, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize
the area power consumption. An iteration algorithm is proposed to derive the
local optimal BS density, and the numerical result shows that the proposed
algorithm can converge to the global optimal BS density. At the end, the impact
of BS density on users' SINR and average packet delay will be discussed.

significantly reduce the number of skeleton frames while maintaining a good

refractometric sensors based on whispering-gallery-modes. The devices under
test are optical microresonators made of silicon nitride on silicon oxide. In
our approach, these microresonators are vertically coupled to a buried
waveguide with the aim of creating integrated and cost-effective devices. The
optimization analysis is a delicate balance of resonance quality factor and
evanescent field overlap with the sorrounding environment to analyze. By
numerical simulations we show that the microdisk thickness is critical to yield
high figure of merit for the sensor, while edge inclination is less important.
We also show that figures of merit as high as 1600/RIU are feasible.

with rates $\tau_c^-{1}$ and $\tau_w^{-1}$ respectively. The mutual collisions
conserve momentum and are inelastic, with a coefficient of restitution $r$. The
velocity change of a particle with velocity $v$, due to driving, is taken to be
$\Delta v=-(1+r_w) v+\eta$, mimicking the collision with a vibrating wall,
where $r_w$ the coefficient of restitution of the particle with the ""wall"" and
$\eta$ is Gaussian white noise. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck driving mechanism given

the variance and the two-particle velocity correlation functions close. With
the exact formula for the variance we find that, for $r_w\ne-1$, the system
goes to a steady state. On the other hand, for $r_w=-1$, the system does not
have a steady state. Similarly, the system goes to a steady state for the

board the Herschel Space Observatory revealed that several asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars are surrounded by an asymmetric circumstellar envelope (CSE)
whose morphology is most likely caused by the interaction with a stellar
companion. The evolution of AGB stars in binary systems plays a crucial role in
understanding the formation of asymmetries in planetary nebul{\ae} (PNe), but
at present, only a handful of cases are known where the interaction of a
companion with the stellar AGB wind is observed.
  Aims. We probe the environment of the very evolved AGB star $\pi^1$ Gruis on
large and small scales to identify the triggers of the observed asymmetries.
  Methods. Observations made with Herschel/PACS at 70 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m
picture the large-scale environment of $\pi^1$ Gru. The close surroundings of
the star are probed by interferometric observations from the VLTI/AMBER
archive. An analysis of the proper motion data of Hipparcos and Tycho-2
together with the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data help identify the
possible cause for the observed asymmetry.
  Results. The Herschel/PACS images of $\pi^1$ Gru show an elliptical CSE whose
properties agree with those derived from a CO map published in the literature.
In addition, an arc east of the star is visible at a distance of
$38^{\prime\prime}$ from the primary. This arc is most likely part of an
Archimedean spiral caused by an already known G0V companion that is orbiting
the primary at a projected distance of 460 au with a period of more than 6200
yr. However, the presence of the elliptical CSE, proper motion variations, and
geometric modelling of the VLTI/AMBER observations point towards a third
component in the system, with an orbital period shorter than 10 yr, orbiting
much closer to the primary than the G0V star.

inflationary scale near Grand Unification scale if one considers single-field
inflationary models. On the other hand, Large Hadron Collider has observed the
elusive Higgs particle whose presently observed mass can lead to electroweak
vacuum instability at high scale $(\sim{\mathcal O}(10^{10})$ GeV). In this
article, we seek for a simple particle physics model which can simultaneously
keep the vacuum of the theory stable and yield high-scale inflation
successfully. To serve our purpose, we extend the Standard Model of particle
physics with a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauged symmetry which spontaneously breaks down
just above the inflationary scale. Such a scenario provides a constrained
parameter space where both the issues of vacuum stability and high-scale
inflation can be successfully accommodated. The threshold effect on the Higgs
quartic coupling due to the presence of the heavy inflaton field plays an
important role in keeping the electroweak vacuum stable. Furthermore, this
scenario is also capable of reheating the universe at the end of inflation.
Though the issues of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which dominate the late-time
evolution of our universe, cannot be addressed within this framework, this
model successfully describes the early universe dynamics according to the Big
Bang model.

(GRBs) is of great importance to correctly interpreting the physical mechanisms
that produce the underlying event as well as the structure of the relativistic
jet from which the emission emanates. Time-resolved analysis of these spectra
is the main method of extracting information from the data. In this work,
several techniques for temporal binning of GRB spectra are examined to
understand the systematics associated with each with the goal of finding the
best method(s) to bin lightcurves for analysis. The following binning methods
are examined: constant cadence (CC), Bayesian blocks (BB), signal-to-noise
(S/N) and Knuth bins (KB). I find that both the KB and BB methods reconstruct
the intrinsic spectral evolution accurately while the S/N method fails in most
cases. The CC method is accurate when the cadence is not too coarse but does
not necessarily bin the data based on the true source variability.
Additionally, the integrated pulse properties are investigated and compared to
the time-resolved properties. If intrinsic spectral evolution is present then
the integrated properties are not useful in identifying physical and
cosmological properties of GRBs without knowing the physical emission mechanism
and its evolution.

bremsstrahlung is detected in four out of six fields. X-rays for the nucleus

density, and the density of accelerated electrons for the nucleus and each part

3.9x10^6 M. The possibility that the thermal gas is injected into the jet from
the black-hole is excluded because the nucleus and the field HST-1 do not
contain thermal components. It is possible that the interstellar medium is
compressed by the jet and is heated by the shock. The energy density of the gas
is comparable to that of the magnetic field with 1 mG. For the field D, a high
density of accelerated electrons of 1.5x10^11 (2 d / tval )^3 ( 6 / delta )^3 (

is a minimal vertex separator of least cardinality. A {\em clique} is a set of
mutually adjacent vertices. A 2-tree is a connected graph in which every
maximal clique is of size three and every minimal vertex separator is of size
two. A spanning tree of a graph $G$ is a connected and an acyclic subgraph of
$G$. In this paper, we focus our attention on two enumeration problems, both
from sequential and parallel perspective. In particular, we consider listing
all possible spanning trees of a 2-tree and listing all perfect elimination
orderings of a chordal graph. As far as enumeration of spanning trees is
concerned, our approach is incremental in nature and towards this end, we work
with the construction order of the 2-tree, i.e. enumeration of $n$-vertex trees
are from $n-1$ vertex trees, $n \geq 4$. Further, we also present a parallel
algorithm for spanning tree enumeration using $O(2^n)$ processors. To our
knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt in designing a parallel algorithm

faster rates for irregular error distributions concentrating sufficient mass

distributions. This result is remarkably different from corresponding results
in mean regression with regular errors. It can readily be applied to develop
goodness-of-fit tests for the error distribution. We present some examples and
investigate the small sample performance in a simulation study. We further
discuss asymptotically distribution-free hypotheses tests for independence of
the error distribution from the points of measurement and for monotonicity of

roughly the same features as for much lower temperature samples. This
demonstration in a relatively simple system opens new possibilities for
alternative routes to laser stabilization at the sub 100 mHz level and

the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere has been the recent subject of many
studies. This was made possible by the availability of high temporal and
spatial resolution observations of the solar photosphere, allowing large
numbers of magnetic elements to be tracked to study their dynamics. In this
work we exploit a long temporal series of seeing-free magnetograms of the solar
photosphere to study the effect of the turbulent convection in the excitation
of kink oscillations in magnetic elements. We make use of the empirical mode
decomposition technique (EMD) in order to study the transverse oscillations of
several magnetic flux tubes. This technique permits the analysis of
non-stationary time series like those associated to the horizontal velocities
of these flux tubes which are continuously advected and dispersed by granular
flows.
  Our primary findings reveal the excitation of low frequency modes of kink
oscillations, which are sub-harmonics of a fundamental mode with a $7.6 \pm
0.2$ minute periodicity. These results constitute a strong case for
observational proof of the excitation of kink waves by the buffeting of the
convection cells in the solar photosphere, and are discussed in light of their

estimated accurate rotational velocity values from asteroseismic analyses of
main sequence stars observed by Kepler. The rotational frequency splittings of
the detected solar-like oscillations of these stars are determined largely by
the near-surface rotation. These estimates have been used to infer the
macroturbulence values for 28 Kepler stars. Out of this sample, 26 stars were

interpreting the physical implications of spacetime diffeomorphism invariance
in General Relativity. However, the alternative formulation of classical
General Relativity known as Shape Dynamics suggest that a subset of spacetime
diffeomorphisms - namely hypersurface deformations - are, in a certain sense,
dual to spatial conformal (or Weyl) invariance. Moreover, holographic
gauge/gravity dualities suggest that bulk spacetime diffeomorphism invariance
can be replaced by the properties of boundary CFTs. How can these new
frameworks be compatible with the traditional notion of reference frame so
fundamental to our interpretation of General Relativity? In this paper, we
address this question by investigating the classical case of maximally
symmetric spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant. We find that it is
possible to define a notion of ""Shape Observer"" that represents a conformal
reference frame that is dual to the notion of inertial reference frame in
spacetime. We then provide a precise dictionary relating the two notions. These
Shape Observers are holographic in the sense that they are defined on the
asymptotic conformal boundaries of spacetime but know about bulk physics. This
leads to a first principles derivation of an exact classical holographic
correspondence that can easily be generalized to more complicated situations
and may lead to insights regarding the interpretation of the conformal
invariance manifest in Shape Dynamics.

stochastic $Q$-trace-class stochastic forcing in two spatial dimensions. This
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) is used as a test case to
understand, how numerical continuation methods can be carried over to the SPDE
setting. First, we compute the deterministic bifurcation diagram for the PDE,
i.e. without stochastic forcing. In this case, two locally asymptotically
stable steady state solution branches exist upon variation of the linear
damping term. Then we consider the Lyapunov operator equation for the locally
linearized system around steady states for the SPDE. We discretize the full
SPDE using a combination of finite-differences and spectral noise approximation
obtaining a finite-dimensional system of stochastic ordinary differential
equations (SODEs). The large system of SODEs is used to approximate the
Lyapunov operator equation via covariance matrices. The covariance matrices are
numerically continued along the two bifurcation branches. We show that we can
quantify the stochastic fluctuations along the branches. We also demonstrate
scaling laws near branch and fold bifurcation points. Furthermore, we perform
computational tests to show that, even with a sub-optimal computational setup,
we can quantify the subexponential-timescale fluctuations near the
deterministic steady states upon stochastic forcing on a standard desktop
computer setup. Hence, the proposed method for numerical continuation of SPDEs
has the potential to allow for rapid parametric uncertainty quantification of
spatio-temporal stochastic systems.

(UCAC4) in combination with photometry from the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky
Survey (APASS) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) to identify stars within
25 pc of the Sun. A sample of nearby stars with accurate trigonometric
parallaxes from the Research Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) is used to
generate a set of 16 new photometric color-$M_{K{_s}}$ relations that provide
distance estimates with uncertainties of 15\%. This work expands the available
suites of well-calibrated photometric distance relations that can be used to
identify nearby stellar systems.
  The distance relations are used with quality cuts to extract an initial
sample of stars from the UCAC4 estimated to be within 25 pc. Color, proper
motion and existing literature sources are then used to obtain a clean sample
of red dwarfs, while limiting the amount of contamination from background
giants, resulting in a sample of 1761 candidate nearby stars within 25 pc. Of
these, 339 are new discoveries with no previously known published parallax or
distance estimate, primarily with proper motions less than 0.2 arcsec/year.
Five stars are estimated to be within 10 pc, with the nearest, TYC 3980 1081 1
with V$=$ 10.50, estimated to be at 5.93 pc. That several hundred new stars
have been revealed so close to the Sun illustrates once again that there is
considerable work yet to be done to map the solar neighborhood, and that
additional nearby stars are likely still to be discovered.

adapted to the underlying geometrical structure of the $x_i$, has finitely many

This construction follows the ideas of Hammond et al. (2011), with the key
point that we construct a tight (or Parseval) frame. This means we have a very
simple, explicit reconstruction formula for every function $f$ defined on the
graph from the coefficients given by its scalar product with the frame
elements. We use this representation in the setting of denoising where we are
given noisy observations of a function $f$ defined on the graph. By applying a
thresholding method to the coefficients in the reconstruction formula, we
define an estimate of $f$ whose risk satisfies a tight oracle inequality.

atmosphere must rely on solutions to the vector Radiative Transport Equation
(vRTE). Monte Carlo integration of the vRTE is a valuable approach for its
flexible treatment of complex viewing and/or illumination geometries and
because it can intuitively incorporate elaborate physics. Aims. We present a
novel Pre-Conditioned Backward Monte Carlo (PBMC) algorithm for solving the
vRTE and apply it to planetary atmospheres irradiated from above. As classical
BMC methods, our PBMC algorithm builds the solution by simulating the photon
trajectories from the detector towards the radiation source, i.e. in the
reverse order of the actual photon displacements. Methods. We show that the
neglect of polarisation in the sampling of photon propagation directions in
classical BMC algorithms leads to unstable and biased solutions for
conservative, optically-thick, strongly-polarising media such as Rayleigh
atmospheres. The numerical difficulty is avoided by pre-conditioning the
scattering matrix with information from the scattering matrices of prior (in
the BMC integration order) photon collisions. Pre-conditioning introduces a
sense of history in the photon polarisation states through the simulated
trajectories. Results. The PBMC algorithm is robust and its accuracy is
extensively demonstrated via comparisons with examples drawn from the
literature for scattering in diverse media. Since the convergence rate for MC
integration is independent of the integral's dimension, the scheme is a
valuable option for estimating the disk-integrated signal of stellar radiation
reflected from planets. Such a tool is relevant in the prospective
investigation of exoplanetary phase curves. We lay out two frameworks for disk
integration and, as an application, explore the impact of atmospheric
stratification on planetary phase curves...

distribution, which can be modelled using a standard multi-temperature
accretion disc, where the disc temperature and radius follow a power-law
relation. Standard accretion disc theory predicts the power law exponent to be
-3/4, and this yields, perhaps surprisingly, acceptable fits to our SED. Given
that the source is a persistent X-ray source, it is however likely that the
accretion disc temperature distribution is produced by X-ray heating,
regardless of its radial dependence. Furthermore, we find no evidence for any
emission from the secondary star at any wavelength. However, adding a secondary
component to our model allows us to derive a 99\% lower limit of 14 or 15 kpc
based on Monte Carlo simulations and using either an evolved K2 or G2V
secondary star respectively. In $>$60\% of cases the distance is $>$80kpc. Such
large distances favor models with a massive ($>$15 M$_{\odot}$) black hole
primary. Our quasi-simultaneous J and V-band time-series photometry, together
with the SED, reveals that the optical/NIR emission must originate in the same
region i.e. the accretion disc. The likely extreme mass ratio supports
suggestions that the accretion disc must be precessing which, depending on the
length of the precession period, could play a major part in explaining the
variety of optical light curve shapes obtained over the last two decades.

robust counter-propagating edge modes. It remains unclear how ubiquitously such
anomalous modes can appear, and what dictates their robustness against
disorder. Here we shed further light on the nature of these modes by analyzing
a simple type of periodic driving where the hopping along one spatial direction
is modulated sinusoidally with time while the hopping along the other spatial
direction is kept constant. We obtain the phase diagram for the quasienergy
spectrum at flux 1/3 as the driving frequency $\omega$ and the hopping
anisotropy are varied. A series of topologically distinct phases with
counter-propagating edge modes appear due to the harmonic driving, similar to
the case of a periodically kicked system studied earlier. We analyze the time
dependence of the pair of Floquet edge states localized at the same edge, and
compare their Fourier components in the frequency domain. In the limit of small
modulation, one of the Floquet edge mode within the pair can be viewed as the
edge mode originally living in the other energy gap shifted in quasienergy by
$\hbar \omega$, i.e., by absorption or emission of a ""photon"" of frequency
$\omega$. Our result suggests that counter-propagating Floquet edge modes are
generic features of periodically driven integer quantum Hall systems, and not
tied to any particular driving protocol. It also suggests that the Floquet edge
modes would remain robust to any static perturbations that do not destroy the
chiral edge modes of static quantum Hall states.

dynamics are written in a multi-symplectic form using the Lagrangian mass
coordinate $m$ and time $t$ as independent variables, and in which the Eulerian
position of the fluid element $x=x(m,t)$ is one of the dependent variables.
This approach differs from the Eulerian, multi-symplectic approach using
Clebsch variables. Lagrangian constraints are used to specify equations for
$x_m$, $x_t$ and $S_t$ consistent with the Lagrangian map, where $S$ is the
entropy of the gas.
  We require $S_t=0$ corresponding to advection of the entropy $S$ with the
flow. We show that the Lagrangian Hamiltonian equations are related to the de
Donder-Weyl multi-momentum formulation. The pullback conservation laws and the
symplecticity conservation laws are discussed. The pullback conservation laws
correspond to invariance of the action with respect to translations in time
(energy conservation) and translations in $m$ in Noether's theorem. The
conservation law due to $m$-translation invariance gives rise to a novel
nonlocal conservation law involving the Clebsch variable $r$ used to impose
$\partial S(m,t)/\partial t=0$.

The mechanisms that form extreme bipolar planetary nebulae remain
unclear. Aims. The physical properties, structure, and dynamics of the bipolar
planetary nebula, MyCn 18, are investigated in detail with the aim of
understanding the shaping mechanism and evolutionary history of this object.
Methods. VLT infrared images, VLT ISAAC infrared spectra, and long-slit optical
Echelle spectra are used to investigate MyCn 18. Morpho-kinematic modelling was
used to firmly constrain the structure and kinematics of the source. A
timescale analysis was used to determine the kinematical age of the nebula and
its main components. Results. A spectroscopic study of MyCn 18's central and
offset region reveals the detailed make-up of its nebular composition.
Molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, and Bracket gamma emission are detected from
the central regions of MyCn 18. ISAAC spectra from a slit position along the
narrow waist of the nebula demonstrate that the ionised gas resides closer to
the centre of the nebula than the molecular emission. A kinematical age of the
nebula and its components were obtained by the P-V arrays and timescale
analysis. Conclusions. The structure and kinematics of MyCn 18 are better
understood using an interactive 3-D modelling tool called shape. A dimensional
and timescale analysis of MyCn 18's major components provides a possible
mechanism for the nebula's asymmetry. The putative central star is somewhat
offset from the geometric centre of the nebula, which is thought to be the
result of a binary system. We speculate that the engulfing and destruction of
an exoplanet during the AGB phase may have been a key event in shaping MyCn 18
and generating of its hypersonic knotty outflow.

for synchrotron radiation separate for this configuration, and the intensities
and polarization values for sources that are uniform on large scales can be
found straightforwardly in the case where opacity is significant. Although the
emission and absorption coefficients must, in general, be obtained numerically,
the process is much simpler than a full numerical solution to the transfer
equations. Some illustrative results are given and an interesting effect,
whereby the polarization increases while the magnetic field distribution
becomes less strongly confined to the plane of compression, is discussed.
  The results are of importance for the interpretation of polarization near the
edges of lobes in radio galaxies and of bright features in the parsec--scale
jets of AGN, where such magnetic field configurations are believed to exist.

characterize due to their complexity and relatively low strength. The
polarization signature amplitudes are proportional to the field strength, and
current studies of cool star magnetic fields are using circular polarization
only since linear polarization is even weaker. However, circular polarization
is only sensitive to the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field, meaning
that many structural features are not recovered or may be misinterpreted when
only circular polarization is used for reconstruction of stellar magnetic
topologies. Linear polarization, on the other hand, is sensitive to the
transverse component of the magnetic field and would provide a more complete
picture of the magnetic field topology if combined with circular polarization.
We have identified the first cool target, the RS CVn star II~Peg, suitable for
full Stokes vector analysis. Using current instrumentation, we have succeeded
in systematically detecting its linear polarization signatures with a precision
and rotational phase coverage sufficient for magnetic mapping. Here we present
the very first temperature and magnetic field maps reconstructed for a cool

bounds for several instances of this question, for the minimum length of
topologically non-trivial closed curves, pants decompositions, and cut graphs
with a given combinatorial map in triangulated combinatorial surfaces (or their
dual cross-metric counterpart).
  Our work builds upon Riemannian systolic inequalities, which bound the
minimum length of non-trivial closed curves in terms of the genus and the area
of the surface. We first describe a systematic way to translate Riemannian
systolic inequalities to a discrete setting, and vice-versa. This implies a
conjecture by Przytycka and Przytycki from 1993, a number of new systolic
inequalities in the discrete setting, and the fact that a theorem of Hutchinson
on the edge-width of triangulated surfaces and Gromov's systolic inequality for
surfaces are essentially equivalent. We also discuss how these proofs
generalize to higher dimensions.
  Then we focus on topological decompositions of surfaces. Relying on ideas of
Buser, we prove the existence of pants decompositions of length
O(g^{3/2}n^{1/2}) for any triangulated combinatorial surface of genus g with n
triangles, and describe an O(gn)-time algorithm to compute such a
decomposition.
  Finally, we consider the problem of embedding a cut graph (or more generally
a cellular graph) with a given combinatorial map on a given surface. Using
random triangulations, we prove (essentially) that, for any choice of a
combinatorial map, there are some surfaces on which any cellular embedding with
that combinatorial map has length superlinear in the number of triangles of the
triangulated combinatorial surface. There is also a similar result for graphs
embedded on polyhedral triangulations.

state that is oblivious to the presence of other impurities. The competition
between these effects leads to a critical distance above which Kondo effect
dominates, translating into a finite range for the RKKY interaction. We study
this mechanism on the square and cubic lattices by introducing an exact mapping
onto an effective one-dimensional problem that we can solve with the density
matrix renormalization group method (DMRG). We show a clear departure from the

for focusing on convex relaxations are: (a) they come with a certificate of
optimality, and (b) they are generic tools which are relatively parameter-free,
not tailored to specific assumptions over the input. More precisely, we
consider the distributional setting where there are $k$ clusters in
$\mathbb{R}^m$ and data from each cluster consists of $n$ points sampled from a
symmetric distribution within a ball of unit radius. We ask: what is the
minimal separation distance between cluster centers needed for convex
relaxations to exactly recover these $k$ clusters as the optimal integral
solution? For the $k$-median linear programming relaxation we show a tight
bound: exact recovery is obtained given arbitrarily small pairwise separation
$\epsilon > 0$ between the balls. In other words, the pairwise center
separation is $\Delta > 2+\epsilon$. Under the same distributional model, the
$k$-means LP relaxation fails to recover such clusters at separation as large
as $\Delta = 4$. Yet, if we enforce PSD constraints on the $k$-means LP, we get
exact cluster recovery at center separation $\Delta > 2\sqrt2(1+\sqrt{1/m})$.
In contrast, common heuristics such as Lloyd's algorithm (a.k.a. the $k$-means
algorithm) can fail to recover clusters in this setting; even with arbitrarily
large cluster separation, k-means++ with overseeding by any constant factor
fails with high probability at exact cluster recovery. To complement the
theoretical analysis, we provide an experimental study of the recovery
guarantees for these various methods, and discuss several open problems which
these experiments suggest.

  71 - 82",,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Covariance matrix estimation arises in multivariate problems including
multivariate normal sampling models and regression models where random effects
are jointly modeled, e.g. random-intercept, random-slope models. A Bayesian
analysis of these problems requires a prior on the covariance matrix. Here we
assess, through a simulation study and a real data set, the impact this prior
choice has on posterior inference of the covariance matrix.
  Inverse Wishart distribution is the natural choice for a covariance matrix
prior because its conjugacy on normal model and simplicity, is usually
available in Bayesian statistical software. However inverse Wishart
distribution presents some undesirable properties from a modeling point of
view. It can be too restrictive because assume the same amount of prior
information about every variance parameters and, more important, it shows a
prior relationship between the variances and correlations.
  Some alternatives distributions has been proposed. The scaled inverse Wishart
distribution, which give more flexibility on the variance priors conserving the
conjugacy property but does not eliminate the prior relationship between
variances and correlations. Secondly, it is possible to fit separate priors for
individual correlations and standard deviations. This strategy eliminates any
prior relationship within the covariance matrix parameters, but it is not
conjugate and therefore computationally slow.

transportation networks (in terms of travelling time), where the speed in
several of the network's roads is a function of the time interval. The main
contribution of the paper is a procedure that is faster compared to the
conventional approaches, that derives the road's traversal time according to
the time instant of departure, for the case where the road's speed has a
constant value inside each time interval (in general, different value for each
time interval). Furthermore, the case where the road's speed is a linear
function of time inside each time interval (in general, different linear
function for each time interval) is investigated. A procedure that derives the
road's traversal time according to the time instant of departure is proposed
for this case as well. The proposed procedures are combined with Dijkstra's
algorithm and the resulting algorithms, that are practically applicable and of
low complexity, provide optimal shortest path routing in the networks under
investigation.

  frictional slip",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When a frictional interface is subject to a localized shear load, it is often
(experimentally) observed that local slip events initiate at the stress
concentration and propagate over parts of the interface by arresting naturally
before reaching the edge. We develop a theoretical model based on linear
elastic fracture mechanics to describe the propagation of such precursory slip.
The model's prediction of precursor lengths as a function of external load is
in good quantitative agreement with laboratory experiments as well as with
dynamic simulations, and provides thereby evidence to recognize frictional slip
as a fracture phenomenon. We show that predicted precursor lengths depend,
within given uncertainty ranges, mainly on the kinetic friction coefficient,
and only weakly on other interface and material parameters. By simplifying the
fracture mechanics model we also reveal sources for the observed non-linearity
in the growth of precursor lengths as a function of the applied force. The
discrete nature of precursors as well as the shear tractions caused by
frustrated Poisson's expansion are found to be the dominant factors. Finally,
we apply our model to a different, symmetric set-up and provide a prediction of
the propagation distance of frictional slip for future experiments.
