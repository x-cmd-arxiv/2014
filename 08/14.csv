approach to state space modeling assuming that both the observational and

assume that the unknown evolutionary equation describes dynamic evolution of
some latent circular random variable.
  Based on appropriate kernel convolution of the standard Wiener process we
model the time-varying observational and evolutionary functions as suitable
Gaussian processes that take both linear and circular variables as arguments.
Additionally, for the time-varying evolutionary function, we wrap the Gaussian
process thus constructed around the unit circle to form an appropriate circular
Gaussian process. We show that our process thus created satisfies desirable
properties.
  For the purpose of inference we develop an MCMC based methodology combining
Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Applications to a simulated
data set, a real wind speed data set and a real ozone data set demonstrated
quite encouraging performances of our model and methodologies.

  Our O(log n/log w) bound is optimal for dynamic rank and select, matching a
lower bound of Fredman and Saks [STOC'89]. When the word length is large, our

the key steps in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis, commonly
referred to as the map-making problem. Some of the most popular and general
methods proposed for this problem involve solving generalised least squares
(GLS) equations with non-diagonal noise weights given by a block-diagonal
matrix with Toeplitz blocks. In this work we study new map-making solvers
potentially suitable for applications to the largest anticipated data sets.
They are based on iterative conjugate gradient (CG) approaches enhanced with
novel, parallel, two-level preconditioners. We apply the proposed solvers to
examples of simulated non-polarised and polarised CMB observations, and a set
of idealised scanning strategies with sky coverage ranging from nearly a full
sky down to small sky patches. We discuss in detail their implementation for
massively parallel computational platforms and their performance for a broad
range of parameters characterising the simulated data sets. We find that our
best new solver can outperform carefully-optimised standard solvers used today
by a factor of as much as 5 in terms of the convergence rate and a factor of up
to $4$ in terms of the time to solution, and to do so without significantly
increasing the memory consumption and the volume of inter-processor
communication. The performance of the new algorithms is also found to be more
stable and robust, and less dependent on specific characteristics of the
analysed data set. We therefore conclude that the proposed approaches are well
suited to address successfully challenges posed by new and forthcoming CMB data
sets.

of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) with hyperon cores, which can be
satisfied only by special models of hadronic matter. The radius-mass relation
for these models is sufficiently specific that it could be subjected to an
observational test with future X-ray observatories. We want to study the impact
of the presence of hyperon cores on the radius-mass relation for NS. We aim to
find out how, and for which particular stellar mass range, a specific relation
R(M), where M is the gravitational mass, and R is the circumferential radius,
is associated with the presence of a hyperon core.
  We consider a set of 14 theoretical EOS of dense matter, based on the
relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, allowing for the presence of
hyperons in NSs. We seek correlations between R(M) and the stiffness of the EOS
below the hyperon threshold needed to pass the 2 Msun test. For NS masses
1.0<M/Msun<1.6, we get R>13km, because of a very stiff pre-hyperon segment of
the EOS. At nuclear density, the pressure is significantly higher than a robust
upper bound obtained recently using chiral effective field theory.
  If massive NSs do have a sizable hyperon core, then according to current
models the radii for M=1.0-1.6 Msun are necessarily >13km. If, on the contrary,
a NS with a radius R<12 km is observed in this mass domain, then sizable
hyperon cores in NSs, as we model them now, are ruled out. Future X-ray
missions with <5% precision for a simultaneous M and R measurement will have
the potential to solve the problem with observations of NSs. Irrespective of
this observational test, present EOS allowing for hyperons that fulfill
condition M_max>2 Msun yield a pressure at nuclear density that is too high
relative to up-to-date microscopic calculations of this quantity.

Mechanically coupled adherent cells are represented as particles interconnected
with elastic beams which can exert non-central forces and torques. Tissue
plasticity is modeled by a stochastic process consisting of a connectivity
change (addition or removal of a single link) followed by a complete relaxation
to mechanical equilibrium. In particular, we assume that (i) two non-connected,
but adjacent particles can form a new link; and (ii) the lifetime of links is
reduced by tensile forces. We demonstrate that the proposed model yields a
realistic macroscopic elasto-plastic behavior and we establish how microscopic
model parameters affect the material properties at the macroscopic scale. Based
on these results, microscopic parameter values can be inferred from tissue
thickness, macroscopic elastic modulus and the magnitude and dynamics of
intercellular adhesion forces. In addition to their mechanical role, model
particles can also act as active simulation agents and modulate their
connectivity according to specific rules. As an example, anisotropic link
insertion and removal probabilities can give rise to local cell intercalation
and large scale convergent extension movements. The proposed stochastic
simulation of cell activities yields fluctuating tissue movements which exhibit
the same autocorrelation properties as empirical data from avian embryos.

test the viability of the model and place approximate constraints on its

that a configuration of the model in which the CMB sphere does not intersect

are crucial here and it suggest that popular notions of wave stress and action

large scale problems is the fact that storing and computing the decision
function is typically expensive, especially at prediction time. In this paper,
we overcome this difficulty by proposing Fastfood, an approximation that
accelerates such computation significantly. Key to Fastfood is the observation
that Hadamard matrices, when combined with diagonal Gaussian matrices, exhibit
properties similar to dense Gaussian random matrices. Yet unlike the latter,
Hadamard and diagonal matrices are inexpensive to multiply and store. These two
matrices can be used in lieu of Gaussian matrices in Random Kitchen Sinks
proposed by Rahimi and Recht (2009) and thereby speeding up the computation for
a large range of kernel functions. Specifically, Fastfood requires O(n log d)
time and O(n) storage to compute n non-linear basis functions in d dimensions,
a significant improvement from O(nd) computation and storage, without
sacrificing accuracy.
  Our method applies to any translation invariant and any dot-product kernel,
such as the popular RBF kernels and polynomial kernels. We prove that the
approximation is unbiased and has low variance. Experiments show that we
achieve similar accuracy to full kernel expansions and Random Kitchen Sinks
while being 100x faster and using 1000x less memory. These improvements,
especially in terms of memory usage, make kernel methods more practical for
applications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of a billion solar masses. The direct collapse
scenario has emerged as the most plausible way to assemble SMBHs. The nurseries
for the direct collapse black holes are massive primordial halos illuminated
with an intense UV flux emitted by population II (Pop II) stars. In this study,
we compute the critical value of such a flux ($J_{21}^{\rm crit}$) for
realistic spectra of Pop II stars through three-dimensional cosmological
simulations. We derive the dependence of $J_{21}^{\rm crit}$ on the radiation
spectra, on variations from halo to halo, and on the impact of X-ray
ionization. Our findings show that the value of $J_{21}^{\rm crit}$ is a few
times $\rm 10^4$ and only weakly depends on the adopted radiation spectra in
the range between $T_{\rm rad}=2 \times 10^4-10^5$ K. For three simulated halos
of a few times $\rm 10^{7}$~M$_{\odot}$, $J_{21}^{\rm crit}$ varies from $\rm 2
\times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^4$. The impact of X-ray ionization is almost
negligible and within the expected scatter of $J_{21}^{\rm crit}$ for
background fluxes of $J_{\rm X,21} \leq 0.1$. The computed estimates of
$J_{21}^{\rm crit}$ have profound implications for the quasar abundance at
$z=10$ as it lowers the number density of black holes forming through an
isothermal direct collapse by a few orders of magnitude below the observed
black holes density. However, the sites with moderate amounts of $\rm H_2$
cooling may still form massive objects sufficient to be compatible with
observations.

versions of quantum theory involving spontaneous stochastic dynamical collapse
of quantum states, which have been considered in attempts to deal with
shortcomings of the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, in
particular, the issue known as ""the measurement problem"". The new basic
hypothesis is that the modified quantum behavior is enhanced in the region of
high curvature so that the information encoded in the initial quantum state of
the matter fields is rapidly erased as the black hole singularity is
approached. We show that in this manner the complete evaporation of the black
hole via Hawking radiation can be understood as involving no paradox.
Calculations are performed using a modified version of quantum theory known as
""Continuous Spontaneous Localization"" (CSL), which was originally developed in
the context of many particle non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We use a
version of CSL tailored to quantum field theory and applied in the context of
the two dimensional Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model. Although
the role of quantum gravity in this picture is restricted to the resolution of
the singularity, related studies suggest that there might be further
connections.

typically between three and seven days, but even for those sources, significant
variability in addition to the periodic signal can be seen. No period is stable

of variability which is longer for more embedded sources. About half of all

time-variable absorption towards the YSO. The other half becomes bluer when
fainter. These colors can only be explained with significant changes in the

However, the IL thickness is unknown for ALD films less 1 nm. In this work,
Nb-Al-ALD-Al2O3-Nb trilayers with tunnel barriers from 0.6 - 1.6 nm were grown

suggest that ALD may be used to grow an ultrathin, uniform tunnel barrier with

nucleation stage of ALD growth that may disqualify Al as a suitable wetting

have been thoroughly investigated during the last years in condensed-matter and
cold-atom systems. However, the geometric topology of the studied samples is
usually trivial, such as a ribbon or a cylinder. In this paper, we consider a
graphene M\""obius band irradiated with circularly polarised light.
Interestingly, due to the non-orientability of the M\""obius band, a homogeneous
quantum Hall effect cannot exist in this system, but the quantum spin Hall
effect can. To avoid this restriction, the irradiation is applied in a
longitudinal-domain-wall configuration. In this way, the periodic
time-dependent driving term tends to generate the quantum anomalous Hall
effect. On the other hand, due to the bent geometry of the M\""obius band, we
expect a strong spin-orbit coupling, which may lead to quantum spin Hall-like
topological states. Here, we investigate the competition between these two
phenomena upon varying the amplitude and the frequency of the light, for a
fixed value of the spin-orbit coupling strength. The topological properties are
analysed by identifying the edge states in the Floquet spectrum at intermediate
frequencies, when there are resonances between the light frequency and the
energy difference between the conduction and valence bands of the graphene
system.

manipulation of the doping conditions allows the stability of a single donor

bottleneck for big data problems. We provide a theory on data preconditioning

appropriate data preconditioner and characterizes the conditions on the loss
function and on the data under which data preconditioning can reduce the

radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The
Platais et al. proper-motion catalog includes twelve anomalous horizontal

of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial-velocity measurement

problem in jet substructure. In this paper, we use the concept of mutual
information to illuminate the physics of quark/gluon tagging. Ideal quark/gluon
separation requires only one bit of truth information, so even if two
discriminant variables are largely uncorrelated, they can still share the same
""truth overlap"". Mutual information can be used to diagnose such situations,
and thus determine which discriminant variables are redundant and which can be
combined to improve performance. Using both parton showers and analytic
resummation, we study a two-parameter family of generalized angularities, which
includes familiar infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables like thrust and
broadening, as well as IRC unsafe variants like $p_T^D$ and hadron
multiplicity. At leading-logarithmic (LL) order, the bulk of these variables
exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their truth overlap is a universal function
of the color factor ratio $C_A/C_F$. Only at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL)
order can one see a difference in quark/gluon performance. For the IRC safe
angularities, we show that the quark/gluon performance can be improved by
combining angularities with complementary angular exponents. Interestingly, LL
order, NLL order, Pythia 8, and Herwig++ all exhibit similar correlations
between observables, but there are significant differences in the predicted
quark/gluon discrimination power. For the IRC unsafe angularities, we show that
the mutual information can be calculated analytically with the help of a
nonperturbative ""weighted-energy function"", providing evidence for the
complementarity of safe and unsafe observables for quark/gluon discrimination.

limits on a new charged lepton, $e_4^\pm$, using the ATLAS search for anomalous
production of multi-lepton events. It is assumed that only one Standard Model
lepton, namely the muon, dominantly mixes with vectorlike leptons resulting in
possible decays $e_4^\pm \to W^\pm \nu_\mu$, $e_4^\pm \to Z\mu^\pm$, and
$e_4^\pm \to h \mu^\pm$. We derive generally applicable limits on the new
lepton treating the branching ratios for these processes as free variables. We
further interpret the general limits in two scenarios with $e_4^\pm$
originating predominantly from either the $SU(2)$ doublet or the $SU(2)$
singlet. The doublet case is more constrained as a result of larger production
cross-section and extra production processes $e_4^\pm \nu_4$ and $\nu_4\nu_4$
in addition to $e_4^+ e_4^-$, where $\nu_4$ is a new neutral state accompanying
$e_4$. We find that some combinations of branching ratios are poorly
constrained, whereas some are constrained up to masses of more than 500 GeV. In
the doublet case, assuming BR$(\nu_4\rightarrow W\mu) = 1$, all masses below
about 300 GeV are ruled out. Even if this condition is relaxed and additional
decay modes, $\nu_4 \to Z \nu_\mu$ and $\nu_4 \to h \nu_\mu$, are allowed,
below the Higgs threshold still almost all of the parameter space (of
independent branching ratios) is ruled out. Nevertheless, even assuming the
maximal production cross-section, which coincides with the doublet case, the
new charged lepton can still be as light as the LEP-II limit allows. We discuss
several possible improvements of current experimental analyses that would
dramatically reduce the allowed parameter space, even with current data.

Across the quantum critical point, the low-temperature Hall coefficient
undergoes a rapid sign change, suggesting a sudden jump of the Fermi surface
and a destruction of the Kondo effect. Our results imply that the enormous
materials basis for the oxypnictides, which has been so crucial to the search

magnetic poles --- have been the subject of speculation since the first
detailed observations of magnetism several hundred years ago. Numerous
theoretical investigations and hitherto unsuccessful experimental searches have
followed Dirac's 1931 development of a theory of monopoles consistent with both
quantum mechanics and the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field. The
existence of even a single Dirac magnetic monopole would have far-reaching
physical consequences, most famously explaining the quantization of electric
charge. Although analogues of magnetic monopoles have been found in exotic
spin-ices and other systems, there has been no direct experimental observation
of Dirac monopoles within a medium described by a quantum field, such as
superfluid helium-3. Here we demonstrate the controlled creation of Dirac
monopoles in the synthetic magnetic field produced by a spinor Bose-Einstein
condensate. Monopoles are identified, in both experiments and matching
numerical simulations, at the termini of vortex lines within the condensate. By
directly imaging such a vortex line, the presence of a monopole may be
discerned from the experimental data alone. These real-space images provide
conclusive and long-awaited experimental evidence of the existence of Dirac
monopoles. Our result provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe and
manipulate these quantum-mechanical entities in a controlled environment.

galaxies is still not fully understood. Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs)
provide a unique window into dwarf galaxy formation and evolution and are often
thought of as an evolutionary stage between different classes of dwarf
galaxies. In this study we use deep optical and near-infrared observations of
the underlying hosts of BCDs in order to study the structural differences
between different types of dwarf galaxies. When compared with dwarf irregular
galaxies of similar luminosities, we find that the underlying hosts of BCDs
have significantly more concentrated light distributions, with smaller scale
lengths and brighter central surface brightnesses. We demonstrate here that the
underlying hosts of BCDs are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf
irregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely that most dwarf irregular galaxies
can transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the starburst
in a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement
with other studies. It appears that a BCD is a long-lived and distinct type of
dwarf galaxy that exhibits an exceptionally concentrated matter distribution.
We suggest that it is this compact mass distribution that enables the strong
star formation events that characterize this class of dwarf galaxy, that the
compactness of the underlying host can be used as a distinguishing parameter
between BCDs and other dwarf galaxies, and that it can also be used to identify
BCDs which are not currently experiencing an intense starburst event.

on asteroseismology and interferometry. An independent spectroscopic
differential analysis based on excitation and ionization balance of iron lines
yielded the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$ = 5035 $\pm$ 29 K, $\log$ g =
3.30 $\pm$ 0.08 and [Fe/H] = 0.10 $\pm$ 0.04. These were used in conjunction
with the PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks to infer a mass M = 1.77 $\pm$ 0.04
M$_{\odot}$, which agrees well with the previous estimates. Lithium abundance
was also estimated from spectral synthesis (A(Li) = 0.77 $\pm$ 0.07) and,
together with $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H], allowed to determine a mass M = 1.64

about the ultra-dense matter in the compact star interior. The method relies on
astro-seismology based on special global oscillation modes (r-modes) that emit
gravitational waves. They would prevent pulsars from spinning with their
observed high frequencies, unless the damping of these modes, determined by the
microscopic properties of matter, can prevent this. We show that for each form

r-modes can be present. We find that stars containing ungapped quark matter are

systematic error nucleation during signal propagation. Here, we present a new
study of NML operation in a high speed regime at fast repetition rates. We
perform direct imaging of digital signal propagation in permalloy nanomagnet

full-field magnetic soft x-ray transmission microscopy after applying single

An intrinsic switching time of 100 ps per magnet is observed. These

the underlying physics of NML architectures repetitively operated on nanosecond

multi-valley effective mass theory, applied properly, does achieve close

demonstrate this, we variationally solve the coupled six-valley Shindo-Nara

including the full Bloch functions necessitates a tetrahedral, rather than
spherical, donor central cell correction to accurately reproduce the

cross-validate this method against atomistic tight-binding calculations,
showing that the two theories agree well for the calculation of donor-donor
tunnel coupling. Further, we benchmark our results by performing a statistical
uncertainty analysis, confirming that derived quantities such as the wave
function profile and tunnel couplings are robust with respect to variational
energy fluctuations. Finally, we apply this method to exhaustively enumerate
the tunnel coupling for all donor-donor configurations within a large search
volume, demonstrating conclusively that the tunnel coupling has no spatially
stable regions. Though this instability is problematic for reliably coupling
donor pairs for two-qubit operations, we identify specific target locations

power from a measurement of the tSZ bispectrum from 800 sq.deg. of the SPT-SZ

radio halos, relics and bridges is still unclear, however galaxy cluster
mergers seems to be an important factor. We clearly detect the North-West (NW)

steepening towards the centre of the cluster, which indicates an ageing

observations. We detect emission that could be associated with a radio halo and

performance improvement in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we consider
distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange
data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most
existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups
or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged.
However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be
involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping
coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class
of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based
on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs
self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions.
Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields
significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up
to 25% in the Q_m+Q_f criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in
the Q_m/Q_f criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up

complex and intricate evolution. The evolution of the surface field is
important for several reasons. One is that the surface field, and its dynamics,
sets the boundary condition for the coronal and heliospheric magnetic fields.
Another is that the surface evolution gives us insight into the dynamo process.
In particular, it plays an essential role in the Babcock-Leighton model of the
solar dynamo. Describing this evolution is the aim of the surface flux
transport model. The model starts from the emergence of magnetic bipoles.
Thereafter, the model is based on the induction equation and the fact that
after emergence the magnetic field is observed to evolve as if it were purely
radial. The induction equation then describes how the surface flows --
differential rotation, meridional circulation, granular, supergranular flows,
and active region inflows -- determine the evolution of the field (now taken to
be purely radial). In this paper, we review the modeling of the various
processes that determine the evolution of the surface field. We restrict our
attention to their role in the surface flux transport model. We also discuss
the success of the model and some of the results that have been obtained using
this model.

Finally, we extend our analysis on lepton flavour violating decays like $\mu
\to e \gamma$ and $\mu \to eee$ due to exchange of TeV scale Higgs triplet
scalar within the low scale type II seesaw framework. The branching ratios for
these lepton flavour processes are examined with the small type II perturbation
term $\omega$ and the estimated values are very close to the experimental bound

non-cooperative RF device localization using a wireless sensor network. We
consider the scenario where few or no sensors receive line-of-sight signals
from the target. In the case of non-line-of-sight signals, the signal path
consists of a single reflection between the transmitter and receiver. Each
sensor is able to measure the time difference of arrival of the target's signal
with respect to a reference sensor, as well as the angle of arrival of the
target's signal. We derive a distributed EM algorithm where each node makes use
of its local information to compute summary statistics, and then shares these
statistics with its neighbors to improve its estimate of the target
localization. Since all the measurements need not be centralized at a single
location, the spectrum usage can be significantly reduced. The distributed
algorithm also allows for increased robustness of the sensor network in the
case of node failures. We show that our distributed algorithm converges, and
simulation results suggest that our method achieves an accuracy close to the
centralized EM algorithm. We apply the distributed EM algorithm to a set of
experimental measurements with a network of four nodes, which confirm that the
algorithm is able to localize a RF target in a realistic non-line-of-sight

streams: one for information forwarding and the other for energy harvesting. We
develop a distributed power splitting framework using game theory to derive a
profile of power splitting ratios for all relays that can achieve a good
network-wide performance. Specifically, non-cooperative games are respectively
formulated for pure amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
networks, in which each link is modeled as a strategic player who aims to
maximize its own achievable rate. The existence and uniqueness for the Nash
equilibriums (NEs) of the formulated games are analyzed and a distributed
algorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NEs is also developed.
Subsequently, the developed framework is extended to the more general network
setting with mixed AF and DF relays. All the theoretical analyses are validated
by extensive numerical results. Simulation results show that the proposed
game-theoretical approach can achieve a near-optimal network-wide performance
on average, especially for the scenarios with relatively low and moderate

XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum of M82, using a newly developed CX model combined with
a single-temperature thermal plasma to characterize the volume-filling hot gas.
The CX process is largely responsible for not only the strongly enhanced
forbidden lines of the K$\alpha$ triplets of various He-like ions, but also
good fractions of the Ly$\alpha$ transitions of C VI (~87%), O VIII and N VII
($\gtrsim$50%) as well. In total about a quarter of the X-ray flux in the RGS
6-30 \AA\ band originates in the CX. We infer an ion incident rate of
$3\times10^{51}\,\rm{s^{-1}}$ undergoing CX at the hot and cool gas interface,
and an effective area of the interface as $\sim2\times10^{45}\,{\rm cm^2}$ that
is one order of magnitude larger than the cross section of the global biconic
outflow. With the CX contribution accounted for, the best fit temperature of
the hot gas is 0.6 keV, and the metal abundances are approximately solar. We
further show that the same CX/thermal plasma model also gives an excellent
description of the EPIC-pn spectrum of the outflow Cap, projected at 11.6 kpc

calculated by different methods. Such calculations are generally done by using
the null geodesics under both strong field and weak field approximation.
However, several authors have studied the gravitational deflection of light ray
using material medium approach. For a static, non-rotating spherical mass, one
can determine the deflection in Schwarzschild field, by expressing the line
element in an isotropic form and calculating the refractive index to determine
the trajectory of the light ray. In this paper, we draw our attention to the
refractive index of light ray in Kerr field using the material medium approach.
The frame dragging effects in Kerr field was considered to calculate the
velocity of light ray and finally the refractive index in Kerr field geometry
was determined. Hence the deflection of light ray in Kerr field was calculated,
assuming far field approximation and compared the results with those
calculations done earlier using Null geodesics.

environmental dependence of the fundamental plane relation. With the help of
the galaxy group catalogue based on SDSS DR7, we calculate the fundamental
planes in different dark matter halo mass bins for central and satellite
galaxies respectively. We find the environmental dependence of the fundamental
plane coefficients are similar in $g$, $r$, $i$ and $z$ bands. The
environmental dependence for central and satellite galaxies is significantly
different. While the fundamental plane coefficients of centrals vary
systematically with the halo mass, those of satellites are similar in different
halo mass bins. The discrepancy between centrals and satellites are significant
in small halos, but negligible in the largest halo mass bins. These results
remain the same when we only keep red galaxies, or galaxies with $b/a>0.6$, or
galaxies in a specific radius range in the sample. After the correction of the
sky background, results are still similar. We suggest that the different
environmental effects of the halo mass on centrals and satellites may arise
from the different quenching processes of them.

We present a high level design of kT-RAM and a formal definition of its

successful port of all previous machine learning benchmark applications

influence a task that a computer can measure? The contribution of this paper is
in exploring the problem of computer-automated suggestion of influences between
artists, a problem that was not addressed before in a general setting. We first
present a comparative study of different classification methodologies for the
task of fine-art style classification. A two-level comparative study is
performed for this classification problem. The first level reviews the
performance of discriminative vs. generative models, while the second level
touches the features aspect of the paintings and compares semantic-level
features vs. low-level and intermediate-level features present in the painting.
Then, we investigate the question ""Who influenced this artist?"" by looking at
his masterpieces and comparing them to others. We pose this interesting
question as a knowledge discovery problem. For this purpose, we investigated
several painting-similarity and artist-similarity measures. As a result, we
provide a visualization of artists (Map of Artists) based on the similarity

show that once the neutrino polarization evolution is considered, there are
clear differences between Dirac and Majorana scattering on electrons. The

lines detectable by SPICA/SAFARI and excited both by star formation and by AGN
activity. The new estimates improve over previous work by using updated
evolutionary models and dealing in a self consistent way with emission of
galaxies as a whole, including both the starburst and the AGN component. New
relationships between line and AGN bolometric luminosity have been derived and
those between line and IR luminosities of the starburst component have been
updated. These ingredients were used to work out predictions for the source
counts in 11 mid/far-IR emission lines partially or entirely excited by AGN
activity. We find that the statistics of the emission line detection of
galaxies as a whole is mainly determined by the star formation rate, because of
the rarity of bright AGNs. We also find that the slope of the line integral
number counts is flatter than 2 implying that the number of detections at fixed
observing time increases more by extending the survey area than by going
deeper. We thus propose a wide spectroscopic survey of 1 hour integration per
field-of-view over an area of 5 deg$^{2}$ to detect (at 5$\sigma$) $\sim$760
AGNs in [OIV]25.89$\mu$m $-$ the brightest AGN mid-infrared line $-$ out to
$z\sim2$. Pointed observations of strongly lensed or hyper-luminous galaxies
previously detected by large area surveys such as those by Herschel and by the
SPT can provide key information on the galaxy-AGN co-evolution out to higher
redshifts.

down the genetic constraints evolved for maintenance of the metazoan
multicellularity, which, however, requires a critical test. Using
xenograft-based experimental evolution we characterized for the first time the
full life history from initiation to metastasis of a tumor at the genomic and
transcriptomic levels, and observed metastasis-driving positive selection for
generally loss-of-function mutations on a set of multicellularity-related
genes, which is further supported by large-scale exome data of clinical tumor
samples. Subsequent expression analysis revealed mainly expression
down-regulation of multicellularity-related genes, which form an evolving
expression profile approaching that of embryonic stem cells, the cell type with
the most characteristics of unicellular life. The theoretical conjecture
predicts that genes born at the emergence of metazoan multicellularity tend to
be cancer drivers, which we validated using a rigorous phylostratigraphy
analysis on the birth rate of genes annotated by Cancer Gene Census. Also, the
number of loss-of-function tumor suppressors often predominates over activated
oncogenes in a typical tumor of human patients. These data collectively suggest
that, different from typical organismal evolution in which gain of new genes is
the mainstream, cancer represents a loss-of-function-driven degenerative
evolution back to the unicellular ground state. This cancer evolution model may
explain the enormous tumoral genetic heterogeneity in the clinic, underlie how
distant-organ metastases originate in primary tumors despite distinct
environmental requirements, and hold implications for designing effective
cancer therapy.

protein sequences. To study this problem, we introduce a simple but physical
model of protein evolution where selection targets allostery, the functional
coupling of distal sites on protein surfaces. This model shows how the
geometrical organization of couplings between amino acids within a protein
structure can depend crucially on its evolutionary history. In particular, two
scenarios are found to generate a spatial concentration of functional
constraints: high mutation rates and fluctuating selective pressures. This
second scenario offers a plausible explanation for the high tolerance of
natural proteins to mutations and for the spatial organization of their least
tolerant amino acids, as revealed by sequence analyses and mutagenesis
experiments. It also implies a faculty to adapt to new selective pressures that
is consistent with observations. Besides, the model illustrates how several
independent functional modules may emerge within a same protein structure,
depending on the nature of past environmental fluctuations. Our model thus
relates the evolutionary history and evolutionary potential of proteins to the
geometry of their functional constraints, with implications for decoding and
engineering protein sequences.

ubiquitous in biological and social networks [M.~E.~J. Newman, Nat. Phys.
\textbf{8}, 25 (2012)]. Motivated by these facts, we here consider the
evolutionary Prisoner's dilemma game taking place on top of a real social
network to investigate how the community structure and the heterogeneity in
activity of individuals affect the evolution of cooperation. In particular, we
account for a variation of the birth-death process (which can also be regarded
as a proportional imitation rule from social point of view) for the strategy
updating under both weak- and strong-selection (meaning the payoffs harvested
from games contribute either slightly or heavily to the individuals'
performance). By implementing comparative studies, where the players are
selected either randomly or in terms of their actual activities to playing
games with their immediate neighbors, we figure out that heterogeneous activity
benefits the emergence of collective cooperation in harsh environment (the
action for cooperation is costly) under strong selection, while it impairs the
formation of altruism under weak selection. Moreover, we find that the
abundance of communities in the social network can evidently foster the
fixation of cooperation under strong-selection, in contrast to the games
evolving on the randomized counterparts. Our results are therefore helpful for
us to better understand the evolution of cooperation in real social systems.

information-theoretic measures from time-series data. While the toolkit
provides classic information-theoretic measures (e.g. entropy, mutual
information, conditional mutual information), it ultimately focusses on
implementing higher-level measures for information dynamics. That is, JIDT
focusses on quantifying information storage, transfer and modification, and the
dynamics of these operations in space and time. For this purpose, it includes
implementations of the transfer entropy and active information storage, their
multivariate extensions and local or pointwise variants. JIDT provides
implementations for both discrete and continuous-valued data for each measure,
including various types of estimator for continuous data (e.g. Gaussian,
box-kernel and Kraskov-Stoegbauer-Grassberger) which can be swapped at run-time
due to Java's object-oriented polymorphism. Furthermore, while written in Java,
the toolkit can be used directly in MATLAB, GNU Octave, Python and other
environments. We present the principles behind the code design, and provide

similarity with prototypical classical T Tauri stars, LkCa4 shows no evidence
for accretion and probes an interesting transition stage for star and planet
formation. Large profile distortions and Zeeman signatures are detected in the
unpolarized and circularly-polarized lines of LkCa4 using Least-Squares
Deconvolution (LSD), indicating the presence of brightness inhomogeneities and
magnetic fields at the surface of LkCa4.
  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct brightness and magnetic maps of
LkCa4 from sets of unpolarized and circularly-polarized LSD profiles. The
large-scale field is strong and mainly axisymmetric, featuring a ~2kG poloidal
component and a ~1kG toroidal component encircling the star at equatorial
latitudes - the latter making LkCa4 markedly different from classical TTauri
stars of similar mass and age. The brightness map includes a dark spot
overlapping the magnetic pole and a bright region at mid latitudes - providing
a good match to the contemporaneous photometry. We also find that differential
rotation at the surface of LkCa4 is small, typically ~5.5x weaker than that of
the Sun, and compatible with solid-body rotation.
  Using our tomographic modelling, we are able to filter out the activity
jitter in the RV curve of LkCa4 (of full amplitude 4.3km/s) down to a rms
precision of 0.055km/s. Looking for hot Jupiters around young Sun-like stars
thus appears feasible, even though we find no evidence for such planets around

that MAXI J0556-332 had near- or super-Eddington luminosities for a large part

a power-law component) result in distance estimates of 45+/-3 kpc, for a
neutron-star radius of 10 km and a mass of 1.4 Msun. The spectra show the
effective surface temperature of the neutron star decreasing monotonically over
the first ~500 days of quiescence, except for two observations that were likely
affected by enhanced low-level accretion. The temperatures we obtain for the
fits that include a power-law (kT_eff=184-308 eV) are much higher than those
seen for any other neutron star heated by accretion, while the inferred cooling

of $G$, denoted by $G^{k,s}$, which is obtained from $G$ by blowing up each
vertex into a $k$-set and each edge into a $(k-2s)$-set, where $s \le k/2$.
When $s < k/2$, $G^{k,s}$ is always odd-bipartite. We show that $G^{k,{k \over

$G^{k,{k \over 2}}$ has the same adjacency (respectively, signless Laplacian)
spectral radius as $G$. So the results involving the adjacency or signless
Laplacian spectral radius of a simple graph $G$ hold for $G^{k,{k \over 2}}$.
In particular, we characterize the unique graph with minimum adjacency or
signless Laplacian spectral radius among all non-odd-bipartite hypergraphs
$G^{k,{k \over 2}}$ of fixed order, and prove that $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}}$ is the
smallest limit point of the non-odd-bipartite hypergraphs $G^{k,{k \over 2}}$.

the obligation to exploitation by a second all-sky mission. Therefore a
proposal was submitted to ESA in May 2013 for a Gaia-like mission in about
twenty years. Two new designs are here considered with NIR sensors in addition
to the visual CCDs as in Gaia. This has been suggested by several colleagues in
order to get better astrometry in obscured regions. A first design with CMOS
sensors was quickly abandoned for technical reasons. The second design with
specially developed CCDs for NIR looked more promising. But a deeper study
showed that the longer wavelength in the near infrared at two microns
deteriorates astrometry so much that only heavily obscured stars of extremely
red types as M5III would obtain a better accuracy. Thus, an option with NIR
sensors does not seem promissing.

within two qualitatively different extensions of the Yukawa sector: one
renormalizable and the other nonrenormalizable; both incorporating Lorentz
violation in a model-independent fashion. These extensions are characterized by
Yukawa-like matrices, the former by a constant Lorentz 2-tensor $Y^{AB}_{\mu
\nu}$, whereas the latter by a constant Lorentz vector $Y^{AB}_\mu$. It is
found that the experimental constraints on the decays $l_A\to l_B\gamma$
severely restrict lepton flavor violating Higgs signals in the renormalizable
scenario. In this context, it is found that $BR(H\to \mu^\pm e^\mp)$ and
$BR(H\to \tau^\pm \mu^\mp)$ cannot be larger than $10^{-18}$ and $10^{-11}$,
respectively. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, transitions mediated by the
Higgs or the $Z$ gauge boson are induced at tree level, and we find mild
restrictions on lepton flavor violation. Using the experimental limits on the
three-body decays $l_A \to l_B \bar{l}_Cl_C$ to constraint the vector
$Y^{AB}_\mu$, it is found that the branching ratio for the decays $H\to \mu^\pm
e^\mp$ is of about $4\times 10^{-9}$, more important, a branching ratio of
$7\times 10^{-4}$ is found for the $\tau^\pm \mu^\mp$ mode. Accordingly, the
decay $H \to \tau^\pm \mu^\mp$ could be at the reach of future measurements.
The lepton flavor violating decays of the $Z$ gauge boson were also studied. In
the renormalizable scenario, it was found the undetectable branching ratios
$BR(Z\to \mu^\pm e^\mp)<5.7\times 10^{-21}$ and $BR(Z\to \tau^\pm
\mu^\mp)<2.0\times 10^{-12}$. In the nonrenormalizable scenario, it was found

the suspension flows through a magnetized filter mesh, high magnetic gradients
around the wires attract and capture the particles, removing them from the
fluid. We model such a system by considering the motion of a paramagnetic
tracer particle through a periodic array of magnetized cylinders. We show that
there is a critical Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) below
which the particle is captured irrespective of its initial position in the

depends on the particle's entry position. We determine the relationship between
the critical Mason number and the system geometry using numerical and

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv1295",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In stark contrast to their laboratory and terrestrial counterparts, the
cosmic jets appear to be very stable. We propose that the reason behind this
remarkable property is the loss of causal connectivity across these jets,
caused by their rapid expansion in response to fast decline of external
pressure with the distance from the ""jet engine"". In atmospheres with power-law
pressure distribution, the total loss of causal connectivity occurs, when the
power index k>2 - the steepness which is expected to be quite common for many
astrophysical environments. This conclusion does not seem to depend on the
physical nature of jets - it applies both to relativistic and non-relativistic
flows, both magnetically-dominated and unmagnetized jets. In order to verify
it, we have carried out numerical simulations of moderately magnetized and
moderately relativistic jets. Their results give strong support to our
hypothesis and provide with valuable insights. In particular, we find that the
z-pinched inner cores of magnetic jets expand slower than their envelopes and
become susceptible to instabilities even when the whole jet is stable. This may
result in local dissipation and emission without global disintegration of the
flow. Cosmic jets may become globally unstable when they enter flat sections of
external atmospheres. We propose that the Fanaroff-Riley morphological division
of extragalactic radio sources into two classes is related to this issue. In
particular, we argue that the low power FR-I jets become re-confined, causally
connected and globally unstable on the scale of galactic X-ray coronas, whereas
more powerful FR-II jets re-confine much further out and remain largely intact
until they terminate at hot spots. Using this idea, we derived the relationship
between the critical jet power and the optical luminosity of the host galaxy,
which is in a very good agreement with the observations.

contact potential approximation is questionable in the presence of Feschbach
resonances.

in several ways, due to the inherent attributes of Internet-mediated
interaction and through its effects on social trust and sociability. We test
our hypotheses on a representative sample of the Italian population. We find a
significantly negative correlation between online networking and well-being.
This result is partially confirmed after accounting for endogeneity. We explore
the direct and indirect effects of the use of social networking sites (SNS) on
well-being in a SEM analysis. We find that online networking plays a positive
role in subjective well-being through its impact on physical interactions,
whereas SNS use is associated with lower social trust. The overall effect of
networking on individual welfare is significantly negative.

  (accepted), pdf version is in draft mode of Space Weather and Space Climate",,,,"physics.ao-ph astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the relationship between spectral solar irradiance (SSI) and
ozone in the tropical upper stratosphere. We find that solar cycle (SC) changes
in ozone can be well approximated by considering the ozone response to SSI
changes in a small number individual wavelength bands between 176 and 310 nm,
operating independently of each other. Additionally, we find that the ozone
varies approximately linearly with changes in the SSI. Using these facts, we
present a Bayesian formalism for inferring SC SSI changes and uncertainties
from measured SC ozone profiles. Bayesian inference is a powerful,
mathematically self-consistent method of considering both the uncertainties of
the data and additional external information to provide the best estimate of
parameters being estimated. Using this method, we show that, given measurement
uncertainties in both ozone and SSI datasets, it is not currently possible to
distinguish between observed or modelled SSI datasets using available estimates
of ozone change profiles, although this might be possible by the inclusion of
other external constraints. Our methodology has the potential, using wider
datasets, to provide better understanding of both variations in SSI and the
atmospheric response.

In a previous paper multitarget tracking with a single sensor was considered
[8]. A ballistic missile may be in several pieces, presenting multiple targets.
Besides the ground based or ship sensor there is also the missile seeker. We
consider algorithms for generating and maintaining the tracks needed for BMD. A
cue of a BM from a non-organic tracking system may also be received. We
consider whether the cue is already in the local track file or is a new track.
The cue information can improve the existing local track.

blocks. The method is inspired by a well known introductory physics homework
problem, and is implemented by tying 12 identical rods of appropriately chosen
radius to the faces of the block. The rods form the corners and new faces that
transform the square prism into a dodecagon which can then be moved more easily
by rolling than by dragging. Experimental results are presented and compared to
independent work by another group which utilized wooden attachments providing a
cylindrical shape. It is found that a small scale stone block converted to
dodecagons can be moved across level open ground with a dynamic coefficient of
friction of the order 0.2. For full scale pyramid blocks, the wooden rods would
need to be posts of order 30 cm in diameter, similar in size to those used as
masts on ships in the Nile.

damping and trapping forces, including cases where nonlinear damping or
nonlinearities in the electric field geometry play significant roles. In the
absence of nonlinearities, particles are either damped to the trap center or
ejected, while their addition brings about a rich spectrum of stable closed
particle trajectories. In three-dimensional (3D) quadrupole traps, the extended
orbits are typically confined to the trap axis, and for this case we present a
1D analysis of the relevant equation of motion. We follow this with an analysis
of 2D quadrupole traps that frequently show diamond-shaped closed orbits. For
both the 1D and 2D cases we present experimental observations of the calculated
trajectories in microparticle ion traps. We also report the discovery of a new
collective behavior in damped 2D microparticle ion traps, where particles
spontaneously assemble into a remarkable knot of overlapping, corotating
diamond orbits, self-stabilized by air currents arising from the particle
motion.
