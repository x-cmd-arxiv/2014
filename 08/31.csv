the scientific community. The number of retractions each year has also
increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific
misconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It
is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their
colleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical
evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors'
research careers. Using data from the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the
productivity, impact and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted
articles for a period of five years before and after the retraction. We found
clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues'
misconduct, and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a
retraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these
consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted
paper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors,
while the impact is less important for middle authors.

has been obtained in semiclassical regime beyond the Dirac point approximation.
In particular, detailed investigations were made on the dependence of
conductivity on the Fermi energy. At low energies, in the vicinity of the Dirac
points, band energy of the monolayer graphene is isotropic at the Fermi level.
Meanwhile, at the intermediate Fermi energies anisotropic effects such as
trigonal warping is expected to be the origin of the anisotropic resistivity.
However, besides the band anisotropy there also exists an other source of
anisotropic resistivity which was introduced by scattering matrix. At high
energies it was shown that the band anisotropy is less effective than the
anisotropy generated by the scattering matrix. It was also shown that there
exist two distinct regimes of anisotropic resistivity corresponding the
trigonal warping and connected Fermi curve at intermediate and high energies
respectively.

Cactus group appears in our construction as a subgroup in the Galois group of

this action is isomorphic to the action of the cactus group on the tensor

prove this conjecture in the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_2$ (in

(PFM) measurements are shown to be a consequence of the Euler-Bernoulli (EB)
dynamics of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever beams used to make the

the boundary conditions determine the sensitivity of cantilevers to forces
between the tip and the sample. Conventional PFM and AFM measurements are made
with the motion of the cantilever measured at one optical beam detector (OBD)
spot location. A single OBD spot location provides a limited picture of the
total cantilever motion and in fact, experimentally observed cantilever
amplitude and phase are shown to be strongly dependent on the OBD spot position
for many measurements. In this work, the commonly observed frequency dependence
of PFM response is explained through experimental measurements and analytic
theoretical EB modeling of the PFM response as a function of both frequency and
OBD spot location on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) sample. One
notable conclusion is that a common choice of OBD spot location, at or near the
tip of the cantilever is particularly vulnerable to frequency dependent
amplitude and phase variations stemming from dynamics of the cantilever sensor
rather than from the piezoresponse of the sample.

if $T$ is a left or right zero band and the $T$-graded algebra is unital, or

to be a current topic, because of their complex phase diagrams and

orbitals), as well as structural properties such as lattice distortion and
charge ordering, among many others. Ruthenocuprates are magnetic
superconductors in which the magnetic transition temperature is much higher
than the critical superconducting temperature, making them unique compounds.
With the aim of investigating the dilution of the magnetic Ru sub-lattice, we
proposed the synthesis of the new Ru1-xRexSr2GdCu2Oy ruthenocupratetype family,
adapting the known two-step process (double perovskite + CuO)by directly doping
the double perovskite, thus obtaining the new perovskite compound
Sr2GdRu1-xRexOy, which represents a new synthesis process to the best of our
knowledge. Our samples were structurally characterised through X-ray
diffraction, and the patterns were analysed via Rietveld refinement. A complete
magnetic characterisation as a function of temperature and applied field, as
well as transport measurements were carried out. We discuss our results in the
light of the two-lattice model for ruthenocuprates, and a relation between RuO2
(magnetic) and CuO2 (superconductor) sublattices can clearly be observed.

  Sharing Queues",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper studies approximations and control of a processor sharing (PS)
server where the service rate depends on the number of jobs occupying the
server. The control of such a system is implemented by imposing a limit on the
number of jobs that can share the server concurrently, with the rest of the
jobs waiting in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer. A desirable control scheme
should strike the right balance between efficiency (operating at a high service
rate) and parallelism (preventing small jobs from getting stuck behind large
ones).
  We employ the framework of heavy-traffic diffusion analysis to devise near
optimal control heuristics for such a queueing system. However, while the
literature on diffusion control of state-dependent queueing systems begins with
a sequence of systems and an exogenously defined drift function, we begin with
a finite discrete PS server and propose an axiomatic recipe to explicitly
construct a sequence of state-dependent PS servers which then yields a drift
function. We establish diffusion approximations and use them to obtain
insightful and closed-form approximations for the original system under a
static concurrency limit control policy.
  We extend our study to control policies that dynamically adjust the
concurrency limit. We provide two novel numerical algorithms to solve the
associated diffusion control problem. Our algorithms can be viewed as ""average
cost"" iteration: The first algorithm uses binary-search on the average cost and
can find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in time $O\left( \log^2
\frac{1}{\epsilon} \right)$; the second algorithm uses the Newton-Raphson
method for root-finding and requires $O\left( \log \frac{1}{\epsilon} \log\log
\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ time.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation for
choosing optimal or near-optimal static and dynamic concurrency control
heuristics.

trajectory of the capsule closely follows the underlying streamlines

velocity and the principal tensions observed during the capsule motion. The
evolution of the capsule velocity displays a loss of the time-reversal symmetry
of Stokes flow due to the elasticity of the membrane. The velocity decreases
while the capsule is approaching the corner as the background flow does,
reaches a minimum at the corner and displays an overshoot past the corner due
to the streamwise elongation induced by the flow acceleration in the downstream

the major principal tension increase linearly with the inverse of the duct
width. Finally, the deformation and tension of the capsule are shown to
decrease in a curved corner.

sense that they accelerate electrons up to the radiation reaction limit.
Motivated by this observation, this paper examines the possibility that young
pulsar wind nebulae can accelerate ions to ultra-high energies at the
termination shock of the pulsar wind. We consider here powerful PWNe, fed by
pulsars born with $\sim\,$millisecond periods. Assuming that such pulsars
exist, at least during a few years after the birth of the neutron star, and
that they inject ions into the wind, we find that protons could be accelerated
up to energies of the order of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off, for a
fiducial rotation period $P\,\sim\,1\,$msec and a pulsar magnetic field
$B_{\star}\,\sim\,10^{13}\,$G, implying a fiducial wind luminosity $L_{\rm
p}\,\sim\,10^{45}\,$erg/s and a spin-down time $t_{\rm sd}\,\sim 3\times
10^7\,$s. The main limiting factor is set by synchrotron losses in the nebula
and by the size of the termination shock; ions with $Z\geq 1$ may therefore be
accelerated to even higher energies. We derive an associated neutrino flux
produced by interactions in the source region. For a proton-dominated
composition, our maximum flux lies slightly below the 5-year sensitivity of
IceCube-86 and above the 3-year sensitivity of the projected Askaryan Radio
Array. It might thus become detectable in the next decade, depending on the
exact level of contribution of these millisecond pulsar wind nebulae to the
ultra-high energy cosmic ray flux.

(MWIS), one of the most studied optimization problems in Graph algorithms. We
are given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a weight function $w: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
a budget function $b: V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z^+}$, and a positive integer $B$.
The weight (resp. budget) of a subset of vertices is the sum of weights (resp.
budgets) of the vertices in the subset. A $k$-budgeted independent set in $G$
is a subset of vertices, such that no pair of vertices in that subset are
adjacent, and the budget of the subset is at most $k$. The goal is to find a
$B$-budgeted independent set in $G$ such that its weight is maximum among all
the $B$-budgeted independent sets in $G$. We refer to this problem as MWBIS.
Being a generalization of MWIS, MWBIS also has several applications in
Scheduling, Wireless networks and so on. Due to the hardness results implied
from MWIS, we study the MWBIS problem in several special classes of graphs. We
design exact algorithms for trees, forests, cycle graphs, and interval graphs.
In unweighted case we design an approximation algorithm for $d+1$-claw free
graphs whose approximation ratio ($d$) is competitive with the approximation
ratio ($\frac{d}{2}$) of MWIS (unweighted). Furthermore, we extend Baker's
technique \cite{Baker83} to get a PTAS for MWBIS in planar graphs.

mechanics introduces a quantum notion of truth which is formalized by quantum
logic (QL) and is incompatible with the classical (Tarskian) notion. We show
that QL can be interpreted as a pragmatic language of assertive formulas which
formalize statements about physical systems that are empirically justified or
unjustified in the framework of quantum mechanics. According to this
interpretation, QL formalizes properties of the metalinguistic notion of
empirical justification within quantum mechanics rather than properties of a
quantum notion of truth. This conclusion agrees with a general integrationist
perspective that interprets nonstandard logics as theories of metalinguistic
notions different from truth, thus avoiding incompatibility with classical
notions and preserving the globality of logic. By the way, some elucidations of
the standard notion of quantum truth are also obtained.
  Key words: pragmatics, quantum logic, quantum mechanics, justifiability,
global pluralism.

primary SDP approach has been investigated and a variety of approaches are
proposed in order to enhance its performance. In SDP approaches, errors in
approximating the given distances are minimized as an objective function. It is
desirable that the distribution of error in these problems would be a delta
distribution, which is practically impossible. Therefore, we may approximate
delta distribution by Gaussian distribution with very small variance. In this
paper, we define a new objective function which makes the error distribution as
similar as possible to a Gaussian distribution with a very small variance.

investigation has attracted considerable research effort recently. However,
existing studies have only partially explored the structure features. In this

uncover hierarchical and overlapping communities, as well as hubs and outliers.
Moreover, LINSIA can provide insight into the label propagation mechanism and
propose a parameter-free solution that requires no prior knowledge. In
addition, LINSIA can give out a soft-partitioning result and depict the degree
of overlapping nodes belonging to each relevant community. The proposed
algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms several

causes is determined from polar motion data. Equations that give the relation
between the figure axis and rotational axis are derived and the motion of the
figure pole with respect to the Earth's surface or the figure axis in the Earth
is determined by using these equations. Estimation of error suggests that the
accuracy of the determination for the position of the figure pole at each

short duration of time, such as one or two days, is significant. The determined
position of the figure pole exhibits a rapid and complicated motion in a short

annual and semi-annual variations, but it is quite independent of the Chandler
wobble.

according to a hierarchical architecture such that their couplings scale with
their reciprocal distance. As a full statistical mechanics solution is not yet
available, after a streamlined introduction to the state of the art via that
route, the problem is consistently approached through signal- to-noise
technique and extensive numerical simulations. Focusing on the low-storage
regime, where the amount of stored patterns grows at most logarithmical with
the system size, we prove that these non-mean-field Hopfield-like networks
display a richer phase diagram than their classical counterparts. In
particular, these networks are able to perform serial processing (i.e. retrieve
one pattern at a time through a complete rearrangement of the whole ensemble of
neurons) as well as parallel processing (i.e. retrieve several patterns
simultaneously, delegating the management of diff erent patterns to diverse
communities that build network). The tune between the two regimes is given by
the rate of the coupling decay and by the level of noise affecting the system.
The price to pay for those remarkable capabilities lies in a network's capacity
smaller than the mean field counterpart, thus yielding a new budget principle:
the wider the multitasking capabilities, the lower the network load and
viceversa. This may have important implications in our understanding of
biological complexity.

abundances predicted by rotating stellar models depend on the numerical
treatment of rotational mixing, such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution
and computation of mean molecular weight gradients. We find that even with
identical numerical prescriptions for calculating the rotational mixing
coefficients in the diffusion equation, different timesteps lead to a deviation
of the coefficients and hence surface abundances. We find the surface
abundances vary by 10-100% between the model sequences with short timestep of
0.001Myr to model sequences with longer timesteps. Model sequences with
stronger surface nitrogen enrichment also have longer main-sequence lifetimes
because more hydrogen is mixed to the burning cores. The deviations in
main-sequence lifetimes can be as large as 20%. Mathematically speaking, no
numerical scheme can give a perfect solution unless infinitesimally small
timesteps are used. However, we find that the surface abundances eventually
converge within 10% between modelling sequences with sufficiently small
timesteps below 0.1Myr. The efficiency of rotational mixing depends on the
implemented numerical scheme and critically on the computation of the mean
molecular weight gradient. A smoothing function for the mean molecular weight
gradient results in stronger rotational mixing. If the discretization scheme or
the computational recipe for calculating the mean molecular weight gradient is
altered, re-calibration of mixing parameters may be required to fit
observations. If we are to properly understand the fundamental physics of
rotation in stars, it is crucial that we minimize the uncertainty introduced
into stellar evolution models when numerically approximating rotational mixing
processes.

Fokker-Planck equations for a free energy function defined on a finite graph.
When $N\ge 2$ is the number of vertices of the graph, they show that the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is a system of $N$ nonlinear ordinary
differential equations defined on a Riemannian manifold of probability
distributions. The different choices for inner products on the space of
probability distributions result in different Fokker-Planck equations for the
same process. Each of these Fokker-Planck equations has a unique global
equilibrium, which is a Gibbs distribution. In this paper we study the {\em
speed of convergence} towards global equilibrium for the solution of these
Fokker-Planck equations on a graph, and prove that the convergence is indeed
exponential. The rate as measured by the decay of the $L_2$ norm can be bound
in terms of the spectral gap of the Laplacian of the graph, and as measured by
the decay of (relative) entropy be bound using the modified logarithmic Sobolev
constant of the graph.
  With the convergence result, we also prove two Talagrand-type inequalities
relating relative entropy and Wasserstein metric, based on two different
metrics introduced in [CHLZ] The first one is a local inequality, while the
second is a global inequality with respect to the ""lower bound metric"" from

The proof considers a security entanglement-based protocol, which is
subsequently reduced to a ""Prepare and Measure"" protocol similar in structure
to the BB84 protocol, thus establishing the security of the BB84 protocol. The
proof, however, is not without assumptions, which are also enumerated. The
