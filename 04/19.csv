consists in pruning the small branches of a tree: given $h\geq0$, it is
obtained by only keeping the vertices having at least one leaf above them at a
distance greater or equal to $h$.
  The $h$-cut of a function $f$ is the function of minimal total variation
uniformly approximating the increments of $f$ with accuracy $h$, and can be
explicitly constructed via the two-sided Skorohod reflection of $f$ on the
interval $[0,h]$.
  In this work, we show that the contour path of the $h$-trimming of a rooted
real tree is given by the $h$-cut of its original contour path. We provide two
applications of this result. First, we recover a famous result of Neveu and
Pitman, which states that the $h$-trimming of a tree coded by a Brownian
excursion is distributed as a standard binary tree. In addition, we provide the
joint distribution of this Brownian tree and its trimmed version in terms of
the local time of the two-sided reflection of its contour path. As a second
application, we relate the maximum of a sticky Brownian motion to the local
time of its driving process.

S is smooth, we obtain a description of the automorphisms of V which is

different models of V preserving certain rational fibrations. This description
enables one to define normal forms of automorphisms and leads in particular to
a natural generalization of the usual notions of affine and Jonquieres
automorphisms of the affine plane. When V is affine, we show however that

statistical distributions of turbulent cloud structures and a simple model of
star formation from cores. They remain poorly tested, especially at the highest
densities. Aims: We investigate the effects of gas density on the SFE through
measurements of the core formation efficiency (CFE). With a total mass of
$\sim2\times10^4$ M$_\odot$, the W43-MM1 ridge is one of the most convincing
candidate precursor of starburst clusters and thus one of the best place to
investigate star formation. Methods: We used high-angular resolution maps
obtained at 3 mm and 1 mm within W43-MM1 with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer to reveal a cluster of 11 massive dense cores (MDCs), and, one
of the most massive protostellar cores known. An Herschel column density image
provided the mass distribution of the cloud gas. We then measured the
'instantaneous' CFE and estimated the SFE and the star formation rate (SFR)
within subregions of the W43-MM1 ridge. Results: The high SFE found in the
ridge ($\sim$6% enclosed in $\sim$8 pc$^3$) confirms its ability to form a
starburst cluster. There is however a clear lack of dense cores in the northern
part of the ridge, which may be currently assembling. The CFE and the SFE are
observed to increase with volume gas density while the SFR steeply decreases
with the virial parameter, $\alpha_{vir}$. Statistical models of the SFR may
well describe the outskirts of the W43-MM1 ridge but struggle to reproduce its
inner part, which corresponds to measurements at low $\alpha_{vir}$. It may be
that ridges do not follow the log-normal density distribution, Larson
relations, and stationary conditions forced in the statistical SFR models.

their subsequent evolution into color-singlet hadrons, are phenomena that
showcase unique facets of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Medium-stimulated gluon
bremsstrahlung, a fundamental QCD process, induces broadening of the transverse
momentum of the parton, and creates partonic energy loss manifesting itself in
experimental observables that are accessible in high energy interactions in hot
and cold systems. The formation of hadrons, which is the dynamical enforcement
of the QCD confinement principle, is very poorly understood on the basis of
fundamental theory, although detailed models such as the Lund string model or
cluster hadronization models can generally be tuned to capture the main
features of hadronic final states. With the advent of the technical capability
to study hadronic final states from lepton scattering with good particle
identification and at high luminosity, a new opportunity has appeared. Study of
the characteristics of parton propagation and hadron formation as they unfold
within atomic nuclei are now being used to understand the coherence and spatial
features of these processes and to refine new experimental tools that will be
used in future experiments. Fixed-target data on nuclei with lepton and hadron
beams, and collider experiments involving nuclei, all make essential contact
with these topics and they elucidate different aspects of these same themes. In
this paper, a survey of the most relevant recent data and its potential
interpretation will be followed by descriptions of planned experiments at
Jefferson Lab following the completion of the 12 GeV upgrade, and feasible
measurements at a future Electron-Ion Collider.

In
principle, two effects conspire against the development of Casimir effects in
swimmer suspensions. First, at low Reynolds number, the force on any closed
volume vanishes, but here the relevant effect is the drag by the flow produced
by the swimmers, which can be finite. Second, the fluid velocity and the
pressure are linear on the swimmer force dipoles, and averaging over the
swimmer orientations would lead to a vanishing effect. However, being the
suspension a discrete system, the noise terms of the coarse grained equations
depend on the density, which itself fluctuates, resulting in effective
non-linear dynamics. Applying the tools developed for other non-equilibrium
systems to general coarse grained equations for swimmer suspensions, the
Casimir drag is computed on immersed objects, and it is found to depend on the
correlation function between the rescaled density and dipolar density fields.
By introducing a model correlation function with medium range order, explicit
expressions are obtained for the Casimir drag on a body. When the correlation
length is much larger than the microscopic cutoff, the average drag is
independent of the correlation length, with a range that depends only on the
size of the immersed bodies.

the so-called Euler-Poincar\'e differential systems, with the aim of developing
a foundation for numerical algorithms of their solutions. This requires
particular attention to the mathematical properties of this system when the
associated class of elliptic operators possesses non-smooth kernels. By casting
the system in its Lagrangian (or characteristics) form, we first formulate a
particles system algorithm in free space with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions for the evolving fields. We next examine the deformation of the
system when non-homogeneous ""constant stream"" boundary conditions are assumed.
We show how this simple change at the boundary deeply affects the nature of the
evolution, from hyperbolic-like to dispersive with a non-trivial dispersion
relation, and examine the potentially regularizing properties of singular
kernels offered by this deformation. From the particle algorithm viewpoint,
kernel singularities affect the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the
corresponding ordinary differential equations systems. We illustrate this with
the case when the operator kernel assumes a conical shape over the spatial
variables, and examine in detail two-particle dynamics under the resulting lack
of Lipschitz-continuity. Curiously, we find that for the conically-shaped
kernels the motion of the related two-dimensional waves can become completely
integrable under appropriate initial data. This reduction projects the
two-dimensional system to the one-dimensional completely integrable
Shallow-Water equation [Camassa, R. and Holm, D. D., Phys. Rev. Lett., 71,

that depending on the balance of the tidal dissipation in both planets, their
final period ratio may stay at the resonant value, increase above, or decrease
below the resonant value.
  Applying this criterion to the two inner planets orbiting GJ163, we deduce
that the current period ratio (2.97) could be the outcome of dissipation in the
3:1 MMR provided that the innermost planet is gaseous (slow dissipation) while
the second one is rocky (faster dissipation). We perform N-body simulations
with tidal dissipation to confirm the results of our analytical model.
  We also apply our criterion on GJ581b, c (5:2 MMR) and reproduce the current
period ratio (2.4) if the inner planet is gaseous and the outer is rocky (as
for GJ163).
  Finally, we apply our model to the Kepler mission's statistics. We show that
the excess of planets pairs close to first order MMR but in external
circulation, i.e., with period ratios P_out/P_in > (p+1)/p for the resonance
(p+1):p, can be reproduced by tidal dissipation in the inner planet. There is

detected by HIFI suggests preferential emission from the subsolar point.
However, it is also possible that water sublimation occurs in small ice-bearing
grains that are emitted from an active region on the nucleus surface at a speed
of ~ 0.2 km s$^{-1}$. The dust thermal emission was detected in the 70 and 160
{\mu}m filters, with a more extended emission in the blue channel. The dust
production rates, obtained for a dust size distribution index that explains the
fluxes at the photocenters of the PACS images, lie in the range 70-110 kg
s$^{-1}$. Scaling the CO production rate measured post-perihelion at 3.20 and
3.32 AU, these values correspond to a dust-to-gas production rate ratio in the
range 0.3-0.4. The dust production rates derived in August 2010 are roughly one
order of magnitude lower than in September 2009, suggesting that the
dust-to-gas production rate ratio remained approximately constant during the
period when the activity became increasingly dominated by CO outgassing.

photometric bandpasses from 0.4 to 12 {\mu}m using timeseries observations of
134 stars. The Bayesian formalism, extended from our previous work to include
the effects of line-of-sight dust extinction, allows for the simultaneous
inference of the posterior distribution of the mean absolute magnitude, slope
of the period-magnitude power-law, and intrinsic scatter about a perfect
power-law for each bandpass. In addition, the distance modulus and
line-of-sight dust extinction to each RR Lyrae star in the calibration sample
is determined, yielding a sample median fractional distance error of 0.66%. The
intrinsic scatter in all bands appears to be larger than the photometric
errors, except in WISE W1 (3.4 {\mu}m) and W2 (4.6 {\mu}m) where the
photometric error ($\sigma \approx 0.05$ mag) is to be comparable or larger
than the intrinsic scatter. Additional observations at these wavelengths could
improve the inferred distances to these sources further. As an application of
the methodology, we infer the distance to the RRc-type star RZCep at low
Galactic latitude ($b = 5.5^\circ$) to be $\mu=8.0397\pm0.0123$ mag
($405.4\pm2.3$ pc) with colour excess $E(B-V)=0.2461\pm0.0089$ mag. This
distance, equivalent to a parallax of $2467\pm14$ microarcsec, is consistent
with the published HST parallax measurement but with an uncertainty that is 13
times smaller than the HST measurement. If our measurements (and methodology)
hold up to scrutiny, the distances to these stars have been determined to an
accuracy comparable to those expected with Gaia. As RR Lyrae are one of the
primary components of the cosmic distance ladder, the achievement of sub-1%
distance errors within a formalism that accounts for dust extinction may be
considered a strong buttressing of the path to eventual 1% uncertainties in
Hubble's constant.

environments in the Universe. In this paper we ask when these dense cores were
formed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. We select
galaxies that have a stellar mass >3x10^10 Msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,
using the 3D-HST survey and data at low redshift. Remarkably, the number
density of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 to
the present. This decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and the
resulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. We infer
that dense cores were mostly formed at z>2.5, consistent with their largely
quiescent stellar populations. While the cores appear to form early, the
galaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses
increase by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radii
increase by a factor of 5-6. As a result, the contribution of dense cores to
the total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% at
z=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. Because of their early formation, the contribution of
dense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the Universe is a strong
function of redshift. The stars in cores with M_1kpc>3x10^10 Msun make up ~0.1%
of the stellar mass density of the Universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, depending
on their IMF. The formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11

of broad emission lines in the optical spectrum, our observations demonstrate
that Mrk 590 has now become a ""changing look"" AGN. If classified by recent
optical spectra, Mrk 590 would be a Seyfert ~1.9-2, where the only broad
emission line still visible in the optical spectrum is a weak component of
Halpha. As an additional consequence of this change, we have definitively
detected UV narrow-line components in a Type 1 AGN, allowing an analysis of
these emission-line components with high-resolution COS spectra. These
observations challenge the historical paradigm that AGN type is only a
consequence of the line of sight viewing angle toward the nucleus in the

processing, PolSAR systems generate images which present a granular noise
called speckle. As a potential solution for reducing such interference, the
parameter $L$ controls the signal-noise ratio. Thus, the proposal of efficient
estimation methodologies for $L$ has been sought. To that end, we consider
firstly that a PolSAR image is well described by the scaled complex Wishart
distribution. In recent years, Anfinsen et al. derived and analyzed estimation
methods based on the ML and on trace statistical moments for obtaining the
parameter $L$ of the unscaled version of such probability law. This paper
generalizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed
by Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula
of the profile likelihood modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of $L$ is
discussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators for the parameter $L$,
which are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen et al. The
performance of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo
experiments, adopting three statistical measures as comparison criterion: the
mean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation. Equivalently to
the simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the
proposed estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.

expansion in the presence of large bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_{cc}$,
we find that the theory admits branches of de Sitter solutions in which the
scale of the Hubble parameter is inversely proportional to a power of
$\Lambda_{cc}$. Hence, a large value of $\Lambda_{cc}$ leads to a small size
for the Hubble scale. In an appropriate limit, in which the symmetry breaking
parameters are small, the theory recovers the Abelian symmetry plus an
additional Galileon symmetry acting on the longitudinal vector polarization.
The approximate Galileon symmetry can make the structure of this theory stable

that no manifest instabilities arise, and that the transverse vector

both problems in the (semi-)external model by adapting the size-constrained

prerequisite for the (semi-)external graph partitioning algorithm. The
algorithm is then used for both the coarsening and the refinement phase of a
multilevel algorithm to compute graph partitions. Our algorithm is able to
partition and cluster huge complex networks with billions of edges on cheap
commodity machines. Experiments demonstrate that the semi-external graph

for which resources needed for analysis are beyond human capabilities. To
process this information and to extract all possible knowledge, machine
learning techniques become necessary. Here we present a new method to
automatically discover unknown variable objects in large astronomical catalogs.
With the aim of taking full advantage of all the information we have about
known objects, our method is based on a supervised algorithm. In particular, we
train a random forest classifier using known variability classes of objects and
obtain votes for each of the objects in the training set. We then model this
voting distribution with a Bayesian network and obtain the joint voting
distribution among the training objects. Consequently, an unknown object is
considered as an outlier insofar it has a low joint probability. Our method is
suitable for exploring massive datasets given that the training process is
performed offline. We tested our algorithm on 20 millions light-curves from the
MACHO catalog and generated a list of anomalous candidates. We divided the
candidates into two main classes of outliers: artifacts and intrinsic outliers.
Artifacts were principally due to air mass variation, seasonal variation, bad
calibration or instrumental errors and were consequently removed from our
outlier list and added to the training set. After retraining, we selected about
4000 objects, which we passed to a post analysis stage by perfoming a
cross-match with all publicly available catalogs. Within these candidates we
identified certain known but rare objects such as eclipsing Cepheids, blue
variables, cataclysmic variables and X-ray sources. For some outliers there
were no additional information. Among them we identified three unknown
variability types and few individual outliers that will be followed up for a
deeper analysis.

hypotheses for further experiments. However, studies rarely consider the broad

symmetries that define the broad class of matching models are in fact the only
aspects of information truly revealed by observed pattern. Commonly observed
patterns derive from simple underlying symmetries. This article illustrates the
problem by showing the symmetry associated with the observed rate of increase
in fitness in a constant environment. That underlying symmetry reveals how each

Problem (VRP) with environmental considerations, recently introduced in the

while respecting capacity constraints and service time windows. Costs are based
on driver wages and fuel consumption, which depends on many factors, such as
travel distance and vehicle load. The vehicle speeds are considered as decision
variables. They complement routing decisions, impacting the total cost, the
travel time between locations, and thus the set of feasible routes. We propose
a method which combines a local search-based metaheuristic with an integer

speed-optimization algorithm. This hybridization enables to integrate more
tightly route and speed decisions. Moreover, two other ""green"" VRP variants,
the Fuel Consumption VRP (FCVRP) and the Energy Minimizing VRP (EMVRP), are
addressed. The proposed method compares very favorably with previous algorithms

second-order phase transitions connected to the Takhtajan--Babudjian integrable
point $\alpha_c(\beta=-1)=0$. In the opposite regime, $\beta>\beta^\ast$, the
transition from the Haldane phase becomes first-order into the next nearest
neighbor (NNN) AKLT phase. Based on field theoretical arguments and DMRG
calculations, we conjecture that these two regimes are separated by a
multicritical point ($\beta^\ast, \alpha^\ast$) of a different universality
class, described by the $SU(2)_4$ Wess--Zumino--Witten critical theory. From
the DMRG calculations we estimate this multicritical point to lie in the range
$-0.2<\beta^\ast<-0.15$ and $0.47<\alpha^\ast < 0.53$. We find that the
dimerized and NNN-AKLT phases are separated by a line of first-order phase
transitions that terminates at the multicritical point. Inside the Haldane
phase, we show the existence of two incommensurate crossovers: the Lifshitz
transition and the disorder transition of the first kind, marking
incommensurate correlations in momentum and real space, respectively. We show
these crossover lines stretch across the entire $(\beta,\alpha)$ phase diagram,
merging into a single incommensurate-to-commensurate transition line for
negative $\beta\lesssim \beta^\ast$ outside the Haldane phase.

Our algorithm is based on clustering the input graph into smaller sized

a careful pruning of the search space, and (2) the load on different reducers

actuation, sensing and communication architectures of the controller can no
longer be taken as given. In particular, controllers implemented using dense
architectures typically outperform controllers implemented using simpler ones
-- however, it is also desirable to minimize the cost of building the
architecture used to implement a controller. The recently introduced
Regularization for Design (RFD) framework poses the controller
architecture/control law co-design problem as one of jointly optimizing the
competing metrics of controller architecture cost and closed loop performance,
and shows that this task can be accomplished by augmenting the variational
solution to an optimal control problem with a suitable atomic norm penalty.
Although explicit constructions for atomic norms useful for the design of
actuation, sensing and joint actuation/sensing architectures are introduced, no
such construction is given for atomic norms used to design communication
architectures. This paper describes an atomic norm that can be used to design
communication architectures for which the resulting distributed optimal
controller is specified by the solution to a convex program. Using this atomic
norm we then show that in the context of $\mathcal{H}_2$ distributed optimal
control, the communication architecture/control law co-design task can be
performed through the use of finite dimensional second order cone programming.

a simple model to represent the different behaviors of subjects in information
cascade experiments, we assume that $X(t)$ is a mixture of an independent
random variable that takes 1 with probability $q$ and a random variable that
depends on the ratio $z$ of the variables taking 1 among recent $r$ variables.
We consider two types of the probability $f(z)$ that the latter takes 1: (i)
analog [$f(z)=z$] and (ii) digital [$f(z)=\theta(z-1/2)$]. We study the
universal functions of scaling for $\xi$ and the integrated correlation time
$\tau$. For finite $r$, $C(t)$ decays exponentially as a function of $t$, and
there is only one stable renormalization group (RG) fixed point. In the limit
$r\to \infty$, where $X(t)$ depends on all the previous variables, $C(t)$ in
model (i) obeys a power law, and the system becomes scale invariant. In model
(ii) with $q\neq 1/2$, there are two stable RG fixed points, which correspond
to the ordered and disordered phases of the information cascade phase
transition with critical exponents $\beta=1$ and $\nu_{||}=2$.

intertwined problems: human pose estimation (HPE) and garment attribute
classification (GAC), which are valuable for a variety of computer vision and
multimedia applications. Unlike previous works that usually handle the two
problems separately, our approach aims to produce a jointly optimal estimation
for both HPE and GAC via a unified inference procedure. To this end, we adopt a
preprocessing step to detect potential human parts from each image (i.e., a set
of ""candidates"") that allows us to have a manageable input space. In this way,
the simultaneous inference of HPE and GAC is converted to a structured learning
problem, where the inputs are the collections of candidate ensembles, the
outputs are the joint labels of human parts and garment attributes, and the
joint feature representation involves various cues such as pose-specific
features, garment-specific features, and cross-task features that encode
correlations between human parts and garment attributes. Furthermore, we
explore the ""strong edge"" evidence around the potential human parts so as to
derive more powerful representations for oriented human parts. Such evidences
can be seamlessly integrated into our structured learning model as a kind of
energy function, and the learning process could be performed by standard
structured Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. However, the joint
structure of the two problems is a cyclic graph, which hinders efficient
inference. To resolve this issue, we compute instead approximate optima by
using an iterative procedure, where in each iteration the variables of one
problem are fixed. In this way, satisfactory solutions can be efficiently
computed by dynamic programming. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets
show the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

simulations. In order to ensure that longitudinal compression and/or transverse
focusing of the laser pulse is not needed before the wake can self-trap the
plasma electrons, we have employed the ionization injection technique.
Furthermore, the plasma density is varied such that at the lowest densities,
the laser pulse occupies only a fraction of the first wavelength of the wake
oscillation (the accelerating bucket), whereas at the highest density, the same
duration laser pulse fills the entire first bucket. Although the trapped
electrons execute betatron oscillations due to the ion column in all cases, at
the lowest plasma density they do not interact with the laser field and the
energy gain is all due to the longitudinal wakefield. However, as the density
is increased, there can be a significant contribution to the maximum energy due
to direct laser acceleration (DLA) of those electrons that undergo betatron
motion in the plane of the polarization of the laser pulse. Eventually, DLA can
be the dominant energy gain mechanism over acceleration due to the longitudinal
field at the highest densities.

Stacey's crossed product that works well with non-injective $\alpha$'s.
  We provide descriptions of the lattices of ideals in $C^*(A,\alpha,J)$
consisting of gauge-invariant ideals and ideals generated by their intersection
with $A$. We investigate conditions under which these lattices coincide with
the set of all ideals in $C^*(A,\alpha,J)$. In particular, we obtain simplicity
criteria that besides minimality of the action require either outerness of
powers of $\alpha$ or pointwise quasinilpotence of $\alpha$.

map $\varrho:A\to A$ relative to an ideal in $A$. They generalize various
crossed products by endomorphisms when $\varrho$ is multiplicative. When $A$ is
commutative they include $C^*$-algebras associated to Markov operators by
Ionescu, Muhly, Vega, and to topological relations by Brenken, but in general
they are not modeled by topological quivers popularized by Muhly and Tomforde.
  We show that Exel's crossed product $A\rtimes_{\alpha,L} \mathbb{N}$,
generalized to the case where $A$ is not necessarily unital, is the crossed
product of $A$ by the transfer operator $L$ relative to the ideal generated by
$\alpha(A)$. We give natural conditions under which $\alpha(A)$ is uniquely
determined by $L$, and hence $A\rtimes_{\alpha,L} \mathbb{N}$ depends only on
$L$. Moreover, the $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}(A,\alpha,L)$ associated to
$(A,\alpha,L)$ by Exel and Royer always coincides with our unrelative crossed
product by $L$.
  As another non-trivial application of our construction we extend a result of
Brownlowe, Raeburn and Vittadello, by showing that the $C^*$-algebra of an
arbitrary infinite graph $E$ can be realized as a crossed product of the
diagonal algebra $\mathcal{D}_E$ by a `Perron-Frobenious' operator $L$. The
important difference is that in general there is no endomorphism $\alpha$ of
$\mathcal{D}_E$ making $(\mathcal{D}_E,\alpha,L)$ an Exel system.

turbulence, the model of vortex bundles, is used. This model is necessary to
mimic the vortex stretching, which is responsible for the energy transfer in
classical turbulence. In our consideration we do not appeal to the possible
""bundle arrangement"" but explore alternative idea that the turbulent spectra
appear from singular solution, which describe the collapsing line at moments of
reconnection. One more aim is related to an important and intensively discussed
topic - a role of hydrodynamic collapse in the formation of turbulent spectra.
We demonstrated that the specific vortex filament configuration generated the
spectrum $E(k)$ close to the Kolmogorov dependence and discussed the reason for
this as well as the reason for deviation. We also discuss the obtained results
from point of view of the both classical and quantum turbulence.

Perhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive SMBHBs, which might
be the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify. Liu et al.
predicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events
(TDEs), caused by the presence of a secondary SMBH. Here, we apply that model
to the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy SDSS J120136.02+300305.5,
which was identified as a candidate TDE with XMM-Newton. We show that the deep
dips in its evolving X-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of
a SMBHB at its core. A SMBHB model with a mass of the primary of M_BH = 10^7
M_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in good
agreement with the observations. Given that primary mass, introducing an
orbital eccentricity is needed, with e_b = 0.3. Alternatively, a lower mass
primary of M_BH = 10^6 M_sun in a circular orbit fits the light curve well.
Tight binaries like this one, which have already overcome the ""final parsec
problem,"" are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two SMBHs
coalesce. Future transient surveys, which will detect TDEs in large numbers,
will place tight constraints on the SMBHB fraction in otherwise non-active
galaxies.

the CF as the fraction of type 2 AGN in all AGNs whose MIR emissions are

steadily drives the starting Hamiltonian in momentum space to a diagonal form
in the infrared limit corresponding to a permutation of the eigenvalues and
depends on G. Levinson's theorem establishes a relation between phase-shifts
and the number of bound-states. We show that unitarily equivalent Hamiltonians
on the grid generate reaction matrices which are compatible with Levinson's
theorem but are phase-inequivalent along the SRG trajectory. An isospectral
definition of the phase-shift in terms of an energy-shift is possible but
requires in addition a proper ordering of states on a momentum grid in order to
fulfill Levinson's theorem. We show how the SRG with different generators G
induces different isospectral flows in the presence of bound-states, leading to
distinct orderings in the infrared limit. While the Wilson generator induces an
ascending ordering incompatible with Levinson's theorem, the Wegner generator
provides a much better ordering, although not the optimal one. We illustrate

to the radio power control problems in wireless networks. Although these
algorithms are shown to converge to the fixed points that give feasible problem
solutions, the solutions often lack notion of problem optimality. This paper
reconsiders well known fixed point algorithms such as those with standard and
type-II standard interference functions, and investigates the conditions under
which they give optimal power control solutions by the recently proposed
Fast-Lipschitz optimization framework. When the qualifying conditions of
Fast-Lipschitz optimization apply, it is established that the fixed points are
the optimal solutions of radio power optimization problems. The analysis is
performed by a logarithmic transformation of variables that gives problems
treatable within the Fast-Lipschitz framework. It is shown how the logarithmic
problem constraints are contractive by the standard or type-II standard
assumptions on the original power control problem, and how a set of cost
functions fulfill the Fast-Lipschitz qualifying conditions. The analysis on non
monotonic interference function allows to establish a new qualifying condition
for Fast-Lipschitz optimization. The results are illustrated by considering
power control problems with standard interference function, problems with
type-II standard interference functions, and a case of sub-homogeneous power
control problems. It is concluded that Fast-Lipschitz optimization may play an
important role in many resource allocation problems in wireless networks.

Modeling of the reactors has become increasingly sophisticated, employing Monte

the isomer $^{176\mathrm{m}}$ Lu, that warrants further investigation. Studies
of the time dependence of dimensionless fundamental constants have been a
driver for much of the recent work on Oklo. We critically review neutron
resonance energy shifts and their dependence on the fine structure constant
$\alpha$ and the ratio $X_q=m_q/\Lambda$ (where $m_q$ is the average of the $u$

on the diversity of receptors displayed at the surface of immune cells. T-cell
receptor diversity results from an initial random DNA editing process, called
VDJ recombination, followed by functional selection of cells according to the
interaction of their surface receptors with self and foreign antigenic
peptides. To quantify the effect of selection on the highly variable elements
of the receptor, we apply a probabilistic maximum likelihood approach to the
analysis of high-throughput sequence data from the $\beta$-chain of human
T-cell receptors. We quantify selection factors for V and J gene choice, and
for the length and amino-acid composition of the variable region. Our approach
is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in
the recombination process. Inferred selection factors differ little between
donors, or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared
between donors is well-predicted by the model, indicating a purely stochastic
origin of such ""public"" sequences. We find a significant correlation between
biases induced by VDJ recombination and our inferred selection factors,
together with a reduction of diversity during selection. Both effects suggest
that natural selection acting on the recombination process has anticipated the
selection pressures experienced during somatic evolution.

generated by live agents: once the systems change due to the adoption of the
prediction models learnt from the behavior data, agents will observe and
respond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. As a
result, the behavior data will evolve and will not be identically and
independently distributed, posing great challenges to the theoretical analysis
on the machine learning algorithms for behavior prediction. To tackle this
challenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments

the machine learning algorithms on its basis. Since the one-step transition
probability matrix of MCRE depends on both previous states and the random

transforms the original MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov
chain. The new Markov chain involves more variables but is more regular, and
thus easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when
time approaches infinity. Then we prove a generalization bound for the machine
learning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain,

function class compounded by the loss function for behavior prediction and the
behavior prediction model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that performs the generalization analysis on data generated by complex

this pitch on the signal's duration time is found for subjects tested with
Gaussian pulses. The discrimination threshold for the pulse duration time
reported on the basis of the effective pitch increases proportionally to the
duration time itself, i.e. it follows the Weber-Fechner law. A model based on
the ""Helmholtz's harp"" idea, i.e. a series of damped resonators tuned in the
audible range of frequencies, reveals the mechanism of producing a maximum in
the filtered spectrum of the pulse. This corroborates the power law in the
dependence of the position of the maximum on the duration time of the pulse.
The model indicates a possibility of designing a manmade device dedicated to
determination of the durations so short that they are inaccessible by direct
measurements.

cryptosystem over the abelian group U(n) where n is one of the following forms
p^m, or 2p^m where p is an odd large prime and m is a positive integer. It is
another good way to deal with the ElGamal Cryptosystem using that abelian group
U(n)={x: x is a positive integer such that x<n and gcd(n,x)=1} in the setting
of the discrete logarithm problem . Since I show in this paper that this new
study maintains equivalent (or better) security with the original ElGamal
cryptosystem(invented by Taher ElGamal in 1985)[1], that works over the finite
cyclic group of the finite field. It gives a better security because
theoretically ElGamal Cryptosystem with U(p^m) or with U(2p^m) is much more
secure since the possible solutions for the discrete logarithm will be
increased, and that would make this cryptosystem is hard to broken even with
thousands of years.

ferroelectric oxide as the complementary gate dielectric operating in negative
capacitance zone, called the Negative Capacitance Tunnel FET (NCTFET). The
proposed device effectively combines two different mechanisms of lowering the
sub threshold swing (SS) for a transistor garnering a further lowered one
compared to conventional TFET. A simple yet accurate analytical tunnel current
model for the proposed device is also presented here. The developed analytical
model demonstrates high ON current at low $V_{GS}$ and exhibits lower SS.
