  Sardinia 2009 Symposium",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An accurate method for enumerating pathogen indicators, such as Escherichia
coli (E. coli), and Salmonella spp. is important for assessing the safety of
compost samples. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of pathogen
indicators in compost samples by using a molecular approach known as Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR). The DNA sample was extracted from sewage sludge compost.
The specificity of the probes and primers at the species level were verified by
performing NCBI-BLAST2 (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Primers that target
the gadAB gene for E.coli and invA gene for Salmonella spp. were selected which
produce fragment lengths around 670bp and 285bp respectively. The primers were
tested against bacterial cultures of both species and produced a strong signal
band of the expected fragment length. It provided results within 6 hours which
is relatively rapid compared to conventional culturing techniques. The other
advantages of PCR are shown to be its high sensitivity, and high specificity.

to the analysis of early mechanically-induced differentiation in adult human

  Probabilistic Logic","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1305.2254",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One important challenge for probabilistic logics is reasoning with very large
knowledge bases (KBs) of imperfect information, such as those produced by
modern web-scale information extraction systems. One scalability problem shared
by many probabilistic logics is that answering queries involves ""grounding"" the
query---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation---and the size of a
""grounding"" grows with database size. To address this bottleneck, we present a
first-order probabilistic language called ProPPR in which that approximate
""local groundings"" can be constructed in time independent of database size.
Technically, ProPPR is an extension to stochastic logic programs (SLPs) that is
biased towards short derivations; it is also closely related to an earlier
relational learning algorithm called the path ranking algorithm (PRA). We show
that the problem of constructing proofs for this logic is related to
computation of personalized PageRank (PPR) on a linearized version of the proof
space, and using on this connection, we develop a proveably-correct approximate
grounding scheme, based on the PageRank-Nibble algorithm. Building on this, we
develop a fast and easily-parallelized weight-learning algorithm for ProPPR. In
experiments, we show that learning for ProPPR is orders magnitude faster than
learning for Markov logic networks; that allowing mutual recursion (joint
learning) in KB inference leads to improvements in performance; and that ProPPR
can learn weights for a mutually recursive program with hundreds of clauses,
which define scores of interrelated predicates, over a KB containing one
million entities.

to be a remarkably fertile ground for the study of gravity and higher spin
fields. The theory is topological and, since there are no propagating field
degrees of freedom, the asymptotic symmetries become all the more crucial. For
pure (2+1) gravity they consist of two copies of the Virasoro algebra. There
exists a black hole which may be endowed with all the corresponding charges.
The pure (2+1) gravity theory may be reformulated in terms of two Chern-Simons
connections for sl(2,R). An immediate generalization containing gravity and a
finite number of higher spin fields may be achieved by replacing sl(2,R) by
sl(3,R) or, more generally, by sl(N,R). The asymptotic symmetries are then two
copies of the so-called W_N algebra, which contains the Virasoro algebra as a
subalgebra. The question then arises as to whether there exists a
generalization of the standard pure gravity (2+1) black hole which would be
endowed with all the W_N charges. The original pioneering proposal of a black
hole along this line for N=3 turns out, as shown in this paper, to actually
belong to the so called ""diagonal embedding"" of sl(2,R) in sl(3,R), and it is
therefore endowed with charges of lower rather than higher spins. In
contradistinction, we exhibit herein the most general black hole which belongs
to the ""principal embedding"". It is endowed with higher spin charges, and
possesses two copies of W_3 as its asymptotic symmetries. The most general
diagonal embedding black hole is studied in detail as well, in a way in which
its lower spin charges are clearly displayed. The extension to N>3 is also
discussed. A general formula for the entropy of a generalized black hole is
obtained in terms of the on-shell holonomies.

the cosine of the channel's time-energy cost (except when the fidelity is

intimate connection between information and physics. Our exact result may also

variant of mutual information, directional information captures the directional
information flow and temporal structure of video sequences across frames.
Meanwhile, within each frame, Markov random fields are utilized to model the
spatial relations among different parts of a human body and the body parts of
different people. The proposed SODA+MRF model is robust to view point
transformations and detect complex interactions accurately. We compare the
proposed method against several baseline methods to highlight the effectiveness
of the SODA+MRF model. We demonstrate that our algorithm has superior action

bottlenecks and identify strategies to overcome them. For this, both
applications and system software must be analysed and potentially improved. The
EU FP7 project Collaborative Research into Exascale Systemware, Tools &
Applications (CRESTA) chose the approach to co-design advanced simulation
applications and system software as well as development tools. In this paper,
we present the results of a co-design activity focused on the simulation code
NEK5000 that aims at performance improvements of collective communication
operations. We have analysed the algorithms that form the core of NEK5000's
communication module in order to assess its viability on recent computer
architectures before starting to improve its performance. Our results show that
the crystal router algorithm performs well in sparse, irregular collective
operations for medium and large processor number but improvements for even
larger system sizes of the future will be needed. We sketch the needed
improvements, which will make the communication algorithms also beneficial for
other applications that need to implement latency-dominated communication
schemes with short messages. The latency-optimised communication operations
will also become used in a runtime-system providing dynamic load balancing,
under development within CRESTA.

solar energetic-particle (SEP) events with measurable abundances of ions with
atomic number Z>2 observed on the Wind spacecraft, and their relationship with
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric
Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). On
average the element abundances in these events are similar to coronal
abundances at low Z but, for heavier elements, enhancements rise as a power law
in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q of the ions (at coronal temperatures of 2.5-3
MK) to a factor of 3 at Ne, 9 at Fe, and 900 for 75<Z<83. Energy dependences of
abundances are minimal in the 2-15 MeV/amu range. The 111 of these Fe-rich
impulsive SEP events we found, between November 1994 and August 2013 using the
Wind spacecraft, have a 69% association rate with CMEs. The CMEs are narrow
with a median width of 75 deg, are characteristically from western longitudes
on the Sun, and have a median speed of ~600 km/s. Nearly all SEP onsets occur
within 1.5-5 h of the CME onset. The faster (>700 km/s), wider CMEs in our
sample are related to SEPs with coronal abundances indicating hot coronal
plasma with fully ionized He, C, N and O and moderate enhancements of heavier
elements, relative to He, but slower (<700 km/s), narrower CMEs emerge from
cooler plasma where higher SEP mass-to-charge ratios, A/Q, yield much greater
abundance enhancements, even for C/He and O/He. Apparently, the open
magnetic-reconnection region where the impulsive SEPs are accelerated also
provides the energy to drive out CME plasma, accounting for a strong, probably
universal, impulsive SEP-CME association.

the standard definition fails to capture that discordances between items with
high rank are more important than those between items with low rank. Recently,
a new measure of correlation based on average precision has been proposed to
solve this problem, but like many alternative proposals in the literature it
assumes that there are no ties in the scores. This is a major deficiency in a
number of contexts, and in particular while comparing centrality scores on
large graphs, as the obvious baseline, indegree, has a very large number of
ties in web and social graphs. We propose to extend Kendall's definition in a
natural way to take into account weights in the presence of ties. We prove a

wave modes on the Sun coincide closely with the 88 day period and 176 day sub
harmonic period of Mercury and evidence of Rossby waves on the Sun at the same
periods. To test the hypothesis that Rossby waves trigger the emergence of
sunspots we use band pass filtering to obtain the 88 day period and 176 day
period components of hemispherical sunspot area and compare the variations to
the tidal height variation on the surface of the Sun due to Mercury. We find
that the two components of hemispherical sunspot area occur in several episodes
or activations of duration 2 to 6 years during each solar cycle. When the
activations are discrete the variation of the 88 day and 176 day period
components are phase coherent with the tidal height variation and a 180 degree
phase change is evident between successive activations. We use this result to
demonstrate that Rieger type quasi-periodicities in sunspot activity are, in
most reported cases, periodicities associated with sidebands of the 88 day and
176 day period variation. We find that, in variables that arise from activity
in both solar hemispheres, phase coherence with the Mercury tidal effect occurs
at infrequent intervals but, when it does occur, it is possible to observe
phase coherence of variables such as sunspot number, solar flares, solar wind
speed and cosmic ray flux with the Mercury tidal effect. Sensitivity of a range
of variables to the tidal effect is calculated for such intervals in solar

with a potentially unbounded number of rows and columns. The three
distributions we consider are derived from the gamma-Poisson, gamma-negative
binomial, and beta-negative binomial processes. Because the models lead to
closed-form Gibbs sampling update equations, they are natural candidates for
nonparametric Bayesian priors over count matrices. A key aspect of our analysis
is the recognition that, although the random count matrices within the family
are defined by a row-wise construction, their columns can be shown to be i.i.d.
This fact is used to derive explicit formulas for drawing all the columns at
once. Moreover, by analyzing these matrices' combinatorial structure, we
describe how to sequentially construct a column-i.i.d. random count matrix one
row at a time, and derive the predictive distribution of a new row count vector
with previously unseen features. We describe the similarities and differences
between the three priors, and argue that the greater flexibility of the gamma-
and beta- negative binomial processes, especially their ability to model
over-dispersed, heavy-tailed count data, makes these well suited to a wide
variety of real-world applications. As an example of our framework, we
construct a naive-Bayes text classifier to categorize a count vector to one of
several existing random count matrices of different categories. The classifier
supports an unbounded number of features, and unlike most existing methods, it
does not require a predefined finite vocabulary to be shared by all the
categories, and needs neither feature selection nor parameter tuning. Both the
gamma- and beta- negative binomial processes are shown to significantly
outperform the gamma-Poisson process for document categorization, with
comparable performance to other state-of-the-art supervised text classification
algorithms.

has a non-quantized magneto-electric coupling even though its electronic
structure does not break parity and time-reversal symmetry, and (iii) the
magnitude of the magneto-electric coupling in bilayer graphene is determined by
the valley-isospin density, which can be manipulated experimentally. This last
property also enables a purely electric measurement of valley-isospin
densities. While our theoretical arguments use bilayer graphene as an example,

center of mass of the system does not remain stationary even if the system is
isolated. In a subsequent work we demonstrated that the violation of the center
of mass motion theorem for isolated systems with spin is a direct consequence
of the conservation of total angular momentum. We also show that there exists a
generalized center of mass and spin which moves with constant velocity. In this

density instead of being of microscopic origin appears by a scaling process,
the macroscopic Belinfante-Rosenfeld tensor emerges from the average of the
microscopic energy-momentum tensor as the true macroscopic energy momentum

The power of magnetic fluctuations is projected into directions perpendicular

Comparison amongst magnetic, velocity, and density spectra are also made,
demonstrating that the energy of the turbulence observed is primarily seeded by
magnetic fields created during plasma production. Direct spatial spectra are
constructed using multi-channel diagnostics and are used to compare to
frequency spectra converted to spatial scales using the Taylor Hypothesis.
Evidence for the observation of dissipation due to ion inertial length scale

Combined with the requirement that ideal measurements remain so when

contextuality that can be found in an arbitrary physical theory, bringing down
the violation of Bell and Kocher-Specker inequalities near to its quantum

non-Gaussianity parameters, as well as the probability density function
$P(x,t)$ we analyze the weakly non-ergodic character of the heterogeneous

individual realization. As we show, the fluctuations between individual
realizations increase with growing modulus $|\alpha|$ of the scaling exponent.
The fluctuations appear to diverge when the critical value $\alpha=2$ is
approached, while for even larger $\alpha$ the fluctuations decrease, again. At
criticality, the power-law behavior of the mean squared displacement changes to
an exponentially fast growth, and the fluctuations of the time averaged mean
squared displacement do not seem to converge for increasing number of
realizations. From a systematic comparison we observe some striking
similarities of the heterogeneous diffusion process with the familiar
subdiffusive continuous time random walk process with power-law waiting time

dSph galaxies agrees with the possible existence of DM particles with mass
$m_w\sim 15 - 20keV$. More complex analysis utilizes the well known semi
analytical model of formation of DM halos in order to describe the basic
properties of corresponding objects and to estimate their redshifts of
formation. For the DM halos this redshift is determined by their masses and the
initial power spectrum of density perturbations. This correlation allows us to
partly reconstruct the small scale spectrum of perturbations. We consider the
available sample of suitable observed objects that includes $\sim 40$ DM
dominated galaxies and $\sim 40$ clusters of galaxies and we show that the
observed characteristics of these objects are inconsistent with expectations of
the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. However, they are consistent with
a more complex DM model with a significant contribution of the hot DM--like
power spectrum with relatively large damping scale ($\sim 10 - 30Mpc$). The HDM

Owing to an optomechanical coupling, the \emph{a priori} phonon-state
distributions contribute to the spectral magnitude, and hence we can infer
information on the phonon states from the measured spectral data. When the
single-photon optomechanical-coupling strength is moderately larger than the
mechanical frequency, then our method works well for a wide range of
cavity-field decay rates, irrespective of whether or not the system is in the
resolved-sideband regime.

cognitive impairment (MCI) can be critical for early treatment and thus has
attracted more and more attention nowadays. Since first introduced, machine
learning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related
research. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a
machine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted
to represent the MRI images. While good representations can be pivotal to the
classification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on
human labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated
to AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires
domain knowledge and is costly and tedious.
  Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to
remove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI
images. In other words, we can let the machine learning methods to figure out
these informative and discriminative image structures for AD classification. In
this work, we propose to learn deep convolutional image features using
unsupervised and supervised learning. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful
tool in the machine learning community and has been successfully applied to
various tasks. We thus propose to exploit deep features of MRI images based on
a pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD and MCI
classification, which spares the effort of manual ROI annotation process.

the temperature-induced bias on power measurements. This will help them gather
temperature-neutral power data while running multiple instance of their
benchmarks. Also power requirements and system failure rates can be decreased
by controlling the CPU's thermal behavior.
  Even though it is usually assumed that the temperature/power relationship is
exponentially related, there is however a lack of publicly available physical
temperature/power measurements to back up this assumption, something our paper
corrects. Via measurements on two pertinent platforms sporting nanometer-scale

quantitative relation between the ""mean error"" of a measurement of one
observable and the disturbance thereby caused on another observable. Heisenberg
derived this famous relation under an additional assumption on quantum
measurements that has been abandoned in the modern theory, and its universal
validity was questioned in a debate on the sensitivity limit to
gravitational-wave detectors in 1980s. A universally valid form of the
error-disturbance relation was shown to be derived in the modern framework of
general quantum measurements in 2003. We have experienced a considerable
progress in theoretical and experimental study of error-disturbance relations
in the last decade. In 2013 Branciard showed a new stronger form of universally
valid error-disturbance relations, one of which is proved tight for spin
measurements carried out in ""pure"" states. Nevertheless, a recent
information-theoretical study of error-disturbance relations has suggested that
Branciard relations can be considerably strengthened for measurements in mixed
states. Here, we show a method for strengthening Branciard relations in mixed
states and derive several new universally valid and stronger error-disturbance
relations in mixed states. In particular, it is proved that one of them gives
an ultimate error-disturbance relation for spin measurements, which is tight in
any state. The new relations will play an important role in applications to
state estimation problems including quantum cryptographic scenarios.

argument that optimizing the long-term well-being through effort and social
feeling state distribution (mean-field) will help to stabilize marriage.
However, if the cost of effort is very high, the couple fluctuates in a bad
feeling state or the marriage breaks down. We then examine the influence of
society on a couple using mean field sentimental games. We show that, in
mean-field equilibrium, the optimal effort is always higher than the one-shot
optimal effort. We illustrate numerically the influence of the couple's network
on their feeling states and their well-being.

augmented metric graphs to a morphism of algebraic curves as the non-vanishing
of certain Hurwitz numbers, and we give various conditions under which this
obstruction does vanish. In particular we show that any finite harmonic
morphism of (non-augmented) metric graphs lifts. We also give various
applications of these results. For example, we show that linear equivalence of
divisors on a tropical curve C coincides with the equivalence relation
generated by declaring that the fibers of every finite harmonic morphism from C
to the tropical projective line are equivalent. We study liftability of
metrized complexes equipped with a finite group action, and use this to
classify all augmented metric graphs arising as the tropicalization of a
hyperelliptic curve. We prove that there exists a d-gonal tropical curve that
does not lift to a d-gonal algebraic curve.

a distributed sensor network. The sparse multiple measurement vector signals
(MMVs) observed by all the nodes are assumed to have a common (but unknown)
sparsity pattern. To accurately recover the common sparsity pattern in a
decentralized manner with a low communication overhead of the network, we
develop an algorithm named decentralized and collaborative subspace pursuit
(DCSP). In DCSP, each node is required to perform three kinds of operations per
iteration: 1) estimate the local sparsity pattern by finding the subspace that
its measurement vector most probably lies in; 2) share its local sparsity
pattern estimate with one-hop neighboring nodes; and 3) update the final
sparsity pattern estimate by majority vote based fusion of all the local
sparsity pattern estimates obtained in its neighborhood. The convergence of
DCSP is proved and its communication overhead is quantitatively analyzed. We
also propose another decentralized algorithm named generalized DCSP (GDCSP) by
allowing more information exchange among neighboring nodes to further improve
the accuracy of sparsity pattern recovery at the cost of increased
communication overhead. Experimental results show that, 1) compared with
existing decentralized algorithms, DCSP provides much better accuracy of
sparsity pattern recovery at a comparable communication cost; and 2) the
accuracy of GDCSP is very close to that of centralized processing.
