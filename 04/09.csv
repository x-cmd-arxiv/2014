inertial from the dissipation range in power density spectra of interplanetary
magnetic field fluctuations, between $0.42$ and $5.3$ AU, during radial
alignments between MESSENGER and WIND for the inner heliosphere and between
WIND and ULYSSES for the outer heliosphere. We found that the spectral break
moves to higher and higher frequencies as the heliocentric distance decreases.
The radial dependence of the corresponding wavenumber is of the kind
$\kappa_b\sim R^{-1.08}$ in good agreement with that of the wavenumber derived
from the linear resonance condition for proton cyclotron damping. These results
support conclusions from previous studies which suggest that a
cyclotron-resonant dissipation mechanism must participate into the spectral
cascade together with other possible kinetic noncyclotron-resonant mechanisms.

energy expansion of type~IIB string theory has been conjectured to be a
solution of an inhomogeneous Laplace eigenvalue equation, obtained by
considering the toroidal compactification of two-loop Feynman diagrams of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. In this paper we determine the exact
$SL(2,\mathbb Z)$-invariant solution $f(x+iy)$ to this differential equation
satisfying an appropriate moderate growth condition as $y\to \infty$ (the weak
coupling limit). The solution is presented as a Fourier series with modes
$\widehat{f}_n(y) e^{2\pi i n x}$, where the mode coefficients,
$\widehat{f}_n(y)$ are bilinear in $K$-Bessel functions. Invariance under
$SL(2,\mathbb Z)$ requires these modes to satisfy the nontrivial boundary
condition $ \widehat{f}_n(y) =O(y^{-2})$ for small $y$, which uniquely
determines the solution. The large-$y$ expansion of $f(x+iy)$ contains the
known perturbative (power-behaved) terms, together with precisely-determined
exponentially decreasing contributions that have the form expected of
D-instantons, anti-D-instantons and D-instanton/anti-D-instanton pairs.

to evaluate several flaring scenarios related to magnetic-field amplification
and enhanced particle acceleration. The code explicitly accounts for
light-travel-time effects and is applied to flares observed in the flat
spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 0208-512, which show optical/{\gamma}-ray
correlation at some times, but orphan optical flares at other times. Changes in
both the magnetic field and the particle acceleration efficiency are explored
as causes of flares. Generally, external Compton emission appears to describe
the available data better than a synchrotron self-Compton scenario, and in
particular orphan optical flares are difficult to produce in the SSC framework.
X-ray soft-excesses, {\gamma}-ray spectral hardening, and the detections at
very high energies of certain FSRQs during flares find natural explanations in
the EC scenario with particle acceleration change. Likewise, optical flares
with/without {\gamma}-ray counterparts can be explained by different
allocations of energy between the magnetization and particle acceleration,
which may be related to the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the
jet flow. We also calculate the degree of linear polarization and polarization
angle as a function of time for a jet with helical magnetic field. Tightening
of the magnetic helix immediately downstream of the jet perturbations, where
flares occur, can be sufficient to explain the increases in the degree of
polarization and a rotation by >= 180 degree of the observed polarization
angle, if light-travel-time effects are properly considered.

partially observed discrete-event systems as a condition stronger than
observability, but weaker than normality. However, unlike observability,
relative observability is closed under language unions, which makes it
interesting for practical applications. In this paper, we investigate this
notion in the framework of coordination control. We prove that conditional
normality is a stronger condition than conditional (strong) relative
observability, hence conditional strong relative observability can be used in
coordination control instead of conditional normality, and present a
distributive procedure for the computation of a conditionally controllable and
conditionally observable sublanguage of the specification that contains the
supremal conditionally strong relative observable sublanguage.

proposed to make BB84 completely free from any side-channel in detectors. Like
in prepare & measure QKD, the use of other protocols in MDI setting would be
advantageous in some practical situations. In this paper, we consider SARG04
protocol in MDI setting. The prepare & measure SARG04 is proven to be able to
generate a key up to two-photon emission events. In MDI setting we show that
the key generation is possible from the event with single or two-photon
emission by a party and single-photon emission by the other party, but the
two-photon emission event by both parties cannot contribute to the key
generation. On the contrary to prepare & measure SARG04 protocol where the
experimental setup is exactly the same as BB84, the measurement setup for
SARG04 in MDI setting cannot be the same as that for BB84 since the measurement
setup for BB84 in MDI setting induces too many bit errors. To overcome this
problem, we propose two alternative experimental setups, and we simulate the
resulting key rate. Our study highlights the requirements that MDI QKD poses on
us regarding with the implementation of a variety of QKD protocols.

inelastic scattering due to the thermal activation of optical phonons. A linear

from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB). The search was
performed on data from the second joint science run of the LIGO and Virgo
detectors (July 2009 - October 2010) and was sensitive to IMBHBs with a range
up to $\sim 200$ Mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinations
of the binaries with respect to the line of sight. No significant candidate was
found. Upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning IMBHBs with
total masses between 100 and $450 \ \mbox{M}_{\odot}$ and mass ratios between
$0.25$ and $1\,$ were placed by combining this analysis with an analogous
search performed on data from the first LIGO-Virgo joint science run (November
2005 - October 2007). The most stringent limit was set for systems consisting
of two $88 \ \mbox{M}_{\odot}$ black holes and is equal to $0.12 \
\mbox{Mpc}^{-3} \ \mbox{Myr}^{-1}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level. This paper
also presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of the
impact on the search range of IMBHB spin configurations: the visible volume for
IMBHBs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population of
IMBHBs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum and
uniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas an
analogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by
$\sim 20\%\,$.

localization and estimation of dynamic targets that are sparsely distributed
over a large area. We generalize an existing framework [Bashan et al, 2008] for
adaptive allocation of sensing resources to the dynamic case, accounting for
time-varying target behavior such as transitions to neighboring cells and
varying amplitudes over a potentially long time horizon. The proposed adaptive
sensing policy is driven by minimization of a modified version of the
previously introduced ARAP objective function, which is a surrogate function
for mean squared error within locations containing targets. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the performance of adaptive sensing policies by
analyzing solutions with oracle knowledge of target locations, gaining insight
into the effect of target motion and amplitude variation as well as sparsity.
Exact minimization of the multi-stage objective function is infeasible, but
myopic optimization yields a closed-form solution. We propose a simple
non-myopic extension, the Dynamic Adaptive Resource Allocation Policy (D-ARAP),
that allocates a fraction of resources for exploring all locations rather than
solely exploiting the current belief state. Our numerical studies indicate that
D-ARAP has the following advantages: (a) it is more robust than the myopic
policy to noise, missing data, and model mismatch; (b) it performs comparably
to well-known approximate dynamic programming solutions but at significantly
lower computational complexity; and (c) it improves greatly upon non-adaptive
uniform resource allocation in terms of estimation error and probability of
detection.

MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on the surface brightness and velocity
dispersion profiles of globular clusters (GCs). Using N-MODY, which is an
N-body simulation code with a MOND potential solver, we show that the general
effect of the external field for diffuse clusters, which obey MOND in most of
their parts, is that it pushes the dynamics towards the Newtonian regime. On
the other hand, for more compact clusters, which are essentially Newtonian in
their inner parts, the external field is effective mainly in the outer parts of
compact clusters. As a case study, we then choose the remote Galactic GC NGC
2419. By varying the cluster mass, half-light radius, and mass-to-light ratio
we aim to find a model that will reproduce the observational data most
effectively, using N-MODY. We find that even if we take the Galactic external
field into account, a Newtonian Plummer sphere represents the observational
data better than MOND to an order of magnitude in terms of the total $\chi^2$
of surface brightness and velocity dispersion.

dimensionality of the system, and screened bodies can still feel external
fields. ORIGAMI is well-suited to this problem because it defines morphologies
according to the dimensionality of the collapsing structure and does not depend
on a smoothing scale or density threshold parameter. We find that halo
particles are screened while filament, wall, and void particles are unscreened,
and this is independent of the particle density. However, after separating
halos according to their large scale morphological environment, we find no
difference in the screening properties of halos in filaments versus halos in

halos is greatest well outside the virial radius. We confirm the theoretical
expectation that even if the internal field is suppressed by the Vainshtein

into a microchannel at atmospheric pressure. These simulations result from
numerical resolutions of reduced-order models. Indeed, combustion control into
microchannels would be allowed by fast simulations that in turn enable
real-time adjustments of the device's parameters. Former experimental studies
reported the occurrence of a Flame Repetitive Extinction/Ignition (FREI)
phenomenon provided that a temperature gradient is sustained at the channel's
walls. Conducting unsteady one-dimensional simulations including complex
chemistry, a late numerical study tried to explain the occurrence of this
phenomenon. The present study therefore explores low-dimensional models that
potentially reproduce the FREI phenomenon. Provided a calibration of some
empirical constants, an unsteady two-dimensional model including one-step
chemical reaction is shown to decently reproduce the FREI regime all along the
range of mixture flow rates investigated by the experimental studies.
Complementing the aforementioned numerical study, furthermore, when the
channel's diameter is varied, the two-dimensional model unveils an unstable
regime that a one-dimensional model cannot capture. As two-dimensional
hydrodynamics appears to play a key role into the flame's dynamics, therefore
the heat rate released by the microcombustor, one-dimensional models are not
believed to deliver an adequate strategy of combustion control into such
microchannels.

tensile studies are performed to quantify kinematic effects on failure

significant strain rate sensitivity is observed, resulting in reductions of
crack formation stresses on the order of 7 to 33%. Activation energies of crack
formation are calculated in the range of 0.58 to 2.07 eV based on an Arrhenius
relation that is fit to the collected simulation data. Physically, the
magnitude of activation energies in graphene tilt boundaries are found to be
linearly correlated to the pre-stress found at the critical bonds in graphene

to the projection of an emitting sphere onto the sky. The models in both
assumptions reproduce the radial profiles of Hbeta surface brightness, the
observed number of ionising photons, and the strong optical emission-line
relative intensities. The first approach produces a constant-density
matter-bounded thin shell of variable thickness and dust-to-gas ratio, while
the second gives place to a radiation-bounded thick shell sphere of decreasing
particle density. However, the radial profile of the 8/24 microns IR ratio,
depending on the gas and dust geometry, only fits well when the thick-shell
model is used. The resulting dust-to-gas mass ratio, which was obtained
empirically from the derived dust mass using data from Spitzer, also has a
better fit using the thick-shell solution. In both approaches, models support
the chemical homogeneity, and the ionisation-parameter radial decrease, These
results must be taken with care in view of the very low extinction values that
are derived from the IR, as compared to that derived from the Balmer decrement.
Besides, the IR can be possibly contaminated with the emission from a cloud of
diffuse gas and dust above the plane of the galaxy detected at 250 micron
Herschel image.

explains the recently reported anomalous peak in the galactic X-ray spectrum at

extension of the Standard Model, with the addition of a real scalar gauge
singlet field subject to a reflection symmetry. This symmetry breaks
spontaneously at an energy scale of a few MeV which triggers the decay of the
dark matter particle into two photons. In this framework, the Higgs boson of
the Standard Model is also the source of dark matter in the Universe. The model
fits the relic dark matter abundance and the partial lifetime for two photon
decay, while being consistent with constraints from domain wall formation and
dark matter self-interactions. We show that all these features of the model are
preserved in its natural embedding into a simple dark $U(1)$ gauge theory with
a Higgs mechanism. The properties of the dark photon get determined in such a
scenario. High precision cosmological measurements can potentially test these
models, as there are residual effects from domain wall formation and
non-negligible self-interactions of dark matter.

analytically solvable. The analytic forms of the pendulum's eigenfuntions make
it possible to find analytic expressions for observables of interest, such as
the expectation values of the angular momentum squared and of the orientation

the topology of the intersections of the pendulum's eigenenergy surfaces can be
characterized by a single integer index whose values correspond to the sets of

or cyclic symmetric double well potentials. Generic potentials are constructed
which allow for analytical estimates of the quantum dynamics in the
non-relativistic deep tunneling regime, in terms of the tunneling distance,
barrier height and mass (or moment of inertia). For cyclic systems, the results
may be scaled to agree well with periodic potentials for which semi-analytical
results in terms of Mathieu functions exist. Starting from a wavepacket which
is initially localized in one of the potential wells, the subsequent periodic
tunneling is associated with tunneling velocities. These velocities (or angular
velocities) are evaluated as the ratio of the flux densities versus the
probability densities. The maximum velocities are found under the top of the
barrier where they scale as the square root of the ratio of barrier height and
mass (or moment of inertia), independent of the tunneling distance. They are
applied exemplarily to several prototypical molecular models of non-cyclic and
cyclic tunneling, including ammonia inversion, Cope rearrangment of
semibullvalene, torsions of molecular fragments, and rotational tunneling in
strong laser fields. Typical maximum velocities and angular velocities are in
the order of a few km/s and from 10 to 100 THz for our non-cyclic and cyclic
systems, respectively, much faster than time-averaged velocities. Even for the
more extreme case of an electron tunneling through a barrier of height of one
Hartree, the velocity is only about one percent of the speed of light.
Estimates of the corresponding time scales for passing through {the narrow
domain just} below the potential barrier are in the domain from 2 to 40 fs,
much shorter than the tunneling times.

monolayer black phosphorus (phosphorene) nanoribbons (PNRs) via
first-principles simulations. The band gap of PNRs is strongly enhanced by
quantum confinement. However, differently orientated PNRs exhibit distinct
scaling laws for the band gap vs the ribbon width (w). The band gaps of
armchair PNRs scale as 1/(w^2), while zigzag PNRs exhibit a 1/w behavior. These
distinct scaling laws reflect a significant implication of the band dispersion
of phosphorene: electrons and holes behave as classical particles along the
zigzag direction, but resemble relativistic particles along the armchair
direction. This unexpected merging of classical and relativistic properties in
a single material may produce novel electrical and magnetotransport properties
of few-layer black phosphorus and its ribbon structures. Finally, the
respective PNRs host electrons and holes with markedly different effective
masses and optical responses, which are suitable for a wide range of
applications.

interactions not only suppresses number fluctuations to enhance number
squeezing, but can also enhance delocalization across wells and tunneling
between wells, each of which may suppress number squeezing. This results in a
dynamical competition whose resolution shows a complex dependence on all three

result from our simulations involves the relationship between squeezing and

a function of interaction strength until it reaches a maximum, after which it
decreases again. We also see a similar relationship between fragmentation and

natural to ask whether these advances in memory devices could also translate
into a new class of logic devices.
  What makes logic devices different from memory is the need for one device to
drive another and this calls for gain, directionality and input-output
isolation as exemplified by the transistor. With this in mind we will try to
present our perspective on how W and R devices in general, spintronic or
otherwise, could be integrated into transistor-like switches that can be
interconnected to build complex circuits without external amplifiers or clocks.
We will argue that the most common switch used to implement digital logic based
on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can be viewed as
an integrated W-R unit having an input-output asymmetry that give it gain and
directionality. Such a viewpoint is not intended to provide any insight into
the operation of CMOS switches, but rather as an aid to understanding how W and
R units based on spins and magnets can be combined to build transistor-like
switches. Next we will discuss the standard W and R units used for magnetic
memory devices and present one way to integrate them into a single unit with
the input electrically isolated from the output. But we argue that this
integrated W-R unit would not provide the key property of gain. We will then
show that the recently discovered giant spin Hall effect could be used to
construct a W-R unit with gain and suggest other possibilities for spin
switches with gain.

newborn stellar clusters. In optical images these so-called globulettes appear
as dark silhouettes against the bright nebular background. We have located
close to 300 globulettes in the Carina Nebula. The objects appear as
well-confined dense clumps and, as a rule, lack thinner envelopes, bright rims,
and tails. Some globulettes are slightly elongated with their major axes
oriented in the direction of young clusters in the complex. Many objects are
quite isolated and reside at projected distances >1.5 pc from other molecular
structures in the region. No globulette coincides in position with recognized
pre-main-sequence objects in the area.
  The objects are systematically much smaller, less massive, and much denser
than those surveyed in other H II regions. Practically all globulettes are of
planetary mass, and most have masses less than one Jupiter mass. The average
number densities exceed 10^5 cm^-3 in several objects. We have found a
statistical relation between density and radius (mass) in the sense that the
smallest objects are also the densest.
  The population of small globulettes in Carina appears to represent a more
advanced evolutionary state than those investigated in other H II regions. The
objects are subject to erosion in the intense radiation field, which would lead
to a removal of any thinner envelope and an unveiling of the core, which
becomes more compact with time. We discuss the possibility that the core may
become gravitationally unstable, in which case free-floating planetary mass
objects can form.

exhibits a brownmillerite structure, which is featured by alternating layers of
InO$_{6}$ octahedra and InO$_{4}$ tetrahedra. The transition from a
perovskite-like to a brownmillerite-like structure is featured by a
hydrated-to-intermediate phase transition at $ca.$ 370 {\deg}C. The structure
of the intermediate phase is similar to the structure of the fully dehydrated

temperatures below the hydrated-to-intermediate phase transition, dehydration
is featured by the release of protons confined to the layers of InO$_{4}$

of the vibrational spectra is not consistent with a single-phase spectrum, but
is in agreement with the superposition of spectra associated with two different
proton configurations. The relative contributions of the two proton

modeled the gamma-ray light curves of 40 LAT-detected MSPs using geometric

the radio profiles using a single-altitude hollow-cone beam, with a core
component when indicated by polarimetry; however, for MSPs with gamma-ray and
radio light curve peaks occurring at nearly the same rotational phase we assume
that the radio emission is co-located with the gamma rays and caustic in
nature. The best-fit parameters and confidence intervals are determined using a
maximum likelihood technique. We divide the light curves into three model
classes, with gamma-ray peaks trailing (Class I), aligned (Class II) or leading

best fit roughly equal numbers of Class I and II, while Class III are
exclusively fit with pair-starved polar cap models. Distinguishing between the

Unit instrument VIRUS-W at the 2.7m telescope of the McDonald Observatory in
Texas. Our analysis confirms the existence of two components. However, we find
them to be co-rotating. The first component is the more luminous (~ 77% of the
total light), has the higher velocity dispersion (~ 170 km/s) and rotates
relatively slowly (projected $v_{max}$ = 50 km/s). The lower luminosity second
component, (~ 23% of the total light), has a low velocity dispersion (~ 20
km/s) and rotates quickly (projected $v_{max}$ = 150 km/s). The difference in
the kinematics of the two stellar components allows us to perform a kinematic
decomposition and to measure the strengths of their Mg and Fe Lick indices
separately. The rotational velocities and dispersions of the less luminous and
faster component are very similar to those of the interstellar gas as measured
from the [OIII] emission. Morphological evidence of active star formation in
this component further suggests that NGC7217 may be in the process of
(re)growing a disk inside a more massive and higher dispersion stellar halo.
The kinematically cold and regular structure of the gas disk in combination
with the central almost dust-free morphology allows us to compare the dynamical
mass inside of the central 500pc with predictions from a stellar population
analysis. We find agreement between the two if a Kroupa stellar initial mass

transitions well before recombination the dark energy to dark matter fraction

of mixed moduli-anomaly (mirage) mediated SUSY breaking models (MMAMSB) whilst
respecting LHC Higgs mass and B-decay constraints (we do not impose LHC8
sparticle mass constraints due to the possibility of compressed spectra within
many of these models). We find mSUGRA, mGMSB, mAMSB and MMAMSB models all to be
highly fine-tuned. The NUHM1 model is moderately fine-tuned while NUHM2 which
allows for radiatively-driven naturalness (RNS) allows for fine-tuning at a
meager 10% level in the case where m(higgsinos) ~ 100-200 GeV and the TeV-scale
top squarks are well-mixed. Models with RNS may or may not be detect at LHC14.

inflationary plateau and the barrier generically leads to a potentially
observable suppression of the scalar power spectrum at large distances. Here we
revisit this analysis in light of the recent BICEP2 results. Assuming that both
the BICEP2 B-mode signal and the Planck analysis of temperature fluctuations
hold up, we find that the data now discriminate more sharply between our
scenario and $\Lambda$CDM. Nonzero tensor modes exclude standard $\Lambda$CDM
with notable but not yet conclusive confidence: at $\sim 3.8\,\sigma$ if
$r\approx0.2$, or at $\sim 3.5\,\sigma$ if $r=0.15$. Of the two steepening
models of our previous work, one is now ruled out by existing bounds on spatial
curvature. The other entirely reconciles the tension between BICEP2 and Planck.
Upcoming $EE$ polarization measurements have the potential to rule out
unmodified $\Lambda$CDM decisively. Next generation Large Scale Structure
surveys can further increase the significance. More precise measurements of
$BB$ at low $\ell$ will help distinguish our scenario from other explanations.
If steepening is confirmed, the prospects for detecting open curvature increase
but need not be large.

characterising the velocity field in cosmological N-body simulations is
inherently complicated by two facts: i) The velocity field becomes manifestly
multi-valued after shell-crossing and has discontinuities at caustics. This is
due to the collisionless nature of dark matter. ii) N-body simulations sample
the velocity field only at a set of discrete locations, with poor resolution in
low-density regions. In this paper, we discuss how the associated problems can
be circumvented by using a phase-space interpolation technique. This method

analyse the Fourier-space properties and provide fitting formulae for the

furthermore contrast some of the interesting differences in the velocity fields

Computational approaches are needed to characterize their morphologies over

of galaxies. The key to our approach is the division of a galaxy image into two
sections delineated by the isophote which encloses half the total brightness of
the galaxy. We call the central section the inner half-flux region (IHR) and
the outer section the outer half-flux region (OHR). From this division, we
derive two parameters: $A_{\rm o}$, which measures the asymmetry of the OHR,
and $D_{\rm o}$, which measures the deviation of the intensity weighted
centroid of the OHR from that of the IHR relative to the effective radius. We
derive the two parameters from $HST$/ACS $z_{850}$-band images for a sample of
764 galaxies with $z_{850}<22$ mag and $0.35<z<0.9$ selected from GEMS and
GOODS-South surveys. We show that the sample galaxies having strong asymmetric
structures, in particular tidal tails, are well-separated from those with
regular morphologies in the $A_{\rm o}$-$D_{\rm o}$ space. Meanwhile, the
widely used $CAS$ and Gini-$M_{20}$ methods turn out to be insensitive to such
morphological features. We stress that the $A_{\rm o}$-$D_{\rm o}$ method is an
efficient way to select galaxies with significant asymmetric features like
tidal tails and study galaxy mergers in the dynamical phase traced by these
delicate features.

within the respective host. Given the frequent assumption of very high mass
progenitors for these explosions from various studies, most notably a direct
progenitor detection, it is interesting to note the weak association of these
subtypes with star formation as traced by H{\alpha} emission, particularly in
comparison with type Ic supernovae, which trace the H{\alpha} emission and are
thought to arise from high mass progenitors. The radial distributions of these
transients compared to type Ic supernovae are also very different. This
provides evidence for the growing hypothesis that these `interacting

events contained within this sample are discussed in detail, where information
in the literature exists, and compared to the environmental data provided.
Impostors are found to split into two main classes, in terms of environment:
SN2008S-like Impostors fall on regions of zero H{\alpha} emission, whereas
{\eta}-Carina-like Impostors all fall on regions with positive H{\alpha}
emission. We also find indications that the Impostor class originate from lower

emergent gravity paradigm provides a new insight and a possible solution to the

material, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the
cosmological constant problem. We show that these conditions are naturally
satisfied in the emergent gravity paradigm in which (i) the field equations of
gravity are invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter Lagrangian
and (ii) the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant in the
solution. The numerical value of this integration constant can be related to
another dimensionless number (called CosMIn) that counts the number of modes
inside a Hubble volume that cross the Hubble radius during the radiation and
the matter dominated epochs of the universe. The emergent gravity paradigm
suggests that CosMIn has the numerical value $4 \pi$, which, in turn, leads to
the correct, observed value of the cosmological constant. Further, the emergent
gravity paradigm provides an alternative perspective on cosmology and
interprets the expansion of the universe itself as a quest towards holographic
equipartition. We discuss the implications of this novel and alternate

A) using ten years worth of observations with INTEGRAL SPI. This source has the
highest flux observed from any AGN in the SPI bandpass (23 keV--8 MeV). The 10
year lightcurve of Cen A is presented, and hardness ratios confirm that the
spectral shape changes very little despite the luminosity varying by a factor
of a few.
  Primarily, we establish the presence of a reflection component in the average
spectrum by demonstrating an excess between 20-60 keV, from extending the
spectral shape observed at low energy to the SPI regime. The excess in Chandra
HETGS and INTEGRAL SPI data is well described by reflection of the dominant
power law spectrum from a neutral, optically-thick atmosphere. We find that the
reprocessed emission contributes 20-25% of the 23-100 keV flux.
  The existence of a cut-off at tens to hundreds of keV remains controversial.
Using simulated spectra, we demonstrate that a high energy cut off reproduces
the observed spectral properties of Cen A more readily than a simple power law.
However, we also show that such a cut-off is probably underestimated when
neglecting (even modest) reflection, and for Cen A would be at energies >700
keV, with a confidence of >95%. This is atypically high for thermal
Comptonizing plasmas observed in AGN, and we propose that we are in fact
modelling the more gradual change in spectral shape expected of synchrotron
self-Compton spectra.

that the corresponding solutions of the constraints are either not globally

demonstrate how the orthonormal Bernstein polynomials can be used to find the

for sampling the pupil of telescopes with 30+ m in diameter, it is necessary to

ratio are changing across the telescope pupil. Existing techniques such as
Matched Filter have been considered as the best technique to compute the

effect of a variation in the Sodium profile. In this work we propose a new
technique using artificial neural networks, which take advantage of the neural

active galactic nucleus (AGN). The gas kinematics are dominated by rotation but
with high turbulence, v_rot/sigma_int~3.1, and a Toomre Q parameter <1
throughout the disk. By fitting three independent thin rotating disk models to
our data, we derive a total dynamical mass of 3+-2x10^10 M_sol. This is close
to the molecular gas mass derived from previous CO(2-1) observations, and
implies a CO to H_2 conversion factor alpha_CO<2.3M_sol(K km/s/pc^2)^-1. The
mass budget also constrains the stellar mass to <3.1x10^10 M_sol, and entails a
gas fraction of f_gas>~0.4. The diameter of the dust continuum emission is <2
kpc, while the star-formation rate is as high as 1000 M_sol/yr. Combined with
our stellar mass constraint, this implies an extreme specific star formation
rate >80 Gyr^{-1}, especially since there are no clear indications of recent
merger activity. Finally, our high signal-to-noise [CII] measurement revises
the observed [NII]/[CII] ratio, which suggests a close to solar metallicity,
unless the [CII] flux contains significant contributions from HII regions. Our

the redshift of the quasar, as well as faint continuum. The second quasar,
CFHQS J005006.6+344522 (z=6.25), is included in our recent HST SNAP survey of
z~6 quasars searching for evidence of gravitational lensing. Deep imaging with
ACS and WFC3 confirms an optical dropout ~4.5 mag fainter than the quasar
(Y_AB=25) at a separation of 0.9 arcsec. The red i_775-Y_105 color of the
galaxy and its proximity to the quasar (5 kpc projected if at the quasar

fainter than the quasar it is remarkably bright when compared to field galaxies
at this redshift, while showing no evidence for lensing. Both systems may
represent late-stage mergers of two massive galaxies, with the observed light
for one dominated by powerful ongoing star formation and for the other by rapid
black hole growth. Observations of close companions are rare; if major mergers

central problem in the area of nonparametric inference under shape constraints.
In this paper, we study the performance of log-concave density estimators with
respect to global loss functions, and adopt a minimax approach. We first show
that no statistical procedure based on a sample of size $n$ can estimate a
log-concave density with respect to the squared Hellinger loss function with
supremum risk smaller than order $n^{-4/5}$, when $d=1$, and order
$n^{-2/(d+1)}$ when $d \geq 2$. In particular, this reveals a sense in which,
when $d \geq 3$, log-concave density estimation is fundamentally more
challenging than the estimation of a density with two bounded derivatives (a
problem to which it has been compared). Second, we show that for $d \leq 3$,
the Hellinger $\epsilon$-bracketing entropy of a class of log-concave densities
with small mean and covariance matrix close to the identity grows like
$\max\{\epsilon^{-d/2},\epsilon^{-(d-1)}\}$ (up to a logarithmic factor when

(substructured versus not-substructured) and on whether they have a significant
CO detection ($S/N>$3$\sigma$). We find that the sources have dust masses in
the range 10$^2$-10$^4$~M$_\odot$ and that they present significant differences
in their inferred dust/star formation/gas parameters depending on their
H$\alpha$ morphology and CO detection classification. The results suggests
differences in the evolutionary states or in the number of embedded HII regions
between the subsamples. The source background--subtracted dust emission seems
to be predominantly powered by local star formation, as indicated by a strong
correlation between the dust luminosity and the dust-corrected H$\alpha$
luminosity and the fact that the extrapolated young stellar luminosity is high
enough to account for the observed dust emission. Finally, we do not find a
strong correlation between the dust-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity and the dust
mass of the sources, consistent with previous results on the breakdown of
simple scaling relations at sub-kpc scales. However, the scatter in the

excess in the Galactic center region. The proposed sources to be responsible
for the excess include the dark matter annihilation or an astrophysical
alternative from a population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Whether or not the
MSP scenario can explain the data self-consistently has very important
implications for the detection of particle dark matter, which is however,
subject to debate in the literature. In this work we study the MSP scenario in
detail, based on the detected properties of the MSPs by Fermi-LAT. We build a
model of the Milky Way MSPs which can reproduce the $\gamma$-ray properties of
the Fermi-LAT MSPs, and derive the intrinsic luminosity function of the MSPs.
The model is then applied to a bulge population of MSPs. We find that the
extended $\gamma$-ray excess can be well explained by the bulge MSPs without
violating the detectable flux distribution of MSPs by Fermi-LAT. The spatial
distribution of the bulge MSPs as implied by the distribution of low mass X-ray
binaries follows a $r^{-2.4}$ profile, which is also consistent with the
$\gamma$-ray excess data. We conclude that the MSP model can explain the
Galactic center $\gamma$-ray excess self-consistently, satisfying all the
current observational constraints.

taken in equivariant $K$-theory, where the equivariance is with respect to all
automorphisms of the problem.
  In Donaldson-Thomas theories, one sums up over all Euler characteristics with
a weight $(-q)^\chi$, where $q$ is a parameter, informally referred to as the
boxcounting parameter. The main feature of the correspondence is that the
3-dimensional boxcounting parameter $q$ becomes in $5$ dimensions the
equivariant parameter for the $\mathbb{C}^\times$-action that defines $X$
inside $Z$.
  The 5-dimensional theory effectively sums up the $q$-expansion in the
Donaldson-Thomas theory. In particular, it gives a natural explanation of the
rationality (in $q$) of the DT partition functions. Other expected as well as
unexpected symmetries of the DT counts follow naturally from the 5-dimensional
perspective. These involve choosing different $\mathbb{C}^\times$-actions on
the same $Z$, and thus relating the same 5-dimensional theory to different DT
problems.
  The important special case $Z=X \times \mathbb{C}^2$ is considered in detail
in Sections 7 and 8. If $X$ is a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, we compute the

two-particle exciton transition energy via photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL).
These quantities yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 eV for monolayer
MoSe2, a value that is orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in
conventional 3D semiconductors. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio

have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies

transition between the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and the
beginning of the PN phase. Sources in this transition phase are compact and
emit intensely in infrared wavelengths, making high spatial resolution
observations in the infrared mandatory to investigate the shaping process of
PNe. Interferometric VLTI IR observations have revealed compelling evidence of
disks at the cores of PNe, but the limited sensitivity, strong observational
constraints, and limited spatial coverage place severe limits on the universal
use of this technique. Inspired by the successful detection of proto-planetary
disks using spectro-astrometric observations, we apply here for the first time
this technique to search for sub-arcsecond structures in PNe. Our exploratory
study using CRIRES (CRyogenic high-resolution Infra-Red Echelle Spectrograph)
commissioning data of the proto-PN IRAS 17516-2525 and the young PN SwSt 1 has
revealed small-sized structures after the spectro-astrometric analysis of the
two sources. In IRAS 17516-2525, the spectro-astrometric signal has a size of
only 12 mas, as detected in the Brackett-gamma line, whereas the structures
found in SwSt 1 have sizes of 230 mas in the [Fe III] line and 130 mas in the
Brackett-gamma line. The spectroscopic observations required to perform
spectro-astrometry of sources in the transition towards the PN phase are less
time consuming and much more sensitive than VLTI IR observations. The results
presented here open a new window in the search of the small-sized collimating
agents that shape the complex morphologies of extremely axisymmetric PNe.

they find solutions efficiently to single-query problems. Optimal RRTs (RRT*s)
extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so
asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in
the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also
inconsistent with their single-query nature.
  For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can
improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that
unless this subset is sampled directly, the probability of improving a solution
becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this
paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this
subset.
  The advantages of the presented sampling technique are demonstrated with a
new algorithm, Informed RRT*. This method retains the same probabilistic
guarantees on completeness and optimality as RRT* while improving the
convergence rate and final solution quality. We present the algorithm as a
simple modification to RRT* that could be further extended by more advanced
path-planning algorithms. We show experimentally that it outperforms RRT* in
rate of convergence, final solution cost, and ability to find difficult
passages while demonstrating less dependence on the state dimension and range
of the planning problem.

resolved, in contrast to the point-like broad-line region and the central
continuum source. The inhomogeneous aperture geometries used among different
observation sets in a joint monitoring campaign introduce systematic deviations
to the fluxes of broad lines and central continuum, and intercalibration over
these data sets is required. As an improvement to the previous empirical
correction performed by comparing the (nearly) contemporaneous observation

(nearly) contemporaneous observations, naturally incorporates physical models
of flux variations, and fully takes into account the measurement errors. In
particular, it fits all the data sets simultaneously regardless of samplings

decoding of the signals from all the users using a low complexity convex
relaxation of the maximum likelihood decoder (ML, constellation search) is

the asymptotic limit of a large number of transmitters, reliable communication
is possible even without employing coding at the transmitters. This holds even
when the number of receiver antennas per transmitter is arbitrarily small, with
scaling behaviour arbitrarily close to what is achievable with coding. Thus,
the diversity of a large system not only makes the scaling law for coded
systems similar to that of uncoded systems, but, as we show, also allows
efficient decoders to realize close to the optimal performance of
maximum-likelihood decoding. However, while there is no performance loss

low-complexity decoder exhibits a loss of the exponential or near-exponential

in which the voters exercise their votes strategically instead of voting
honestly to prevent selection of an alternative that is less preferred. The
Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that there is no strategy-proof voting rule

Researchers have attempted to get around the impossibility results in several
ways such as domain restriction and computational hardness of manipulation.
However these approaches have been shown to have limitations. Since prevention
of manipulation seems to be elusive, an interesting research direction
therefore is detection of manipulation. Motivated by this, we initiate the
study of detection of possible manipulators in an election.
  We formulate two pertinent computational problems - Coalitional Possible
Manipulators (CPM) and Coalitional Possible Manipulators given Winner (CPMW),
where a suspect group of voters is provided as input to compute whether they
can be a potential coalition of possible manipulators. In the absence of any
suspect group, we formulate two more computational problems namely Coalitional
Possible Manipulators Search (CPMS), and Coalitional Possible Manipulators
Search given Winner (CPMSW). We provide polynomial time algorithms for these

show that these problems are in NP-complete. We observe that detecting

systems from the gravitational-wave signals they emit. For coalescing
compact-binary sources this requires accurate model templates for the inspiral
and, potentially, the subsequent merger and ringdown. Models with
frequency-domain waveforms that terminate abruptly in the sensitive band of the
detector are often used for parameter-estimation studies. We show that the
abrupt waveform termination contains significant information that affects
parameter-estimation accuracy. If the sharp cutoff is not physically motivated,
this extra information can lead to misleadingly good accuracy claims. We also
show that using waveforms with a cutoff as templates to recover complete
signals can lead to biases in parameter estimates. We evaluate when the
information content in the cutoff is likely to be important in both cases. We
also point out that the standard Fisher matrix formalism, frequently employed
for approximately predicting parameter-estimation accuracy, cannot properly
incorporate an abrupt cutoff that is present in both signals and templates;
this observation explains some previously unexpected results found in the
literature. These effects emphasize the importance of using complete waveforms
with accurate merger and ringdown phases for parameter estimation.

networks. These layerings can replace hard-to-compute BFS-trees in many
contexts while having an efficient randomized distributed construction. We
demonstrate their versatility by using them to provide near optimal distributed
algorithms for several multi-message communication primitives.
  Designing efficient communication primitives for radio networks has a rich
history that began 25 years ago when Bar-Yehuda et al. introduced fast
randomized algorithms for broadcasting and for constructing BFS-trees. Their
BFS-tree construction time was $O(D \log^2 n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the network
diameter and $n$ is the number of nodes. Since then, the complexity of a
broadcast has been resolved to be $T_{BC} = \Theta(D \log \frac{n}{D} + \log^2
n)$ rounds. On the other hand, BFS-trees have been used as a crucial building
block for many communication primitives and their construction time remained a
bottleneck for these primitives.
  We introduce collision free layerings that can be used in place of BFS-trees
and we give a randomized construction of these layerings that runs in nearly
broadcast time, that is, w.h.p. in $T_{Lay} = O(D \log \frac{n}{D} +
\log^{2+\epsilon} n)$ rounds for any constant $\epsilon>0$. We then use these
layerings to obtain: (1) A randomized algorithm for gathering $k$ messages
running w.h.p. in $O(T_{Lay} + k)$ rounds. (2) A randomized $k$-message
broadcast algorithm running w.h.p. in $O(T_{Lay} + k \log n)$ rounds. These
algorithms are optimal up to the small difference in the additive
poly-logarithmic term between $T_{BC}$ and $T_{Lay}$. Moreover, they imply the
first optimal $O(n \log n)$ round randomized gossip algorithm.

to weight each of the metrics. In this work we propose a solution for the two
aforementioned problems by defining the $R^*$-value and introducing the concept
of \emph{robustness surface} ($\Omega$). The rationale of our proposal is to
make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We firstly adjust to 1 the
initial robustness of a network. Secondly, we find the most informative
robustness metric under a specific failure scenario. Then, we repeat the
process for several percentage of failures and different realizations of the
failure process. Lastly, we join these values to form the robustness surface,
which allows the visual assessment of network robustness variability. Results
show that a network presents different robustness surfaces (i.e., dissimilar
shapes) depending on the failure scenario and the set of metrics. In addition,
the robustness surface allows the robustness of different networks to be
compared.

determined for the case that the current carries a non-zero Matsubara
frequency, both in a weak-coupling approach and through lattice QCD. We point
out that such screening masses are sensitive to the same infrared physics as
light-cone real-time rates. In particular, on the perturbative side, the
inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation determining screening correlators is shown
to have the same general form as the equation implementing LPM resummation for
the soft-dilepton and photon production rates from a hot QCD plasma. The static
potential appearing in the equation is identical to that whose soft part has
been determined up to NLO and on the lattice in the context of jet quenching.
Numerical results based on this potential suggest that screening masses
overshoot the free results (multiples of 2piT) more strongly than at zero
Matsubara frequency. Four-dimensional lattice simulations in two-flavour QCD at
temperatures of 250 and 340 MeV confirm the non-static screening masses at the
10% level. Overall our results lend support to studies of jet quenching based
on the same potential at T > 250 MeV.

investigated on the basis of the work of Lee and others [Science, 318:426-430,

of melanin to covalently bind amine functional groups was confirmed by
quantification of the corresponding binding sites on dopamine-melanin
aggregates. Furthermore it is possible to redissolve dopamine-melanin
aggregates in strongly alkaline solutions. The obtained small melanin grains
were used to build layer-by-layer deposits with poly(diallyldimethylammonium).
  Different methods of dopamine oxidation to grow melanin films at
solid--liquid interfaces were developed. All examined methods lead to
continuous dopamine-melanin films with very similar surface morphologies. The
dopamine-melanin films become impermeable to electrochemical probes at a
thickness in the 10 nm range. In this context a higher permeability for
positively charged and neutral probes than for negatively charged ones was
confirmed for one preparation method.
  The adsorption of proteins on dopamine-melanin coatings was explained as
combination of electrostatic and strong, most probably covalent, interactions.
To obtain this explanation, the zeta-potential of dopamine-melanin deposits has
been measured as a function of pH.
  The formation of melanin by dopamine oxidation in layer-by-layer films of
poly(L-lysine) (PLL) and hyaluronate (HA) was studied: Melanin is able to
homogeneously fill $(\text{PLL-HA})_n$ films and the obtained
polyelectrolyte-melanin composites can be detached from their substrate as
free-standing membranes prepared by a biomimetic method in mild conditions.

responsible for the observational differences between type-1 (pole-on) and

of emission and/or absorption features is directly correlated to the
inclination of the system. The AGN structure can be further probed by using the
geometry-sensitive technique of polarimetry, yet the pairing between observed
polarization and Seyfert type remains poorly examined. Based on archival data,
I report here the first compilation of 53 estimated AGN inclinations matched
with ultraviolet/optical continuum polarization measurements. Corrections,
based on the polarization of broad emission lines, are applied to the sample of
Seyfert-2 AGN to remove dilution by starburst light and derive information
about the scattered continuum alone. The resulting compendium agrees with past
empirical results, i.e. type-1 AGN show low polarization degrees (P < 1%)
predominantly associated with a polarization position angle parallel to the
projected radio axis of the system, while type-2 objects show stronger
polarization percentages (P > 7%) with perpendicular polarization angles. The
transition between type-1 and type-2 inclination occurs between 45 and 60
degrees without noticeable impact on P. The compendium is further used as a
test to investigate the relevance of four AGN models. While an AGN model with
fragmented regions matches observations better than uniform models, a structure
with a failed dusty wind along the equator and disc-born, ionized, polar
outflows is by far closer to observations. However, although the models
correctly reproduce the observed dichotomy between parallel and perpendicular
polarization, as well as correct polarization percentages at type-2
inclinations, further work is needed to account for some highly polarized

broken by virtue of the Hosotani mechanism, the huge mass splitting between the
colored Higgs triplet and the electroweak Higgs doublet superfields is
naturally realized. As a byproduct, the existence of adjoint chiral superfields
with masses of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale is predicted,
leading to the Higgs sector that contains an SU(2)_L triplet chiral multiplet
with hypercharge zero and a neutral singlet one in addition to the two SU(2)_L
doublets of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We focus on the Higgs
sector and investigate to what extent the couplings of the standard model-like
Higgs boson and the masses of the additional Higgs bosons deviate from those in
the Standard Model and other models due to the new triplet and singlet chiral
multiplets. We show that this model can be distinguished using precision
measurements of couplings and masses of the Higgs sector particles and serves
as a good example of grand unification testable at colliders such as the
luminosity up-graded Large Hadron Collider and future electron-positron
colliders.

at most mildly overpressured with respect to the global lobe plasma showing no
evidence of large-scale efficient Fermi I-type particle acceleration, and
persist for ~ 2-3 Myr. We demonstrate that the dwarf galaxy KK 196 (AM
1318-444) cannot account for the features, and that surface plasma
instabilities, the internal sausage mode and radiative instabilities are highly
unlikely. An internal tearing instability and the kink mode are allowed within
the observational and growth time constraints and could develop in parallel on
different physical scales. We interpret the origin of the vertex and vortex
filaments in terms of weak shocks from transonic MHD turbulence or from a
moderately recent jet activity of the parent AGN, or an interplay of both.

with the formation of eight-site clusters, octamers, in the spinel compound
CuIr$_2$S$_4$. The octamer state was considered to be a spin-singlet state
induced by a Peieirls instability through the strong anisotropy of $d$
orbitals, the so-called orbital Peierls state. We reexamine this picture by
taking into account the spin-orbit coupling which was ignored in the previous
study. We derive a low-energy effective model between $j_{\rm eff}=1/2$
quasispins on Ir$^{4+}$ cations in an octamer from the multiorbital Hubbard
model with the strong spin-orbit coupling by performing the perturbation
expansion from the strong correlation limit. The effective Hamiltonian is in
the form of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model but with an additional interaction, a
symmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction originating from the perturbation
process including both d-d and d-p-d hopping. Analyzing the effective
Hamiltonian on two sites and the octamer by the exact diagonalization, we find
that there is a competition between a spin-singlet state and a quadrupolar
state. The former singlet state is a conventional one, adiabatically connected
to the orbital-Peierls state. On the other hand, the latter quadrupolar state
is stabilized by the additional interaction, which consists of a linear
combination of different total spin momenta along the spin quantization axis.
In the competing region, the model exhibits paramagnetic behavior with a
renormalized small effective moment at low temperature. This peculiar remnant
paramagnetism is not obtained in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model without the
additional interaction. Our results renew the picture of the octamer state and
provide a scenario for the intrinsic paramagnetic behavior recently observed in
a muon spin rotation experiment [K. M. Kojima et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112,

determine plasma parameters like the electron density or the electron

general analytic expression of the electrical admittance of a spherical shaped
probe immersed into a plasma. It is derived from the matrix representation of
an appropriate operator, which describes the dynamical behavior of the

during the past decade: First, photon-based quantum communication, which
guarantees unbreakable encryption but still has to be scaled to high rates over
large distances. Second, quantum computation, which will fundamentally enhance
computability if it can be scaled to a large number of quantum bits. It was
realized early on that a hybrid system of light and matter qubits could solve
the scalability problem of both fields - that of communication via quantum
repeaters, that of computation via an optical interconnect between smaller
quantum processors. To this end, the development of a robust two-qubit gate
that allows to link distant computational nodes is ""a pressing challenge"". Here
we demonstrate such a quantum gate between the spin state of a single trapped
atom and the polarization state of an optical photon contained in a faint laser
pulse. The presented gate mechanism is deterministic, robust and expected to be
applicable to almost any matter qubit. It is based on reflecting the photonic
qubit from a cavity that provides strong light-matter coupling. To demonstrate
its versatility, we use the quantum gate to create atom-photon,
atom-photon-photon, and photon-photon entangled states from separable input
states. We expect our experiment to break ground for various applications,

Schr\""odinger-cat states, deterministic photonic Bell-state measurements, and

Kaluza-Klein modes matches the structure found in explicit calculations. In
M-theory compactification on a manifold $M$ of $G_2$ or Spin(7) holonomy,
similar results hold to all orders in the inverse radius of $M$ -- but not
exactly. The classical moduli space of $G_2$ metrics on a manifold $M$ is known
to be locally a Lagrangian submanifold of $H^3(M,{\mathbf R})\oplus
H^4(M,\mathbf{R})$. We show that this remains valid to all orders in the
$\alpha'$ or inverse radius expansion.

forms of these modes that have not been previously published. We study all
modes of degree $l \le 4$, which includes both inertial modes and surface
gravity modes, with the aim of better understanding the effect of rapid
rotation on tidal interactions. The inclusion of these higher degree modes
greatly increases the number of frequencies at which tidal resonances may
occur. We derive an expression for the decay rates of these modes to first
order in viscosity and explicitly plot these for modes. We see that the
equatorial bulge of the spheroid has a significant effect on the decay rates
(changing some of these by a factor of 2 between an eccentricity of $e=0$ and
$0.5$), and a more modest effect on the mode frequencies. This suggests that
models of tidal interaction between rapidly rotating stars and giant planets
that model the Coriolis force while neglecting the centrifugal distortion of
the body may be in error by an order unity factor. In a subsequent paper we
shall examine the case of a forced flow in this spheroid, and complete the

FFT, and for smooth functions the resulting approximation is close to optimal,
with computations that are numerically stable. Given sufficiently accurate
function samples, the Chebyshev expansion coefficients can be computed to
machine precision accuracy. However, the accuracy is only with respect to
absolute error, and this implies that very small expansion coefficients
typically have very large relative error. Upon differentiating a Chebyshev
expansion, this relative error in the small coefficients is magnified and
accuracy may be lost, especially after repeated differentiation. At first
sight, this seems unavoidable. Yet, in this paper, we focus on an alternative
computation of Chebyshev expansion coefficients using contour integrals in the
complex plane. The main result is that the coefficients can be computed with
machine precision relative error, rather than absolute error. This implies that
even very small coefficients can be computed with full floating point accuracy,
even when they are themselves much smaller than machine precision. As a result,
no accuracy is lost after differentiating the expansion, and even the 100th

accuracy using standard floating point arithmetic. In some cases, the contour
integrals can be evaluated using the FFT, making the approach both highly

a Poisson process; the speed is determined by the short time behaviour, which
in our model is controlled by the exponent. We demonstrate that finite, so
called ""locally tree-like"" networks, like the Barab\'asi-Albert networks behave
very differently from real tree graphs if the IETD is strongly fat-tailed, as
the lack or presence of rare alternative paths modifies the spreading. A
further important result is that the non-stationarity of the dynamics has a
significant effect on the spreading speed for strongly fat-tailed power-law
IETDs, thus bursty processes characterized by small power-law exponents can
cause slow spreading in the stationary state but also very rapid spreading
heavily depending on the age of the processes.

It is believed that necessary elements are a rotating (Kerr) black hole and a

magnetic flux tubes/strings. If such a tube falls into a Kerr black hole, then
the leading portion loses angular momentum and energy as the string brakes, and
to compensate for this loss, momentum and energy is redistributed to the
trailing portion of the tube.} {We found that buoyancy creates a pronounced
helical magnetic field structure aligned with the spin axis. Along the field
lines, the plasma is centrifugally accelerated close to the speed of light.
This process leads to unlimited stretching of the flux tube since one part of
the tube continues to fall into the black hole and simultaneously the other
part of the string is pushed outward. Eventually, reconnection cuts the tube,
the inner part is filled with new material and the outer part forms a
collimated bubble-structured relativistic jet. Each plasmoid can be considered
like an outgoing particle in the Penrose mechanism: it carries extracted
rotational energy away from the black hole while the falling part with the
corresponding negative energy is left inside the ergosphere.

previous results, and the ultra-faint dwarfs with an even lower one. Under
these assumptions, we can reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution
function, the $[\alpha/Fe]$ vs. $[Fe/H]$ abundance patterns and the total
stellar and gas masses observed at the present time in these objects. In
particular, for the ultra-faint dwarfs we assume a strong initial burst of star
formation, with the mass of the system being already in place at early times.
On the other hand, for the classical dwarf spheroidals the agreement with the
data is found by assuming the star formation histories suggested by the
Color-Magnitude diagrams and a longer time-scale of formation via gas infall.
We find that all these galaxies should experience galactic winds, starting in
all cases before $1$ Gyr from the beginning of their evolution. From comparison

to estimate the effect on mortality of premature babies being delivered in a
high-level NICU vs. a low-level NICU through an observational study where there
are unmeasured confounders as well as nonignorable missing covariates. We
consider the use of excess travel time as an instrumental variable (IV) to
control for unmeasured confounders. In order for an IV to be valid, we must
condition on confounders of the IV---outcome relationship, for example, month
prenatal care started must be conditioned on for excess travel time to be a
valid IV. However, sometimes month prenatal care started is missing, and the
missingness may be nonignorable because it is related to the not fully measured
mother's/infant's risk of complications. We develop a method to estimate the
causal effect of a treatment using an IV when there are nonignorable missing
covariates as in our data, where we allow the missingness to depend on the
fully observed outcome as well as the partially observed compliance class,
which is a proxy for the unmeasured risk of complications. A simulation study
shows that under our nonignorable missingness assumption, the commonly used
estimation methods, complete-case analysis and multiple imputation by chained
equations assuming missingness at random, provide biased estimates, while our
method provides approximately unbiased estimates. We apply our method to the
NICU study and find evidence that high-level NICUs significantly reduce deaths
for babies of small gestational age, whereas for almost mature babies like 37
weeks, the level of NICUs makes little difference. A sensitivity analysis is
conducted to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions to key assumptions about
the missing covariates. The method we develop in this paper may be useful for
many observational studies facing similar issues of unmeasured confounders and
nonignorable missing data as ours.

curvatures on Hermitian manifolds and the background Riemannian manifolds.
Moreover, we study non-K\""ahler Calabi-Yau manifolds by using the first
Aeppli-Chern class and the Levi-Civita Ricci-flat metrics. In particular, we
construct explicit Levi-Civita Ricci-flat metrics on Hopf manifolds
$S^{2n-1}\times S^1$. We also construct a smooth family of Gauduchon metrics on
a compact Hermitian manifolds such that the metrics are in the same first
Aeppli-Chern class, and their first Chern-Ricci curvatures are the same and
nonnegative, but their Riemannian scalar curvatures are constant and vary
smoothly between negative infinity and a positive number. In particular, it
shows that Hermitian manifolds with nonnegative first Chern class can admit
Hermitian metrics with strictly negative Riemannian scalar curvature.

and applications in astrophysics are discussed. As theoretical framework, the
scale decomposition of the dynamical equations for neutral fluids by means of
spatial filtering is explained. For cosmological applications, the filtered
equations in comoving coordinates are also presented. To obtain a closed set of
equations that can be evolved in LES, several subgrid scale models for the
interactions between numerically resolved and unresolved scales are discussed,
in particular the subgrid scale turbulence energy equation model. It is then
shown how model coefficients can be calculated, either by dynamical procedures
or, a priori, from high-resolution data. For astrophysical applications,
adaptive mesh refinement is often indispensable. It is shown that the subgrid
scale turbulence energy model allows for a particularly elegant and physically
well motivated way of preserving momentum and energy conservation in AMR
simulations. Moreover, the notion of shear-improved models for inhomogeneous
and non-stationary turbulence is introduced. Finally, applications of LES to
turbulent combustion in thermonuclear supernovae, star formation and feedback
in galaxies, and cosmological structure formation are reviewed.

then study its geometrothermodynamics. It is shown that the local phase
transition points not only witness the divergence of the specific heat, but
also witness the minimum temperature and the maximum free energy or Gibbs
potential. They also witness the divergence of the corresponding thermodynamic
scalar curvature. No matter which ensemble is chosen, the metric constructed
can successfully produce the behavior of the thermodynamic interaction and
phase transition structure while other metrics failed to predict the phase
transition point of the charged topological black hole in former literature. In
grand-canonical ensemble, we have discovered the phase transition which has not
been reported before. It is similar to the canonical ensemble in which the
phase transition only takes place when $k=-1$. But it also has its unique
characteristics that the location of the phase transition point depends on the
value of potential, which is different from the canonical ensemble where the
phase transition point is independent of the parameters. After an analytical
check of Ehrenfest scheme, we find that the new phase transition is a second

the H-shell was suggested to explain AGB star abundances. Here we verify this
idea quantitatively through exact MHD models. Starting with a simple 2D
geometry and in an inertia frame, we study plasma equilibria avoiding the
complications of numerical simulations. We show that, below the convective
envelope of an AGB star, variable magnetic fields induce a natural expansion,
permitted by the almost ideal MHD conditions, in which the radial velocity
grows as the second power of the radius. We then study the convective envelope,
where the complexity of macro-turbulence allows only for a schematic analytical
treatment. Here the radial velocity depends on the square root of the radius.
We then verify the robustness of our results with 3D calculations for the
velocity, showing that, for both the studied regions, the solution previously
found can be seen as a planar section of a more complex behavior, in which
anyway the average radial velocity retains the same dependency on radius found
in 2D. As a final check, we compare our results to approximate descriptions of
buoyant magnetic structures. For realistic boundary conditions the envelope
crossing times are sufficient to disperse in the huge convective zone any
material transported, suggesting magnetic advection as a promising mechanism
for deep mixing. The mixing velocities are smaller than for convection, but
larger than for diffusion and adequate to extra-mixing in red giants.

In the first type of measurements, the wave vector of magnetoplasmons excited

magnetoplasmon spectrum depended on the gate geometry which gives an additional
parameter to control plasma excitations in THz detectors. Fourier spectra
showed a strong dependence of the cyclotron resonance amplitude on the

masses arise due to the interaction of these heavy quarkonium states with the
gluon condensates of QCD. The gluon condensates in the hot hadronic matter are
computed from the medium modification of a scalar dilaton field within a chiral
SU(3) model, introduced in the hadronic model to incorporate the broken scale
invariance of QCD. There is seen to be drop in the masses of the bottomonium
states and mass shifts are observed to be quite considerable at high densities
for the excited states. The effects of density, isospin asymmetry, strangeness
as well as temperature of the medium on the masses of the $\Upsilon$-states are
investigated. The effects of the isospin asymmetry as well as strangeness
fraction of the medium are seen to be appreciable at high densities and small
temperatures. The density effects are the most dominant medium effects which
should have observable consequences in the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) in
the heavy ion collision experiments in the future facility at FAIR, GSI. The
study of the $\Upsilon$ states will however require access to energies higher

results on leptonic CP violation and absolute neutrino masses. However,
puzzling measurements exist that deserve an exhaustive evaluation. The NESSiE
Collaboration has been setup to undertake conclusive experiments to clarify the
muon-neutrino disappearance measurements at small $L/E$, which will be able to
put severe constraints to models with more than the three-standard neutrinos,
or even to robustly measure the presence of a new kind of neutrino oscillation
for the first time. To this aim the use of the current FNAL-Booster neutrino
beam for a Short-Baseline experiment has been carefully evaluated. This
proposal refers to the use of magnetic spectrometers at two different sites,
Near and Far. Their positions have been extensively studied, together with the
possible performances of two OPERA-like spectrometers. The proposal is
constrained by availability of existing hardware and a time-schedule compatible
with the CERN project for a new more performant neutrino beam, which will
nicely extend the physics results achievable at the Booster. The possible FNAL
experiment will allow to clarify the current $\nu_{\mu}$ disappearance tension
with $\nu_e$ appearance and disappearance at the eV mass scale. Instead, a new
CERN neutrino beam would allow a further span in the parameter space together
with a refined control of systematics and, more relevant, the measurement of

that polarization and magnetization of material media need not be treated as
local averages over small volumes - volumes that nevertheless contain a large
number of electric and/or magnetic dipoles. Indeed, Maxwell's macroscopic
equations are exact and self-consistent mathematical relations between
electromagnetic fields and their sources, which consist of free charge, free
current, polarization, and magnetization. When necessary, the discrete nature
of the constituents of matter and the granularity of material media can be
handled with the aid of special functions, such as Dirac's delta-function. The
energy of the electromagnetic field and the exchange of this energy with
material media are treated with a single postulate that establishes the
Poynting vector S = ExH as the rate of flow of electromagnetic energy under all
circumstances. Similarly, the linear and angular momentum densities of the
fields are simple functions of the Poynting vector that can be unambiguously
evaluated at all points in space and time, irrespective of the type of material
media, if any, that might reside at various locations. Finally, we examine the
Einstein-Laub force- and torque-density equations, and point out the
consistency of these equations with the preceding postulates, with the
conservation laws, and with the special theory of relativity. The set of

(12 pages, 3 figures)","EPJ Quantum Technology 2014 1:13","10.1186/epjqt13",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Schemes of universal quantum computation in which the interactions between
the computational elements, in a computational register, are mediated by some
ancillary system are of interest due to their relevance to the physical
implementation of a quantum computer. Furthermore, reducing the level of
control required over both the ancillary and register systems has the potential
to simplify any experimental implementation. In this paper we consider how to
minimise the control needed to implement universal quantum computation in an
ancilla-mediated fashion. Considering computational schemes which require no
measurements and hence evolve by unitary dynamics for the global system, we
show that when employing an ancilla qubit there are certain fixed-time
ancilla-register interactions which, along with ancilla initialisation in the
computational basis, are universal for quantum computation with no additional
control of either the ancilla or the register. We develop two distinct models
based on locally inequivalent interactions and we then discuss the relationship
between these unitary models and the measurement-based ancilla-mediated models
known as ancilla-driven quantum computation.

dimensions in the limit of long wavelengths, both for the hyperbolic and
elliptic case. We first study the formal dispersionless limit of the Toda
equations and solve initial value problems for the resulting system up to the
point of gradient catastrophe.
  It is shown that the break-up of the solution in the hyperbolic case is
similar to the shock formation in the Hopf equation, a $1+1$ dimensional
singularity. In the elliptic case, it is found that the break-up is given by a
cusp as for the semiclassical system of the focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation in $1+1$ dimensions. The full Toda system is then studied for finite
small values of the dispersion parameter $\epsilon$ in the vicinity of the
shocks of the dispersionless Toda equations. We determine the scaling in
$\epsilon$ of the difference between the Toda solution for small $\epsilon$ and
the singular solution of the dispersionless Toda system. In the hyperbolic
case, the same scaling proportional to $\epsilon^{2/7}$ is found as in the
small dispersion limit of the Korteweg-de Vries and the defocusing nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equations. In the elliptic case, we obtain the same scaling
proportional to $\epsilon^{2/5}$ as in the semiclassical limit for the focusing
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. We also study the formation of dispersive
shocks for times much larger than the break-up time in the hyperbolic case. In
the elliptic case, an $L_{\infty}$ blow-up is observed instead of a dispersive
shock for finite times greater than the break-up time. The
$\epsilon$-dependence of the blow-up time is determined.

and baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determine
team skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm to
calculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created a
networks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. A
digraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, and
edges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointed
towards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using a
right-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams
will be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector
centrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament
performance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between
coach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \cdot P_s
= T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given
score difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We
multiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the
probability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill
and coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of
team skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown
matrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of
all time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in
the yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.

Dry friction damping produced by the sliding surfaces of these interfaces
reduces the amplitude of bladed-disk vibration. The relative displacements at
these interfaces lead to fretting-wear which reduces the average life
expectancy of the structure. Frequency response functions are calculated
numerically by using the multi-harmonic balance method (mHBM). The dynamic
Lagrangian frequency-time method is used to calculate contact forces in the
frequency domain. A new strategy for solving nonlinear systems based on dual
time stepping is applied. This method is faster than using Newton solvers. It
was used successfully for solving Nonlinear CFD equations in the frequency
domain. This new approach allows identifying the steady state of worn systems
by integrating wear rate equations a on dual time scale. The dual time
equations are integrated by an implicit scheme. Of the different orders tested,
the first order scheme provided the best results.

not be stable if Nitrogen is bounded to four of the surrounding Carbon.
Additional support comes from the substantially bigger size of the single
