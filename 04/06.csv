incompressible fluids is presented in two dimensions in circular, elliptic and
bipolar coordinates. Since the velocity field is solenoidal in this case, it
can be written as the curl of a vector potential, which will then satisfy
Poisson's equation with vorticity as a source term. In regions with zero
vorticity, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation, and this allows
for the construction of harmonic potentials inside and outside circles and
ellipses, depending on the coordinate system. The vector potential is normal to
the coordinate plane, and is proportional to the scalar harmonic functions on
the plane, thereby guaranteeing that the velocity field is also harmonic and is
located on the coordinate plane. The components of the velocity field normal to
either a circle or an ellipse are continuous, but the tangential components are
discontinuous, so that, in effect, a vortex sheet is introduced at these
boundaries. This discontinuity is a measure of the vorticity, normal to the
plane and distributed harmonically along the perimeter of the respective
circles or ellipses. An analytic expression for the streamlines is obtained
which makes visualisation of vortices of various geometries and harmonicities
possible. This approach also permits a reformulation of the notion of
multipolarity of vortices in the traditional sense of a multipolar expansion of
the Green's function for Poisson's equation. As an example of the applicability
of this formulation to known vortical structures, Rankine vortices of different
geometries are expressed in terms of harmonic functions.

in powers of superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. A simple form
for the dependence of theory parameters on the pressure ensures a correct
theoretical outline of the temperature-pressure phase diagram where a stable
phase of coexistence of p-wave superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetism
appears. This new theory is in an excellent agreement with the experimental
data for intermetallic compounds, for example, UGe2, URhGe, UCoGe, and UIr that
are experimentally proven to be itinerant ferromagnets exhibiting spin-triplet
superconductivity. The mechanism of appearance of superconductivity due to
itinerant ferromagnetism ($M$-trigger effect) is established and demonstrated.
On the basis of the same theory, basic features of quantum phase transitions in
this type of ferromagnetic superconductors are explained in agreement with the
experimental data. The theory allows for a classification of the spin-triplet
ferromagnetic superconductors in two different types: type I and type II. The
classification is based on quantitative criteria, i.e., on simple relations
between theory parameters. Both theory and experiment indicate that the two
types of p-wave ferromagnetic superconductors are well distinguished by
essential differences in their physical properties.

  arXiv:1305.5777",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity of a signal in order to
integrate acquisition and compression. CS theory enables exact reconstruction
of a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable
nonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data
representation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of
increased computational complexity. In applications involving color images,
video sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of
high-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form. Standard
applications of CS to higher-order data typically involve representation of the
data as long vectors that are in turn measured using large sampling matrices,
thus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this chapter, we
introduce Generalized Tensor Compressed Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for
compressed sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic
structure of tensorial data with reduced computational complexity at
reconstruction. We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for
representation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition
and compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two
reconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method
(GTCS-P), both capable of recovering a tensor based on noiseless and noisy
observations. We then compare the performance of the proposed methods with
Kronecker compressed sensing (KCS) and multi-way compressed sensing (MWCS). We
demonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both
reconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing
speed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the
achieved compression ratios may be worse than those offered by KCS.

the algorithm showed that it had three serious drawbacks, which prevented its
use by practitioners: it is difficult to understand, it has large memory
requirements, and it is slow. This paper presents an alternate formulation of
SSS*, in which it is implemented as a series of Alpha-Beta calls that use a
transposition table (AB- SSS*). The reformulation solves all three perceived
drawbacks of SSS*, making it a practical algorithm. Further, because the search
is now based on Alpha-Beta, the extensive research on minimax search
enhancements can be easily integrated into AB-SSS*. To test AB-SSS* in
practise, it has been implemented in three state-of-the- art programs: for
checkers, Othello and chess. AB-SSS* is comparable in performance to Alpha-Beta
on leaf node count in all three games, making it a viable alternative to
Alpha-Beta in practise. Whereas SSS* has usually been regarded as being
entirely different from Alpha-Beta, it turns out to be just an Alpha-Beta
enhancement, like null-window searching. This runs counter to published
simulation results. Our research leads to the surprising result that iterative

that any fixed-depth minimax tree-search algorithm traversing a uniform tree
must explore, the so-called minimal tree. Since real-life minimax trees are not
uniform, the exact size of this tree is not known for most applications.
Further, most games have transpositions, implying that there exists a minimal
graph which is smaller than the minimal tree. For three games (chess, Othello
and checkers) we compute the size of the minimal tree and the minimal graph.
Empirical evidence shows that in all three games, enhanced Alpha-Beta search is
capable of building a tree that is close in size to that of the minimal graph.
Hence, it appears game-playing programs build nearly optimal search trees.
However, the conventional definition of the minimal graph is wrong. There are
ways in which the size of the minimal graph can be reduced: by maximizing the
number of transpositions in the search, and generating cutoffs using branches
that lead to smaller search trees. The conventional definition of the minimal
graph is just a left-most approximation. Calculating the size of the real
minimal graph is too computationally intensive. However, upper bound
approximations show it to be significantly smaller than the left-most minimal
graph. Hence, it appears that game-playing programs are not searching as
efficiently as is widely believed. Understanding the left-most and real minimal
search graphs leads to some new ideas for enhancing Alpha-Beta search. One of
them, enhanced transposition cutoffs, is shown to significantly reduce search
tree size.

moving along straight lines at constant apparent superluminal speeds

no measurable delay. The total flux density from the moving jet components is
delayed $\sim$2 yr in relation to the core light curve, roughly the same as the

understand the origin of the mass scale which controls the range of color
confinement and the hadronic spectrum. We show that a mass gap and a
fundamental color confinement scale arise when one extends the formalism of de
Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to frame-independent light-front Hamiltonian theory.
Remarkably, the resulting light-front potential has a unique form of a harmonic
oscillator in the light-front invariant impact variable if one requires that
the action remains conformally invariant. The result is a single-variable
relativistic equation of motion for $q \bar q$ bound states, a ""Light-Front
Shr\""odinger Equation"", analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schr\""odinger
equation, which incorporates color confinement and other essential
spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics, including a massless
pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in
the radial quantum number and orbital angular momentum. The same equations with
the correct hadron spin dependence arise from the holographic mapping of
modified AdS$_5$ space with a specific dilaton profile. A fundamental mass
parameter $\kappa$ appears, determining the hadron masses and the length scale
which underlies hadron structure. Quark masses can be introduced to account for
the spectrum of strange hadrons. This Light-Front Holographic approach predicts
not only hadron spectroscopy successfully, but also hadronic form factors, the
QCD running coupling at small virtuality, and the light-front wavefunctions of
hadrons. Thus the combination of light-front dynamics, its holographic mapping

of research in mathematical logic, where the classification process of
decidable classes of first-order sentences represent only one of the remarkable
results. According to the criteria used to identify the particular classes of
interest, this process was declined into several research programs, of which
some of the most deeply investigated are the ones classifying sentences in
prenex normal form in base of their prefix vocabulary. Unfortunately, almost
all of these approaches did not shed any light on the reasons why modal logic
is so robustly decidable. Trying to answer to this question, Andreka, van
Benthem, and Nemeti introduced the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which
generalizes the modal framework by essentially retaining all its fundamental
properties. They started, so, a completely new research program based on the
way quantifications can be relativized. Although this approach succeeded in its
original task, we cannot consider it satisfactory in spotting the reasons why
some complex extensions of modal logic are well-behaved. In particular, by just
using the related results, we are not able to derive the decidability of
multi-agent logics for strategic abilities. In this paper, aiming to lay the
foundation for a more thorough understanding of some of these decidability
questions, we introduce a new kind of classification based on the binding forms
that are admitted in a sentence, i.e., on the way the arguments of a relation
can be bound to a variable. We describe a hierarchy of first-order fragments
based on the Boolean combinations of these forms, showing that the less
expressive one is already incomparable with the guarded logic and related
extensions. We also prove, via a new model-theoretic technique, that it enjoys
the finite-model property and a PSpace satisfiability problem.

surfaces, separated by dielectric spacers. Because the surface impedance of
each layer is a tensor, an arbitrarily polarized incident field is scattered
into its constituent TE and TM components. This gives rise to transmitarrays
capable of altering the polarization state of an incident field. Various tensor
impedance transmitarray have been proposed in the literature to alter the
polarization, however no comprehensive methodology has been proposed to design
these structures. In this work we propose a procedure for designing tensor
impedance transmitarrays using multi-conductor transmissionline (MTL) theory.
We treat the transmitarray by modelling free-space and the dielectric spacers
as an MTL supporting TE and TM modes with each tensor impedance surface as a
shunt load along the MTL. By using simple MTL concepts we can design a
transmitarray to be reflectionless while controlling the transmission through
the layers and thus the transmitted polarization state. We demonstrate this
procedure for two classes of tensor impedance transmitarrays while also
validating the design using full-wave simulation. The first class are symmetric
transmitarrays which can alter a given incident polarization state into a
desired polarization state. The second class are asymmetric transmitarrays
which can also implement chiral polarization effects such as a linear
polarization rotation and a circular polarization selectivity.

previously unknown relation between the channel switching rates and membrane
capacitance, bypassing Eyring-type explicit treatment of gating charge
kinetics. From a molecular structural standpoint, membrane charge $Q_m$ is a
more natural dynamic variable than potential $V_m$; our formalism treats
$Q_m$-dependent conformational transition rates $\lambda_{ij}$ as intrinsic

protocol dependent,e.g., different from voltage or charge clamping
measurements. For constant membrane capacitance per unit area $C_m$ and
neglecting membrane potential induced by gating charges, $V_m=Q_m/C_m$, and

the standard Green-Kubo relation, according to which the shear viscosity is
given by the retarded correlator of the traceless part of viscous
energy-momentum tensor. We approximate this retarded correlator using a
one-loop skeleton expansion, and express the bosonic and fermionic shear
viscosities, $\eta_{b}$ and $\eta_{f}$, in terms of bosonic and fermionic
spectral widths, $\Gamma_{b}$ and $\Gamma_{\pm}$. Here, the subscripts $\pm$
correspond to normal and collective (plasmino) excitations of fermions. We
study, in particular, the effect of these excitations on thermal properties of
$\eta_{f}[\Gamma_{\pm}]$. To do this, we determine first the dependence of
$\Gamma_{b}$ and $\Gamma_{\pm}$ on momentum $p$, temperature $T$, chemical
potential $\mu$ and $\xi_{0}\equiv m_{b}^{0}/m_{f}^{0}$, in a one-loop
perturbative expansion in the orders of the Yukawa coupling. Here, $m_{b}^{0}$
and $m_{f}^{0}$ are $T$ and $\mu$ independent bosonic and fermionic masses,
respectively. We then numerically determine $\eta_{b}[\Gamma_{b}]$ and
$\eta_{f}[\Gamma_{\pm}]$, and study their thermal properties. It turns out that
whereas $\Gamma_{b}$ and $\Gamma_{+}$ decrease with increasing $T$ or $\mu$,
$\Gamma_{-}$ increases with increasing $T$ or $\mu$. This behavior
qualitatively changes by adding thermal corrections to $m_{b}^{0}$ and
$m_{f}^{0}$, while the difference between $\Gamma_{+}$ and $\Gamma_{-}$ keeps
increasing with increasing $T$ or $\mu$. Moreover, $\eta_{b}$ ($\eta_{f}$)
increases (decreases) with increasing $T$ or $\mu$. We show that the effect of
plasminos on $\eta_{f}$ becomes negligible with increasing (decreasing) $T$
($\mu$).

Non-linear hash functions have demonstrated the advantage over linear ones due

encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training
time. Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving non-linearity
in hashing, which are fast to train and evaluate, hence more suitable for
hashing with high dimensional data. In our approach, we first propose
sub-modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem and an
efficient GraphCut based block search method for solving large-scale inference.
Then we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the
binary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in retrieval precision and training
time. Especially for high-dimensional data, our method is orders of magnitude
faster than many methods in terms of training time.

signature of off-axis companions to the star, just like angular differential
imaging (ADI). However, the attenuation due to SDI has the peculiarity of being
dependent on the spectral properties of the companions. To date, no study has
investigated these effects. Our team is addressing this problem based on data
from a direct imaging survey of 16 stars combining the phase-mask coronagraph,
the SDI and the ADI modes of VLT/NaCo. The objective of the survey is to search
for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations of 5-10 AU orbiting
young, nearby stars (<200 Myr, <25 pc). The data analysis did not yield any
detections. As for the estimation of the sensitivity limits of SDI-processed
images, we show that it requires a different analysis than that used in
ADI-based surveys. Based on a method using the flux predictions of evolutionary
models and avoiding the estimation of contrast, we determine directly the mass
sensitivity limits of the survey for the ADI processing alone and with the
combination of SDI and ADI. We show that SDI does not systematically improve
the sensitivity due to the spectral properties and self-subtraction of point
sources.

one splits the notion of $\mu $-completeness into pieces, and asks for a
uniform ultrafilter over $\mu $ satisfying just some piece of $\mu
$-completeness.
  Analogue local versions of weak compactness are harder to come by, since weak
compactness cannot be defined by using a single ultrafilter. We deal with the
problem by restricting just to a subset $P$ of all the partitions of $\mu $
into $<\mu $ classes and asking for some ultrafilter $D$ over $\mu $ such that
no partition in $P$ disproves the $\mu $-completeness of $D$. By making $P$
vary in appropriate classes, one gets both measurability and weak compactness,
as well as possible intermediate notions of ""weak measurability"".
  We systematize the above procedures and combine them to obtain variants of
measurability which are at the same time weaker and local. Of particular
interest is the fact that the notions thus obtained admit equivalent
formulations through topological, model theoretical, combinatorial and Boolean

environmental stiffness that is reminiscent of the cellular response to
substrate stiffness. For small stiffness, minifilaments form transient
crosslinks exerting short spikes of force with negligible mean. For large
stiffness, minifilaments form near permanent crosslinks exerting a mean force
which hardly depends on environmental elasticity. This functional switch arises
because dissociation after the power stroke is suppressed by force (catch
bonding) and because ensembles can no longer perform the power stroke at large
forces. Symmetric myosin II minifilaments perform a random walk with an
effective diffusion constant which decreases with increasing ensemble size, as
demonstrated for rigid substrates with an analytical treatment.

seek quite general conditions which will allow us to show that the C*-envelope
of the semicrossed product is (a full corner of) a crossed product of an
auxiliary C*-algebra by a group action.
  Our analysis concerns a case-by-case dilation theory on covariant pairs. In
the process we determine the C*-envelope for various semicrossed products of
(possibly nonselfadjoint) operator algebras by spanning cones and
lattice-ordered abelian semigroups.
  In particular, we show that the C*-envelope of the semicrossed product of
C*-dynamical systems by doubly commuting representations of $\mathbb{Z}^n_+$
(by generally non-injective endomorphisms) is the full corner of a C*-crossed
product. In consequence we connect the ideal structure of C*-covers to
properties of the actions. In particular, when the system is classical, we show
that the C*-envelope is simple if and only if the action is injective and
minimal.
  The dilation methods that we use may be applied to non-abelian semigroups. We
identify the C*-envelope for actions of the free semigroup $\mathbb{F}_+^n$ by
automorphisms in a concrete way, and for injective systems in a more abstract

channels to secondaries in lieu of financial remuneration. Transmission quality
of a channel evolves randomly. Each primary has to select the price it would
quote without knowing the transmission qualities of its competitors' channels.
Each secondary buys a channel depending on the price and the transmission
quality a channel offers. We formulate the price selection problem as a non
co-operative game with primaries as players. In the one-shot game, we show that
there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium(NE) strategy profile and
explicitly compute it. Our analysis reveals that under the NE strategy profile
a primary prices its channel to render high quality channel more preferable to
the secondary; this negates the popular belief that prices ought to be selected
to render channels equally preferable to the secondary regardless of their
qualities. We show the loss of revenue in the asymptotic limit due to the non
co-operation of primaries. In the repeated version of the game, we characterize
a subgame perfect NE where a primary can attain a payoff arbitrarily close to
the payoff it would obtain when primaries co-operate.

is extended to the Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback, and the error
probabilities and achievable rate region are derived for this coding strategy
by using the iterated random function theory. A variant of the Ozarow-Leung
code for the general two-user broadcast channel with feedback can be realized
as a special case of our coding scheme. Furthermore, for the symmetric Gaussian
broadcast channel with feedback, our coding scheme achieves the linear-feedback
sum-capacity like the LQG code and outperforms the Kramer code.

  Theorem",,,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virial theorem is important for understanding stellar structures. It produces
an interesting connection between the magnetic energy and the gravitational
one. Using the general form of the virial theorem including the magnetic field
(toroidal magnetic field), we may explain the solar dynamo model in related to
variations of the magnetic and gravitational energies. We emphasize the role of
the gravitational energy in sub-surface layers which has been certainly minored
up to now. We also consider two types of solar outer shape (spherical and
spheroidal) to study the behavior of magnetic and gravitational energies. The
magnetic energy affects the solar shape, while the gravitational energy is not
changed by the considered shapes of the Sun.
