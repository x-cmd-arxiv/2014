in ordinary metals. One of the most significant differences is a resistivity
that is linear in temperature and rises to well above the Ioffe-Regel limit
(where the mean-free path is equal to the lattice spacing). Using an exact Kubo
formula, we show that a linear resistivity naturally occurs for many systems
when they are in an incoherent intermediate-temperature state. We verify the
analytic arguments with numerical calculations for a simplified version of the
Hubbard model which is solved with dynamical mean-field theory. Similar
features have also been seen in Hubbard models, where they can begin at even
lower temperatures due to the formation of resilient quasiparticles.

of signaling schemes is a crucial aspect of effective mechanisms aiming to
optimize social welfare or revenue. One of the research endeavors of this line
of work is understanding the algorithmic and computational complexity of
designing efficient signaling schemes. In reality, however, information is
typically not held by a central authority, but is distributed among multiple
sources (third-party ""mediators""), a fact that dramatically changes the
strategic and combinatorial nature of the signaling problem, making it a game
between information providers, as opposed to a traditional mechanism design
problem.
  In this paper we introduce {\em distributed signaling games}, while using
display advertising as a canonical example for introducing this foundational
framework. A distributed signaling game may be a pure coordination game (i.e.,
a distributed optimization task), or a non-cooperative game. In the context of
pure coordination games, we show a wide gap between the computational
complexity of the centralized and distributed signaling problems. On the other
hand, we show that if the information structure of each mediator is assumed to
be ""local"", then there is an efficient algorithm that finds a near-optimal
($5$-approximation) distributed signaling scheme.
  In the context of non-cooperative games, the outcome generated by the
mediators' signals may have different value to each (due to the auctioneer's
desire to align the incentives of the mediators with his own by relative
compensations). We design a mechanism for this problem via a novel application
of Shapley's value, and show that it possesses some interesting properties, in
particular, it always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, and it never decreases
the revenue of the auctioneer.

strands, which can influence biochemical processes involving its readout. For
example, loop formation in the Lac operon can regulate the expression of key
genes, and DNA supercoiling is closely correlated to rhythmic circardian gene
expression in cyanobacteria. Supercoiling is also important for large scale
organisation of the genome in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. DNA can
respond to torsional stress by writhing to form looped structures called
plectonemes, thus transferring energy stored as twist into energy stored in
bending. Denaturation bubbles can also relax torsional stress, with the
enthalpic cost of breaking bonds being compensated by their ability to absorb
undertwist. Here we predict a novel regime where bubbles form at the tips of
plectonemes, and study its properties using coarse-grained simulations. These
tip bubbles can occur for both positive and negative supercoiling and greatly
reduce plectoneme diffusion by a pinning mechanism. They can cause plectonemes
to preferentially localise to AT rich regions, because bubbles more easily form
there. The tip-bubble regime occurs for supercoiling densities and forces that
are typically encountered for DNA in vivo, and may be exploited for biological
control of genomic processes.

radius of R= 2.42 +0.28-0.34 R_Jup and a mass of M= 7.5 +16.9-4.3 M_Jup for the
PZ Tel companion, being consistent with most earlier estimates using photometry
alone. Combining our results with evolutionary models, we find a best fitting
mass of about 21 Jupiter masses at an age corresponding to the recently

detect observationally. The influence of magnetic concentrations on the
surrounding nonmagnetic convective flows (a 'proximity effect') reduces the
brightness by an amount exceeding the brightening by the magnetic
concentrations themselves. The net photospheric effect of the small scale field
(~ -0.34% at a mean flux density of 50 G) is thus negative. We conclude that
the main contribution to the observed positive correlation between the magnetic

small datasets and, for the first time, makes clustering high-coverage human

representative read from each cluster needs to be mapped using a traditional
readmapper such as BWA, instead of individually mapping all reads. On human
reads, all processing steps, including clustering and mapping, only require
11%-59% of the time for individually mapping all reads, achieving speed-ups for
all readmappers, while minimally affecting mapping quality. This accelerates a

phonon Boltzmann transport equation to investigate the thermal conductivity of
silicene as well as the phonon scattering mechanisms. Although both graphene
and silicene are two-dimensional crystals with similar crystal structure, we
find that phonon transport in silicene is quite different from that in
graphene. The thermal conductivity of silicene shows a logarithmic increase
with respect to the sample size due to the small scattering rates of acoustic
in-plane phonon modes, while that of graphene is finite. Detailed analysis of
phonon scattering channels shows that the linear dispersion of the acoustic
out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, which is induced by the buckled structure,
makes the long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes in silicene
not as efficiently scattered as that in graphene. Compared with graphene, where
most of the heat is carried by the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, the
ZA phonon modes in silicene only have ~10% contribution to the total thermal
conductivity, which can also be attributed to the buckled structure. This
systematic comparison of phonon transport and thermal conductivity of silicene

bounded operator \begin{eqnarray*} \bigwedge (T_1,\ldots
,T_{k-p},R):~C^0(X)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}. \end{eqnarray*} This operator is
{\bf symmetric} in $T_1,\ldots ,T_{k-p}$. It is {\bf independent} of the choice
of a quasi-potential $u_i$ of $T_i$, of the choice of a smooth closed $(1,1)$
form $\theta _i$ in the cohomology class of $T_i$, and of the choice of a
K\""ahler form on $X$. Its total mass $<\bigwedge (T_1,\ldots ,T_{k-p},R),1>$ is
the intersection in cohomology $\{T_1\}\{T_2\}\ldots \{T_{k-p}\}.\{R\}$. It has
a semi-continuous property concerning approximating $T_i$ by appropriate smooth
closed $(1,1)$ forms, plus some other good properties.
  If $p=0$ and $T_1=\ldots =T_k=T$, we have a least negative Monge-Ampere
operator $MA(T)=\bigwedge (T,\ldots ,T)$. If the set where $T$ has positive
Lelong numbers does not contain any curve, then $MA(T)$ is positive. Several
examples are given.

The main feature of the schemes is their ability to preserve the total particle
number and total energy on the fully discrete level regardless of mesh size.
Those are desired properties of numerical schemes especially for long time
simulations with under-resolved mesh. The conservation is realized by explicit
and implicit energy-conserving temporal discretizations, and the discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) spatial discretizations. We benchmarked our algorithms on a test
example to check the one-species limit, and the current-driven ion-acoustic
instability. To simulate the current-driven ion-acoustic instability, a slight
modification for the implicit method is necessary to fully decouple the split
equations. This is achieved by a Gauss-Seidel type iteration technique.
Numerical results verified the conservation and performance of our methods.

prevent free riding in social dilemmas. But in large groups these mechanisms
may become ineffective, because they require single individuals to have a
substantial influence on their peers. However, the recent discovery of the
powerful class of zero-determinant strategies in the iterated prisoner's
dilemma suggests that we may have underestimated the degree of control that a
single player can exert. Here, we develop a theory for zero-determinant
strategies for multiplayer social dilemmas, with any number of involved
players. We distinguish several particularly interesting subclasses of
strategies: fair strategies ensure that the own payoff matches the average
payoff of the group; extortionate strategies allow a player to perform above
average; and generous strategies let a player perform below average. We use
this theory to explore how individuals can enhance their strategic options by
forming alliances. The effects of an alliance depend on the size of the
alliance, the type of the social dilemma, and on the strategy of the allies:
fair alliances reduce the inequality within their group; extortionate alliances
outperform the remaining group members; but generous alliances increase
welfare. Our results highlight the critical interplay of individual control and
alliance formation to succeed in large groups.

Assuming ignorance about the extent to which the process has advanced, which
implies an ignorance about the final temperatures, we quantify the prior
information about the process and assign a prior distribution to the unknown
temperature(s). This requires that we also take into account the temperature
values which are regarded to be unphysical in the standard theory, as they lead
to a contradiction with the physical laws. Instead in our formulation, such
values appear to be consistent with the given prior information and hence are
included in the inference. We derive estimates of the efficiency at optimal
work from the expected values of the final temperatures, and show that these
values match with the exact expressions in the limit when any one of the

reservoirs, we suggest a weighting procedure over the estimates from two valid

2011 QF99. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of the orbital evolution of
these transient co-orbitals to understand better how they got captured in the
first place and what makes them dynamically unstable. We also look for
additional temporary Uranian co-orbital candidates among known objects. Our
N-body simulations show that the long-term stability of 2011 QF99 is controlled
by Jupiter and Neptune; it briefly enters the 1:7 mean motion resonance with
Jupiter and the 2:1 with Neptune before becoming a Trojan and prior to leaving
its tadpole orbit. During these ephemeral two-body mean motion resonance
episodes, apsidal corotation resonances are also observed. For known
co-orbitals, Saturn is the current source of the main destabilizing force but
this is not enough to eject a minor body from the 1:1 commensurability with
Uranus. These objects must enter mean motion resonances with Jupiter and
Neptune in order to be captured or become passing Centaurs. Asteroid 2010 EU65,
a probable visitor from the Oort cloud, may have been stable for several Myr
due to its comparatively low eccentricity. In addition, we show that the
orbital properties and discovery circumstances of known objects can be used to
outline a practical strategy by which additional Uranus' co-orbitals may be
found.

strong variability during quiescence on timescales of days to seconds.The
present study aims to update the outdated orbital ephemerides published
previously, to investigate deviations from linear ephemerides, and to
characterize non-random brightness variations in a range of timescales. Light
curves of V893 Sco were observed on 39 nights, spanning a total time base of
about 14 years. They contain 114 eclipses which were used to significantly
improve the precision of the orbital period and to study long-term variations
of the time of revolution. Oscillations and similar brightness variations were
studied with Fourier techniques in the individual light curves. The orbital
period exhibits long-term variations with a cycle time of 10.2 years. They can
be interpreted as a light travel time effect caused by the presence of a giant
planet with approximately 9.5 Jupiter masses in a 4.5 AU orbit around V893 Sco.
On some nights transient semi-periodic variations on timescales of several
minutes can be seen which may be identified as quasi-periodic oscillations.
However, it is difficult to distinguish whether they are caused by real
physical mechanisms or if they are the effect of an accidental superposition of
unrelated flickering flares. Simulations to investigate this question are
presented.

compile a moderate-sized sample of UV DLAs in any narrow cosmic time interval.
However, DLAs are easy to identify in low-resolution spectra because they have
large absorption rest equivalent widths. We have performed an efficient
strong-MgII-selected survey for UV DLAs at redshifts z=[0.42,0.70] using HST's
low-resolution ACS-HRC-PR200L prism. This redshift interval covers ~1.8 Gyr in
cosmic time, i.e., t~[7.2,9.0] Gyrs after the Big Bang. A total of 96 strong
MgII absorption-line systems identified in SDSS spectra were successfully
observed with the prism at the predicted UV wavelengths of Ly-alpha absorption.
We found that 35 of the 96 systems had a significant probability of being DLAs.
One additional observed system could be a very high N(HI) DLA (N(HI)~2x10^22

to do so requires embellishing the cognitive theory so that it can make
predictions for neuroscience; much the same as how testing a cognitive theory
using behavior requires embellishing that theory to make experimentally
realizable behavioral predictions (i.e., the process of generating operational

approximating LOOCV with only Markov chain samples simulated from a posterior

approximations given by importance sampling (IS) and WAIC in Bayesian models
with possibly correlated latent variables. In iIS and iWAIC, we first integrate
the predictive density over the distribution of the latent variables associated
with the held-out without reference to its observation, then apply IS and WAIC
approximations to the integrated predictive density. We compare iIS and iWAIC
with other approximation methods in three real data examples that respectively
use mixture models, models with correlated spatial effects, and a random effect
logistic model. Our empirical results show that iIS and iWAIC give

introducing nonforking, seminal for the development of stability theory. Prior
to the present paper, there had been no such characterization of an unstable
class. In the present paper, we first establish the existence of so-called
optimal ultrafilters on Boolean algebras, which are to simple theories as
Keisler's good ultrafilters are to all theories. Then, assuming a supercompact
cardinal, we characterize the simple theories in terms of saturation of

of simple theories, in ZFC, via complexity of certain amalgamation patterns.
This brings into focus a fundamental complexity in simple unstable theories
having no real analogue in stability.

dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and $(ii)$ consistent
circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed-duration upstream
transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze
circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of
dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based
analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by
admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and
we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet

demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON.

additional iterative structure emerges for finite loop integrals. As a concrete
non-trivial example we study planar master integrals of light-by-light
scattering to three loops, and derive analytic results for all values of the
Mandelstam variables $s$ and $t$ and the mass $m$. We start with a recent
proposal for defining a basis of loop integrals having uniform transcendental
weight properties and use this approach to compute all planar two-loop master
integrals in dimensional regularization. We then show how this approach can be
further simplified when computing finite loop integrals. This allows us to
discuss precisely the subset of integrals that are relevant to the problem. We
find that this leads to a block triangular structure of the differential
equations, where the blocks correspond to integrals of different weight. We
explain how this block triangular form is found in an algorithmic way. Another
advantage of working in four dimensions is that integrals of different loop
orders are interconnected and can be seamlessly discussed within the same
formalism. We use this method to compute all finite master integrals needed up
to three loops. Finally, we remark that all integrals have simple Mandelstam
representations.

coevolution of strategy and network interdependence to study whether it can

show that the interdependence between networks self-organizes so as to yield

adverse conditions cooperators can prevail where on isolated networks they
would perish. This is due to the spontaneous emergence of a two-class society,
with only the upper class being allowed to control and take advantage of the
interdependence. Spatial patterns reveal that cooperators, once arriving to the

clusters of followers. Indeed, the asymmetric exploitation of interdependence
confers to them a strong evolutionary advantage that may resolve even the

buckled monolayer graphene, quasi-relativistic Dirac fermions may find
themselves in a variety of broken symmetry phases even for weak interactions.
Through a detailed Hartree self-consistent numerical calculation in finite
strained graphene with cylindrical and open boundaries we establish the
possibility of realizing a charge-density-wave order for the spinless fermions
in the presence of weak nearest-neighbor repulsion. Such an instability gives
rise to a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between bulk and
boundary of the system as well as among two sublattices of graphene, due to the
spatial separation of the zero energy states localized on opposite sublattices.
Although with fermions spin restored, an unconventional magnetic order driven
by the onsite repulsion, possibly leads to the dominant instability at the
Dirac point, the proposed charge-density-wave order can nevertheless be
realized at finite doping, which is always accompanied by a finite
ferromagnetic moment. Additionally, the charge-density-wave phase supports a
quantized charge or spin Hall conductivity when its formation away from the
Dirac point is further preceded by the appearance of topological anomalous or
spin Hall insulator respectively. The topological orders in strained graphene
can be supported by weak second neighbor repulsion, for example. Therefore,
depending on the relative strength of various short-range components of the
Coulomb interaction a number of broken symmetry phases can be realized within
the zero energy manifold in strained graphene.

$>6^{\prime \prime}$ (corresponding to physical distances $>0.05$ Mpc) and
thereby map the one- and two-halo contributions to the clustering. We fit halo
occupation distributions and determine how the central galaxy's stellar mass
and satellite occupation depend on the halo mass. We measure a prominent peak
in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at a halo mass of $\log(M_{\rm halo} /

the idea of an evolving mass threshold above which star formation is quenched.

fraction to be $f_\mathrm{sat}\sim0.2$, showing a clear evolution compared to

galaxies that are in similar mass pairs is higher at $z=1.5$ than at $z=0$. In

decaying to neutrinos have been considered while dark matter annihilation has
been dismissed invoking the unitarity bound as a limiting factor. However, the
latter claim was done ignoring the contribution from dark matter substructure,
which for PeV Cold Dark Matter would extend down to a free streaming mass of
$\mathcal{O}$($10^{-18}$M$_\odot$). Since the unitarity bound is less stringent
at low velocities, ($\sigma_{\rm ann}$v)$\leq4\pi/m_\chi^2v$, then, it is
possible that these cold and dense subhalos would contribute dominantly to a
dark-matter-induced neutrino flux and easily account for the events observed by
IceCube. A Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter model can naturally support such
scenario. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the events shows features
that would be expected in a dark matter interpretation. Although not
conclusive, 9 of the 37 events appear to be clustered around a region near the
Galactic Center while 6 others spatially coincide, within the reported angular
errors, with 5 of 26 Milky Way satellites. However, a simple estimate of the
probability of the latter occurring by chance is $\sim35\%$. More events are
needed to statistically test this hypothesis. PeV dark matter particles are
massive enough that their abundance as standard thermal relics would overclose
the Universe. This issue can be solved in alternative scenarios, for instance
if the decay of new massive unstable particles generates significant entropy
reheating the Universe to a slightly lower temperature than the freeze-out
temperature, $T_{\rm RH} \lesssim T_{\rm f}\sim4\times10^4$~GeV.

sources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities for
probing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new source
classes. Until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been
detected with the Parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting some
concern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. Here we present FRB
121102, the first FRB discovery from a geographic location other than Parkes.
FRB 121102 was found in the Galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-GHz Pulsar
ALFA survey with the Arecibo Observatory with a DM = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pc
cm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellar
scattering. The observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agrees
precisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. Despite
its low Galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times the
maximum Galactic DM expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting an
extragalactic origin. A peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;
we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the ALFA
receiver. FRB 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate are
all consistent with the properties of the previously detected Parkes bursts.

foreground-cleaned Planck maps by means of a suitably defined {\it
local-variance} estimator. Our analysis shows a clear dipolar structure in
Planck's {\it variance map} pointing in the direction $(l,b) \,\simeq\,
(220^{\circ},-32^{\circ})$, thus consistent with the North-South asymmetry
phenomenon. Surprisingly, and contrary to previous findings, removing the CMB
quadrupole and octopole makes the asymmetry stronger. Our results show a
maximal statistical significance, of $98.1\%$ CL, in the scales ranging from
$\ell=4$ to $\ell=500$. Additionally, through exhaustive analyses of the four
foreground-cleaned and individual frequency Planck maps, we find unlikely that
residual foregrounds could be causing this dipole variance asymmetry. Moreover,
we find that the dipole gets lower amplitudes for larger masks, evidencing that
most of the contribution to the variance dipole comes from a region near the
galactic plane. Finally, our results are robust against different foreground
cleaning procedures, different Planck masks, pixelization parameters, and the
addition of inhomogeneous real noise.

rate is known with certainty. Then, once the arrival rate becomes known, the
call center may be over-staffed, in which case staff are being paid to be idle,
or under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long wait
times. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can
mitigate this problem by co-sourcing; that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls.
Then, the required staffing $N$ depends on how the firm chooses which calls to
outsource in real-time, after the arrival rate realizes and the call center
operates as a $M/M/N+M$ queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to
find a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long
run average cost of this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear
staffing cost per unit time and linear costs associated with abandonments and
outsourcing.
  We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety staffing rule, and
outsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when
the system is ""too crowded"". Analytically, we establish that our proposed
policy is asymptotically optimal, as the mean arrival rate becomes large, when
the level of uncertainty in the arrival rate is of the same order as the
inherent system fluctuations in the number of waiting customers for a known
arrival rate. Through an extensive numerical study, we establish that our
policy is extremely robust. In particular, our policy performs remarkably well
over a wide range of parameters, and far beyond where it is proved to be
asymptotically optimal.

close-range encounters between galaxies are less frequent and less damaging to
disc galaxies than originally expected, since they mostly occur when group
members have lost a significant fraction of their initial mass to tidal
stripping. We also find that group members mostly affect disc galaxies
indirectly by modifying their common global tidal field. Different initial
orbital parameters of group members introduce a significant ""scatter"" in the
evolution of general properties of disc galaxies around a ""median"" evolution
that is similar to when only the effect of the global tidal field is included.
Close-encounters introduce a high variability in the properties of disc
galaxies, even slowing their evolution in some cases, and could wash out
correlations between galaxy properties and the group total mass. The combined
effect of the global tidal field and close-encounters appears to be inefficient
at forming/enhancing central stellar bulges. This implies that bulges of S0
galaxies should be mostly composed by young stars, which is consistent with
recent observations.

supercooled SW Si, in the temperature range of 1060 K--1070 K at zero pressure.
We find that as the relaxation of the metastable supercooled liquid phase
initiates, a straight line region (SLR) is formed in cumulative potential
energy distributions. The configurational temperature corresponding to the SLR
is close to 1060 K, which was earlier identified as the freezing temperature of
4-coordinated amorphous network. The SLR is found to be tangential to the
distribution of the metastable liquid phase and thus influences the broadness
of the distribution. As the bath temperature is reduced from 1070 K to 1060 K,
the effective temperature approaches the bath temperature which results in
broadening of the metastable phase distribution. This, in turn, causes an
increase in overall fluctuations of potential energy and hence an increase of
heat capacity. We also find that during initial stages of relaxation,
4-coordinated atoms form 6-membered rings with a chair--like structure and
other structural units that indicate crystallization. Simultaneously a strong
correlation is established between the number of chair-shaped 6-membered rings
and the number of 4-coordinated atoms in the system. This shows that all
properties related to 4-coordinated particles are highly correlated as the SLR
is formed in potential energy distributions and this can be interpreted as a
consequence of `freezing' of amorphous network formed by 4-coordinated
particles.

Traditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to

we consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label
information, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant
features due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the
intrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection
(GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian
regularized least squares regression model. With $\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can
find a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds.
Extensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two
computational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior
performance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature
selection methods. Additionally, we show that GLFS selects a sparser set of

formal measure of synergy, based on the idea that a synergy is exhibited when
the performance of a team deviates from the norm. We then show that our synergy
value is the only possible such measure that satisfies certain intuitive
properties. We then investigate some alternative characterisations of this
measure.

spectral effects of space weathering are darkening, reduction in intensity of
silicate mineral absorption bands, and an increase in the spectral slope
towards longer wavelengths (reddening). Production of nanophase metallic iron
(npFe$^{0}$) during space weathering plays major role in these spectral
changes. A laboratory procedure for the controlled production of npFe$^{0}$ in
silicate mineral powders has been developed. The method is based on a two-step
thermal treatment of low-iron olivine, first in ambient air and then in
hydrogen atmosphere. Through this process, a series of olivine powder samples
was prepared with varying amounts of npFe$^{0}$ in the 7-20 nm size range. A
logarithmic trend is observed between amount of npFe$^{0}$ and darkening,
reduction of 1 {\mu}m olivine absorption band, reddening, and 1 {\mu}m band
width. Olivine with a population of physically larger npFe$^{0}$ particles
follows spectral trends similar to other samples, except for the reddening
trend. This is interpreted as the larger, ~40-50 nm sized, npFe$^{0}$ particles
do not contribute to the spectral slope change as efficiently as the smaller
npFe$^{0}$ fraction. A linear trend is observed between the amount of
npFe$^{0}$ and 1 {\mu}m band center position, most likely caused by Fe$^{2+}$
disassociation from olivine structure into npFe$^{0}$ particles.

looking at their Lyman-alpha line profiles. We carry out Lyman-alpha radiation
transfer calculations in two models of HII regions which are porous to ionising
continuum escape: 1) the so-called ""density bounded"" media, in which massive
stars produce enough ionising photons to keep the surrounding interstellar
medium transparent to the ionising continuum, i.e almost totally ionised, and
2) ""riddled ionisation-bounded"" media, surrounded by neutral interstellar
medium, but with holes, i.e. with a covering factor lower than unity. The
Lyman-alpha spectra emergent from these configurations have distinctive
features: 1) a ""classical"" asymmetric redshifted profile in the first case, but
with a small shift of the maximum of the profile compare to the systemic
redshift (Vpeak < 150 km/s); 2) a main peak at the systemic redshift in the
second case (Vpeak = 0 km/s), with, as a consequence, a non-zero Lyman-alpha
flux bluewards the systemic redshift. Assuming that in a galaxy leaking
ionising photons, the Lyman-alpha component emerging from the leaking star
cluster(s) dominates the total Lyman-alpha spectrum, the Lyman-alpha shape may
be used as a pre-selection tool to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) leaking
galaxies, in objects with well determined systemic redshift, and high spectral
resolution Lyman-alpha spectra (R >= 4000). The examination of a sample of 10
local starbursts with high resolution HST-COS Lyman-alpha spectra and known in
the literature as LyC leakers or leaking candidates, corroborates our
predictions. Observations of Lyman-alpha profiles at high resolution should
show definite signatures revealing the escape of Lyman continuum photons from
star-forming galaxies.

stars, and surprisingly so, as they are missing in our solar system. Recent
detections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to
begin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and
internal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most
common, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital
periods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 R_e planets that receive 1-4x the
incident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are
sprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and
probably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show
that the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e, have the density expected for rocky
planets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by
gravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation:
rho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0
R_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing
amounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,
befitting the appellation ""mini-Neptunes."" Planets of ~1.5 R_e have the highest
densities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially
around stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around
stars having a range of heavy element abundances. One explanation is that the
fast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavy
elements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,
forming giant planets. But models of the formation of 1-4 R_e planets remain
uncertain. Defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit of
either detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemical
origins.

likelihood ratio under Gaussian hypothesis and replacing the unknown background
parameters by their estimates. In most applications, interference signals are
assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean or with a known mean vector that can be
removed and with unknown covariance matrix. When mean vector is unknown, it has
to be jointly estimated with the covariance matrix, as it is the case for
instance in hyperspectral imaging. In this paper, the adaptive versions of the
classical Matched Filter and the Normalized Matched Filter, as well as two
versions of the Kelly detector are first derived and then are analyzed for the
case when the mean vector of the background is unknown. More precisely,
theoretical closed-form expressions for false-alarm regulation are derived and
the Constant False Alarm Rate property is pursued to allow the detector to be
independent of nuisance parameters. Finally, the theoretical contribution is
validated through simulations and on real hyperspectral scenes.

cell entries are continuous or represent values inferred from a continuous
parametric model, then FET cannot be applied. Such tables arise frequently in
areas of biostatistical research including population genetics and evolutionary
genomics, where cell entries are estimated by computational methods and result
in cell entries drawn from the non-negative real line R+. Simply rounding cell
entries to conform to the assumptions of FET is an ill-suited approach that we
show creates problems related to both type-I and type-II errors. Pearson's
chi^2 test for independence, while technically applicable, is not often
effective for these tables, as the test has several limiting assumptions that
make application of this method inadvisable in many common instances
(particularly with small cell entries). Here we develop a novel method for
tables with continuous entries, which we term continuous Fisher's Exact Test
(cFET). Through simulations, we show that cFET has a close-to-uniform
distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of independence, and more
power when applied to tables where the null hypothesis is false (compared to
FET applied to rounded cell entries). We apply cFET to an example from
comparative genomics to confirm an overall increased evolutionary rate among
primates compared to rodents, and identify several genes that show particularly
elevated evolutionary rates in primates. Some of these genes exhibit signatures
of continued positive selection along the human lineage since our divergence
with chimpanzee 5-7 million years ago, as well as ongoing selection in modern

1979) insist on the role of paraphrases, rewritings, citations, reciprocal

Phoebus is collaborative project that makes computer scientists from the
University Pierre and Marie Curie (LIP6-UPMC) collaborate with the literary
teams of Paris-Sorbonne University with the aim to develop efficient tools for
literary studies that take advantage of modern computer science techniques. In
this context, we have developed a piece of software that automatically detects

describes the principles on which is based this program, the significant
results that have already been obtained and the perspectives for the near

from the top level of the visual hierarchy that processes gist and abstract

Inspired by the theory, we develop a computational model for saliency detection
in images. First, the original image is downsampled to different scales to
constitute a pyramid. Then, saliency on each layer is obtained by image
super-resolution reconstruction from the layer above, which is defined as
unpredictability from this coarse-to-fine reconstruction. Finally, saliency on
each layer of the pyramid is fused into stochastic fixations through a
probabilistic model, where attention initiates from the top layer and
propagates downward through the pyramid. Extensive experiments on two standard
eye-tracking datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive
results with state-of-the-art models.

equalization and conventional decoding methods. To deal with the ISI problem,
in this paper a new joint successive cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm is
proposed for polar codes in ISI channels, which combines the equalization and
conventional decoding. The initialization information of the decoding method is
the likelihood functions of ISI codeword symbols rather than the codeword
symbols. The decoding adopts recursion formulas like conventional SC decoding
and is without iterations. This is in contrast to the conventional iterative
algorithm which performs iterations between the equalizer and decoder. In
addition, the proposed SC trellis decoding can be easily extended to list
decoding which can further improve the performance. Simulation shows that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional decoding schemes in
ISI channels.

the electronic structures after doping are investigated in details. The results
show that the electronic characters near the Fermi level are high sensitive to

1,2;8,9-dibenzopentacene exhibits visibly different band structures from other
three PAHs. In these metallic PAHs, two bands cross the Fermi level which
results in the complicated multiband feature of Fermi surfaces. Fascinatingly,
we find that the electronic states of potassium contribute to the Fermi
surfaces especially for K-3$d$ electrons, which improves a way to understand
this superconductivity. As a result, we suggest that the rigid-band picture is
invalidated due to the hybridization between K atoms and PAH molecules as well
as the rearrangement and distortion of PAH molecules.

homogeneous nucleation of liquid in their core, depending on overheating time
and temperature. In complete contrast to current ideas, a long time is
necessary to melt them and to attain the thermodynamic equilibrium above Tm.
They act as heterogeneous growth nuclei of crystallized phase at a temperature
Tc of the undercooled melt when they are not melted. They contribute to the
reduction of the critical barrier, which becomes smaller than that of crystals
containing the same atom number n. The undercooling rate is always limited,
even in a liquid at thermodynamic equilibrium, because the homogeneous
nucleation of 13-atom superclusters reduces the energy barrier, and increases
Tc above the homogeneous nucleation temperature equal to Tm/3 in liquid

the interband Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) and intraband
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairings. In particular, for the weak and
moderate SOC strengths, these two pairings can coexist, giving rise to a new
phase called the FFLO-BCS phase, which exhibits a unique three-peak structure
in pairing momentum distribution. For the strong SOC strength, the intraband
BCS pairing always dominates in the whole parameter regime, including the half
filling. We figure out the whole phase diagrams as functions of filling factor,
SOC strength, and Zeeman field. Our results are qualitatively different from
recent mean-field predictions. Finally, we address that our predictions could

of the lightest KK particle is expected to be above 10 TeV to satisfy
constraints from avor changing neutral currents(FCNC). Instead, the precision

International Linear Collider(ILC) is a promising way to observe the deviation
originating from the Higgs-radion mixing and radiative corrections from the KK
gauge bosons and matter fermions. For some cases, those effects are separately

SIS18 at GSI Helmholtzzentrum for Heavy-Ion Research, Darmstadt. The transverse
mass distributions in rapidity bins are well described by Boltzmann shapes with
a maximum inverse slope parameter of about $90\,$MeV at a rapidity of $y=1.0$,
i.e. slightly below the center-of-mass rapidity for nucleon-nucleon collisions,
$y_{cm}=1.12$. The rapidity density decreases monotonically with increasing
rapidity within a rapidity window ranging from 0.3 to 1.3. The $\Lambda$
phase-space distribution is compared with results of other experiments and with
predictions of two transport approaches which are available publicly. None of
the present versions of the employed models is able to fully reproduce the
experimental distributions, i.e. in absolute yield and in shape. Presumably,
this finding results from an insufficient modelling in the transport models of
the elementary processes being relevant for $\Lambda$ production, rescattering
and absorption. The present high-statistics data allow for a genuine
two-dimensional investigation as a function of phase space of the
self-analyzing $\Lambda$ polarization in the weak decay $\Lambda\rightarrow p
\pi^-$. Finite negative values of the polarization in the order of $5-20\,\%$
are observed over the entire phase space studied. The absolute value of the
polarization increases almost linearly with increasing transverse momentum for
$p_t>300\,$MeV/c and increases with decreasing rapidity for $y < 0.8$.

S155. Star-formation activities therein were investigated based on
multi-wavelength data from optical to the far-infrared. The surface density
distribution of selected 2MASS sources toward S155 indicates the existence of a
compact cluster, which is spatially consistent with the position of the
exciting source of the H II region, HD 217086. A sample of more than 200
excessive emission sources in the infrared were selected based on their 2MASS
color indices. The spatial distribution of the sample sources reveals the
existence of three young sub-clusters in this region, among which, sub-cluster
A is spatially coincident with the bright rim of the H II region. In addition,
photometric data from the WISE survey were used to identify and classify young
stellar objects (YSOs). To further explore the evolutionary stages of the
candidate YSOs, we fit the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of 44 sources,
which led to the identification of 14 Class I, 27 Class II, and 3 Class III
YSOs. The spatial distribution of the classified YSOs at different evolutionary
stages presents a spatio-temporal gradient, which is consistent with a scenario
of sequential star formation. On the other hand, Herschel PACS observations
toward the interface between S155 and the ambient molecular cloud disclose an
arc-shaped dust layer, the origin of which could be attributed to the UV
dissipation from the early type stars e.g. HD 217061 in S155. Four dusty cores
were revealed by the Herschel data, which hints for new generations of star

approach, in which the two-proton emission is described as a time-evolution of

emission can be intuitively discussed by monitoring the time-dependence of the
two-particle density distribution. With a model Hamiltonian which well
reproduces the experimental two-proton decay width, we show that a strongly
correlated diproton emission is a dominant process in the early stage of the
two-proton emission. When the diproton correlation is absent, the sequential
two-proton emission competes with the diproton emission, and the decay width is
underestimated. These results suggest that the two-proton emission decays
provide a good opportunity to probe the diproton correlation in proton-rich

enhanced canting angle of antiferromagnetically ordered spins caused by the
crystal lattice distortion. However, further increase in substitution results
in the reduction of remnant magnetization and coercivity due to the appearance
of complete antiferromagnetic ordering in the orthorhombic structure because of

considered in the framework of the compensation approach. Conditions for a
spontaneous generation of effective interactions of fundamental fields are
shown to lead to sets of equations for parameters of a theory. A principal
possibility to calculate mass ratios of fundamental quarks and leptons is
demonstrated, as well of mixing angles of quarks, e.g. of the Cabibbo angle. A
possibility of a spontaneous generation of an effective interaction of
electroweak gauge bosons $W^a$ and $B$ is demonstrated. In case of a
realization of a non-trivial solution of a set of compensation equations,
parameter $\sin^2\theta_W$ is defined. The non-trivial solution is demonstrated
to provide a satisfactory value for the electromagnetic fine structure constant
$\alpha$ at scale $M_Z$: $\alpha(M_Z) = 0.00772$. The results being obtained
may be considered as sound arguments on behalf of a possibility of a
calculation of parameters of the Standard Model.

Instead, we can argue that only a refinement of the estimate $\hat{\theta}_N$

that it is reasonable to suppose that an initial guess of the parameter is

love errors, and discuss whether traditional software dependability fits into
this class. The answer is somewhat negative, although adaptive fault tolerance
is antifragile: the system learns something when an error happens, and always
imrpoves. Automatic runtime bug fixing is changing the code in response to
errors, fault injection in production means injecting errors in business
critical software. I claim that both correspond to antifragility. Finally, I
hypothesize that antifragile development processes are better at producing

have conformational transition rates tuned one at time in the polymerase
elongation cycle, with a controlled differentiation free energy at each
checkpoint. The elongation is sustained at non-equilibrium steady state with
constant free energy input and heat dissipation. It is found that error
reduction capability does not improve for selection checkpoints down the
reaction path. Hence, it is essential to select early to achieve an efficient
fidelity control. In particular, for two consecutive selections that reject the
wrong substrate back and inhibit it forward from a same kinetic state, the same
error rates are obtained at the same free energy differentiation. The initial
screening is indispensible for maintaining the elongation speed high, as the
wrong nucleotides can be removed quickly and replaced by the right nucleotides

convection, pulsations, or magnetism, we need to ensure that this index mostly
takes into account magnetic effects. We define another stellar magnetic
activity index as the average of the standard deviation of shorter subseries
which lengths are determined by the rotation period of the star. This way we
can ensure that the measured photometric variability is related to starspots
crossing the visible stellar disk. This new index combined with a
time-frequency analysis based on the Morlet wavelets allows us to determine the
existence of magnetic activity cycles. We measure magnetic indexes for the Sun
and for 34 M dwarfs observed by Kepler. As expected, we obtain that the sample
of M dwarfs studied in this work is much more active than the Sun. Moreover, we
find a small correlation between the rotation period and the magnetic index.
Finally, by combining a time-frequency analysis with phase diagrams, we
discover the presence of long-lived features suggesting the existence of active
longitudes on the surface of these stars.

by decays of hypothetical long-lived exotic particles. The injections induce
the showers of nonthermal hadrons via nuclear scattering. Neutrons generated at
these events can react with $^7$Be nuclei and reduce $^7$Be abundance solving a
problem of the primordial $^7$Li abundance. We suggest that thermal neutron
injection is a way to derive a model independent conservative limit on the
relation between abundances of D and $^7$Li in a hadronic energy injection
model. We emphasize that an uncertainty in cross sections of inelastic $n+p$
scattering affects the total number of induced neutrons, which determines final
abundances of D and $^7$Li. In addition, the annihilations of antinucleons with
$^4$He result in higher D abundance and trigger nonthermal $^6$Li production.
It is concluded that a reduction of $^7$Li abundance from a value in the
standard big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model down to an observational two
$\sigma$ upper limit is necessarily accompanied by an undesirable increase of D
abundance up to at least an observational 12 $\sigma$ upper limit from
observations of quasi-stellar object absorption line systems. The effects of
antinucleons and secondary particles produced in the hadronic showers always
lead to a severer constraint. The BBN models involving any injections of extra

have an hour-glass geometry, i.e., the magnetic field lines are pinched as they
thread the equatorial plane surrounding the forming star but merge smoothly
onto a background field at large distances. With this field configuration,
incoming cosmic rays experience both a funneling effect that acts to enhance
the flux impinging on the circumstellar disk and a magnetic mirroring effect
that acts to reduce that flux. To leading order, these effects nearly cancel
out for simple underlying magnetic field structures. However, the environments
surrounding young stellar objects are expected to be highly turbulent. This
paper shows how the presence of magnetic field fluctuations affects the process
of magnetic mirroring, and thereby changes the flux of cosmic rays striking
circumstellar disks. Turbulence has two principle effects: 1) The (single)
location of the magnetic mirror point found in the absence of turbulence is
replaced with a wide distribution of values. 2) The median of the mirror point
distribution moves outward for sufficiently large fluctuation amplitudes
(roughly when $\delta B/B_0>0.2$ at the location of the turbulence-free mirror
point); the distribution becomes significantly non-gaussian in this regime as
well. These results may have significant consequences for the ionization
fraction of the disk, which in turn dictates the efficiency with which disk
material can accrete onto the central object. A similar reduction in cosmic ray
flux can occur during the earlier protostellar stages; the decrease in
ionization can help alleviate the magnetic braking problem that inhibits disk
formation.

theorem, we identify universal features of efficiency fluctuations. While the
standard thermodynamic efficiency is, as expected, the most likely value, we

system of $N$ electrons subjected to mutual Coulomb repulsion and an external
electric field. For a long time, the treatment of the kinetic energy was not
correct and the theory was not well-defined for $N$-representable particle
densities. In the work of [Hadjisavvas and Theophilou, Phys. Rev. A, 1984, 30,
2183], a rigorous Kohn-Sham theory for $N$-representable particle densities was
developed using the Levy-Lieb functional. Since a Levy-Lieb-type functional can
be defined for Current Density Functional Theory formulated with the
paramagnetic current density, we here develop a rigorous $N$-representable
Kohn-Sham approach for interacting electrons in magnetic field. Furthermore, in
the one-electron case, criteria for $N$-representable particle densities to be
$v$-representable are given.

However, neither the ""crossing-criterion"" nor the new ""floating interface""

The highlight of the research is that the proposed scheme can dramatically
improve the performance of cells that have a high discrepancy in its

results show that a \emph{free-lunch} solution is possible, whereby for a
negligible performance degradation in the saturated users, a large improvement
in the non-saturated users can be obtained. However, on average, the number of
free-lunch user pairings are low. By relaxing the degradation constraints, the
\emph{non-free-lunch} solution can yield a greater multi-user throughput gain.
Motivated by surge in mobile multimedia traffic, we further demonstrate that
the proposed scheduling may have a profound impact on both energy efficiency

of an insulating bulk and one-dimensional helical edge states. While these edge

rate $\tau^{-1}$ and the semiclassical conductivity in the regimes of high
($\omega \gg \tau^{-1}$) and low ($\omega \ll \tau^{-1}$) frequency. By
comparing the two limits, we find that the parametric dependence of

Luttinger liquid effects, we complement the kinetic equation analysis by
treating interactions exactly in bosonization and calculating conductivity

(12+log(O/H) < 7.7) is not consistent with the XLF normalisation for galaxies
with near solar metallicities, at a confidence level of 1-5E-6. The XLF
normalisation for the BCDs is found to be 14.5 +/- 4.8 (M_solar^-1 yr), a

Additionally, we show that it is not possible to extend the bivariate
information decomposition into $\widetilde{SI}$, $\widetilde{UI}$ and
$\widetilde{CI}$ to a non-negative decomposition on the partial information
lattice of Williams and Beer. Nevertheless, the quantities $\widetilde{UI}$,
$\widetilde{SI}$ and $\widetilde{CI}$ have a well-defined interpretation, even
in the multivariate setting.

  Method for Elliptic Obstacle Problem","21 pages; 6 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A residual based {\em a posteriori} error estimator is derived for a
quadratic finite element method (fem) for the elliptic obstacle problem. The
error estimator involves various residuals consisting the data of the problem,
discrete solution and a Lagrange multiplier related to the obstacle constraint.
{\em A priori} error estimates for the Lagrange multiplier have been derived
and further under an assumption that the contact set does not degenerate to a
curve in any part of the domain, optimal order {\em a priori} error estimates
have been derived whenever the data and the solution are sufficiently regular,
precisely, under the sufficient conditions required for quadratic fem in the
case of linear elliptic problem. The numerical experiments of adaptive fem for
a model problem satisfying the above condition on contact set show optimal
order convergence. This demonstrates that the quadratic fem for obstacle
problem can exhibit optimal performance.

in electronic energy transfer dynamics. One of the simplest approaches to
incorporate such fluctuations in energy transfer dynamics is the well known
Haken-Strobl-Reineker model, in which the energy-gap fluctuation is
approximated as a white noise. Recently, several groups have employed molecular
dynamics simulations and excited-state calculations in conjunction to take the
thermal fluctuation of excitation energies into account. Here, we discuss a
rigorous connection between the stochastic and the atomistic bath models. If
the phonon bath is treated classically, time evolution of the exciton-phonon
system can be described by Ehrenfest dynamics. To establish the relationship
between the stochastic and atomistic bath models, we employ a projection
operator technique to derive the generalized Langevin equations for the
energy-gap fluctuations. The stochastic bath model can be obtained as an
approximation of the atomistic Ehrenfest equations via the generalized Langevin
approach. Based on the connection, we propose a novel scheme to correct
reorganization effects within the framework of stochastic models. The proposed
scheme provides a better description of the population dynamics especially in
the regime of strong exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we discuss the effect of
the bath reorganization in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of ideal
J-aggregates in terms of the Stokes shifts. For this purpose, we introduce a
simple relationship that relates the reorganization contribution to the Stokes
shifts - the reorganization shift - to three parameters: the monomer
reorganization energy, the relaxation time of the optical gap, and the exciton
delocalization length. This simple relationship allows one to classify the
origin of the Stokes shifts in molecular aggregates.

  Quantitative Methods","Journal of Applied Quantitative Methods 9 (2014) 1-21",,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental and empirical data are often analyzed on log-log plots in order
to find some scaling argument for the observed/examined phenomenon at hands, in
particular for rank-size rule research, but also in critical phenomena in
thermodynamics, and in fractal geometry. The fit to a straight line on such
plots is not always satisfactory. Deviations occur at low, intermediate and
high regimes along the log($x$)-axis. Several improvements of the mere power
law fit are discussed, in particular through a Mandelbrot trick at low rank and
a Lavalette power law cut-off at high rank. In so doing, the number of free
parameters increases. Their meaning is discussed, up to the 5 parameter free
super-generalized Lavalette law and the 7-parameter free hyper-generalized
Lavalette law. It is emphasized that the interest of the basic 2-parameter free
Lavalette law and the subsequent generalizations resides in its ""noid"" (or
sigmoid, depending on the sign of the exponents) form on a semi-log plot;
something incapable to be found in other empirical law, like the
Zipf-Pareto-Mandelbrot law. It remained for completeness to invent a simple law
showing an inflection point on a \underline{log-log plot}. Such a law can
result from a transformation of the Lavalette law through $x$ $\rightarrow$
log($x$), but this meaning is theoretically unclear. However, a simple linear
combination of two basic Lavalette law is shown to provide the requested
feature. Generalizations taking into account two super-generalized or
hyper-generalized Lavalette laws are suggested, but need to be fully considered
at fit time on appropriate data.

approach used to establish the results for degree 6 and 7 has been extended
successfully to degree 8 and 9. Candidate graphs are defined as functions of
the diameter for both degree 8 and degree 9. They are proven to be extremal for
small diameters. They establish new lower bounds for all greater diameters, and
are conjectured to be extremal. The existence of the degree 8 solution is
proved for all diameters. Finally some conjectures are made about solutions for
circulant graphs of higher degree.

the standard cosmological model. The theory has previously been shown to lead
to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relationship [1], to agree with the observed
rotation curve of the Galaxy [2], to readily produce the observed features in
the rotational curves of other spiral galaxies [3], and to agree with
observations of the Coma cluster [4]. All without the need for any free
parameters. The theory of an induced energy polarized vacuum is now applied to
superclusters. From a model of the distribution of superclusters, the overall
density parameter of universe as given by the theory of an induced energy
polarized vacuum is Omega = 0.94 plus/minus 0.23. This is consistent with a
geometrically flat universe. In addition, by treating the superclusters as
unbound systems, the theory leads to an accelerating expansion of the universe
in line with observations and without requiring the need for dark energy.
