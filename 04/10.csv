sub-modular MRF in the context of object segmentation. Our model is obtained by
linearizing an $l_1^+$-norm derived from the quadratic programming (QP) form of
the MRF energy. The resultant LP model contains significantly fewer variables
and constraints compared to the conventional LP relaxation of the MRF energy.
In addition, unlike QP which can produce ambiguous labels, our model can be
viewed as a quasi-total-variation minimization problem, and it can therefore
preserve the discontinuities in the labels. We further establish a relaxation
bound between our LP model and the conventional LP model. In the experiments,
we demonstrate our method for the task of interactive object segmentation. Our
LP model outperforms QP when converting the continuous labels to binary labels
using different threshold values on the entire Oxford interactive segmentation
dataset. The computational complexity of our LP is of the same order as that of
the QP, and it is significantly lower than the conventional LP relaxation.

basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal) can be understood as
originating from a tribimaximal dominant structure with small deviations, as
demanded by data. If neutrino masses originate from at least two different
mechanisms, referred to as ""hybrid neutrino masses"", the experimentally
observed structure naturally emerges provided one mechanism accounts for the
dominant tribimaximal structure while the other is responsible for the
deviations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this picture in a fairly
model-independent way by using lepton-number-violating effective operators,
whose structure we assume becomes dictated by an underlying $A_4$ flavor
symmetry. We show that if a second mechanism is at work, the requirement of
generating a reactor angle within its experimental range always fixes the solar
and atmospheric angles in agreement with data, in contrast to the case where
the deviations are induced by next-to-leading order effective operators. We
prove this idea is viable by constructing an $A_4$-based ultraviolet
completion, where the dominant tribimaximal structure arises from the type-I
seesaw while the subleading contribution is determined by either type-II or
type-III seesaw driven by a non-trivial $A_4$ singlet (minimal hybrid model).
After finding general criteria, we identify all the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries
capable of producing such $A_4$-based minimal hybrid models.

elasto-hydrodynamic penetration length. We finally discuss the possible

effective, but by confining the transmit and receive signals to a subset of the

expending a cost that may nullify the net benefit of operating in full-duplex

time-division (i.e. half-duplex) depends heavily on the geometric distribution

scattering and other methods. We also study the radiation field and differences
in grain emissivity between diffuse and dense areas. We have used scattered J,
H, and K band surface brightness WFCAM-observations to map filament TMC-1N in
Taurus, covering an area of 1dx1d corresponding to ~(2.44 pc)^2. We have
converted the data into optical depth and compared the results with NIR
extinction and Herschel observations of submm dust emission. We see the
filament in scattered light in all three NIR bands. We note that our WFCAM
observations in TMC-1N show notably lower intensity than previous results in
Corona Australis using the same method. We show that 3D radiative transfer
simulations predict similar scattered surface brightness levels as seen in the
observations. However, changing the assumptions about the background can change
the results of simulations notably. We derive emissivity by using optical depth
in the J band as an independent tracer of column density. We obtain opacity
sigma(250um) values 1.7-2.4x10^-25 cm^2/H, depending on assumptions of the
extinction curve, which can change the results by over 40%. These values are
twice as high as obtained for diffuse areas, at the lower limit of earlier
results for denser areas. We show that NIR scattering can be a valuable tool in
making high resolution maps. We conclude, however, that NIR scattering
observations can be complicated, as the data can show relatively low-level
artefacts. This suggests caution when planning and interpreting the
observations.

Minkowski background metric. It can be regarded as the noncommutative analogue
of a static circular string. Perturbations about the solution yield a tachyonic
scalar field (and an additional tachyonic fermion in the full supersymmetric
version of the model) in the commutative limit. The tachyonic mode is
attributed to the fact that the circular string is unstable under uniform
adiabatic deformations. We obtain a stabilizing term which when added to the
matrix model removes the tachyonic mass.

eccentricities than Solar System planets and has a much higher average
eccentricity. These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the
Solar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary
systems. We report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricity
with multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued radial
velocity (RV) systems. The mean, median and rough distribution of
eccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this
anti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely despite the fact
that no more than 2 Solar System planets would be detectable with RV data
comparable to that in the exoplanet sample. Moreover, even if regarded as a
single or double planetary system, the Solar System lies in a reasonably
heavily populated region of eccentricity-multiplicity space. Thus, the Solar
System is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to
eccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as
the multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as a
power law of index -1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependent
interpretation of this relationship implies that approximately 80% of the one
planet and 25% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet
undiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity are
largely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscovered
planets). If low eccentricities indeed favor high multiplicities, habitability
may be more common in systems with a larger number of planets.

is that the dust is being charged by the solar wind, then being affected by the
interplanetary magnetic field via the Lorentz force. Though this effect has
been explored previously, if correct, this seems to be the first time that the
Lorentz force has been required to model a cometary dust tail. The analysis
also suggests that Hale-Bopp was actively emitting particles when these images
were taken, and the tail characteristics changed between observations.

motivated the study of particle physics models that can provide weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the mass range 1-50 GeV. Viable
candidates for light WIMP DM must fulfil stringent constraints. On the one
hand, the observation at the LHC of a Higgs boson with Standard Model
properties set an upper bound on the coupling of light DM particles to the
Higgs, thereby making it difficult to reproduce the correct relic abundance. On
the other hand, the recent results from direct searches in the CDMSlite,
SuperCDMS and LUX experiments have set upper constraints on the DM scattering
cross section. In this paper, we investigate the viability of light
right-handed sneutrino DM in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM)
in the light of these constraints. To this aim, we have carried out a scan in
the NMSSM parameter space, imposing experimental bounds on the Higgs sector and
low-energy observables, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment and
branching ratios of rare decays. We demonstrate that the enlarged Higgs sector
of the NMSSM, together with the flexibility provided by the RH sneutrino
parameters, make it possible to obtain viable RH sneutrino DM with a mass as
light as 2 GeV. We have also considered the upper bounds on the annihilation
cross section from Fermi LAT data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and extracted
specific examples with mass in the range 8-50 GeV that could account for the
apparent low-energy excess in the gamma-ray emission at the Galactic Centre.
Then, we have computed the theoretical predictions for the elastic scattering
cross-section of RH sneutrinos. Finally, after imposing the recent bounds from
SuperCDMS and LUX, we have found a wide area of the parameter space that could
be probed by future low-threshold direct detection experiments.

astrophysics. In nearby galaxies the far-infrared-radio correlation indicates
the coupling between magnetic fields and star formation. The correlation arises
from the synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons traveling through the
interstellar magnetic fields. However, with an increase of the interstellar
radiation field (ISRF), inverse Compton scattering becomes the dominant energy
loss mechanism of cosmic ray electrons with a typical emission frequency in the
X-ray regime. The ISRF depends on the one hand on the star formation rate and
becomes stronger in starburst galaxies, and on the other hand increases with
redshift due to the evolution of the cosmic microwave background. With a model
for the star formation rate of galaxies, the ISRF, and the cosmic ray spectrum,
we can calculate the expected X-ray luminosity resulting from the inverse
Compton emission. Except for galaxies with an active galactic nucleus the main
additional contribution to the X-ray luminosity comes from X-ray binaries. We
estimate this contribution with an analytical model as well as with an
observational relation, and compare it to the pure inverse Compton luminosity.
Using data from the Chandra Deep Field Survey and far-infrared observations
from ALMA we then determine upper limits for the cosmic ray energy. Assuming
that the magnetic energy in a galaxy is in equipartition with the energy
density of the cosmic rays, we obtain upper limits for the magnetic field
strength. Our results suggest that the mean magnetic energy of young galaxies
is similar to the one in local galaxies. This points toward an early generation
of galactic magnetic fields, which is in agreement with current dynamo
evolution models.

the ever increasing sophistication and depth of new research. Even so,
conventional accelerator techniques often cannot keep pace with new demands

mode-locked x-ray pulse trains, light with orbital angular momentum, and
attosecond or even zeptosecond long coherent pulses in free-electron lasers.
Several methods to generate femtosecond pulses in storage rings are also
discussed. Additionally, we describe various schemes designed to enhance the
performance of light sources through precision beam preparation including beam
conditioning, laser heating, emittance exchange, and various laser-based
diagnostics. Together these techniques represent a new emerging concept of

mitigation of foreground contaminants that are typically several orders of
magnitude brighter than the cosmological signal. Recent simulations and
observations have shown that the smooth spectral structure of foregrounds
combines with instrument chromaticity to contaminate a ""wedge""-shaped region in
cylindrical Fourier space. While previous efforts have explored the suppression
of foregrounds within this wedge, as well as the avoidance of this highly
contaminated region, all such efforts have neglected a rigorous examination of
the error statistics associated with the wedge. Using a quadratic estimator
formalism applied to the interferometric measurement equation, we provide a
framework for such a rigorous analysis (incorporating a fully covariant
treatment of errors). Additionally, we find that there are strong error
correlations at high spatial wavenumbers that have so far been neglected in
sensitivity derivations. These error correlations substantially degrade the
sensitivity of arrays relying on contributions from long baselines, compared to
what one would estimate assuming uncorrelated errors.

not been any spectroscopic measurements to demonstrate the one-dimensional (1D)

experimental indications of possible topological boundary states at their

show that a subset of the predicted Bi-bilayers' edge states are decoupled from

incompleteness explains why the $h$-index ultimately has more utility in
certain scientific subfields than others. In this paper, we expose the origin
of this incompleteness and then also propose a method of completing the
definition of $h$ in a way which remains close to its original guiding
principle. As a result, this ""completed"" $h$ not only reduces to the usual $h$
in cases where the $h$-index already achieves its objectives, but also extends

We identify a subtle issue associated with which contribution in the density

with the ones obtained at the background level. For the background tests we
have used type Ia supernovae data (Union 2.1 compilation) in combination with
baryonic acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background observations and
also measurements of the Hubble parameter at different redshifts. As a
consequence of the studies we have performed at both the background and

done just that! We construct an explicit, simple, example of such a system with
just two degrees of freedom, of which one achieves `spontaneous
classicalization'. It starts from a quantum state and under the usual
Hamiltonian evolution, becomes more and more classical (in a well-defined
manner in terms of the Wigner function) as time progresses. This is achieved
without the usual procedures of integrating out a large number of environmental
degrees of freedom or conventional decoherence. We consider different ranges of
parameter space and identify the conditions under which spontaneous
classicalization occurs in our model. The mutual interaction between the
sub-systems of a larger system can indeed drive some of the subsystems to a
classical configuration, with a phase space trajectory of evolution. We also
argue that the results of our toy model may well be general characteristics of
certain class of interacting systems. Several implications are discussed.

large fraction of main sequence stars. Given the short lifetime of the observed
small dust grains, these 'exozodis' are difficult to explain, especially for
old (>100 Myr) stars. The exozodiacal dust may be observed as excess emission
in the mid-infrared, or using interferometry. We hypothesise that exozodi are
sustained by planetesimals scattered by planets inwards from an outer
planetesimal belt, where collision timescales are long. In this work, we use
N-body simulations to show that the outwards migration of a planet into a belt,
driven by the scattering of planetesimals, can increase, or sustain, the rate
at which planetesimals are scattered from the outer belt to the exozodi region.
We hypothesise that this increase is sufficient to sustain the observed exozodi
on Gyr timescales. No correlation between observations of an outer belt and an
exozodi is required for this scenario to work, as the outer belt may be too
faint to detect. If planetesimal driven migration does explain the observed
exozodi, this work suggests that the presence of an exozodi indicates the
presence of outer planets and a planetesimal belt.

allows one to predict the AGN (optical or X-ray) luminosity as a function of
the AGN X-ray variability and either the HBeta or the PaBeta line widths. In
the best case, when the PaBeta is used, the relationship has an intrinsic
dispersion of ~0.6 dex. Although intrinsically more disperse than Supernovae
Ia, this relation constitutes an alternative distance indicator potentially
able to probe, in an independent way, the expansion history of the Universe.

to measure the X-ray variability of hundreds of AGN and then constrain the
distance modulus with uncertainties of 0.1 mag up to z~0.6. We also discuss
how, using a new dedicated wide field X-ray telescope able to measure the

feedback requires 1) a combination of local early momentum feedback via
radiation pressure and stellar winds and subsequent efficient supernovae
feedback, and 2) efficacy of feedback that results in self-regulation of the
global star formation rate on kiloparsec scales. We show that such
feedback-driven self-regulation is achieved globally for a local star formation
efficiency per free fall time of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 10\%$. Although this
value is larger that the $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim 1\%$ value usually inferred
from the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, we show that it is consistent with
direct observational estimates of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ in molecular clouds.
Moreover, we show that simulations with local efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm

also reproduce the cosmic star formation history of the Milky Way sized
galaxies and satisfy a number of other observational constraints. Conversely,
we find that simulations that a priori assume an inefficient mode of star
formation, instead of achieving it via stellar feedback regulation, fail to
produce sufficiently vigorous outflows and do not reproduce observations. This
illustrates the importance of understanding the complex interplay between star
formation and feedback and the detailed processes that contribute to the

In 25 stars, the elements can be explained by radiative levitation alone,
although we argue that accretion has very likely occurred recently. The
remaining 23 white dwarfs (27%) must be currently accreting. Together with
previous studies, we find no accretion rate trend in cooling age from ~40 Myr
to ~2 Gyr. The median, main sequence progenitor of our sample corresponds to a
star of ~2 Msun, and we find 13 of 23 white dwarfs descending from 2-3 Msun
late B- and A-type stars to be currently accreting. Only one of 14 targets with
Mwd > 0.8 Msun is found to be currently accreting, which suggests a large
fraction are double-degenerate mergers, and the merger discs do not commonly
reform large planetesimals or otherwise pollute the remnant. We reconfirm our
previous finding that two white dwarf Hyads are currently accreting rocky
debris.
  At least 27%, and possibly up to ~50%, of all white dwarfs with cooling ages
20-200 Myr are accreting planetary debris. At Teff > 23000K, the luminosity of
white dwarfs is likely sufficient to vaporize circumstellar dust, and hence no
stars with strong metal-pollution are found. However, planetesimal disruption
events should occur in this cooling age and Teff range as well, and likely
result in short phases of high mass transfer rates. It appears that the
formation of rocky planetary material is common around 2-3 Msun late B- and
A-type stars.

Pseudomagnetic fields are thus explained by means of position-dependent Dirac

depletion when the molecules of a pulsed beam interact with a static electric
or magnetic field and an oscillating field (RF). In these cases, and as a main
difference, instead of using four fields as in the original technique developed
by I.I. Rabi and others, only two fields, those which configure the resonant
unit, are used. That is, without using the nonhomogeneous magnetic fields.
  The depletion explanation for I.I. Rabi and others is based in the
interaction between the molecular electric or magnetic dipole moment and the
non-homogeneous fields. But, obviously, the change in the molecules
trajectories observed on these new experiments has to be explained without
considering the force provided by the field gradient because it happens without
using non-homogeneous fields.

results is presented. One important point emerges as a result of this

both stars are detected as X-ray sources. The X-ray spectra of both stars

slight outward elongation of the source structure of RW Aur A along the

impact both security (e.g. application failure, legal issues) and accounting

field topology of CU Vir. In this study we aim to derive, for the first time,
detailed maps of the magnetic field distribution over the surface of this star.
We use high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations covering the entire
rotational period. These data are interpreted using a multi-line technique of
least-squares deconvolution (LSD) and a new Zeeman Doppler imaging code based
on detailed polarised radiative transfer modelling of the Stokes I and V LSD
profiles. This new magnetic inversion approach relies on the spectrum synthesis
calculations over the full wavelength range covered by observations and does
not assume that the LSD profiles behave as a single spectral line with mean
parameters. We present magnetic and chemical abundance maps derived from the Si
and Fe lines. Mean polarisation profiles of both elements reveal a significant
departure of the magnetic field topology of CU Vir from the commonly assumed
axisymmetric dipolar configuration. The field of CU Vir is dipolar-like, but
clearly non-axisymmetric, showing a large difference of the field strength
between the regions of opposite polarity. The main relative abundance depletion
features in both Si and Fe maps coincide with the weak-field region in the
magnetic map. Detailed information on the distorted dipolar magnetic field
topology of CU Vir provided by our study is essential for understanding

investigated systematically in three-dimensional simulations. In order to
obtain the critical conditions for explosion as a function of mass accretion
rate, neutrino luminosity, and specific angular momentum, rigidly rotating
matter was injected from the outer boundary with an angular momentum, which is
increased every 500 ms. It is found that there is a critical value of the
specific angular momentum, above which the standing shock wave revives, for a
given combination of mass accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e. an
explosion can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is lower than
the critical value for a given mass accretion rate in non-rotational models.
The coupling of rotation and hydrodynamical instabilities plays an important
role to characterize the dynamics of shock revival for the range of specific
angular momentum that are supposed to be realistic. Contrary to expectations
from past studies, the most rapidly expanding direction of the shock wave is
not aligned with the rotation axis. Being perpendicular to the rotation axis on
average, it can be oriented in various directions. Its dispersion is small when
the spiral mode of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) governs the
dynamics, while it is large when neutrino-driven convection is dominant. As a
result of the comparison between 2D and 3D rotational models, it is found that
m=!0 modes of neutrino-driven convection or SASI are important for shock
revival around the critical surface.

Release 9 quasar spectra. With 435 doublets identified in the catalog, this
list is the largest CaII catalog compiled to date, spanning redshifts z < 1.34,
which corresponds to the most recent ~ 8.9 Gyrs of the history of the Universe.
We derive statistics on the CaII rest equivalent width distribution (REW) and
incidence (number density per unit redshift). We find that the lambda3934 REW
distribution cannot be described by a single exponential function. A double
exponential function is required to produce a satisfactory description. The
function can be written as a sum of weak and strong components: dn/dW =
(N_wk*/W_wk*) exp(-W/W_wk*) + (N_str*/W_str*) exp(-W/W_str*). A maximum
likelihood fit to the unbinned data indicates: N_wk*=0.140 +/- 0.029,
W_wk*=0.165 +/- 0.020 A, N_str*=0.024 +/- 0.020, and W_str*=0.427 +/- 0.101 A.
This suggests that the CaII absorbers are composed of at least two distinct
populations. The incidence (product of integrated absorber cross section and
their co-moving number density) of the overall CaII absorber population does
not show evidence for evolution in the standard cosmology. The normalization of
the no-evolution curve, i.e., the value of the CaII incidence extrapolated to
redshift z=0, for lambda 3934 >= 0.3 A, is n_0=0.017 +/- 0.001. In comparison
to MgII surveys, we found that only 3% of MgII systems in the SDSS have CaII,
confirming that it is rare to identify CaII in quasar absorption-line surveys.
We also report on some preliminary investigations of the nature of the two
populations of CaII absorbers, and show that they can likely be distinguished
using their MgII properties.

  2014",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small cells have been proposed as a vehicle for wireless networks to keep up
with surging demand. Small cells come with a significant challenge of providing
backhaul to transport data to(from) a gateway node in the core network. Fiber
based backhaul offers the high rates needed to meet this requirement, but is
costly and time-consuming to deploy, when not readily available. Wireless
backhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less
expensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber. However, there are multitude
of bands and features (e.g. LOS/NLOS, spatial multiplexing etc.) associated
with wireless backhaul that need to be used intelligently for small cells.
Candidate bands include: sub-6 GHz band that is useful in non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) scenarios, microwave band (6-42 GHz) that is useful in point-to-point
line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, and millimeter wave bands (e.g. 60, 70 and 80
GHz) that are recently being commercially used in LOS scenarios. In many
deployment topologies, it is advantageous to use aggregator nodes, located at
the roof tops of tall buildings near small cells. These nodes can provide high
data rate to multiple small cells in NLOS paths, sustain the same data rate to
gateway nodes using LOS paths and take advantage of all available bands. This
work performs the joint cost optimal aggregator node placement, power
allocation, channel scheduling and routing to optimize the wireless backhaul
network. We formulate mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) to capture the
different interference and multiplexing patterns at sub-6 GHz and microwave
band. We solve the MINLP through linear relaxation and branch-and-bound
algorithm and apply our algorithm in an example wireless backhaul network of
downtown Manhattan.

star-suggest the existence of an angular-momentum reservoir confined to the
inner crust of the neutron star. Large and regular glitches observed in the
Vela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of
inertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal
entrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order
to account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia
residing in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the
required angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the
crust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state
provide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large
crustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given
that analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive
to the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters
of the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an
excellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to
obtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with
masses below 1.6 solar masses. In particular, we find that if the neutron-skin
thickness of 208Pb falls within the (0.20-0.26) fm range, large enough
transition pressures can be generated to explain the large Vela glitches
without invoking an additional angular-momentum reservoir beyond that confined
to the solid crust. Our results suggest that the crust may be enough.

wall {brane model}. Because such structure usually leads to quasilocalized
modes of various kinds of bulk fields. In this paper, we construct a domain
wall brane model by using a scalar field $\phi$, which couples to its kinetic
term. The inner brane structure emerges as the scalar-kinetic coupling
increases. With such brane structure, we show that it is possible to obtain
gravity resonant modes in both tensor and scalar sectors. The number of the
resonant modes depends on the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and the form
of scalar-kinetic coupling. The correspondence between our model and the
canonical one is also discussed. The noncanonical and canonical background
scalar fields are connected by an integral equation, while the warp factor
remains the same. Via this correspondence, the canonical and noncanonical
models share the same linear perturbation spectrum. So the gravity resonances
{obtained} in the noncanonical frame can also be obtained in the standard
model. However, due to the inequivalence between the corresponding background
scalar solutions, the localization condition for the left-chiral fermion zero
mode can be largely different in different frames. Our estimate shows that the
magnitude of the Yukawa coupling in the noncanonical frame might be hundreds
times larger than the one in the canonical frame, if one demands the
localization of the left-chiral fermion zero mode as well as the appearance of

  Model and Other Time-Evolving Networks",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the spreading speed of complex contagions in a social
network. A $k$-complex contagion starts from a set of initially infected seeds
such that any node with at least $k$ infected neighbors gets infected. Simple
contagions, i.e., $k=1$, quickly spread to the entire network in small world
graphs. However, fast spreading of complex contagions appears to be less likely
and more delicate; the successful cases depend crucially on the network
structure~\cite{G08,Ghasemiesfeh:2013:CCW}.
  Our main result shows that complex contagions can spread fast in a general
family of time-evolving networks that includes the preferential attachment
model~\cite{barabasi99emergence}. We prove that if the initial seeds are chosen
as the oldest nodes in a network of this family, a $k$-complex contagion covers
the entire network of $n$ nodes in $O(\log n)$ steps. We show that the choice
of the initial seeds is crucial. If the initial seeds are uniformly randomly
chosen in the PA model, even with a polynomial number of them, a complex
contagion would stop prematurely. The oldest nodes in a preferential attachment
model are likely to have high degrees. However, we remark that it is actually
not the power law degree distribution per se that facilitates fast spreading of
complex contagions, but rather the evolutionary graph structure of such models.
Some members of the said family do not even have a power-law distribution.
  We also prove that complex contagions are fast in the copy
model~\cite{KumarRaRa00}, a variant of the preferential attachment family.
  Finally, we prove that when a complex contagion starts from an arbitrary set
of initial seeds on a general graph, determining if the number of infected
vertices is above a given threshold is $\mathbf{P}$-complete. Thus, one cannot
hope to categorize all the settings in which complex contagions percolate in a
graph.

time between faults on each node of a high performance computer we provide
bounds on the expected error for interpolation with this algorithm. Numerical
experiments on the scalar advection PDE demonstrate that the algorithm is
resilient to faults on a real application. It is observed that the trade-off of

violated by all mixed states with the above steering property. The new class of

observed at the leaves is a problem arising in evolutionary biology. The
simplest technique -- majority rule -- estimates the root state by the most
frequently occurring state at the leaves. Alternative methods -- such as
maximum parsimony - explicitly take the tree structure into account. Since
either method can outperform the other on particular trees, it is useful to
consider the accuracy of the methods on trees generated under some evolutionary
null model, such as a Yule pure-birth model. In this short note, we answer a
recently posed question concerning the performance of majority rule on Yule
trees under a symmetric 2-state Markovian substitution model of character state
change. We show that majority rule is accurate precisely when the ratio of the
birth (speciation) rate of the Yule process to the substitution rate exceeds
the value $4$. By contrast, maximum parsimony has been shown to be accurate
only when this ratio is at least 6. Our proof relies on a second moment
calculation, coupling, and a novel application of a reflection principle.

glass transition phenomenon becomes a thermodynamic transition at a temperature
$T_{K}$. However, with any finite cooling rate, the system falls out of
equilibrium at temperatures near $T_g(>T_{K})$, implying that the very
existence of the putative thermodynamic phase transition at $T_{K}$ can be
questioned. Recent studies of systems with randomly pinned particles have
hinted that the thermodynamic glass transition may be observed in simulations
and experiments carried out for liquids with randomly pinned particles. This
expectation is based on the results of approximate calculations that suggest
that the temperature of the thermodynamic glass transition increases as the
concentration of pinned particles is increased and it may be possible to
equilibrate the system at temperatures near the increased transition
temperature. We test the validity of this prediction through extensive
molecular dynamics simulations of two model glass-forming liquids in the
presence of random pinning. We fit the temperature-dependence of the structural
relaxation time to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann form that predicts a divergence of
the relaxation time at a temperature $T_{VFT}$ and identify this temperature
with the thermodynamic transition temperature $T_K$. We find that $T_{VFT}$
does not show any sign of increasing with increasing concentration of pinned
particles. The main effect of pinning is found to be a rapid decrease in the
kinetic fragility of the system with increasing pin concentration. Implications
of these observations for current theories of the glass transition are
discussed.

its complete asymptotic expansion. Here Stirling's approximation for the
logarithm of the gamma function or $\ln \Gamma(z)$ is derived completely
whereby it is composed of the standard leading terms and an asymptotic series
that is generally truncated. Nevertheless, to obtain values of $\ln \Gamma(z)$,
the remainder must undergo regularization. Two regularization techniques are
then applied: Borel summation and Mellin-Barnes (MB) regularization. The
Borel-summed remainder possesses an infinite convergent sum of exponential
integrals and discontinuous logarithmic terms across Stokes sectors and lines,
while the MB-regularized remainders possess one MB integral, which is better to
compute, and similar logarithmic terms. The MB integrals are valid over
overlapping domains of convergence. Hence, two MB-regularized asymptotic forms
can be used to evaluate $\ln \Gamma(z)$. Despite having to truncate the
Borel-summed remainder, it is found that all the remainders combined with (1)
the truncated asymptotic series, (2) the leading terms of Stirling's
approximation and (3) their logarithmic terms yield identical values of $\ln
\Gamma(z)$. In the few cases where the accuracy falls away, it is mostly due to
a very high value for the truncation parameter, which results in the
cancellation of redundant decimal places. Where possible, all the asymptotic
forms yield the same values as the LogGamma routine in Mathematica.

We provide a fundamental theory, based on the mean-field formalism, to show
that the induced pseudospin precession resonates with the Higgs amplitude mode
of the superconductor at $2\Omega=2\Delta$ with $2\Delta$ being the
superconducting gap. The resonant precession is accompanied by a divergent
enhancement of the third-harmonic generation (THG). By decomposing the THG
susceptibility into the bare one and vertex correction, we find that the
enhancement of the THG cannot be explained by individual quasiparticle
excitations (pair breaking), so that the THG serves as a smoking gun for an
identification of the collective Higgs mode. We further explore the effect of
electron-electron scattering on the pseudospin resonance by applying the
nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the attractive Hubbard model
driven by ac electric fields. The result indicates that the pseudospin
resonance is robust against electron correlations, although the resonance width
is broadened due to electron scattering, which determines the lifetime of the
Higgs mode.

The rate and efficiency of this process are affected substantially by the

most fundamental measure of this structure is the probability density function
of volume densities (rho-PDF), which determines the star formation rates
predicted with analytical models. This function has remained unconstrained by
observations. We have developed an approach to quantify rho-PDFs and establish
their relation to star formation. The rho-PDFs instigate a density threshold of
star formation and allow us to quantify the star formation efficiency above it.
The rho-PDFs provide new constraints for star formation theories and correctly
predict several key properties of the star-forming interstellar medium.

congestion. We prove the maximum stability property for this class of
randomized policies. Thus these policies have the same first order behavior as
the MaxWeight policies. However, for multihop networks some of these
generalized polices address a number of critical weakness of the
MaxWeight/BackPressure policies.
  For multihop networks with fixed routing, we consider the Proportional
Scheduler (or (1,log)-policy). In this setting, the BackPressure policy is
maximum stable, but must maintain a queue for every route-destination, which
typically grows rapidly with a network's size. However, this proportionally
fair policy only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is
typically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining
per-link queueing each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and
not its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional
Scheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights, only
local link information is required. This leads to greater potential for
decomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an
entropy argument, we demonstrate that, whilst maintaining substantially less
queueing overhead, the Proportional Scheduler achieves maximum throughput
stability.

galaxies from optical data and compare the results with X-ray derived masses.
The optical method relies only on the most basic observables such as the
surface brightness $I(R)$ and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion
$\sigma_p(R)$ profiles and provides an anisotropy-independent estimate of the
galaxy circular speed $V_c$. The mass-anisotropy degeneracy is effectively
overcome by evaluating $V_c$ at a characteristic radius $R_{\rm sweet}$ defined
from {\it local} properties of observed profiles. The sweet radius $R_{\rm
sweet}$ is expected to lie close to $R_2$, where $I(R) \propto R^{-2}$, and not
far from the effective radius $R_{\rm eff}$. We apply the method to a sample of
five X-ray bright elliptical galaxies observed with the 6-m telescope BTA-6 in
Russia. We then compare the optical $V_c$-estimate with the X-ray derived
value, and discuss possible constraints on the non-thermal pressure in the hot
gas and configuration of stellar orbits. We find that the average ratio of the
optical $V_c$-estimate to the X-ray one is equal to $\approx 0.98$ with $11 \%$
scatter, i.e. there is no evidence for the large non-thermal pressure
contribution in the gas at $\sim R_{\rm sweet}$. From analysis of the Lick
indices H$\beta$, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335, we calculate the mass of the stellar
component within the sweet radius. We conclude that a typical dark matter
fraction inside $R_{\rm sweet}$ in the sample galaxies is $\sim 60\%$ for the

magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequence
objects (1 Myr < t < 10 Gyr). For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that
the unsigned average large-scale surface field <|Bv|> is related to age as
$t^{-0.655 \pm 0.045}$. This relation has a similar dependence to that
identified by Skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. Likewise,
our relation could be used as an age-dating method (""magnetochronology""). The
trends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism are
consistent with the trends found from Zeeman broadening measurements (sensitive
to large- and small-scale fields). These similarities indicate that the fields
recovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting that
small- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generation
processes. For the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relations
are found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux and
rotation period. We attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction,
rather than being driven by the dynamo.

for driving interactive menus, small applications and interactive games. Here,
we also calculate the orientation of the hand which can be used to provide
inputs for the direction and/or speed control of a robot, controlling mouse
cursor or slide-show presentations. If being used by a single person, with his

comes from an infrared enhanced contribution due to thermal bath photons. For
distributions typical of a heavy-ion meson gas, the charged and neutral pion
masses and their difference depend on temperature through slowly increasing

the corrections smooth and compatible with observed pion spectra. We study
phenomenological effects related to the electromagnetic damping leading to
corrections for transport coefficients and neutral-charged mean free times
differences. An important aspect is the connection with chiral symmetry
restoration through the relation of the pion mass difference with the
vector-axial spectral function difference, which holds at $T=0$ due to a sum
rule in the chiral and soft pion limits. We analyze the modifications of that
sum rule including nonzero pion masses and temperature, up to order $T^2$ and
$M_\pi^2$. Both effects produce terms making the pion mass difference grow
against chiral-restoring decreasing contributions. Finally, we analyze the

in presence of a hydration shell of bound water at the interface between the
complex and the solvent. Starting from a low-spin state, the photoexcited
complex can reach the high-spin state via a cascade of different possible
transitions involving electronic as well as vibrational relaxation processes.
By numerically exact path integral calculations for the relaxational dynamics
of a continuous solvent model, we find that the vibrational life times of the
intermittent states are of the order of a few ps. Since the electronic
rearrangement in the complex occurs on the time scale of about 100 fs, we find
that the complex first rearranges itself in a high-spin and highly excited
vibrational state, before it relaxes its energy to the solvent via vibrational
relaxation transitions. By this, the relaxation pathway can be clearly
identified. We find that the life time of the vibrational states increases with
the size of the complex (within a spherical model), but decreases with the
thickness of the hydration shell, indicating that the hydration shell acts as
an additional source of fluctuations.

quantum dot active region too fast to sustain inversion. The tradeoff between
different extraction/injection pathways is discussed. Comparing the modal gain
to a standard quantum-well structure as used in quantum cascade lasers, our

only be achieved for an inhomogeneous broadening of a quantum-dot ensemble that

longitudinal imaging studies, where the manual segmentation of one image can be
used as a prior for automatic segmentation of subsequent images. The model is
demonstrated by application to cone-beam computed tomography (CT), an imaging

angular momentum transport in accretion disks. However, questions remain about
the ability of simulated disks to reproduce observationally inferred
stress-to-gas-pressure ratios. In this paper we present a set of high
resolution global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations which are initialised
with different field configurations: purely toroidal, vertical field lines, and
nested poloidal loops. A mass source term is included which allows the total
disk mass to equilibrate in simulations with long run times, and also enables
the impact of rapid mass injection to be explored. Notably different levels of
angular momentum transport are observed during the early-time transient disk
evolution. However, given sufficient time to relax, the different models evolve
to a statistically similar quasi-steady state with a stress-to-gas-pressure
ratio, $\alpha \sim 0.032-0.036$.
  The indication from our results is that {\it steady, isolated} disks may be
unable to maintain a large-scale magnetic field or produce values for the
stress-to-gas-pressure ratio implied by some observations. Supplementary
simulations exploring the influence of trapping magnetic field, injecting
vertical field, and rapidly injecting additional mass into the disk show that
large stresses ($\alpha \sim 0.1-0.25$) can be induced by these mechanisms. The
simulations highlight the common late-time evolution and characteristics of
turbulent disks for which the magnetic field is allowed to evolve freely. If
the boundaries of the disk, the rate of injection of magnetic field, or the
rate of mass replenishment are modified to mimic astrophysical disks, markedly
different disk evolution occurs.

(~0.01). Here we report on unusual voltage-controlled resistive switching
followed by current-controlled resistive switching induced by self-heating in
polycrystalline BaCo1-xNixS2-y (nominal x=0.1 and y=0.2). These were due to the
steep metal to insulator transition upon heating followed by the activated
behavior of the resistivity above the transition. The major role of Joule
heating in switching is supported by the absence of nonlinearity in the current
as function of voltage, I(V), obtained in pulsed measurements, in the range of
electric fields relevant to d.c. measurements. The voltage-controlled negative
differential resistance around the threshold for switching was explained by a
simple model of self-heating. The main difficulty in modeling I(V) from the
samples resistance as function of temperature R(T) was the progressive increase
of R(T), and to a lesser extend the decrease of the resistance jumps at the
transitions, caused by the damage induced by cycling through the transitions by
heating or self-heating. This was dealt with by following systematically R(T)
over many cycles and by using the data of R(T) in the heating cycle closest to

projection of the thermal pressure of free electrons and lacks any redshift
information. By cross correlating the tSZ effect with an external cosmological
tracer we can recover a good fraction of this lost information. Weak lensing
(WL) is thought to provide an unbiased probe of the dark Universe, with many WL
surveys having sky coverage that overlaps with tSZ surveys. Generalising the
tomographic approach, we advocate the use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (sFB)
expansion to perform an analysis of the cross-correlation between the projected
(2D) tSZ Compton $y$-parameter maps and 3D weak lensing convergence maps. We
use redshift dependent linear biasing and the halo model as a tool to
investigate the tSZ-WL cross-correlations in 3D. We use the Press-Schechter
(PS) and the Sheth-Tormen (ST) mass-functions in our calculations, finding that
the results are quite sensitive to detailed modelling. We provide detailed
analysis of surveys with photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. The
signal-to-noise (S/N) of the cross-spectra $\mathcal{C}_{\ell} (k)$ for
individual 3D modes, defined by the radial and tangential wave numbers
$(k;\ell)$, remains comparable to, but below, unity though optimal binning is
expected to improve this. The results presented can be generalised to analyse
other CMB secondaries, such as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect.

asymptotically AdS spaces to Ricci-flat ones. A remarkable result is that the

confined to this brane. We also calculate the Brown-York stress tensor for the
perturbed AdS metric, which turns out to be the negative of the stress tensor

Such problematics occur when the probability distribution of a physical
quantity is to be measured, but it is randomized (smeared) by some well
understood process, such as a non-ideal detector response or a well described
physical phenomenon. In such case it is said that the original probability
distribution of interest is folded by a known response function. The
reconstruction of the original probability distribution from the measured one
is called unfolding. That technically involves evaluation of the non-bounded
inverse of an integral operator over the space of L^1 functions, which is known
to be an ill-posed problem. For the pertinent regularized operator inversion,
we propose a linear iterative formula and provide proof of convergence in a
probability theory context. Furthermore, we provide formulae for error
estimates at finite iteration stopping order which are of utmost importance in
practical applications: the approximation error, the propagated statistical
error, and the propagated systematic error can be quantified. The arguments are
based on the Riesz-Thorin theorem mapping the original L^1 problem to L^2
space, and subsequent application of ordinary L^2 spectral theory of operators.
A library implementation in C of the algorithm along with corresponding error
propagation is also provided. A numerical example also illustrates the method

However, the physical mechanism of glitch is still a matter of debate because
it depends on the puzzle of pulsar's inner structure, i.e., the equation of
state of dense matter. Some pulsars (e.g., Vela-like) show large glitches
({\Delta}{\nu}/{\nu}~10^-6) but release negligible energy, whereas the large
glitches of AXPs/SGRs (anomalous X-ray pulsars/soft gamma repeaters) are
usually (but not always) accompanied with detectable energy releases
manifesting as X-ray bursts or outbursts. We try to understand this aspect of
glitches in a starquake model of solid quark stars. There are actually two
kinds of glitches in this scenario: bulk-invariable (Type I) and bulk-variable
(Type II) ones. The total stellar volume changes (and then energy releases)
significantly for the latter but not for the former. Therefore, glitches
accompanied with X-ray bursts (e.g., that of AXP/SGRs) could originate from
Type II starquakes induced probably by accretion, while the others without
evident energy release (e.g., that of Vela pulsar) would be the result of Type
I starquakes due to, simply, a change of stellar ellipticity.

the two kinds of augmented bases, we have efficient description of one-particle

have to treat a static non-local exchange-correlation potential, which is
generated from the self-energy. We expand the potential in the highly localized
MTOs. This allows us to make stable interpolation of the self-energy in the
whole Brillouin zone. In addition, we have improved the offset-{\Gamma} method

of the screened Coulomb interaction in the calculation of the self-energy. For
GaAs and cubic SiO2 , we checked convergence of calculated band gaps on cutoff

radiative and mechanical energy input. After their birth, they form bubbles of
hot gas surrounded by a dense shell. Traditionally, the formation of bubbles is
explained through the input of a powerful stellar wind, even though direct
evidence supporting this scenario is lacking. Here we explore the possibility
that interstellar bubbles seen by the Spitzer- and Herschel space telescopes,
blown by stars with log(L/L_sun) < 5.2, form and expand due to the thermal
pressure accompanying ionization of the surrounding gas. We show that density
gradients in the natal cloud or a puncture in the swept up shell lead to an
ionized gas flow through the bubble into the general interstellar medium, which
is traced by a dust wave near the star, demonstrating the importance of
radiation pressure during this phase. Dust waves provide a natural explanation
for the presence of dust inside H II bubbles, offer a novel method to study
dust in H II regions and provide direct evidence that bubbles are relieving
their pressure into the ISM through a champagne flow, acting as a probe of the
radiative interaction of a massive star with its surroundings. We create a
parameter space connecting the ambient density, the ionizing source luminosity,
and the position of the dust wave, while using the well-studied H II bubbles
RCW 120 and RCW 82 as benchmarks of our model. Finally, we briefly examine the
implications of our study for the environments of super star clusters formed in
UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxies (ULIRGs), merging galaxies and the early

radiation pressure is expected to dominate the dynamical evolution.

The resulting power spectra cover multipoles from $\ell \approx 60$ to $\ell

flattening at high multipoles from point sources. We fit the power spectrum
with a model that accounts for these components and instrumental effects. The
resulting power-law indices are found to have a mode of 2.3, similar to
previous results. However, there are significant regional variations in the
index, defying attempts to characterize the emission with a single value. The
power-law index is found to increase away from the Galactic plane. A transition
from small-scale to large-scale structure is evident at $b= 9^{\circ}$,
associated with the disk-halo transition in a 15$^{\circ}$ region around
$l=108^{\circ}$. Localized variations in the index are found toward HII regions
and supernova remnants, but the interpretation of these variations is
inconclusive. The power in the polarized emission is anticorrelated with bright

on the impact of a sequence of random or targeted failures of network nodes or

their usage. We propose a dynamic model of transport based on the

more than an amount $\mu$ (threshold) of the resource and we investigate it on
the square lattice. As we deal with a new model, we provide insight on its
fundamental behavior and dependence on parameters. We observe that for low
values of the threshold due to a positive feedback of link failure, an
avalanche develops that leads to an abrupt collapse of the lattice. By
contrast, for high thresholds the lattice breaks down in an uncorrelated
fashion. We determine the critical threshold $\mu^*$ separating these two
regimes and show how it depends on the toppling threshold of the nodes and the
mass increment added stepwise to the system. We find that the time of major
disconnection is well described with a linear dependence on $\mu$. Furthermore,
we propose a lower bound for $\mu^*$ by measuring the strength of the dynamics

  For fingerprinting, we show that if the pirate strategy is known, the
Neyman-Pearson-based log-likelihood decoders provably achieve capacity,
regardless of the strategy. The decoder built against the interleaving attack
is further shown to be a universal decoder, able to deal with arbitrary attacks
and achieving the uninformed capacity. This universal decoder is shown to be
closely related to the Lagrange-optimized decoder of Oosterwijk et al. and the
empirical mutual information decoder of Moulin. Joint decoders are also
proposed, and we conjecture that these also achieve the corresponding joint
capacities.
  For group testing, the simple decoder for the classical model is shown to be
more efficient than the one of Chan et al. and it provably achieves the simple
group testing capacity. For generalizations of this model such as noisy group
testing, the resulting simple decoders also achieve the corresponding simple

finite interaction times. An irrational ratio of the driving frequencies of the

as quasiperiodic, resulting in observations which may differ by several orders
of magnitude from the expected quasiperiodic behavior. Thus, the system
response depends on the nature of the irrational ratio, as well as the

used data from the IMF GSM-components with time resolution of 16 s. The
mathematical property chosen was the statistical mean of the wavelet
coefficients $(\langle Dd1 \rangle)$. The Daubechies wavelet coefficients have
been used because they represent the local regularity present in the signal

the sheath region is more than that of the MC region. This technique could be
useful to help a specialist to find events boundaries when working with IMF
datasets, i.e., a best form to visualize the data. The wavelet coefficients
have the advantage of helping to find some shocks that are not easy to see in
the IMF data by simple visual inspection. We can learn that fluctuations are
not low in all MCs, in some cases waves can penetrate from the sheath to the
MC. This methodology has not yet been tested to identify some specific
fluctuation patterns at IMF for any other geoeffective interplanetary events,

purpose of the model is to predict the three measured values after the last
measured value of the Kp index (it means the next 9 hours values). The AR model
provides the lowest computational cost with satisfactory results. The ARIMA
model is efficient for predicting Kp index during geomagnetic disturbance
conditions. This paper provides a quick and efficient way to make a prediction
of Kp index, without using satellite data. Although it is reported that the
forecast results are better when satellite data are used. In the literature we
find that the linear correlation between predicted values and actual values is
$77\%$, which is better than the $68.5\%$ obtained in this work. However,
taking into account that our results are based only on Kp stochastic time
series, the correlation value can be considered satisfactory.

often at multiple scales and at regions where analytical representations of the
microscopic features of the flows are often unavailable. Full accounts to these
problems heavily depend on the geometry of the system under consideration and
are computationally expensive. Therefore, a method capable of solving
multiscale features of the flow without confining itself to fine scale
calculations is sought after.
  The approximation of boundary condition on coarse element edges when
computing the multiscale basis functions critically influences the eventual
accuracy of any MsFEM approaches. The weakly enforced continuity of Crouzeix -
Raviart function space across element edges leads to a natural boundary
condition for the multiscale basis functions which relaxes the sensitivity of
our method to complex patterns of obstacles exempt from the needs of
implementing any oversampling techniques. Additionally, the application of
penalization method makes it possible to avoid complex unstructured domain and
allows extensive use of simpler Cartesian meshes.

such technique that has found application in these domains is learning-based
model predictive control (LBMPC). An important novelty of LBMPC lies in the
fact that its robustness and stability properties are independent of the type
of online learning used. This allows the use of advanced statistical or machine
learning methods to provide the adaptation for the controller. This paper is
concerned with providing practical comparisons of different optimization
algorithms for implementing the LBMPC method, for the special case where the
dynamic model of the system is linear and the online learning provides linear
updates to the dynamic model. For comparison purposes, we have implemented a
primal-dual infeasible start interior point method that exploits the sparsity
structure of LBMPC. Our open source implementation (called LBmpcIPM) is
available through a BSD license and is provided freely to enable the rapid
implementation of LBMPC on other platforms. This solver is compared to the
dense active set solvers LSSOL and qpOASES using a quadrotor helicopter
platform. Two scenarios are considered: The first is a simulation comparing
hovering control for the quadrotor, and the second is on-board control
experiments of dynamic quadrotor flight. Though the LBmpcIPM method has better
asymptotic computational complexity than LSSOL and qpOASES, we find that for
certain integrated systems (like our quadrotor testbed) these methods can
outperform LBmpcIPM. This suggests that actual benchmarks should be used when
choosing which algorithm is used to implement LBMPC on practical systems.

colors from the 3D-HST survey are combined with structural parameter
measurements from CANDELS imaging to determine the galaxy size-mass
distribution over the redshift range 0<z<3. Separating early- and late-type
galaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-type
galaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, and
find a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxy
mass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, R_eff ~ (1+z)^-1.48,
and moderate evolution for the late-type population, R_eff ~ (1+z)^-0.75. The
large sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, in
combination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive use
of spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results, but also enable us to
probe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. At all redshifts the
slope of the size-mass relation is shallow, R_eff ~ M_star^0.22, for late-type
galaxies with stellar mass >3x10^9 M_sol, and steep, R_eff M_star^0.75, for
early-type galaxies with stellar mass >2x10^10 M_sol. The intrinsic scatter is
<~0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. For late-type galaxies, the
logarithmic size distribution is not symmetric, but skewed toward small sizes:
at all redshifts and masses a tail of small late-type galaxies exists that
overlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. The number density of
massive (~10^11 M_sol), compact (R_eff < 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increases
from z=3 to z=1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.

on-axis point source and offers a 0.9 or 1.75 lambda/D inner working angle for
topological charge 2 or 4, respectively. Current and near-future large
telescopes are on-axis, however, and the diffraction effects of the central
obscuration, and the secondary supports are strong enough to prevent the
detection of companions 1e-3 - 1e-5 as bright as, or fainter than, their host
star. Recent advances show that a ring apodizer can restore the performance of
this coronagraph by compensating for the diffraction effects of a circular
central obscuration in a 1D modeling of the pupil. We extend this work and
optimize apodizers for arbitrary apertures in 2D in order to tackle the
diffraction effects of the spiders and other noncircular artefacts in the
pupil. We use a numerical optimization scheme to compute hybrid coronagraph
designs that combine the advantages of the vortex coronagraph (small in IWA)
and of shaped pupils coronagraphs (robustness to central obscuration and pupil
asymmetric structures). We maximize the apodizer transmission, while
constraints are set on the extremum values of the electric field that is
computed in chosen regions of the Lyot plane through closed form expressions.
Optimal apodizers are computed for topological charges 2 and 4 vortex
coronagraphs and for telescope apertures with 10-30% central obscurations and
0-1% thick spiders. We characterize the impacts of the obscuration ratio and
the thickness of the spiders on the throughput and the IWA for the two
topological charges.

some stochastic process, of monomers that can be taken from a finite or
countable infinite set of possible monomer types. For the case of uncorrelated
random polymers we found that the diffusion coefficient exhibits a
non-monotonous behavior as a function of the noise intensity. Particularly
interesting is the fact that the relative diffusivity becomes optimal at a
finite temperature, a behavior which is reminiscent to that of stochastic
resonance. We explain this effect as an interplay between the deterministic and
noisy dynamics of the system. We also show that this behavior of the diffusion
coefficient at a finite temperature is more pronounced for the case of weakly
disordered potentials. We test our findings by means of numerical simulations
of the corresponding Langevin dynamics of an ensemble of noninteracting

type of such immersions are determined by their Smale invariant, defined up to
a sign ambiguity. In this paper we fix a sign of the Smale invariant and we
show that for immersions induced by holomorphic gems the sign-refined Smale
invariant is the negative of the number of cross caps appearing in a generic

abscissa and ordinate, in which case the analysis deals with the case of data
pairs with errors in both coordinates, but X can be any measured quantities on
which Y depends. The analysis applies for arbitrary covariance, provided all
errors are gaussian, and provided the errors in X are small, both in comparison
with the scale over which the expected signal Y changes, and with the width of
the prior distribution. This generalises the Fisher Matrix approach, which
normally only considers errors in the `ordinate' Y. In this work, we include
errors in X by marginalising over latent variables, effectively employing a
Bayesian hierarchical model, and deriving the Fisher Matrix for this more
general case. The methods here also extend to likelihood surfaces which are not
gaussian in the parameter space, and so techniques such as DALI (Derivative
Approximation for Likelihoods) can be generalised straightforwardly to include
arbitrary gaussian data error covariances. For simple mock data and theoretical
models, we compare to Markov Chain Monte Carlo experiments, illustrating the

constitutes one of the main areas of research in WH physics. On the other hand,
the current literature shows us that noncommutativity is one of the most
promising candidates to help us to understand the physics of the early
Universe. However, since noncommutativity does not change the commutative
results, we also can expect that energy conditions violation near the throat
must occur. We will show here that the violation of the energy conditions,
described in a noncommutative space-time, has fixed conditions on the angular
momentum of a rotating WH with constant angular velocity. Also, we have
established a new theoretical bound on the NC constant, $\theta$, as a function
of some WH parameters.

Hoyle","A Dynamical Model of the Industrial Economy of the Humber Region",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Humber region in the UK is a large and diverse industrial area centred
around oil refining, chemical industries and energy production. However there
is currently a desire to see the region transition towards a more bio-based
economy. New bio-related industries are being situated in the region as a
consequence of policy and economic incentives. Many of these industries are
connected through their supply chains, either directly, or by sharing common
suppliers or customers and the growth or decline of one industry can hence have
impacts on many others. Therefore an important question to consider is what
effect this movement towards bio-based industry will actually have on the
regional economy as a whole. In this paper we develop a general abstract
dynamical model for the metabolic interactions of firms or industries. This
dynamical model has been applied to the Humber region in order to gain a deeper
understanding of how the region may develop. The model suggests that the
transition to a bio-based economy will occur with oil refining losing its
dominance to bioethanol production and biological chemical production, whilst
anaerobic digestion grows as a major source of electricity, in turn driving up
the value of regional waste aggregators and arable farming in the overall
economy.

Modulation mode AFM is challenging, especially when measuring in liquids. Here,
we derive formulas for the tip-sample conservative and dissipative interactions
and investigate the effect that spurious resonances have on the measured
interaction. Both direct and acoustic excitation are considered. We also
highlight the differences between measuring directly the tip position or the
cantilever deflection. We show that, when probing the tip-sample forces, the
acoustically excited cantilever behavior is insensitive to spurious resonances
as long as the measured signal corresponds to the tip position, or if the
excitation force is correctly taken into account. Since the effective
excitation force may depend on the presence of such spurious resonances, we
consider the cases where the frequency is kept constant during the measurement
so that the proportionality between excitation signal and actual excitation
force is kept constant. With the present work we show the advantages that
result from the use of a calibration method based on the acquisition of
approach-retract curves. Optical beam deflection based AFMs benefit from the
use of this calibration method, especially in presence of spurious resonances
in the cantilever transfer function.

mutual information (MI) is the natural figure of merit. In this paper, we
analyze an optical fiber system by evaluating MI as the maximum achievable rate
of transmission of such a system. MI is estimated by means of histograms for
which the correct bin number is determined in a blind way. The MI estimate
obtained this way shows excellent accuracy in comparison with the true MI of
16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over an additive white Gaussian
noise channel with additional phase noise, which is a simplified model of a
nonlinear optical fiber channel. We thereby justify to use the MI estimation
method to accurately estimate the MI of an optical fiber system. In the second
part of this work, a transoceanic fiber system with 6000 km of standard
single-mode fiber is simulated and its MI determined. Among rectangular QAMs,
16-QAM is found to be the optimal modulation scheme for this link as to
performance in terms of MI and requirements on components and digital signal
processing. For the reported MI of 3.1 bits/symbol, a minimum coding overhead
of 29% is required when the channel memory is not taken into account. By
employing ideal single-channel digital back-propagation, an increase in MI by
0.25 bits/symbol and 0.28 bits/symbol is reported for 16-QAM and 64-QAM,
respectively, lowering the required overhead to 19% and 16%. When the channel
spacing is decreased to be close to the Nyquist rate, the dual-polarization
spectral efficiency is 5.7 bits/s/Hz, an increase of more than 2 bits/symbol
compared to a 50 GHz spacing.

the major changes in astrophysics and cosmology would be if it is
experimentally confirmed that antimatter falls upwards. The key point is: If
antiparticles have negative gravitational charge, the quantum vacuum, well
established in the Standard Model of Particles and Fields, contains virtual
gravitational dipoles. The main conclusions are: (1) the physical vacuum
enriched with gravitational dipoles is compatible with a cyclic universe
alternatively dominated by matter and antimatter, without initial singularity
and without need for cosmic inflation; (2) the virtual dipoles might explain
the phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy. While what we
have presented is still far from a complete theory, hopefully it can stimulate
a radically different and potentially important way of thinking.
