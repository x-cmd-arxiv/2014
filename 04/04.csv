arXiv:1012.5251. We classify all possible quadratic brackets on the set of
pairs of matrices A and B with the property that the natural action of B on the
defining matrix A of a bilinear form is a Poisson action of a Poisson-Lie
group, thus endowing this space of bilinear forms with the structure of Poisson
homogeneous space. Beside the product Poisson structure we find two more (dual
to each other) structures for which (in contrast to the product Poisson
structure) we can implement the reduction to the space of bilinear forms with
block upper triangular defining matrices by Dirac procedure. We consider the
generalisation of the above construction to triples and show that the space of
bilinear forms then acquires the structure of Poisson symmetric space. We study
also the generalisation to chains of transformations and to the quantum and
quantum affine algebras and the relation between the construction of Poisson
symmetric spaces and that of the Poisson groupoid.

each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine

evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard
mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go
beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of
heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude
that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely

deriving Markovian master equations that describe the time-evolution of
particle number densities in a statistical ensemble with arbitrary flavour
content. As an application of this general formalism, we study flavour effects
in a scenario of resonant leptogenesis (RL) and obtain the flavour-covariant
evolution equations for heavy-neutrino and lepton number densities. This
provides a complete and unified description of RL, capturing three distinct
physical phenomena: (i) the resonant mixing between the heavy-neutrino states,
(ii) coherent oscillations between different heavy-neutrino flavours, and (iii)
quantum decoherence effects in the charged-lepton sector. To illustrate the
importance of this formalism, we numerically solve the flavour-covariant rate
equations for a minimal RL model and show that the total lepton asymmetry can
be enhanced by up to one order of magnitude, as compared to that obtained from
flavour-diagonal or partially flavour off-diagonal rate equations. Thus, the
viable RL model parameter space is enlarged, thereby enhancing further the
prospects of probing a common origin of neutrino masses and the baryon
asymmetry in the Universe at the LHC, as well as in low-energy experiments
searching for lepton flavour and number violation. The key new ingredients in
our flavour-covariant formalism are rank-4 rate tensors, which are required for
the consistency of our flavour-mixing treatment, as shown by an explicit
calculation of the relevant transition amplitudes by generalizing the optical
theorem. We also provide a geometric and physical interpretation of the
heavy-neutrino degeneracy limits in the minimal RL scenario. Finally, we
comment on the consistency of various suggested forms for the heavy-neutrino

time following complex, non-Markovian, dynamics. Here we investigate the impact
of this ubiquitous feature by studying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity driven
networks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and non-Markovian). We show
that while memory inhibits the spreading process in SIR models, where the
epidemic threshold is moved to larger values, it plays the opposite effect in
the case of the SIS, where the threshold is lowered. The heterogeneity in tie
strengths, and the frequent repetition of connections that it entails, allows
in fact less virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local
clusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture by
evaluating the threshold of both processes in a real temporal network. Our
findings confirm the important role played by non-Markovian network dynamics on
dynamical processes

Despite the practical success of this methodology, there is limited
understanding of several heuristics that follow this framework. We provide
theoretical justification for one such natural and computationally efficient
variant.
  Our result can be summarized as follows. A partition of a graph is called
strong if each cluster has small external conductance, and large internal
conductance. We present a simple greedy spectral clustering algorithm which
returns a partition that is provably close to a suitably strong partition,
provided that such a partition exists. A recent result shows that strong
partitions exist for graphs with a sufficiently large spectral gap between the
k-th and (k+1)-st eigenvalues. Taking this together with our main theorem gives
a spectral algorithm which finds a partition close to a strong one for graphs
with large enough spectral gap. We also show how this simple greedy algorithm
can be implemented in near-linear time for any fixed k and error guarantee.
Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on some real-world and synthetic inputs.

an individual goes to a restaurant or a bar. Third, we show how to analyze this

low-level atmospheric circulation, the underlying physical mechanisms remain
unclear. Lindzen and Nigam (1987) noted that sea level pressure (SLP) gradients
are proportional to surface temperature gradients if isobaric height (the
height where pressure does not vary in the horizontal plane) is constant; their
own model of low-level circulation assumed that isobaric height in the tropics
is around 3 km. Recently Bayr and Dommenget (2013) proposed a simple model of
temperature-driven air redistribution from which they derived that the isobaric
height in the tropics again varies little but occurs higher (at the height of
the troposphere). Here investigations show that neither the empirical
assumption of Lindzen and Nigam (1987) nor the theoretical derivations of Bayr
and Dommenget (2013) are plausible. Observations show that isobaric height is
too variable to determine a universal spatial or temporal relationship between
local values of air temperature and SLP. Since isobaric height cannot be
determined from independent considerations, the relationship between SLP and
temperature is not evidence that differential heating drives low-level
circulation. An alternative theory suggests SLP gradients are determined by the
condensation of water vapor as moist air converges towards the equator. This
theory quantifies the meridional SLP differences observed by season across the
Hadley cells reasonably well. Higher temperature of surface air where SLP is
low may be determined by equatorward transport and release of latent heat below
the trade wind inversion layer. The relationship between atmospheric
circulation and moisture dynamics merits further investigation.

dynamics of solvents and solutes from the dipolar relaxation times down to
electronic ones. In the late 1970s, Hubbard and Onsager predicted that adding
salt ions to a polar solution would result in a reduced dielectric permittivity
that arises from the unexpected tendency of solvent dipoles to align opposite
to the applied field. So far, this effect has escaped an experimental
verification, mainly because of the concomitant appearance of dielectric
saturation from which the Hubbard-Onsager decrement cannot be easily separated.
Here we develop a novel non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation approach
to determine this decrement accurately for the first time. Using a
thermodynamic consistent all-atom force field we show that for an aqueous
solution containing sodium chloride around 4.8 Mol/l, this effect accounts for
12\% of the total dielectric permittivity. The dielectric decrement can be
strikingly different if a less accurate force field for the ions is used. Using
the widespread GROMOS parameters, we observe in fact an {\it increment} of the
dielectric permittivity rather than a decrement. We can show that this
increment is caused by ion pairing, introduced by a too low dispersion force,
and clarify the microscopic connection between long-living ion pairs and the
appearance of specific features in the dielectric spectrum of the solution.

difference (OPD) directly translates into an astrometric measurement. In the
simplest case, the OPD is equal to the scalar product between the vector
linking the two telescopes and the normalized vector pointing toward the star.
However, a too simple interpretation of this scalar product leads to seemingly
conflicting results, called here ""the baseline paradox"". For micro-arcsecond
accuracy astrometry, we have to model in full the metrology measurement. It
involves a complex system subject to many optical effects: from pure baseline
errors to static, quasi-static and high order optical aberrations. The goal of
this paper is to present the strategy used by the ""General Relativity Analysis
via VLT InTerferometrY"" instrument (GRAVITY) to minimize the biases introduced
by these defects. It is possible to give an analytical formula on how the
baselines and tip-tilt errors affect the astrometric measurement. This formula
depends on the limit-points of three type of baselines: the wide-angle
baseline, the narrow-angle baseline, and the imaging baseline. We also,
numerically, include non-common path higher-order aberrations, whose amplitude
were measured during technical time at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer.
We end by simulating the influence of high-order common-path aberrations due to
atmospheric residuals calculated from a Monte-Carlo simulation tool for
Adaptive optics systems. The result of this work is an error budget of the
biases caused by the multiple optical imperfections, including optical
dispersion. We show that the beam stabilization through both focal and pupil
tracking is crucial to the GRAVITY system. Assuming the instrument pupil is
stabilized at a 4 cm level on M1, and a field tracking below 0.2$\lambda/D$, we
show that GRAVITY will be able to reach its objective of 10$\mu$as accuracy.

combinations of alleles allow close adaptation to the optimum. If alleles have
equal effects, all combinations that result in the same deviation from the
optimum are equivalent. Furthermore, the genetic variance that is maintained by
mutation-selection balance is $2 \mu/S$ per locus, where $\mu$ is the mutation
rate and $S$ the strength of stabilizing selection. In reality, alleles vary in
their effects, making the fitness landscape asymmetric, and complicating
analysis of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic variance
depends on the fraction of alleles near fixation, which contribute by $2
\mu/S$, and on the total mutational effects of alleles that are at intermediate
frequency. The interplay between stabilizing selection and mutation leads to a
sharp transition: alleles with effects smaller than a threshold value of
$2\sqrt{\mu / S}$ remain polymorphic, whereas those with larger effects are
fixed. The genetic load in equilibrium is less than for traits of equal
effects, and the fitness equilibria are more similar. We find that if the
optimum is displaced, alleles with effects close to the threshold value sweep
first, and their rate of increase is bounded by $\sqrt{\mu S}$. Long term
response leads in general to well-adapted traits, unlike the case of equal
effects that often end up at a sub-optimal fitness peak. However, the
particular peaks to which the populations converge are extremely sensitive to
the initial states, and to the speed of the shift of the optimum trait value.

on the initial stellar masses, rotation velocities, and nature of the mixing
processes up to relative enrichment of N/O by a factor of about four, thus this
plot constitutes an ideal quality test for observational results. The
comparison between the FLAMES Survey and theoretical values shows overall
agreement, despite the observational scatter of the published results. The
existence of some mixing of CNO products is clearly confirmed, however the
accuracy of the data is not sufficient for allowing a test of the significant
differences between different models of rotating stars and the Geneva models.

reduced. Finally, the N/C vs N/O plot potentially offers a powerful way for
discriminating blue supergiants before the red supergiant stage from those

Besides likely being associated with the normal-state pseudogap, the
charge-density wave order presumably influences the build-up of known
superconducting correlations as the temperature is lowered toward the
superconducting state. As a pure magnetic probe, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR)
is not directly sensitive to charge order, but may sense its presence via the
effect it has on the magnetic dipolar coupling of the muon with the host nuclei
at zero or low magnetic field. At higher field where $\mu$SR is completely
blind to the effects of charge order, experiments have revealed a universal
inhomogeneous normal-state response extending to temperatures well above $T_c$.
The measured inhomogeneous line broadening has been attributed to regions of

requirements of Horndeski's four-dimensional action. The former scalar is a
Galileon with shift symmetry whereas the latter scalar is adjusted to have a
higher order conformal coupling. Employing technics from local Weyl geometry
certain Galileon higher order terms are thus constructed to be conformally
invariant. The combined shift and partial conformal symmetry of the action,
allow us to construct exact black hole solutions. The black holes initially
found are of planar horizon geometry embedded in anti de Sitter space and can
accommodate electric charge. The conformally coupled scalar comes with an
additional independent charge and it is well-defined on the horizon whereas
additional regularity of the Galileon field is achieved allowing for time
dependence. Guided by our results in adS space-time we then consider a higher
order version of the BBMB action and construct asymptotically flat, regular,
hairy black holes. The addition of the Galileon field is seen to cure the BBMB
scalar horizon singularity while allowing for the presence of primary scalar
hair seen as an independent integration constant along-side the mass of the
black hole.

They are
characterized by fast response and slow adaptation to varying environmental
cues. Insofar as sensory adaptive systems map environmental changes to changes
of their internal degrees of freedom, they can be regarded as computational
devices manipulating information. Landauer established that information is
ultimately physical, and its manipulation subject to the entropic and energetic
bounds of thermodynamics. Thus the fundamental costs of biological sensory
adaptation can be elucidated by tracking how the information the system has
about its environment is altered. These bounds are particularly relevant for
small organisms, which unlike everyday computers operate at very low energies.
In this paper, we establish a general framework for the thermodynamics of
information processing in sensing. With it, we quantify how during sensory
adaptation information about the past is erased, while information about the
present is gathered. This process produces entropy larger than the amount of
old information erased and has an energetic cost bounded by the amount of new
information written to memory. We apply these principles to the E. coli's
chemotaxis pathway during binary ligand concentration changes. In this regime,
we quantify the amount of information stored by each methyl group and show that
receptors consume energy in the range of the information-theoretic minimum. Our
work provides a basis for further inquiries into more complex phenomena, such
as gradient sensing and frequency response.

convergent mode sum. The self-force is first evaluated numerically, and next
presented as an analytical expansion in powers of R/r, with R denoting the
event-horizon radius. The power series is then summed to yield a closed-form
expression. Unlike its four-dimensional version, the self-force features a
dependence on a regularization parameter s that can be interpreted as the
particle's radius. The self-force is repulsive at large distances, and its
behavior is related to a model according to which the force results from a
gravitational interaction between the black hole and the distribution of
electrostatic field energy attached to the particle. The model, however, is
shown to become inadequate as r becomes comparable to R, where the self-force
changes sign and becomes attractive. We also calculate the self-force acting on

and metallicity calculated from the ab-type RR Lyrae, we conclude that Phoenix
is more likely of intermediate Oosterhoff type; however the morphology of the
Bailey diagram for Phoenix RR Lyraes appears similar to that of an Oosterhoff

nanoscale pores of Vycor glass showed anomalous frequency changes at
temperatures below 200 mK. These were initially attributed to decoupling of
some of the helium's mass from the oscillator, the expected signature of a
supersolid. However, these and similar anomalous effects seen with bulk
$^{4}$He now appear to be artifacts arising from large shear modulus changes
when mobile dislocations are pinned by $^{3}$He impurities. We have used a
torsional oscillator (TO) technique to directly measure the shear modulus of
the solid $^{4}$He/Vycor system at a frequency (1.2 kHz) comparable to that
used in previous TO experiments. The shear modulus increases gradually as the
TO is cooled from 1 K to 20 mK. We attribute the gradual modulus change to the
freezing out of thermally activated relaxation processes in the solid helium.
The absence of rapid changes below 200 mK is expected since mobile dislocations
could not exist in pores as small as those of Vycor. Our results support the
interpretation of a recent torsional oscillator experiment that showed no
anomaly when elastic effects in bulk helium were eliminated by ensuring that
there were no gaps around the Vycor sample.

that the formation of each globular occurs in very massive stellar
environments, as suggested by some models that aim at explaining the presence
of multi-populations in these systems. The assumption that the relative number
of globular clusters to diffuse stellar mass depends exponentially on chemical
abundance, [Z/H], and the presence of two dominant GC sub-populations blue and
red, allows the mapping of low metallicity halos and of higher metallicity (and
more heterogeneous) bulges. In particular, the masses of the low-metallicity
halos seem to scale up with dark matter mass through a constant. We also find a
dependence of the globular cluster formation efficiency with the mean projected
stellar mass density of the galaxies within their effective radii. The analysis
is based on a selected sub-sample of galaxies observed within the ACS Virgo
Cluster Survey of the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}. These systems were grouped,
according to their absolute magnitudes, in order to define composite fiducial
galaxies and look for a quantitative connection with their (also composite)
globular clusters systems. The results strengthen the idea that globular

approach is to sample as many genotypes as possible, measure their fitnesses,
and fit a statistical model of the landscape that includes additive and
pairwise interactive effects between loci. Here we elucidate the pitfalls of
using such regressions, by studying artificial but mathematically convenient
fitness landscapes. We identify two sources of bias inherent in these
regression procedures that each tends to under-estimate high fitnesses and
over-estimate low fitnesses. We characterize these biases for random sampling
of genotypes, as well as for samples drawn from a population under selection in
the Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary dynamics. We show that common measures
of epistasis, such as the number of monotonically increasing paths between
ancestral and derived genotypes, the prevalence of sign epistasis, and the
number of local fitness maxima, are distorted in the inferred landscape. As a
result, the inferred landscape will provide systematically biased predictions
for the dynamics of adaptation. We identify the same biases in a computational
RNA-folding landscape, as well as in regulatory sequence binding data, treated
with the same fitting procedure. Finally, we present a method that may
ameliorate these biases in some cases.

various topologically ordered states in 3+1D, which exhibit both point-like and

surprisingly involves three loops simultaneously, and can distinguish different

is studied, where initially players belong to two independent structured
populations. Simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players whose current
utility exceeds a threshold are rewarded by an external link to a player
belonging to the other population. Yet as soon as the utility drops below the
threshold, the external link is terminated. The rewarding of current
evolutionary fitness thus introduces a time-varying interdependence between the
two populations. We show that, regardless of the details of the evolutionary
game and the interaction structure, the self-organization of fitness and reward
gives rise to distinguished players that act as strong catalysts of cooperative
behavior. However, there also exist critical utility thresholds beyond which
distinguished players are no longer able to percolate. The interdependence
between the two populations then vanishes, and cooperators are forced to rely
on traditional network reciprocity alone. We thus demonstrate that a simple
strategy-independent form of rewarding may significantly expand the scope of
cooperation on structured populations. The formation of links outside the
immediate community seems particularly applicable in human societies, where an
individual is typically member in many different social networks.

estimate the atmospheric stability of close-in exoplanets and the age of their

the stellar activity level. However, testing for tidal or magnetic interaction
effects in samples of planet-hosting stars is difficult because stellar
activity hinders exoplanet detection, so that stellar samples with detected
exoplanets show a bias towards low activity for small exoplanets. We aim to
test if exoplanets in close orbits influence the stellar rotation and magnetic
activity of their host stars, and have developed a novel approach to test for
such systematic activity enhancements. We use wide (several 100 AU) binary
systems in which one of the stellar components is known to have an exoplanet,
while the second stellar component does not have a detected planet and
therefore acts as a negative control. We use the stellar coronal X-ray emission
as an observational proxy for magnetic activity, and analyze observations
performed with Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find that in two systems for which
strong tidal interaction can be expected the planet-hosting primary displays a
much higher magnetic activity level than the planet-free secondary. In three
systems for which weaker tidal interaction can be expected the activity levels
of both stellar components are in agreement. Our observations indicate that the
presence of Hot Jupiters may inhibit the spin-down of host stars with thick
outer convective layers. Possible causes for such an effect include a transfer
of angular momentum from the planetary orbit to the stellar rotation through
tidal interaction, or differences during the early evolution of the system,
where the host star may decouple from the protoplanetary disk early due to a
gap opened by the forming Hot Jupiter.

useful to investigate their inner regions. However, optical and X-ray results
show many discrepancies that have not been fully understood yet. The aim of
this paper is to study the ""synapses"" between the X-ray and optical
classifications.
  For the first time, the new EFLUXER task allowed us to analyse broad band
X-ray spectra of emission line nuclei (ELN) without any prior spectral fitting
using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Our sample comprises 162 XMM-Newton/pn
spectra of 90 local ELN in the Palomar sample. It includes starbursts (SB),
transition objects (T2), LINERs (L1.8 and L2), and Seyferts (S1, S1.8, and S2).
  The ANNs are 90% efficient at classifying the trained classes S1, S1.8, and
SB. The S1 and S1.8 classes show a wide range of S1- and S1.8-like components.
We suggest that this is related to a large degree of obscuration at X-rays. The
S1, S1.8, S2, L1.8, L2/T2/SB-AGN (SB with indications of AGN), and SB classes
have similar average X-ray spectra within each class, but these average spectra
can be distinguished from class to class. The S2 (L1.8) class is linked to the
S1.8 (S1) class with larger SB-like component than the S1.8 (S1) class. The L2,
T2, and SB-AGN classes conform a class in the X-rays similar to the S2 class
albeit with larger fractions of SB-like component. This SB-like component is
the contribution of the star-formation in the host galaxy, which is large when
the AGN is weak. An AGN-like component seems to be present in the vast majority
of the ELN, attending to the non-negligible fraction of S1-like or S1.8-like
component. This trained ANN could be used to infer optical properties from
X-ray spectra in surveys like eRosita.

1<z<5.2 using the PACS and SPIRE on-board Herschel. Combined with existing
mid-IR photometry from Spitzer and observations obtained with LABOCA, the SEDs
of galaxies in our sample are continuously covered across 3.6-870um. The total
infrared luminosities of these RGs are such that they almost all are either
ultra-or hyper-luminous infrared galaxies. We fit the infrared SEDs with a set
of empirical templates which represent dust heated (1) by a variety of SB and
(2) by a AGN. We find that the SEDs of RGs require the dust to be heated by
both AGN and SB, but the luminosities of these two components are not strongly
correlated. Assuming empirical relations and simple physical assumptions, we
calculate the SFR, the black hole mass accretion rate (MdotBH), and the black
hole mass (MBH) for each RG. We find that the host galaxies and their BHs are
growing extremely rapidly, having SFR~100-5000 Msun/yr and MdotBH~1-100
Msun/yr. The mean sSFR of RGs at z>2.5 are higher than the sSFR of typical
star-forming galaxies over the same redshift range but are similar or perhaps
lower than the galaxy population for RGs at z<2.5. By comparing the sSFR and
the specific black hole mass accretion rate, we conclude that BHs in radio loud
AGN are already, or soon will be, overly massive compared to their host
galaxies in terms of expectations from the local MBH-MGal relation. In order to
``catch up'' with the BH, the galaxies require about an order-of magnitude more
time to grow in mass, at the observed SFRs, compared to the time the BH is
actively accreting. However, during the current cycle of activity, we argue
that this catching-up is likely to be difficult due to the short gas depletion
times. Finally, we speculate on how the host galaxies might grow sufficiently
in stellar mass to ultimately fall onto the local MBH-MGal relation.

  Ambient ionized gas. The velocity dispersion of the ionized ISM in U/LIRGs
(<sigma> ~ 70 kms-1) is larger than in lower luminosity local star forming
galaxies (<sigma> ~ 25 kms-1). While for isolated disc LIRGs star formation
appears to sustain turbulence, gravitational energy release associated to
interactions and mergers plays an important role driving sigma in the U/LIRG
range. We also find that the impact of an AGN in ULIRGs is strong, increasing
sigma by a factor 1.5 on average. The observed weak dependency of sigma with
SFR surface density for local U/LIRGs is in very good agreement with that
measured in some high-z samples.
  Ionized outflows. The presence of ionized gas outflows in U/LIRGs seems
universal based on the detection of a broad, usually blueshifted, Halpha line.
AGNs in U/LIRGs are able to generate faster (x2) and more massive (x1.4)
ionized gas outflows than pure starbursts. The derived ionized mass loading
factors are in general below one, with only a few AGNs above this limit. Only a
small fraction of the ionized material from low mass LIRGs (log(Mdyn/Msun) <
10.4) could reach the intergalactic medium, with more massive galaxies
retaining the gas. The observed average outflow properties in U/LIRGs are
similar to high-z galaxies of comparable SFR. In the bright SF clumps found in
LIRGs, ionized gas outflows appear to be very common. For a given SFR surface
density, outflows in LIRG clumps would be about one to two orders of magnitude
less energetic than those launched by clumps in high-z SF galaxies.

version of Unit-Fractions Bin Packing, and it is also called Inventory
Replenishment in the context of Supply Chain. In brief, the problem is to
schedule the use of communication channels to clients. Each client ci is
characterized by an active cycle and a window wi. During the period of time
that any given client ci is active, there must be at least one transmission
from ci scheduled in any wi consecutive time slots, but at most one
transmission can be carried out in each channel per time slot. The goal is to
minimize the number of channels used. We extend previous online models, where
decisions are permanent, assuming that clients may be reallocated at some cost.
We assume that such cost is a constant amount paid per reallocation. That is,
we aim to minimize also the number of reallocations. We present three online
reallocation algorithms for Windows Scheduling. We evaluate experimentally
these protocols showing that, in practice, all three achieve constant amortized
reallocations with close to optimal channel usage. Our simulations also expose
interesting trade-offs between reallocations and channel usage. We introduce a
new objective function for WS with reallocations, that can be also applied to
models where reallocations are not possible. We analyze this metric for one of
the algorithms which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first online WS
protocol with theoretical guarantees that applies to scenarios where clients
may leave and the analysis is against current load rather than peak load. Using
previous results, we also observe bounds on channel usage for one of the
algorithms.

teams, with the #1 player of team A matched against the #1 player of team B,
the #2 player of team A against the #2 player of team B, and so on. This paper
addresses the following question: What if team A wants to game the system? Can
it gain an advantage by putting its players in a different order?
  The first example of this problem in history (to the author's knowledge) was
a match of three horse races between the King of Qi and general Tian Ji, in
China, in the fourth century B.C. Tian Ji's protege, Sun Bin, advised the
general to throw the first race, running his #3 horse against the king's #1,
and then to race his #1 horse against the king's #2 and his #2 horse against
the king's #3. In this way, Tian Ji won the match, 2-1, and Sun Bin ensured his
reputation as a great strategist.
  The paper introduces a card-game version of this puzzle, called One Round
War, and derives the optimal strategy in case each side has N cards (the
analogue of N horses). The problem is recast as a linear assignment problem.
The optimal solution involves sacrificing the weakest k cards/horses (for some
k = k(N)) against the opponent's strongest k in reverse order (weakest vs.
strongest), and then playing the remaining N-k cards/horses against the
opponent's remaining cards in forward order. An exact formula is derived for
k(N), and asymptotically we show that k(N) ~ sqrt (N ln N/2).
  Note: This paper proves that the strategy described above is optimal for
sufficiently large N (e.g., for N greater than 10^7). It has also been verified
by computer to be optimal for N less than 60. We conjecture that it is also
true for N between 60 and 10^7. The upper bound 10^7 can be greatly improved,
but closing the gap completely will probably require computer calculations that
are beyond our resources.

The PSP framework captures a variety of scheduling problems, including the
classical problems of unrelated machines scheduling, broadcast scheduling, and
scheduling jobs of different parallelizability. It also captures scheduling
constraints arising in diverse modern environments ranging from individual

multidimensional resource requirements and parallelizability, as well as
network bandwidth requirements found in data center scheduling.

minimizing total weighted completion time for PSP and 2)a scalable algorithm

assuming independent Rayleigh fading between antennas. Several representative

addition, it is shown that if the number of antennas at the representative

result indicates that to the extent that the system assumptions hold, it is

in-network caching is becoming increasingly important to improve the end-user
experience and reduce the Internet access cost for mobile network operators.
However, caching is a difficult problem due to the very large number of online
videos and video requests,limited capacity of caching nodes, and limited
bandwidth of in-network links. Existing solutions that rely on static
configurations and average request arrival rates are insufficient to handle
dynamic request patterns effectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
collaborative video caching framework to be deployed in mobile networks. We
decompose the caching problem into a content placement subproblem and a
source-selection subproblem. We then develop SRS (System capacity Reservation
Strategy) to solve the content placement subproblem, and LinkShare, an adaptive
traffic-aware algorithm to solve the source selection subproblem. Our framework
supports congestion avoidance and allows merging multiple requests for the same
video into one request. We carry extensive simulations to validate the proposed
schemes. Simulation results show that our SRS algorithm achieves performance

Stellar shells, which form axially symmetric systems of arcs in some
elliptical galaxies, are most likely remnants of radial minor mergers. They are
observed up a radius of $\sim$100 kpc. The stars in them oscillate in radial
orbits. The radius of a shell depends on the free-fall time at the position of
the shell and on the time since the merger. We previously verified the
consistency of shell radii in the elliptical galaxy NGC 3923 with its most
probable MOND potential. Our results implied that an as~yet undiscovered shell
exists at the outskirts of the galaxy.
  Aims. We here extend our study by assuming more general models for the
gravitational potential to verify the prediction of the new shell and to
estimate its position.
  Methods. We tested the consistency of the shell radial distribution observed
in NGC 3923 with a wide variety of MOND potentials of the galaxy. The
potentials differed in the mass-to-light ratio and in distance to the galaxy.
We considered different MOND interpolation functions, values of the
acceleration constant $a_0$, and density profiles of the galaxy. We verified
the functionality of our code on a Newtonian self-consistent simulation of the
formation of a shell galaxy.
  Results. Our method reliably predicts that exactly one new outermost shell
exists at a galactocentric radius of about 1900$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$210
kpc) on the southwestern side of the galaxy. Its estimated surface brightness
is about 28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in $B$ - a value accessible by current
instruments. This prediction enables a rare test of MOND in an elliptical down
to an acceleration of $a_0/10$. The predictive power of our method is verified
by reconstructing the position of the largest known shell from the distribution
of the remaining shells.

wave turbulence. It has been known since seminal work by Kolmogorov, that
turbulent dynamics is controlled by a directional energy flux through the
wavelength scales. We demonstrate that an energy cascade in wave turbulence can
be bi-directional, that is, can simultaneously flow towards large and small
wavelength scales from the pumping scales at which it is injected. This
observation is in sharp contrast to existing experiments and wave turbulence
theory where the energy flux only flows in one direction. We demonstrate that
the bi-directional energy cascade changes the energy budget in the system and
leads to formation of large-scale, large-amplitude waves similar to oceanic
rogue waves. To study surface wave turbulence, we took advantage of capillary
waves on a free, weakly charged surface of superfluid helium He-II at
temperature 1.7K. Although He-II demonstrates non-classical thermomechanical
effects and quantized vorticity, waves on its surface are identical to those on
a classical Newtonian fluid with extremely low viscosity. The possibility of
directly driving a charged surface by an oscillating electric field and the low
viscosity of He-II have allowed us to isolate the surface dynamics and study
nonlinear surface waves in a range of frequencies much wider than in
experiments with classical fluids.

economic levels of the power grid. In terms of keeping the balance between
supply and demand, the usual scheme of supply following load may not be
appropriate for large penetration levels of uncertain and intermittent
renewable supply. In this paper, we focus on an alternative scheme in which the
load follows the supply, exploiting the flexibility associated with the demand
side. We consider a model of flexible loads that are to be serviced by
zero-marginal cost renewable power together with conventional generation if
necessary. Each load demands 1 kW for a specified number of time slots within
an operational period. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the
service may be delivered over any slots within the operational period. Loads
therefore require flexible energy services that are differentiated by the
demanded duration. We focus on two problems associated with
durations-differentiated loads. The first problem deals with the operational
decisions that a supplier has to make to serve a given set of duration
differentiated loads. The second problem focuses on a market implementation for
duration differentiated services. We give necessary and sufficient conditions
under which the available power can service the loads, and we describe an
algorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available
supply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be
purchased to service the loads. Next we consider a forward market where
consumers can purchase duration differentiated energy services. We first
characterize social welfare maximizing allocations in this forward market and
then show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium.

(ISS) of the double pulsar J0737$-$3039 over the course of 18 months. As in
earlier work (Coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in the
ISS caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionized
interstellar medium (IISM), and the Earth. The transverse velocity of the
binary system can be determined both by VLBI and timing observations. The
orbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timing
observations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.
Since the Earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbital
velocity by its effect on the timescale of the ISS, we can determine the
orientation $\Omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates
($\Omega = 65\pm2$ deg). We also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$
deg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured Shapiro delay by
our estimate $i=88.1\pm0.5$ deg. This relies on analysis of the ISS over both
frequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,
turbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the IISM. We find that the
IISM can be well-modeled during each observation, typically of a few orbital
periods, but its turbulence level and mean velocity vary significantly over the
18 months.

to tackle this problem. We decompose the representing space of signals into two
parts, the measurement dictionary and the sparsifying basis. The dictionary is
designed to approximate a sub-Gaussian distribution to exploit its

in the first stage, and obtain the training and testing coefficients
respectively. Then we design the basis to approach an identity matrix in the
second stage, to acquire the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and
universality property. The testing coefficients are encoded over the basis and
the final representing coefficients are obtained. We verify that the projection
of testing coefficients onto the basis is a good approximation of the signal
onto the representing space. Since the projection is conducted on a much
sparser space, the runtime is greatly reduced. For concrete realization, we
provide an instance for the proposed TSSR. Experiments on four biometrics
databases show that TSSR is effective and efficient, comparing with several
classical methods for solving linear inverse problem.

spin-orbit effective fields considering contributions from both the anomalous
and planar Hall effects. The longitudinal and transverse components of
effective fields are found to have strong angular dependence on the
magnetization direction at 300 K. The transverse field decreases significantly
with decreasing temperature, whereas the longitudinal field shows weaker
temperature dependence. Our results reveal important features and provide an
opportunity for a more comprehensive understanding of current induced
spin-orbit effective fields.

interests, because of the possibility to go beyond the conventional
symmetry-breaking phases, towards topologically ordered phases, such as lattice

susceptible to source, channel and amplifier nonlinearities because of its high
peak-to-average ratio (PAPR). The distortion gets worse by increasing the
average power of the OFDM signals since larger portion of the signals are
affected by nonlinearity. In this paper we introduce Hadamard coded modulation
(HCM) that uses the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) to modulate data as an
alternative technique to OFDM in direct-detection wireless optical systems.
This technique is shown to have a better performance for high average optical
power scenarios because of its small PAPR, and can be used instead of OFDM in
two scenarios: 1) in optical systems that require high average optical powers
such as visible light communications (VLC), and 2) in optical wireless systems
unconstrained by average power, for which HCM achieves lower bit error rate
(BER) compared to OFDM. The power efficiency of HCM can be improved by removing
a part of the signal's DC bias without losing any information. In this way, the
amplitude of the transmitted signal is decreased and the signals become less
susceptible to nonlinearity. Interleaving can be applied on HCM to make the
resulting signals resistent against inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects in
dispersive channels by uniformly distributing the interference over all
symbols.

approach to gather, store, and sort data over time. To build more complicated
systems in chemistries, the ability to look at data in the past would be a
valuable tool to perform complex calculations. In this paper we present the
first implementation of a chemical delay line providing information storage in
a chemistry that can reliably capture information over an extended period of
time. The delay line is capable of parallel operations in a single instruction,
multiple data (SIMD) fashion.
  Using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we describe the chemical delay line
implementation featuring an enzyme acting as a means to reduce copy errors. We
also discuss how information is randomly accessible from any element on the
delay line. Our work shows how the chemical delay line retains and provides a
value from a previous cycle. The system's modularity allows for integration
with existing chemical systems. We exemplify the delay line capabilities by
integration with a threshold asymmetric signal perceptron to demonstrate how it
learns all 14 linearly separable binary functions over a size two sliding
window. The delay line has applications in biomedical diagnosis and treatment,
such as smart drug delivery.

manifests itself not only in the peculiar magnetism but also in anomalous
transport and magnetoelectric effect. We report our theoretical results on the
influence and stability of a toroidal order in metals on the basis of a
microscopic model. We consider an effective single-band Hubbard-type model with
a site-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, which is derived from a
four-band tight-binding model including the atomic spin-orbit coupling,
off-site hybridizations between orbitals with different parities, and
odd-parity crystalline electric field. For this single-band model on a layered
honeycomb lattice, we investigate the electronic structure, magnetotransport,
and magnetoelectric effect in the toroidal ordered state with a vortex-like
magnetic structure. The ferroic order of the microscopic toroidal moments acts
as an effective gauge field for electrons, which modulates the electronic band
structure with a shift of the band bottom in the momentum space. In addition,
the site-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling gives rise to highly
anisotropic Hall responses. The most salient feature is two different types of
magnetoelectric responses: one is a magnetic order with net toroidal
magnetization induced by an electric current perpendicular to the planes, and
the other is a uniform transverse magnetization induced by an electric current
within the planes. We examine the ground state of the effective model by the
mean-field approximation, and show that the toroidal order is stabilized by
strong electron correlations at low electron density. We also discuss the
temperature dependence of the magnetoelectric effects associated with
spontaneous toroidal ordering. Implications to experiments are also presented.

multiresolution finite element method is hence presented. The multiresolution
analysis (MRA) framework is formulated out of a mutually nesting displacement
subspace sequence, whose basis functions are constructed of scaling and
shifting on the element domain of basic node shape function. The basic node
shape function is constructed by extending shape function around a specific
node. The MRA endows the proposed element with the resolution level (RL) to
adjust the element node number, thus modulating structural analysis accuracy
accordingly. As a result, the traditional 4-node quadrilateral plate element
and method is a monoresolution one and also a special case of the proposed
element and method. The meshing for the monoresolution plate element model is
based on the empiricism while the RL adjusting for the multiresolution is laid
on the rigorous mathematical basis. The accuracy of a structural analysis is
actually determined by the RL, not by the mesh. The rational MRA enable the
implementation of the multiresolution element method to be more rational and
efficient than that of the conventional monoresolution plate element method or
other corresponding MRA methods such as the wavelet finite element method, the
meshfree method, and the natural element method etc.

recent literature. String theory is promising because it has interesting
features such as unifying gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear
forces. However, even the energy scale of the experiments at the Large Hadron
Collider (~TeV) is too low to detect any strong evidence for string theory. The
energy scale of inflation can be above ~10^9 TeV. Therefore, it is expected to
find some signature of string theory in cosmology.
  String theory predicts ten space-time dimensions. In the brane world
scenario, our four dimensional Universe is confined onto the higher dimensional
object called the Brane in the ten dimensional space time. The
Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation is based on this idea. DBI inflation predicts
a characteristic statistical feature in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
temperature anisotropies. In this thesis, we study the predictions of the DBI
inflation models on the CMB temperature anisotropies.

show how to dimension the pool of M2M-dedicated resources in order to guarantee

that the pool of resources is used by a massive number of devices allows to

is subjected to strict physical constraints: the mass-action law, elementarity
of processes, and detailed balance. We further digress on the role of solvents
and on the seemingly unacknowledged property of network independence of free
energy landscapes. We then open the system by assuming that the concentrations
of certain substrate species (the chemostats) are fixed, whether because
promptly regulated by the environment via contact with reservoirs, or because
nearly constant in a time window. As a result, the system is driven out of
equilibrium. A rich algebraic and topological structure ensues in the network
of internal species: Emergent irreversible cycles are associated to
nonvanishing affinities, whose symmetries are dictated by the breakage of
conservation laws. These central results are resumed in the relation $a + b =
s^Y$ between the number of fundamental affinities $a$, that of broken
conservation laws $b$ and the number of chemostats $s^Y$. We decompose the
steady state entropy production rate in terms of fundamental fluxes and

Assuming that the hadronic interactions responsible for high-energy gamma rays
also produce high-energy neutrinos and that O(100) PeV cosmic rays can be
produced and confined in starburst galaxies, we here discuss the possibility
that star-forming galaxies are also the main sources of the high-energy
neutrinos observed by the IceCube experiment. First, we compute the diffuse
gamma-ray background from star-forming galaxies, adopting the latest Herschel
PEP/HerMES luminosity function and relying on the correlation between the
gamma-ray and infrared luminosities reported by Fermi observations. Then we
derive the expected intensity of the diffuse high-energy neutrinos from
star-forming galaxies including normal and starburst galaxies. Our results
indicate that starbursts, including those with active galactic nuclei and
galaxy mergers, could be the main sources of the high-energy neutrinos observed
by the IceCube experiment. We find that assuming a cosmic-ray spectral index of
2.1-2.2 for all starburst-like galaxies, our predictions can be consistent with
both the Fermi and IceCube data, but larger indices readily fail to explain the
observed diffuse neutrino flux. Taking the starburst high-energy spectral index
as free parameter, and extrapolating from GeV to PeV energies, we find that the
spectra harder than E^(-2.15) are likely to be excluded by the IceCube data,
which can be more constraining than the Fermi data for this population.

convex function $\phi$ and include well known distance functions like
$\ell_2^2$ and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. There has been extensive
research on algorithms for problems like clustering and near neighbor search
with respect to Bregman divergences, in all cases, the algorithms depend not
just on the data size $n$ and dimensionality $d$, but also on a structure
constant $\mu \ge 1$ that depends solely on $\phi$ and can grow without bound
independently.
  In this paper, we provide the first evidence that this dependence on $\mu$
might be intrinsic. We focus on the problem of approximate near neighbor search
for Bregman divergences. We show that under the cell probe model, any
non-adaptive data structure (like locality-sensitive hashing) for
$c$-approximate near-neighbor search that admits $r$ probes must use space
$\Omega(n^{1 + \frac{\mu}{c r}})$. In contrast, for LSH under $\ell_1$ the best
bound is $\Omega(n^{1+\frac{1}{cr}})$.
  Our new tool is a directed variant of the standard boolean noise operator. We
show that a generalization of the Bonami-Beckner hypercontractivity inequality
exists ""in expectation"" or upon restriction to certain subsets of the Hamming
cube, and that this is sufficient to prove the desired isoperimetric inequality
that we use in our data structure lower bound.
  We also present a structural result reducing the Hamming cube to a Bregman
cube. This structure allows us to obtain lower bounds for problems under
Bregman divergences from their $\ell_1$ analog. In particular, we get a
(weaker) lower bound for approximate near neighbor search of the form
$\Omega(n^{1 + \frac{1}{cr}})$ for an $r$-query non-adaptive data structure,
and new cell probe lower bounds for a number of other near neighbor questions
in Bregman space.

point-to-point wireless communications system with hybrid energy sources
consisting of an energy harvester and a conventional energy source. In
particular, as an incentive to promote the use of renewable energy, we assume
that the renewable energy has a lower cost than the conventional energy. Then,
by assuming that the non-causal information of the energy arrivals and the
channel power gains are available, we minimize the total energy cost of such a
system over $N$ fading slots under a proposed outage constraint together with
the energy harvesting constraints. The outage constraint requires a minimum
fixed number of slots to be reliably decoded, and thus leads to a mixed-integer
programming formulation for the optimization problem. This constraint is
useful, for example, if an outer code is used to recover all the data bits.
Optimal linear time algorithms are obtained for two extreme cases, i.e., the
number of outage slot is $1$ or $N-1$. For the general case, a lower bound
based on the linear programming relaxation, and two suboptimal algorithms are
proposed. It is shown that the proposed suboptimal algorithms exhibit only a
small gap from the lower bound. We then extend the proposed algorithms to the
multi-cycle scenario in which the outage constraint is imposed for each cycle
separately. Finally, we investigate the resource allocation strategies when
only causal information on the energy arrivals and only channel statistics is
available. It is shown that the greedy energy allocation is optimal for this
scenario.

production region can be measured using the Bose-Einstein correlations of
identical bosons at low relative momentum. The source radii are typically
extracted using two-pion correlations, and characterize the system at the last
stage of interaction, called kinetic freeze-out. In low-multiplicity
collisions, unlike in high-multiplicity collisions, two-pion correlations are
substantially altered by background correlations, e.g. mini-jets. Such
correlations can be suppressed using three-pion cumulant correlations. We
present the first measurements of the size of the system at freeze-out
extracted from three-pion cumulant correlations in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb
collisions at the LHC with ALICE. At similar multiplicity, the invariant radii
extracted in p-Pb collisions are found to be 5-15% larger than those in pp,
while those in Pb-Pb are 35-55% larger than those in p-Pb. Our measurements
disfavor models which incorporate substantially stronger collective expansion
in p-Pb as compared to pp collisions at similar multiplicity.

have been clearly observed in different experimental protocols. The memory
effect in the zero-field-cooled magnetization further establishes that the
glassy magnetic state arises from the co-operative spin-spin interaction but
not due to the independent relaxation of metastable phase clusters. The
asymmetric response with respect to negative and positive temperature change
favors the hierarchical model of memory effects rather than the droplet model
discussed in other works for different insulating and metallic Heisenberg spin

N2H+, HNCO, and CH3OH. Furthermore, 6 isotopologues of the major species have
been detected. On the other hand, SiO, HC3N, CH3CN, and the deuterated species

evaluated to be less than 0.8 % and 1.2 % for DCN/HCN and DCO+/HCO+,
respectively. By comparing the results of the two positions with different star
formation activities, we have found that the observed chemical compositions do
not strongly depend on star formation activities. They seem to reflect a
chemical composition averaged over the 1-kpc scale region including many giant
molecular clouds. Among the detected molecules CN, CCH, and CH3OH are found to
be abundant. High abundances of CN, and CCH are consistent with the above
picture of a wide spread distribution of molecules, because they can be
produced by photodissociation. On the other hand, it seems likely that CH3OH is
liberated into the gas phase by shocks associated with large scale phenomena
such as cloud-cloud collisions and/or by non-thermal desorption processes such
as photoevaporation due to cosmic-ray induced UV photons. The present result
demonstrates a characteristic chemical composition of a giant molecular cloud
complex in the spiral arm, which can be used as a standard reference for

graphene and separated by a long and highly doped region the Fano factor rises
up to 0.5 in contrast to the similar gapless structure where the Fano factor is
close to 0.25. Similarly to a gapless graphene superlattice, creation of each

in the Fano factor. However, gapped graphene inclusion into the

fluctuations of the metastable false vacuum, it can expand exponentially no
matter whether the bubble is closed, flat or open. The exponential expansion
will end when the bubble becomes large and thus the early universe appears.
With the de Broglie-Bohm quantum trajectory theory, we show explicitly that it
is the quantum potential that plays the role of the cosmological constant and
provides the power for the exponential expansion of the true vacuum bubble. So
it is clear that the birth of the early universe completely depends on the

  Society",,"10.1093/mnras/stu676",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Jets in low-luminosity radio galaxies are known to decelerate from
relativistic speeds on parsec scales to mildly or sub-relativistic speeds on
kiloparsec scales. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this
effect, including strong reconfinement shocks and the growth of instabilities
(both leading to boundary-layer entrainment) and mass loading from stellar
winds or molecular clouds. We have performed a series of axisymmetric
simulations of the early evolution of jets in a realistic ambient medium to
probe the effects of mass loading from stellar winds using the code Ratpenat.
We study the evolution of Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI) jets, with kinetic
powers L_j \sim 1.e41-1.e44 erg/s, within the first 2 kpc of their evolution,
where deceleration by stellar mass loading should be most effective. Mass
entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar mass loss in
elliptical galaxies produce deceleration and effective decollimation of weak
FRI jets within the first kiloparsec. However, powerful FRI jets are not
decelerated significantly. In those cases where the mass loading is important,
the jets show larger opening angles and decollimate at smaller distances, but
the overall structure and dynamics of the bow-shock are similar to those of
unloaded jets with the same power and thrust. According to our results, the
flaring observed on kpc scales is initiated by mass loading in the weaker FRI
jets and by reconfinement shocks or the growth of instabilities in the more
powerful jets. The final mechanism of decollimation and deceleration is always
the development of disruptive pinching modes.

galaxy as a result of tidal interaction with the Milky Way. The dwarf is
initially composed of a disk embedded in a dark matter halo and we follow its
evolution on a typical orbit for 10 Gyr. It undergoes an evolution typical of
tidally stirred dwarf galaxies: it loses mass, the stellar component transforms
from a disk to a spheroid and the rotation of the stars is partially replaced
by random motions. A tidally induced bar forms at the first pericentre passage
and survives until the end of the evolution. Fourier decomposition of the
distribution of stars reveals that only even modes are significant and preserve
a hierarchy so that the bar mode is always the strongest. They show a
characteristic profile with a maximum, similar to simulated bars forming in
isolated galaxies and observed bars in real galaxies. We adopt the maximum of
the bar mode as a measure of the bar strength and we estimate the bar length by
comparing the density profiles along the bar and perpendicular to it. Both the
bar strength and the bar length decrease with time, mainly at pericentres, as a
result of tidal torques acting at those times and not to secular evolution. The
pattern speed of the bar varies significantly on a time scale of 1 Gyr and
seems to be fully controlled by the orientation of the tidal torque from the
Milky Way. The bar is never tidally locked but we discover a hint of a 5/2
orbital resonance between the third and fourth pericentre passage. The speed of
the bar expressed in terms of the ratio of the bar length to the corotation
radius decreases in the long run so that the bar changes from initially rather
fast to slow in the later stages. The boxy/peanut shape is clearly visible in
the edge-on view between the second and third pericentre and its occurrence is
preceded by a short period of buckling instability.

persistence barcodes by first relating persistence values in dimension one to
distances (with respect to the supremum norm) to the sets of functions with a
given number of modes, and subsequently working with norms different from the
supremum norm. As a particular case we investigate the Kolmogorov norm. We
argue that this modification has certain statistical advantages. We offer
confidence bands for the attendant Kolmogorov signatures, thereby allowing for
the selection of relevant signatures with a statistically controllable error.
As a result of independent interest, we show that taut strings minimize the
number of critical points for a very general class of functions. We illustrate
our results by several numerical examples.

have not yet been identified, the capabilities of present and future cosmic-ray
detectors may allow their discovery. The method makes use of the geomagnetic
conversion of UHE photons (preshower effect), which significantly affects the
subsequent longitudinal shower development. The conversion probability depends
on photon energy and can be calculated accurately by QED. The comparison of the
observed fraction of converted photon events to the expected one allows the
determination of the absolute energy scale of the observed photon air showers
and, thus, an energy calibration of the air shower experiment. We provide
details of the method and estimate the accuracy that can be reached as a
function of the number of observed photon showers. Already a very small number
of UHE photons may help to test and fix the absolute energy scale.

spin-dependent atom-ion scattering length and on its motional state with
tunnelling rates reaching hundreds of Hz. A protocol is presented that could
transport an atom from one well to the other depending on the motional (Fock)
state of the ion within a few ms. This phonon-atom coupling is of interest for
creating atom-ion entangled states and may form a building block in
constructing a hybrid atom-ion quantum simulator. We also analyze the effect of
imperfect ground state cooling of the ion and the role of micromotion when the
ion is trapped in a Paul trap. Due to the strong non-linearities in the
atom-ion interaction, the micromotion can cause couplings to high energy
atom-ion scattering states, preventing accurate state preparation and
complicating the double-well dynamics. We conclude that the effects of
micromotion can be reduced by choosing ion/atom combinations with a large mass
ratio and by choosing large inter-well distances. The proposed double-well
system may be realised in an experiment by combining either optical traps or
magnetic microtraps for atoms with ion trapping technology.

relativistic flow, photon propagation is concentrated in the directions of the

scattering case, the number of scatterings is proportional to the size
parameter $\xi\equiv L/l_0$ if the flow velocity $\beta\equiv v/c$ satisfies
$\beta/\Gamma\gg \xi^{-1}$, while it is proportional to $\xi^2$ if
$\beta/\Gamma\ll \xi^{-1}$ where $L$ and $l_0$ are the size of the system in

We also examine the photon propagation in the scattering and absorptive medium.
We find that, if the optical depth for absorption $\tau_{\rm a}$ is
considerably smaller than the optical depth for scattering $\tau_{\rm s}$
($\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm s} \ll 1$) and the flow velocity satisfies $\beta\gg
\sqrt{2\tau_{\rm a}/\tau_{\rm s}}$, the effective optical depth is approximated

three-dimensional structure and their biological function, leading to strong
evolutionary constraints on the sequence variability between homologous
proteins. Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly
accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and
function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical
inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance
estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their
predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary
protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of
the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential
time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for
practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian
modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete
amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The
resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We
show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one
achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as
done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of
residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of
protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction. An

self-terminations phenomena. Due to its transparent mathematical structure, our
model provides a lucid understanding for how different physical parameters

the lasing action. Interestingly, our analysis also confirms that, for
frequency mismatched cavities, operation in the proximity of exceptional points
(without actually crossing the square root singularities) can still lead to
laser self-termination. We confirm this latter prediction for two coupled slab
cavities using scattering matrix analysis and SALT technique. In addition, we
employ our model to investigate the pump-controlled lasing action and we show
that emission patterns are governed by the locations of exceptional points in

consists of neutral gas with a negligible stellar contribution to the mass. We
are hence dealing with two different systems and the results are quite diverse

spherical obstacle, and emulates the pinching segment in pinched flow

decreases with increasing particle size. We then use the distance of closest

the one in which the minimum particle-obstacle separation is equal to the range
of the non-hydrodynamic interactions. The results further show that the initial

with particle size. We interpret the variation of the critical offset with
particle size as the basis for size-based microfluidic separation in pinched

the particle trajectories; we simulate a constant force driving the particles
in a quiescent fluid as well as a freely suspended particles in a
pressure-driven flow. We observe that the particles driven by a constant force
approach closer to the obstacle than those suspended in a flow (for the same
initial offset). On the other hand, the increment in the critical offset (as a
function of particle size) is larger in the pressure-driven case than in the
force-driven case. Thus, pressure-driven particle separation using pinched flow
fractionation would prove more effective than its force-driven counterpart.

general thermodynamical systems in the subleading canonical expansion
approximately. Our general result, $q = 1 - 1/C + \Delta T^2 / T^2$,
demonstrates how the heat capacity and the temperature fluctuation effects
compete, and cancel only in the standard Gaussian approximation.

logarithmic entropic functional ($S_{BG}$) is inadequate for wide classes of
strongly correlated systems: see for instance the 2001 Brukner and Zeilinger's
{\it Conceptual inadequacy of the Shannon information in quantum measurements},
among many other systems exhibiting various forms of complexity. On the other
hand, the Shannon and Khinchin axioms uniquely mandate the BG form
$S_{BG}=-k\sum_i p_i \ln p_i$; the Shore and Johnson axioms follow the same
path. Many natural, artificial and social systems have been satisfactorily
approached with nonadditive entropies such as the $S_q=k \frac{1-\sum_i
p_i^q}{q-1}$ one ($q \in {\cal R}; \,S_1=S_{BG}$), basis of nonextensive
statistical mechanics. Consistently, the Shannon 1948 and Khinchine 1953
uniqueness theorems have already been generalized in the literature, by Santos
1997 and Abe 2000 respectively, in order to uniquely mandate $S_q$. We argue
here that the same remains to be done with the Shore and Johnson 1980 axioms.
We arrive to this conclusion by analyzing specific classes of strongly
correlated complex systems that await such generalization.

is applicable to all variants of the hybridization expansion method. We show
that this so-called sliding window sampling scheme speeds up the simulation by
at least an order of magnitude for a broad range of model parameters, with the
largest improvements at low temperature.

roughly five years (2005--2010). We analyze these data using standard pulsar
timing models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure and
frequency-variable pulse shape terms. Within the timing data, we perform a
search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black
hole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and Bayesian
techniques. We find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectable
continuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the most
constraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves.
Using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averaged
strain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nHz.
Furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminosity
distance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_L \gtrsim 425$
Mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nHz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rm

pulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased by
a factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. Finally we place limits
on the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.

separate biological cells by fractionating different blood components. We
discuss the presence of two regimes, which can be distinguished depending on
the ratio between the settling velocity and the velocity of the particles

separative force fields in the direction normal to the plane of the cavities to

couplings arise for instance in models in which Higgs sector is extended by the
existence of additional Higgs bosons or by higher dimensional operators. We
emphasize the importance of anomalous single top plus Higgs production in these
scenarios, in addition to the more widely studied $t \to h j$ decays. By
recasting existing CMS searches in multilepton and diphoton plus lepton final
states, we show that bounds on $tuh$ couplings are improved by a factor of 1.5
when single top plus Higgs production is accounted for. We also recast the CMS
search for vector boson plus Higgs production into new, competitive constraints
on $tuh$ and $tch$ couplings, setting the limits of $BR(t\to hu) < 0.7%$ and
$BR(t\to hc) <1.2%$. We then investigate the sensitivity of future searches in
multilepton channel and in fully hadronic channel. In multilepton searches,
studying the lepton rapidity distributions and charge assignments can be used
to discriminate between $tuh$ couplings, for which anomalous single top
production is relevant, and $tch$ couplings, for which it is suppressed by the
parton distribution function of the charm quark. An analysis of fully hadronic
$t+h$ production and $t\to h j$ decay can be competitive with the multilepton
search at 100 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data if jet substructure techniques are
employed to reconstruct boosted top quarks and Higgs bosons. To show this we
develop a modified version of the HEPTopTagger algorithm, optimized for tagging
$t \to h j$ decays. Our sensitivity estimates on $BR(t\to hu)$ ($BR(t\to hc)$)

analyzing an exponentially-increasing number of paths in a control-flow graph
(CFG), and (b) checking feasibility of paths in a CFG. We address these
challenges by introducing an equivalence relation on the CFG paths to partition
them into equivalence classes. It is then sufficient to perform analysis on
these equivalence classes rather than on the individual paths in a CFG. This
technique has two major advantages: (a) although the number of paths in a CFG
can be exponentially large, the essential information to be analyzed is
captured by a small number of equivalence classes, and (b) checking path
feasibility becomes simpler. The key challenge is how to efficiently compute
equivalence classes of paths in a CFG without examining each path in the CFG?
In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm to form equivalence classes
without the need for examination of each path in a CFG. The key to this
algorithm is construction of an event-flow graph (EFG), a compact derivative of
the CFG, in which each path represents an equivalence class of paths in the
corresponding CFG. EFGs are defined with respect to the set of events that are
in turn defined by the analyzed property. The equivalence classes are thus
guaranteed to preserve all the event traces in the original CFG. We present an
empirical evaluation of the Linux kernel (v3.12). The EFGs in our evaluation
are defined with respect to events of the spin safe-synchronization property.
Evaluation results show that there are many fewer EFG-based equivalence classes
compared to the corresponding number of paths in a CFG. This reduction is close
to 99% for CFGs with a large number of paths. Moreover, our controlled
experiment results show that EFGs are human comprehensible and compact compared
to their corresponding CFGs.

of a publicly maintained data set that contains information about airports and
alternative connections between these airports, we empirically reveal that the
WAN is a redundant and resilient network for long distance air travel, but
otherwise breaks down completely due to removal of short and apparently
insignificant connections. These short range connections with moderate number
of passengers and alternate flights are the connections that keep remote parts
of the world accessible. It is surprising, insofar as there exists a highly
resilient and strongly connected core consisting of a small fraction of
airports (around 2.3%) together with an extremely fragile star-like periphery.
Yet, in spite of their relevance, more than 90% of the world airports are still

Schwarzschild space-time, we show that the Dirac--Schwarzschild problem has
bound states and calculate their energies including relativistic corrections.
Relativistic effects are shown to be suppressed by the gravitational
fine-structure constant alpha_G = G m_1 m_2/(hbar c), where G is Newton's
gravitational constant, c is the speed of light and m_1 and m_2 >> m_1 are the
masses of the two particles. The kinetic corrections due to space-time
curvature are shown to lift the familiar (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom. We supplement the discussion by a consideration of an
attractive scalar potential, which, in the fully relativistic Dirac formalism,
modifies the mass of the particle according to the replacement m -> m (1 -
\lambda/r), where r is the radial coordinate. We conclude with a few comments
regarding the (n,j) degeneracy of the energy levels, where n is the principal
quantum number, and j is the total angular momentum, and illustrate the
calculations by way of a numerical example.

non-objectivity of quantum observables which is a consequence of the absence of
logical atoms in QM. We argue that the matter of quantum non-objectivity is
that, on the one hand, the formalism of QM constructed as a mathematical theory
is self-consistent, but, on the other hand, quantum phenomena as results of
experimenter's performances are not self-consistent. This self-inconsistency is
an effect of that the language of QM differs much from the language of human
performances. The first is the language of a mathematical theory which uses
some Aristotelian and Russellian assumptions (e.g., the assumption that there
are logical atoms). The second language consists of performative propositions
which are self-inconsistent only from the viewpoint of conventional
mathematical theory, but they satisfy another logic which is non-Aristotelian.
Hence, the representation of quantum reality in linguistic terms may be
different: from a mathematical theory to a logic of performative propositions.
To solve quantum self-inconsistency, we apply the formalism of non-classical
self-referent logics.

model of common knowledge based on information representations of agents which
can be operationally represented by Hermitian operators. For simplicity, we
assume that each agent constructs her/his information representation by using
just one operator. However, different agents use in general representations
based on noncommuting operators, i.e., incompatible representations. The
quantum analog of basic system of common knowledge features ${\cal K}1-{\cal

double slit experiment performed with drops bouncing on a vibrated fluid
surface, where interference in the particle statistics is found even though it
is possible to determine unambiguously which slit the ""walking"" drop passes. It
is one of the first papers in an impressive series, showing that such walking
drops closely resemble de Broglie waves and can reproduce typical quantum
phenomena like tunneling and quantized states [2-13]. The double slit
experiment is, however, a more stringent test of quantum mechanics, because it
relies upon superposition and phase coherence. In the present comment we first
point out that the experimental data presented in [1] are not convincing, and
secondly we argue that it is not possible in general to capture quantum
mechanical results in a system, where the trajectory of the particle is
well-defined.

  Mechanics: Natural Science Beyond the Veil of Spacetime"", 9th Symposium in
  Honour of J.-P. Vigier, World Scientific, 2015",,"10.1142/9789814719063_0011",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vibrating string is a source of gravitational waves which requires novel
computational techniques, based on the explicit construction of a conserved and
renormalized (in a classical sense) energy-momentum tensor. The renormalization
is necessary to take into account the effect of external constraints, which
affect the emission considerably. Vibrating media offer in general a testing
ground for reconciling conflicts between General Relativity and other branches
of physics; however, constraints are absent in sources like the Weber bar, for
which the standard covariant formalism for elastic bodies can also be applied.
Our solution method is based on the linearized Einstein equations, but relaxes
other usual assumptions like far-field approximation, spherical or plane wave
symmetry, TT gauge and source without internal interference. The string
solution is then adapted to give the radiation field of a transversal Alfven
wave in a rarefied plasma, where the tension is produced by an external static
magnetic field. Like for the string, the field strength turns out to be
independent from the frequency. We give a preliminary example of a numerical
solution based on parameters referred to Alfven waves in the solar corona.
Further astrophysical applications require an extension of the solution
procedure to second order in the amplitude, and consideration of border
effects. Future work will also address numerical and analytical near-field
solutions.
