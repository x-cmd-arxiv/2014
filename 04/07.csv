These unique
properties often originate primarily from the quantum confinement of free
electrons in a potential well, while electron-electron interactions do not play
a decisive role. A recent experimental study shows that self-assembled Ir
nanowires grown on Ge(001) surface have a strong length preference: the
nanowire lengths are an integer multiple of 4.8 nm. In this paper, a free
electron-gas model for geometries corresponding to the nanowires is used to
analyze the selection of these preferred or magic lengths. The model shows that
the inclusion of even numbers of free electrons in an Ir nanowire corresponds
to these magic lengths once an electron spillage effect is taken into account.
The model also shows that the stability of the nanowire diminishes with its
increasing length, and consequently suggests why no long nanowires are observed
in experiments. It is also shown that applying generic results for quantum size
effects in a nanofilm geometry is not adequate to accurately describe the
length selection in the rather different nanowire geometry, where the
transverse dimensions smaller than the electron Fermi wavelength. Finally, the
monatomic Au chain growth on Ge(001) surface is also analyzed. In contrast to
Ir nanowires, the model shows that the stability of an Au chain strongly
depends on its electron spillage.

from N$_2$ and N$_2^+$ radiative states follow with different delays. These
different delays are caused by differences in the dynamics of populating the
radiative states, due to different excitation and quenching rates.}

  G1.9+0.3 and G330.2+1.0 with H.E.S.S","9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu459",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-thermal nature of the X-ray emission from the shell-type supernova
remnants (SNRs) G1.9+0.3 and G330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particle
acceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. This suggests that the SNRs
are prime candidates for very-high-energy (VHE; E $>$ 0.1 TeV) {\gamma}-ray
observations. G1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known SNR in the
Galaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of SNR
evolution in the VHE domain. The purpose of this work is to probe the level of
VHE {\gamma}-ray emission from both SNRs and use this to constrain their
physical properties. Observations were conducted with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy
Stereoscopic System) Cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year period
spanning 2004-2010. The obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h for
G1.9+0.3 and 16 h for G330.2+1.0. The data are analyzed in the context of the
multi-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of both
leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. No significant
{\gamma}-ray signal from G1.9+0.3 or G330.2+1.0 was detected. Upper limits (99%
confidence level) to the TeV flux from G1.9+0.3 and G330.2+1.0 for the assumed
spectral index {\Gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 TeV and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above
0.38 TeV, respectively. In a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limits
imply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to B$_{\mathrm{G1.9}}$
$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}G for G1.9+0.3 and to B$_{\mathrm{G330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}G
for G330.2+1.0. In a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the large
distances to the SNRs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which the
H.E.S.S. upper limits are not constraining.

As input our simplicial calculus needs only combinatorial data of the special

at a maximum speed of 500+-40 m/s, while the tail and coma were composed of a
wider range of dust particle sizes (0.4-570 micron) and expansion speeds 7-390

These values are much smaller than in the historic outburst of 17P/Holmes in

every Hermite and Laguerre multiplier sequence can be diagonalized into a sum
of hyperbolicity preserving operators, where each of the summands forms a
classical multiplier sequence. Interestingly, this does not work for other
orthogonal bases; for example, this property fails for the Legendre basis. We
establish many new formulas concerning the $Q_k$'s of Peetre's 1959
differential representation for linear operators in the specific case of
Hermite and Laguerre diagonal differential operators. Additionally, we provide
a new algebraic characterization of the Hermite multiplier sequences and also
extend a recent result of T. Forg\'acs and A. Piotrowski on hyperbolicity
properties of the polynomial coefficients in hyperbolicity preserving Hermite
diagonal differential operators.

for organic transistor applications due to the high electrical mobilities
attained by post-deposition crystallization using solvent vapour annealing. We
have studied thermal annealing as an alternative route to post-deposition
crystallization of TESADT films. Thermal annealing initially appears promising,
producing mm-sized crystal domains, but poor electrical performance is
obtained, which we attribute to a combination of crack formation and
potentially also structural transition during the anneal process. We also find
that illumination has a significant positive effect on crystallization,
possibly due to an optically-induced enhancement in molecular mobility during
annealing. This suggests further studies of how solvent exposure, heat,
substrate surface properties and particularly light exposure influence the
ordering kinetics of TESADT are warranted.

clamped and unzipped GO, are shown to have piezoelectric responses via
first-principles density functional calculations. By applying an electric field
perpendicular to the GO basal plane, the largest value of in-plane strain and
strain piezoelectric coefficient, d31 are found to be 0.12% and 0.24 pm/V,
respectively, which are comparable with those of some advanced piezoelectric
materials. An in-depth molecular structural analysis reveals that deformation
of the oxygen doping regions in the clamped GO dominates its overall strain
output, whereas deformation of the regions without oxygen dopant in the
unzipped GO determines its overall piezoelectric strain. This understanding
explains the observed dependence of d31 on oxygen doping rate, i.e., higher
oxygen concentration giving rise to a larger d31 in the clamped GO whereas
leading to a reduced d31 in the unzipped GO. As the thinnest two-dimensional
piezoelectric materials, GO has a great potential for a wide range of MEMS/NEMS

support for the second generation microkernels in the form of explicit support
of multi-pager environment for the tasks running in the system. Proposed
mechanism is based on the intra-kernel high granularity pagers assignments per
virtual address space, which allow efficient and simple dispatching of page
faults to the appropriate pagers. The paging is one of the major features of
the virtual memory, which is extensively used by advanced operating systems to
provide an illusion of elastic memory. Original and present second generation
microkernels provide only limited, inflexible and unnatural support for paging.
Furthermore, facilities provided by current solutions for multi-pager support
on the runtime level introduce an overhead in terms of mode switches and thread
context switches which can be significantly reduced. Limited paging support
limits the attractiveness of the second generation microkernel based systems
use in real-life applications, in which processes usually have concurrent
servicing of multiple paging servers. The purpose of this paper is to present a
facilities for the efficient and flexible support of multi-pager environments

the population change between the polarised extragalactic radio sources is the
origin of this inverse correlation and suggest a cosmic evolution of the space

that were resolved in our recent study to those of 288 inactive galaxies with
closely matched redshifts. Crucially, the lu- minosities of the inactive
galaxies and the quasar host galaxies are also closely matched, unlike in most
previous studies. The environmental overdensities were studied by measuring the
num- ber density of galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc to 1 Mpc.
The galaxy number density of the quasar environments is comparable to that of
the inactive galaxies with similar luminosities, both classes of ob- jects
showing significant excess compared to the background galaxy density for
distances < 400 kpc. There is no significant dependence of the galaxy number
density on redshift, quasar or host galaxy luminosity, black hole mass or radio
loudness. This suggests that the fueling and triggering of the nuclear activity
is only weakly dependent on the local environment of quasars, and the quasar
phase may be a short-lived common phase in the life cycle of all massive
galaxies.

problems in modern cosmology, with the search for new observational probes
guiding the development of the next generation of observational facilities.
Clues come from tension between the predictions from {\Lambda}CDM and
observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies. Previous studies showed that
galaxy clusters in the {\Lambda}CDM are not strong enough to reproduce the
observed number of lensed arcs. This work aims to constrain the warm dark
matter cosmologies by means of the lensing efficiency of galaxy clusters drawn
from these alternative models. The lensing characteristics of two samples of
simulated clusters in the warm dark matter ({\Lambda}WDM) and cold dark matter
({\Lambda}CDM) cosmologies have been studied. The results show that even though
the CDM clusters are more centrally concentrated and contain more
substructures, the WDM clusters have slightly higher lensing efficiency than
their CDM counterparts. The key difference is that WDM clusters have more
extended and more massive subhaloes than CDM analogues. These massive
substructures significantly stretch the critical lines and caustics and hence
they boost the lensing efficiency of the host halo. Despite the increase in the
lensing efficiency due to the contribution of massive substructures in the WDM
clusters, this is not enough to resolve the arc statistics problem.

the largest vibrationally excited H$_2$ column densities seen in UV absorption

items from the information era, has attracted an increasing attention from both
the scientific and application society. One of the widest applied
recommendation methods is the Matrix Factorization (MF). However, most of MF
based approaches focus on the user-item rating matrix, but ignoring the
ingredients which may have significant influence on users' preferences on
items. In this paper, we propose a multi-linear interactive MF algorithm
(MLIMF) to model the interactions between the users and each event associated
with their final decisions. Our model considers not only the user-item rating
information but also the pairwise interactions based on some empirically
supported factors. In addition, we compared the proposed model with three
typical other methods: user-based collaborative filtering (UCF), item-based
collaborative filtering (ICF) and regularized MF (RMF). Experimental results on
two real-world datasets, \emph{MovieLens} 1M and \emph{MovieLens} 100k, show
that our method performs much better than other three methods in the accuracy
of recommendation. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding
of modeling user online behaviors and the consequent decisions.

channels. In order to reduce the overhead to obtain full channel state
information and to avoid the pilot contamination problem, by treating the
scattered component as interference, we investigate a transmit and receive
conjugate beamforming (BF) transmission scheme only based on the line-of-sight
(LOS) component. Under Rank-1 model, we first consider a single-user system
with N transmit and M receive antennas, and focus on the problem of
power-scaling law when the transmit power is scaled down proportionally to
1/MN. It can be shown that as MN grows large, the scattered interference
vanishes, and the ergodic achievable rate is higher than that of the
corresponding BF scheme based fast fading and minimum mean-square error (MMSE)
channel estimation. Then we further consider uplink and downlink single-cell
scenarios where the base station (BS) has M antennas and each of K users has N
antennas. When the transmit power for each user is scaled down proportionally
to 1/MN, it can be shown for finite users that as M grows without bound, each
user obtains finally the same rate performance as in the single-user case. Even
when N grows without bound, however, there still remains inter-user LOS
interference that can not be cancelled. Regarding infinite users, there exists
such a power scaling law that when K and the b-th power of M go to infinity
with a fixed and finite ratio for a given b in (0, 1), not only inter-user LOS
interference but also fast fading effect can be cancelled, while fast fading
effect can not be cancelled if b=1. Extension to multi-cells and
frequency-selective channels are also discussed shortly. Moreover, numerical
results indicate that spacial antenna correlation does not have serious
influence on the rate performance, and the BS antennas may be allowed to be
placed compactly when M is very large.

bias field it becomes a semiconductor with a direct band gap that is
proportional to the applied field. Under a layer-asymmetric strain (where the
upper layer undergoes compression and lower layer tension or visa-versa) we
find that the band gap of a biased bilayer graphene ribbon becomes indirect
and, for higher strains, becomes negative returning the material its original
semimetal state. As a result, the conductivity of the ribbon increases and can
be almost an order of magnitude larger that of the intrinsic unbiased material
- a change that can be induced with a strain of only ~2-3%. The conductivity is
proportional to the applied strain and the magnitude of the effect is tunable
with the bias field. Such layer-asymmetric strains can be achieved by bending,
with forces on the order of ~1nN resulting in a layer-asymmetric strain of ~1%.
This new electromechanical effect has a wide potential for application in the
areas of nano-force microscopy and pressure sensing on the atomic scale.

networks with hardware-constrained secondary users (SUs). In particular, we
assume that SUs exploit spectrum holes on a set of channels where each SU can
use at most one available channel for communication. We present the optimal
brute-force search algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear integer
optimization problem and analyze its complexity. Because the optimal solution
has exponential complexity with the numbers of channels and SUs, we develop two
low-complexity channel assignment algorithms that can efficiently utilize the
spectrum holes. In the first algorithm, SUs are assigned distinct sets of
channels. We show that this algorithm achieves the maximum throughput limit if
the number of channels is sufficiently large. In addition, we propose an
overlapping channel assignment algorithm that can improve the throughput
performance compared with its nonoverlapping channel assignment counterpart.
Moreover, we design a distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol for
access contention resolution and integrate it into the overlapping channel
assignment algorithm. We then analyze the saturation throughput and the
complexity of the proposed channel assignment algorithms. We also present
several potential extensions, including the development of greedy channel
assignment algorithms under the max-min fairness criterion and throughput
analysis, considering sensing errors. Finally, numerical results are presented
to validate the developed theoretical results and illustrate the performance
gains due to the proposed channel assignment algorithms.

intensities observed independently with a muon detector at Nagoya in Japan and
neutron monitors over four solar activity cycles. We clearly see the phase of
the free-space diurnal anisotropy shifting toward earlier hours around solar
activity minima in A>0 epochs, due to the reduced anisotropy component parallel
to the mean magnetic field. The average parallel component is consistent with a
rigidity independent spectrum, while the perpendicular component increases with
GCR rigidity. We suggest that this harder spectrum of the perpendicular
component is due to contribution from the drift streaming. We find that the
bidirectional latitudinal density gradient is positive in A>0 epoch, while it
is negative in A<0 epoch, in accord with the drift model prediction. The radial
density gradient, on the other hand, varies with ~11-year cycle with maxima
(minima) in solar maximum (minimum) periods, but there is no significant
difference seen between average radial gradients in A>0 and A<0 epochs. The
average parallel mean free path is larger in A<0 than in A>0. We also find,
however, that parallel mean free path (radial gradient) appears to persistently
increase (decreasing) in the last three cycles of weakening solar activity. We
suggest that simple differences between these parameters in A>0 and A<0 epochs
are seriously biased by these long-term trends.

explored in the context of their uses for solving promise problems and with
respect to the size of automata. It is shown that for solving particular

very special structure, that succinctness of the exact quantum finite automata
under consideration, with respect to the number of (basis) states, can be very
small (and constant) though it grows proportional to $n$ in the case
deterministic finite automata (DFAs) of the same power are used. This is here
demonstrated also for the case that the component languages of the promise

rare event of the process being positive at large times. To characterize this
rare event, we identify a tilted measure. This presents some challenges
inherent to the power-law nature of the thinned Levy process. General
principles prescribe that the tilt should follow from a variational problem,
but in the case of the thinned Levy process this involves a Riemann sum that is
hard to control. We choose to approximate the Riemann sum by its limiting
integral, derive the first-order correction term, and prove that the tilt that
follows from the corresponding approximate variational problem is sufficient to
establish the large deviations results.

ferromagnetic order and a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect, %, very
likely involving magnetic polarons, is studied by high-resolution thermal
expansion and magnetostriction experiments. EuB$_6$ may be viewed as a model
system, where pure magnetism-tuned transport and the response of the crystal
lattice can be studied in a comparatively simple environment,i.e., not
influenced by strong crystal-electric field effects and Jahn-Teller
distortions. We find a very large lattice response, quantified by (i) the
magnetic Gr\""uneisen parameter, (ii) the spontaneous strain when entering the
ferromagnetic region and (iii) the magnetostriction in the paramagnetic
temperature regime. Our analysis reveals that a significant part of the lattice
effects originates in the magnetically-driven delocalization of charge
carriers, consistent with the scenario of percolating magnetic polarons. A
strong effect of the formation and dynamics of local magnetic clusters on the
lattice parameters is suggested to be a general feature of CMR materials.

irregular galaxies SextansA and SextansB, members of the NGC3109 association.
We use newly obtained deep (r~26.5) and wide field g,r photometry to extend the
Surface Brightness (SB) profiles of the two galaxies down to mu_V~ 31.0
mag/arcsec^2. We find that both galaxies are significantly more extended than
what previously traced with surface photometry, out to ~4 kpc from their
centers along their major axis. Older stars are found to have more extended
distribution with respect to younger populations. We obtain the first estimate
of the mean metallicity for the old stars in SexB, from the color distribution
of the Red Giant Branch, <[Fe/H]>=-1.6. The SB profiles show significant
changes of slope and cannot be fitted with a single Sersic model. Both galaxies
have HI discs as massive as their respective stellar components. In both cases
the HI discs display solid-body rotation with maximum amplitude of ~50 km/s
(albeit with significant uncertainty due to the poorly constrained
inclination), implying a dynamical mass ~10^{9}~M_sun, a mass-to-light ratio
M/L_V~25 and a dark-to-barionic mass ratio of ~10. The distribution of the
stellar components is more extended than the gaseous disc in both galaxies. We
find that the main, approximately round-shaped, stellar body of Sex~A is
surrounded by an elongated low-SB stellar halo that can be interpreted as a
tidal tail, similar to that found in another member of the same association
(Antlia). We discuss these, as well as other evidences of tidal disturbance, in
the framework of a past passage of the NGC3109 association close to the Milky
Way, that has been hypothesized by several authors and is also supported by the
recently discovered filamentary configuration of the association itself.

analytically show that the rescaled surface profiles for which $\sqrt{\mathcal

surface is essentially flat remains constant and equal to the Kelvin angle, and
the angle corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the waves scales as
$\sqrt{\mathcal W}/Fr$, thus showing that previous work on the wake's angle for
isotropic objects can be extended to anisotropic objects of given aspect ratio.
We then focus on the wave resistance and discuss its properties in the case of

background (CMB) B-mode polarization in various sky regions of several tens of
square degrees and obtained BB power spectra in the multipole range 20-3000,
detecting the components due to gravitational lensing and to inflationary
gravitational waves. We analyze jointly the results of these three experiments
and propose modifications of their analysis of the spectra to include in the
model, in addition to the gravitational lensing and the inflationary
gravitational waves components, also the effects induced by the cosmic
polarization rotation (CPR), if it exists within current upper limits. Although
in principle our analysis would lead also to new constraints on CPR, in
practice these can only be given on its fluctuations <{\delta}{\alpha}^2>,
since constraints on its mean angle are inhibited by the de-rotation which is
applied by current CMB polarization experiments, in order to cope with the
insufficient calibration of the polarization angle. The combined data fits from
all three experiments (with 29% CPR-SPTpol correlation, depending on
theoretical model) gives constraint <{\delta}{\alpha}^2>^1/2 < 27.3 mrad
(1.56{\deg}) with r = 0.194 \pm 0.033. These results show that the present data
are consistent with no CPR detection and the constraint on CPR fluctuation is
about 1.5{\deg}. This method of constraining the cosmic polarization rotation
is new, is complementary to previous tests, which use the radio and optical/UV
polarization of radio galaxies and the CMB E-mode polarization, and adds a new
constraint for the sky areas observed by SPTpol, POLARBEAR and BICEP2.

smallest $k \in \Bbb N$ is a tail vertex then all vertices $v_\ell, k< \ell <
j$ are tails of arcs to $v_j$ and finally, the degree of vertex $k$ is $d(v_k)
= ak.$ The family of finite directed graphs are those limited to $n \in \Bbb N$
vertices by lobbing off all vertices (and edges arcing to vertices)$v_t, t> n.$
Hence, trivially we have $d(v_i) \leq ai$ for $i \in \Bbb N.$ We present an
interesting Lucassian-Zeckendorf result and other general results of interest.
It is meant to be an introductory paper to encourage exploratory research.

relative merit on a quantitative level, we compare their vertical ionization
potentials (IPs) with those obtained from coupled-cluster calculations CCSD(T).
Our results are futher compared with ""one-shot"" $G_0W_0$ calculations starting
from Hartree-Fock solutions ($G_0W_0$-HF). Both self-consistent $GW$ approaches
behave quite similarly. Averaging over all the studied molecules, both methods
show only a small improvement (somewhat larger for SC$GW$) of the calculated
IPs with respect to $G_0W_0$-HF results. Interestingly, SC$GW$ and QS$GW$
calculations tend to deviate in opposite directions with respect to CCSD(T)
results. SC$GW$ systematically underestimates the IPs, while QS$GW$ tends to
overestimate them. $G_0W_0$-HF produces results which are surprisingly close to
QS$GW$ calculations both for the DOS and for the numerical values of the IPs.

  The starting point is the determination of good neighborhoods at infinity of

are related to ""boundary degenerations"" of $X$. The proof of their existence is
made by using wonderful compactifications.
  In this article we will show the existence of such neighborhoods assuming

of two different distributions proposed in the literature for the modelling of
data that have asymmetric and possibly long-tailed clusters. They are referred
to as the restricted and unrestricted skew t-distributions by Lee and McLachlan
(2013a). Firstly, we wish to point out that in Lee and McLachlan (2014b), which
preceded this comparison, it is shown how a distribution belonging to the
broader class, the canonical fundamental skew t (CFUST) class, can be fitted
with essentially no additional computational effort than for the unrestricted
distribution. The CFUST class includes the restricted and unrestricted
distributions as special cases. Thus the user now has the option of letting the
data decide as to which model is appropriate for their particular dataset.
Secondly, we wish to identify several statements in the comparison by Azzalini
et al.(2014) that demonstrate a serious misunderstanding of the reporting of
results in Lee and McLachlan (2014a) on the relative performance of these two
skew t-distributions. In particular, there is an apparent misunderstanding of
the nomenclature that has been adopted to distinguish between these two models.
Thirdly, we take the opportunity to report here that we have obtained improved
fits, in some cases a marked improvement, for the unrestricted model for
various cases corresponding to different combinations of the variables in the
two real datasets that were used in Azzalini et al. (2014) to mount their
claims on the relative superiority of the restricted and unrestricted models.
For one case the misclassification rate of our fit under the unrestricted model
is less than one third of their reported error rate. Our results thus reverse
their claims on the ranking of the restricted and unrestricted models in such
cases.

the presence of the lossy layer decreases the threshold gain; 2. For the more

is a function of $\eta$ that has a local minimum. The latter is in sharp

It is shown that such assemblies can produce coherent radiation. A method is
developed for solving the systems of nonlinear equations describing the
dynamics of such assemblies. The method is shown to be general and applicable
to systems of different physical nature. Despite mathematical similarities of
dynamical equations, the physics of the processes for quantum dots and magnetic
nanoclusters is rather different. In a quantum dot assembly, coherence develops
due to the Dicke effect of dot interactions through the common radiation field.
For a system of magnetic clusters, coherence in the spin motion appears due to
the Purcell effect caused by the feedback action of a resonator. Self-organized
coherent spin radiation cannot arise without a resonator. This principal
difference is connected with the different physical nature of dipole forces
between the objects. Effective dipole interactions between the radiating
quantum dots, appearing due to photon exchange, collectivize the dot radiation.
While the dipolar spin interactions exist from the beginning, yet before
radiation, and on the contrary, they dephase spin motion, thus destroying the
coherence of moving spins. In addition, quantum dot radiation exhibits
turbulent photon filamentation that is absent for radiating spins.

used in science and engineering. Cooley and Tukey's Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) from 1964 is a method for computing this transformation in time $O(n\log
n)$. Achieving a matching lower bound in a reasonable computational model is
one of the most important open problems in theoretical computer science.
  In 2014, improving on his previous work, Ailon showed that if an algorithm
speeds up the FFT by a factor of $b=b(n)\geq 1$, then it must rely on
computing, as an intermediate ""bottleneck"" step, a linear mapping of the input
with condition number $\Omega(b(n))$. Our main result shows that a factor $b$
speedup implies existence of not just one but $\Omega(n)$ $b$-ill conditioned
bottlenecks occurring at $\Omega(n)$ different steps, each causing information
from independent (orthogonal) components of the input to either overflow or
underflow. This provides further evidence that beating FFT is hard. Our result
also gives the first quantitative tradeoff between computation speed and
information loss in Fourier computation on fixed word size architectures. The
main technical result is an entropy analysis of the Fourier transform under
transformations of low trace, which is interesting in its own right.

in the proximity of a superconductor. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a

Moreover, a magnetic flux is applied through the center of the ring, which
makes the phase difference of the superconducting order parameters in the two
wires being zero or $\pi$ due to the fluxoid quantization and the thermodynamic
equilibrium of the supercurrent in the superconducting ring. If the phase
difference is $\pi$, two Majorana modes are shown to appear around the ring
without interacting with each other. On contrast, if the phase difference is
zero, these Majorana modes disappear and the states localized around the ring
have finite energies. These states can be detected via the conductance
measurement by connecting two normal leads to the wires and a third one
directly to the ring. It is shown in the bias dependence of the differential
conductance from one of the leads connected to the wire to the one connected
directly to the ring that the tunnelings through the Majorana modes (i.e., in
the case with $\pi$ phase difference) leads to two peaks very close to the zero
bias, while the tunneling through the states with finite energies (i.e., in the
case with zero phase difference) leads to peaks far away from the zero bias if
the ring radius is small. This difference for the cases with and without the
Majorana modes in small ring radius is distinct and hence can be used to
identify the Majorana modes....

`$\mathrm{ND(1)}$ property', which provides a suitable ground where one can
generalize the concepts such as `being nondegenerate' or `of minimal degree'
from the case of varieties to the case of more general closed subschemes and
give a clear interpretation on the tailing Betti numbers. Next, we recall basic
notions and facts on Gins theory and we analyze the generation structure of the
reverse lexicographic (rlex) Gins of 3-regular $\mathrm{ND(1)}$ subschemes. As
a result, we present exact formulae for these tailing Betti numbers, which
connect them with linear normality of general linear sections of $X\cap

values for certain free parameters in gauged supergravity, there exist a large
class of solutions that satisfy conditions for the attractor mechanism to hold.
We investigate the response of the solution against linearized fluctuations of
the scalar field. The sufficient conditions for the attractor mechanism ensure
that there exist a solution for the scalar fluctuation which dies out at the
horizon. Furthermore, we solve for the gauge field and metric fluctuations that
are sourced by scalar fluctuations and show that they are well behaved near the
horizon. Thus, we have an example of a stable Bianchi attractor in gauged

supergravity in the background of our solution. We find that a radial Killing
spinor consistent with the Bianchi III symmetry breaks supersymmetry.

linear and nonlinear dynamics of particles moving along an accelerator
beamline. An accurate model of an accelerator must include realistic models of
the magnet fringe fields. Fringe fields for dipoles are well understood and can
be modelled at an early stage of accelerator design in such codes as MAD8, MADX
or ELEGANT. However, usually it is not until the final stages of a design
project that it is possible to model fringe fields for quadrupoles or higher
order multipoles. Even then, existing techniques rely on the use of a numerical
field map, which will usually not be available until the magnet design is well
developed. Substitutes for the full field map exist but these are typically
based on expansions about the origin and rely heavily on the assumption that
the beam travels more or less on axis throughout the beam line. In some types
of machine (for example, a non-scaling FFAG such as EMMA) this is not a good
assumption.
  In this paper, a method for calculating fringe fields based on analytical
expressions is presented, which allows fringe field effects to be included at
the start of an accelerator design project. The magnetostatic Maxwell equations
are solved analytically and a solution that fits all orders of multipoles
derived. Quadrupole fringe fields are considered in detail as these are the
ones that give the strongest effects. Two examples of quadrupole fringe fields
are presented. The first example is a magnet in the LHC inner triplet, which
consists of a set of four quadrupoles providing the final focus to the beam,
just before the interaction point. Quadrupoles in EMMA provide the second
example. In both examples, the analytical expressions derived in this paper for
quadrupole fringe fields provide a good approximation to the field maps
obtained from a numerical magnet modelling code.

the control variable, which is given by the velocity of the motion occurring in
the convective term, is nonlinearly coupled to the state variable. The latter
fact makes it necessary to state rather special regularity assumptions for the
admissible controls, which, while looking a bit nonstandard, are however quite
natural in the corresponding analytical framework. In fact, they are
indispensable prerequisites to guarantee the well-posedness of the associated

occur in various places in the literature on computational optics. In a number
of cases, the expansion of these derivatives and Laplacians in the circle
polynomials are required. For the first-order partial derivatives, analytic
results are scattered in the literature, starting as early as 1942 in Nijboer's
thesis and continuing until present day, with some emphasis on recursive
computation schemes. A brief historic account of these results is given in the
present paper. By choosing the unnormalized version of the circle polynomials,
with exponential rather than trigonometric azimuthal dependence, and by a
proper combination of the two partial derivatives, a concise form of the series
expressions emerges. This form is appropriate for the formulation and solution
of a model wave-front sensing problem of reconstructing a wave-front on the
level of its expansion coefficients from (measurements of the expansion
coefficients of) the partial derivatives. It turns out that the least-squares
estimation problem arising here decouples per azimuthal order $m$, and per $m$
the generalized inverse solution assumes a concise analytic form, thereby
avoiding SVD-decompositions. The preferred version of the circle polynomials,
with proper combination of the partial derivatives, also leads to a concise
analytic result for the Zernike expansion of the Laplacian of the circle
polynomials. From these expansions, the properties of the Laplacian as a
mapping from the space of circle polynomials of maximal degree $N$, as required
in the study of the Neumann problem associated with the Transport-of-Intensity
equation, can be read off within a single glance. Furthermore, the inverse of
the Laplacian on this space is shown to have a concise analytic form.

the FEAST algorithm to non-Hermitian problems. The approach can be summarized

technique to extract desired eigenpairs with appropriately chosen test

wavelengths from 1.6 um to 2 um. Theses pulses were used as a proof of
principle for high harmonic generation in atomic and molecular targets. In
order to generate such pulses we produced a filament in a 4 bar krypton cell.
Spectral broadening by a factor of 2 to 3 of a 40 fs near infrared input pulse
was achieved. The spectrally broadened output pulses were then compressed by
fused silica plates down to the few-cycle regime close to the Fourier limit.
The auto-correlation of these pulses revealed durations of about 3 cycles for
all investigated central wavelengths. Pulses with a central wavelength of 1.7
um and up to 430 uJ energy per pulse were employed to generate high order
harmonics in Xe, Ar and N2. Moving to near infrared few-cycle pulses opens the
possibility to operate deeply in the non-perturbative regime with a Keldysh
parameter smaller than 1. Hence, this source is suitable for the study of the
non-adiabatic tunneling regime in most generating systems used for high order
harmonic generation and attoscience.

comparisons. However, lack of balance is common in observational studies. This
article considers weighting strategies for balancing covariates. We define a
general class of weights---the balancing weights---that balance the weighted
distributions of the covariates between treatment groups. These weights
incorporate the propensity score to weight each group to an analyst-selected
target population. This class unifies existing weighting methods, including
commonly used weights such as inverse-probability weights as special cases.
General large-sample results on nonparametric estimation based on these weights
are derived. We further propose a new weighting scheme, the overlap weights, in
which each unit's weight is proportional to the probability of that unit being
assigned to the opposite group. The overlap weights are bounded, and minimize
the asymptotic variance of the weighted average treatment effect among the
class of balancing weights. The overlap weights also possess a desirable
small-sample exact balance property, based on which we propose a new method
that achieves exact balance for means of any selected set of covariates. Two
applications illustrate these methods and compare them with other approaches.

tunneling and find dimerized Mott insulator phases with fractional filling.
These incompressible insulating phases are characterized by an
interaction-driven localization of particles in respect to the individual
dimers and large local particle-number fluctuations within the dimers. We
calculate the ground-state phase diagrams and the excitation spectra using an
accurate cluster mean-field method. The cluster treatment enables us to probe
the fundamental excitations of the dimerized Mott insulator where the
excitation gap is dominated by the intra-dimer tunneling amplitude. This allows
the distinction from normal Mott insulating phases gapped by the on-site
interaction. In addition, we present analytical results for the phase diagram
derived by a higher-order strong-coupling perturbative expansion approach. By
computing finite lattices with large diameters the influence of a harmonic
confinement is discussed in detail. It is shown that a large fraction of atoms
forms the dimerized Mott insulator under experimental conditions. The necessary
anisotropic tunneling can be realized either by periodic driving of the optical
lattice or by engineering directly a dimerized lattice potential. The dimers
can be mapped to to their antisymmetric states creating a lattice with coupled
p-orbitals.

incompatible with cosmological data if the sterile neutrino is fully

thermalises it can be compatible with all current data, both cosmological and

flux-correlation function of the Ly{\alpha} forest of high-redshift quasars
with a statistical significance of five standard deviations. The study uses
137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the Data Release
11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of SDSS-III.
This sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous
studies. The measured position of the BAO peak determines the angular distance,
$D_A(z=2.34)$ and expansion rate, $H(z=2.34)$, both on a scale set by the sound
horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$. We find
$D_A/r_d=11.28\pm0.65(1\sigma)^{+2.8}_{-1.2}(2\sigma)$ and
$D_H/r_d=9.18\pm0.28(1\sigma)\pm0.6(2\sigma)$ where $D_H=c/H$. The optimal
combination, $\sim D_H^{0.7}D_A^{0.3}/r_d$ is determined with a precision of
$\sim2\%$. For the value $r_d=147.4~{\rm Mpc}$, consistent with the CMB power
spectrum measured by Planck, we find $D_A(z=2.34)=1662\pm96(1\sigma)~{\rm Mpc}$
and $H(z=2.34)=222\pm7(1\sigma)~{\rm km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$. Tests with mock
catalogs and variations of our analysis procedure have revealed no systematic
uncertainties comparable to our statistical errors. Our results agree with the
previously reported BAO measurement at the same redshift using the
quasar-Ly{\alpha} forest cross-correlation. The auto-correlation and
cross-correlation approaches are complementary because of the quite different
impact of redshift-space distortion on the two measurements. The combined
constraints from the two correlation functions imply values of $D_A/r_d$ and
$D_H/r_d$ that are, respectively, 7% low and 7% high compared to the
predictions of a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with the best-fit Planck
parameters. With our estimated statistical errors, the significance of this
discrepancy is $\approx 2.5\sigma$.

algorithms, called AM-QFT algorithms, that contains the improved QFT (Quick

main idea is to apply the Amplitude Modulation Double Sideband - Suppressed
Carrier (AM DSB-SC) to convert odd-indices signals into even-indices signals,
and to insert this elaboration into the improved QFT algorithm, substituting
the multiplication by secant function. The 8 variants of this class are
obtained by re-elaboration of the AM DSB-SC idea, and by means of duality. As a
result the 8 variants have both the same computational cost and the same memory
requirements than improved QFT. Differently, comparing this class of 8 variants
of AM-QFT algorithm with the split-radix 3add/3mul (one of the most performing
FFT approach appeared in the literature), we obtain the same number of
additions and multiplications, but employing half of the trigonometric
constants. This makes the proposed FFT algorithms interesting and useful for
fixed-point implementations. Some of these variants show advantages versus the
improved QFT. In fact one of this variant slightly enhances the numerical
accuracy of improved QFT, while other four variants use trigonometric constants
that are faster to compute in `on the fly' implementations.

studies to a wider range of parameter space, in a more systematic fashion.
Though the interaction we introduced seems simple and intuitive, it produced
dramatically different behavior in the single- and two-network systems.
Specifically, partitioning the single network into two identical sectors, we
find the cross-link distribution to be a sharply peaked Gaussian. In stark
contrast, we find a very broad and flat plateau in the case of two interacting
identical networks. A sound understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive.
Exploring more asymmetric interacting networks, we discover a kind of
`universal behavior' for systems in which the `introverts' (nodes with smaller
preferred degree) are far outnumbered. Remarkably, an approximation scheme for
their degree distribution can be formulated, leading to very successful
predictions.

Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared (IR) photometry and spectroscopy have
provided a valuable dataset for the study of debris discs gas and dust

Herschel PACS observations of young stellar associations.
  Aims. This work aims at studying the properties of discs in the Beta Pictoris
Moving Group (BPMG) through far-IR PACS observations of dust and gas.
  Methods. We obtained Herschel-PACS far-IR photometric observations at 70, 100
and 160 microns of 19 BPMG members, together with spectroscopic observations of
four of them. Spectroscopic observations were centred at 63.18 microns and 157
microns, aiming to detect [OI] and [CII] emission. We incorporated the new
far-IR observations in the SED of BPMG members and fitted modified blackbody
models to better characterise the dust content.
  Results. We have detected far-IR excess emission toward nine BPMG members,
including the first detection of an IR excess toward HD 29391.The star HD
172555, shows [OI] emission, while HD 181296, shows [CII] emission, expanding
the short list of debris discs with a gas detection. No debris disc in BPMG is
detected in both [OI] and [CII]. The discs show dust temperatures in the range
55 to 264 K, with low dust masses (6.6*10^{-5} MEarth to 0.2 MEarth) and radii
from blackbody models in the range 3 to 82 AU. All the objects with a gas
detection are early spectral type stars with a hot dust component.

particle pairs or between particles and an external container wall. The Stokes'
drag leads to particle motion that is periodic with the driving force, even at

around. By reducing the density of the material we go through another
transition to a ""non-interacting"" absorbing state, where particles
independently follow the force-induced oscillations without collisions. In the

a discontinuous phase transition. It is accompanied by a diverging relaxation
time, but not by a vanishing order parameter, which rather jumps to zero at the

service (QoS) for secure communication to multiple single-antenna information
receivers. In particular, the algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex
optimization problem which takes into account a minimum required
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the information
receivers and a constraint on the maximum tolerable channel capacity achieved
by the energy harvesting receivers for a given transmit power budget. The
proposed problem formulation exploits the dual use of artificial noise
generation for facilitating efficient wireless energy transfer and secure
communication. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is
exploited to obtain a global optimal solution of the considered problem.
Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain in harvested
energy that is achieved by the proposed optimal scheme compared to two simple
baseline schemes.

tensor-to-scalar ratio $r > 0.1$ requires inflaton field values close to or
above the Planck scale. Recently, it has been claimed that $r > 0.15$ can be
achieved with much smaller inflaton field values $\Delta \phi < M_{Pl}/10$. We
show that in single-field slow-roll inflation, it is impossible to reconcile $r
> 0.1$ with such small field values, independently of the form of the
potential, and that the recent claim to the contrary is based on an invalid
approximation. We conclude that the result of the BICEP2 measurement of $r >

single-field slow-roll inflation.

absorbers. They consist of periodic arrays of alternating metal/dielectric
layers forming truncated square-based pyramids. The metallic layers of
increasing lengths play the role of vertically and, to a less extent, laterally
coupled plasmonic resonators. Based on detailed numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that plasmon hybridization between such resonators helps in
achieving ultra-broadband absorption. The dipolar modes of individual
resonators are shown to be prominent in the electromagnetic coupling mechanism.
Lateral coupling between adjacent pyramids and vertical coupling between
alternating layers are proven to be key parameters for tuning of plasmon
hybridization. Following optimization, the operational bandwidth of Au/Ge
pyramids, i.e. the bandwidth within which absorption is higher than 90%,
extends over a 0.2-5.8 micrometers wavelength range, i.e. from UV-visible to
mid-infrared, and total absorption (integrated over the operational bandwidth)
amounts to 98.0%. The omni-directional and polarization-independent
high-absorption properties of the device are verified. Moreover, we show that
the choice of the dielectric layer material (Si versus Ge) is not critical for
achieving ultra-broadband characteristics, which confers versatility for both
design and fabrication. Realistic fabrication scenarios are briefly discussed.
This plasmon hybridization route could be useful in developing photothermal
devices, thermal emitters or shielding devices that dissimulate objects from
near infrared detectors.

Toward this end, we analyze the complexity of the optimal brute-force search

in performance evaluation of power-saving data centers. In a data center, there
are a huge number of servers which consume a large amount of energy. In the
current technology, an idle server still consumes about 60\% of its peak
processing a job. Thus, the only way to save energy is to turn off servers
which are not processing a job. However, when there are some waiting jobs, we
have to turn on the OFF servers. A server needs some setup time to be active
during which it consumes energy but cannot process a job. Therefore, there
exists a trade-off between power consumption and delay performance. Gandhi et
al. \cite{Gandhi10a,Gandhi10} analyze this trade-off using an M/M/$c$ queue
with staggered setup (one server in setup at a time). In this paper, using an
alternative approach, we obtain generating functions for the joint stationary
distribution of the number of active servers and that of jobs in the system for
a more general model with batch arrivals and state-dependent setup time. We
further obtain moments for the queue size. Numerical results reveal that
keeping the same traffic intensity, the mean power consumption decreases with
the mean batch size for the case of fixed batch size. One of the main
theoretical contribution is a new conditional decomposition formula showing
that the number of waiting customers under the condition that all servers are
busy can be decomposed to the sum of two independent random variables where the
first is the same quantity in the corresponding model without setup time while
the second is the number of waiting customers before an arbitrary customer.

neurotmesis as connecting or functional recovery channel. Such material owns a
group of unique merits in many aspects, such as favorable fluidity, super
compliance, high electrical conductivity, which are rather beneficial for
conducting the excited signal of nerve during the regeneration process in vivo.
It was found that the measured electroneurographic signal from the transected
bullfrog sciatic nerve reconnected by the liquid metal after the electrical
stimulation was close to that from the intact sciatic nerve. The control
experiments through replacement of GaInSn with the conventionally used Riger
Solution revealed that Riger Solution could not be competitive with the liquid
metal in the performance as functional recovery channel. In addition, through
evaluation of the basic electrical property, the material GaInSn works more
suitable for the conduction of the weak electroneurographic signal as its
impedance was several orders lower than that of the well-known Riger Solution.
Further, the visibility under the plain radiograph of such material revealed
the high convenience in performing secondary surgery. This new generation nerve
connecting material is expected to be important for the functional recovery
during regeneration of the injured peripheral nerve and the optimization of
neurosurgery in the near future.
