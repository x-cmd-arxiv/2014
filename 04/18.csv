  Yang-Mills Theory","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  De Sitter Quantum Gravity is a Yang-Mills theory based on the de Sitter or
SO(4,1) group and a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. In
this paper, an exact, static, spherically symmetric solution of the classical
equations is derived. I show that when the Schwarzchild radius to distance
ratio is at post-Newtonian order the theory agrees with general relativity for
all parameters but that, once the ratio becomes closer to unity, they differ.
At the Schwarzchild radius from a black hole singularity, general relativity
predicts an event horizon, which has become a controversial topic in quantum
gravity because of information preservation issues. In the De Sitter theory I
show, however, that time-like escape paths exist for any mass black hole until
the singularity itself is reached. Since an event horizon has never been
directly observed and there is currently no observation on which the two
theories disagree, this provides a powerful test of the De Sitter theory.

the possibility of using the 1548\AA\ transition of triply ionized carbon (C
IV) as a tracer. While the Ly-alpha forest is a more sensitive tracer of
intergalactic gas, it is limited by the fact that it can only be measured in
the optical window at redshifts $z > 2$. Quasars are challenging to identify
and observe at these high-redshifts, but the C IV forest can be probed down to
redshifts $z \approx 1.3$, taking full advantage of the peak in the redshift
distribution of quasars that can be targeted with high efficiency.
  I explore the strength of the C IV absorption signal and show that the
absorbing population on the red side of the Ly-alpha emission line is dominated
by C IV (and so will dominate over the potential BAO signal of other metals).
As a consequence, I argue that forthcoming surveys may have a sufficient
increase in quasar number density to offset the lower sensitivity of the C IV
forest and provide competitive precision using both the C IV autocorrelation
and the C IV-quasar cross-correlation at $< z > \approx 1.6$.

in graphs, is defined as the minimum over all cuts in the hypergraph of the
ratio of the number of the hyperedges cut to the size of the smaller side of

parameter $\delta \in (0,1/2]$, asks to compute the cut having the least
expansion while having at most $\delta$ fraction of the vertices on the smaller
side of the cut. We present two algorithms. Our first algorithm gives an
$\tilde O(\delta^{-1} \sqrt{\log n})$ approximation. The second algorithm finds
a set with expansion $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}(\sqrt{d_{\text{max}}r^{-1}\log r\,
\phi^*} + \phi^*))$ in a $r$--uniform hypergraph with maximum degree
$d_{\text{max}}$ (where $\phi^*$ is the expansion of the optimal solution).
Using these results, we also obtain algorithms for the Small Set Vertex
Expansion problem: we get an $\tilde O(\delta^{-1} \sqrt{\log n})$
approximation algorithm and an algorithm that finds a set with vertex expansion
$O\left(\delta^{-1}\sqrt{\phi^V \log d_{\text{max}} } + \delta^{-1}

  For $\delta=1/2$, Hypergraph Small Set Expansion is equivalent to the

significantly extended the spectral coverage of GRB observations and improved
the characterization of this spectral evolution. We study how internal shocks
can reproduce these observations. In this model the emission comes from the
synchrotron radiation of shock accelerated electrons, and the spectral
evolution is governed by the evolution of the physical conditions in the
shocked regions. We present a comprehensive set of simulations of a single
pulse and investigate the impact of the model parameters, related to the shock
microphysics and to the initial conditions in the ejecta.
  We find a general qualitative agreement between the model and the various
observations used for the comparison. All these properties or relations are
governed by the evolution of the peak energy and photon indices of the
spectrum. In addition, we identify the conditions for a quantitative agreement.
We find that the best agreement is obtained for (i) steep electron slopes
(p>~2.7), (ii) microphysics parameters varying with shock conditions so that
more electrons are accelerated in stronger shocks, (iii) steep variations of
the initial Lorentz factor in the ejecta. When simulating short GRBs by
contracting all timescales, all other parameters being unchanged, we show that
the hardness-duration correlation is reproduced, as well as the evolution with
duration of the pulse properties. Finally, we investigate the signature at high

internal shocks could have a significant contribution to the prompt LAT

studied numerically.The plate moves with velocity $at^p$, where $p=0,0.5,1,2$.
We present the evolution of vorticity profiles, streaklines and streamlines,
and study the dependence on the acceleration parameter $p$. Four stages in the
vortex evolution, as proposed by Luchini & Tognaccini (2002), are clearly
identified. The initial stage, in which the vorticity consists solely of a
Rayleigh boundary layer, is shown to last for a time-interval whose length
shrinks to zero like $p^3$, as $p \to 0$. In the second stage, a center of
rotation develops near the tip of the plate, well before a vorticity maximum
within the vortex core develops. Once the vorticity maximum develops, its
position oscillates and differs from the center of rotation. The difference
between the two increases with increasing $p$, and decreases in time. In the
third stage, the center of rotation and the shed circulation closely satisfy
self-similar scaling laws for inviscid flow. Finally, in the fourth stage, the
finite plate length becomes relevant and the flow begins to depart from the
self-similar behaviour. While the core trajectory and circulation closely
satisfy inviscid scaling laws, the vorticity maximum and the boundary layer
thickness follow viscous scaling laws. The results are compared with
experimental results of Pullin & Perry (1980), and Taneda & Honji (1971), where

only can account for covariance-related serial dependencies, and they require
second-order stationarity. Much attention has been devoted lately to
quantile-based spectral methods that go beyond covariance-based serial
dependence features. At the same time, covariance-based methods relaxing
stationarity into much weaker {\it local stationarity} conditions have been
developed for a variety of time-series models. Here, we are combining those two
approaches by proposing quantile-based spectral methods for locally stationary
processes. We therefore introduce a time-varying version of the copula spectra
that have been recently proposed in the literature, along with a suitable local
lag-window estimator. We propose a new definition of local {\it strict}
stationarity that allows us to handle completely general non-linear processes
without any moment assumptions, thus accommodating our quantile-based concepts
and methods. We establish a central limit theorem for the new estimators, and
illustrate the power of the proposed methodology by means of a simulation
study. Moreover, in two empirical studies (namely of the Standard \& Poor's 500
series and a temperature dataset recorded in Hohenpeissenberg) we demonstrate
that the new approach detects important variations in serial dependence
structures both across time and across quantiles. Such variations remain
completely undetected, and are actually undetectable, via classical
covariance-based spectral methods.

by an angular momentum coupling is examined. Such system arises when
considering a particle in a rotating anisotropic harmonic trap or a charged
particle in a fixed harmonic potential in a magnetic field, and exhibits a rich
dynamical structure, with stable, unstable and critical regimes according to
the values of the rotational frequency or field and trap parameters.
Consequently, it is shown that the entanglement generated from an initially
separable gaussian state can exhibit quite distinct evolutions, ranging from
quasiperiodic behavior in stable sectors to different types of unbounded
increase in critical and unstable regions. The latter lead respectively to a
logarithmic and linear growth of the entanglement entropy with time. It is also
shown that entanglement can be controlled by tuning the frequency, such that it
can be increased, kept constant or returned to a vanishing value just with
stepwise frequency variations. Exact asymptotic expressions for the
entanglement entropy in the different dynamical regimes are provided.

$\left(n,\ell,\gamma\right)$-sharing set families have a rich set of

These results are competitive with the inexplicit construction of Raz et al for

used to obtain a parallelizable pseudorandom number generator with a low memory

also prove that $m\left(n,n/c_1,c_2n\right)$ must be a constant whenever $c_2

consider analytically how a drifting ion species (e.g. He$^{++}$) affects the
linear slow mode wave in a mainly electron-proton plasma, with potential
consequences for the aforementioned applications. Our main conclusions are: 1.
For wavevectors highly oblique to the magnetic field, we find solutions that
are characterized by very small perturbations of total pressure. Thus, our
results may help to distinguish the MHD slow mode from kinetic Alfv\'en waves
and non-propagating pressure-balanced structures, which can also have very
small total pressure perturbations. 2. For small ion concentrations, there are
solutions that are similar to the usual slow mode in an electron-proton plasma,
and solutions that are dominated by the drifting ions, but for small drifts the
wave modes cannot be simply characterized. 3. Even with zero ion drift, the
standard dispersion relation for the highly oblique slow mode cannot be used
with the Alfv\'en speed computed using the summed proton and ion densities, and
with the sound speed computed from the summed pressures and densities of all
species. 4. The ions can drive a non-resonant instability under certain
circumstances. For low plasma beta, the threshold drift can be less than that
required to destabilize electromagnetic modes, but damping from the Landau
resonance can eliminate this instability altogether, unless $T_{\mathrm
e}/T_{\mathrm p}\gg1$.

growing body of near-infrared spectra of $z>7$ galaxies in order to take into
account these host galaxy dependencies. In a first application of our new
method, we demonstrate its potential via a new spectroscopic survey of $7<z<8$
galaxies undertaken with the Keck MOSFIRE spectrograph. Together with earlier
published data our data provides improved estimates of the evolving visibility
of Lyman alpha, particularly at redshift $z\simeq 8$. As a byproduct, we also
present a new line emitting galaxy at a redshift $z=7.62$ which supersedes an
earlier redshift record. We discuss the improving constraints on the evolving
neutral fraction over $6<z<8$ and the implications for cosmic reionization.

extensive near-infrared monitoring survey of an unbiased sample of 69 brown

and the median photometric precision of the data is ~0.7%. A total of 14 brown
dwarfs were identified as variables with min-to-max amplitudes ranging from
1.7% to 10.8% over the observed duration. All variables satisfy a statistical
significance threshold with a p-value <5% based on comparison with the median
reference star light curve. Approximately half of the variables show sinusoidal
amplitude variations similar to 2M2139, and the remainder shows short timescale
evolving light curves similar to SIMP0136. The L/T transition has been
suggested to be a region of a higher degree of variability if patchy clouds are
present and this survey was designed to test the patchy cloud model with
photometric monitoring of both the L/T transition and non-transition brown
dwarfs. Considering the targets identified as variable with the same
statistical threshold, the measured variability frequency of 13^{+10}_{-4}% for
the L7 -- T4 transition region is indistinguishable from that of the earlier
spectral types (32^{+11}_{-8}%), the later spectral types (13^{+10}_{-4}%), or
the combination of all non-transition region brown dwarfs (21^{+7}_{-5}%). The
variables are not concentrated at the transition, in a specific colour, or with
binaries. We note that of the systems previously monitored for variability only
~60% maintained the state of variability (variable or constant), with the
remaining switching states. The 14 variables include nine newly identified
variables that will provide important systems for follow-up multi-wavelength
monitoring to further investigate brown dwarf atmosphere physics.

cluster simulations. The pipeline is identical to that used for Chandra
observations, but the biases discussed in this paper are relevant for all X-ray
observations outside of ${R}_{500c}$. We find the following from our analysis:
(1) filament regions can contribute as much as $50\%$ at $R_{200c}$ to the
emission measure; (2) X-ray temperatures and metal abundances from model fitted
mock X-ray spectra in a multi-temperature ICM respectively vary to the level of
$10\%$ and $50\%$; (3) resulting density profiles vary to within $10\%$ out to
$R_{200c}$, and gas mass, total mass, and baryon fractions all vary to within a
few percent; (4) the bias from a metal abundance extrapolated a factor of five
higher than the true metal abundance results in total mass measurements biased
high by $20\%$ and total gas measurements biased low by $10\%$; and (5)
differences in projection and dynamical state of a cluster can lead to gas
density slope measurements that differ by a factor of $15\%$ and $30\%$,
respectively. The presented results can partially account for some of the
recent gas profile measurements in cluster outskirts by, e.g., Suzaku. Our

clusters from a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, we
characterize the non-thermal pressure fraction profile and study its dependence
on redshift, mass, and mass accretion rate. We find that the non-thermal
pressure fraction profile is universal across redshift when galaxy cluster
radii are defined with respect to the mean matter density of the universe
instead of the commonly used critical density. We also find that the
non-thermal pressure is predominantly radial, and the gas velocity anisotropy
profile exhibits strong universality when galaxy cluster radii are defined with
respect to the mean matter density of the universe. However, we find that the
non-thermal pressure fraction is strongly dependent on the mass accretion rate
of the galaxy cluster. We provide fitting formulae for the universal
non-thermal pressure fraction and velocity anisotropy profiles of gas in galaxy
clusters, which should be useful in modeling astrophysical uncertainties

matrix with the $(i,j)$-{th} entry equal to the covariance between normalized
vectors $A^ie$ and $A^je$ ($e$ being vector of all ones) as a representation
for graph with adjacency matrix $A$. We show that the proposed matrix
representation encodes the spectrum of the underlying adjacency matrix and it
also contains information about the counts of small sub-structures present in
the graph such as triangles and small paths. In addition, we show that this
matrix is a \emph{""graph invariant""}. All these properties make the proposed
matrix a suitable object for representing graphs.
  The representation, being a covariance matrix in a fixed dimensional metric
space, gives a mathematical embedding for graphs. This naturally leads to a
measure of similarity on graph objects. We define similarity between two given
graphs as a Bhattacharya similarity measure between their corresponding
covariance matrix representations. As shown in our experimental study on the
task of social network classification, such a similarity measure outperforms
other widely used state-of-the-art methodologies. Our proposed method is also
computationally efficient. The computation of both the matrix representation
and the similarity value can be performed in operations linear in the number of
edges. This makes our method scalable in practice.
  We believe our theoretical and empirical results provide evidence for
studying truncated power iterations, of the adjacency matrix, to characterize
social networks.

property which gives merely a rough constraint that the data points locate on
some low-dimensional subspace, but generally ignores the extra structures which
specify in more detail how the data points locate on the subspace. Whenever the
geometric distribution of the data points is not uniform, the coherence
parameters of data might be large and, accordingly, the method might fail even
if the latent matrix we want to recover is fairly low-rank. To better handle
non-uniform data, in this paper we propose a method termed Low-Rank Factor
Decomposition (LRFD), which imposes an additional restriction that the data
points must be represented as linear combinations of the bases in a dictionary
constructed or learnt in advance. We show that LRFD can well handle non-uniform
data, provided that the dictionary is configured properly: We mathematically
prove that if the dictionary itself is low-rank then LRFD is immune to the
coherence parameters which might be large on non-uniform data. This provides an
elementary principle for learning the dictionary in LRFD and, naturally, leads
to a practical algorithm for advancing matrix completion. Extensive experiments
on randomly generated matrices and motion datasets show encouraging results.

variations is not reproduced by most of the irradiance reconstruction
techniques based on variations of surface magnetism employed so far, and it is
not clear yet whether SIM calibration procedures need to be improved, or if
instead new physical mechanisms must be invoked to explain such variations. We
employ three-dimensional magneto hydrodynamic simulations of the solar
photosphere to investigate the dependence of solar radiance in SIM Visible and
IR spectral ranges on variations of the filling factor of surface magnetic
fields. We find that the contribution of magnetic features to solar radiance is
strongly dependent on the location on the disk of the features, being negative
close to disk center and positive toward the limb. If features are
homogeneously distributed over a region around the equator (activity belt) then
their contribution to irradiance is positive with respect to the contribution
of HD snapshots, but decreases with the increase of their magnetic flux for
average magnetic flux larger than 50 G in at least two of the Visible and IR
spectral bands monitored by SIM. Under the assumption that the 50 G snapshots
are representative of quiet Sun regions we find thus that the Spectral
Irradiance can be in counter-phase with the solar magnetic activity cycle.

  Workloads","70 Pages, 16 figures,Thesis, The Ohio State University",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of internet services, data started growing faster than it can
be processed. To personalize user experience, this enormous data has to be
processed in real time, in interactive fashion. In order to achieve faster data
processing often a statistical method called subsampling. Subsampling workloads
compute statistics from a random subset of sample data (i.e., a subsample).
Data-parallel platforms group these samples into tasks; each task subsamples
its data in parallel.
  Current, state-of-the-art platforms such as Hadoop are built for large tasks
that run for long periods of time, but applications with smaller average task
sizes suffer large overheads on these platforms. Tasks in subsampling workloads
are sized to minimize the number of overall cache misses, and these tasks can
complete in seconds. This technique can reduce the overall length of a
map-reduce job, but only when the savings from the cache miss rate reduction
are not eclipsed by the platform overhead of task creation and data
distribution.
  In this thesis, we propose a data-parallel platform with an efficient data
distribution component that breaks data-parallel subsampling workloads into
compute clusters with tiny tasks. Each tiny task completes in few hundreds of
milliseconds to seconds. Tiny tasks reduce processor cache misses caused by
random subsampling, which speeds up per-task running time. However, they cause
significant scheduling overheads and data distribution challenges. We propose a
task knee-pointing algorithm and a dynamic scheduler that schedules the tasks
to worker nodes based on the availability and response times of the data nodes.
We compare our framework against various configurations of BashReduce and
Hadoop. A detailed discussion of tiny task approach on two workloads, EAGLET
and Netflix movie rating is presented.

hemispherical shell closed by a ""cap""; if the rotation rates are unequal, then
particles can leave the surface they start on and traverse a volume of the

analytical expressions are provided for the location of period-one curves,
their extent into the bulk of the granular material, and their dependence on

restriction of trajectories to 2D surfaces in the case of equal rotation rates
about the axes, a method is proposed for identifying and constructing 3D
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tubes around the normally elliptic period-one

with a map into $G/B$. These varieties are mostly studied in the case in which
the map into $G/B$ is birational to the image; however in this paper we study a
fiber of this map when it is not birational. We will see that in some cases the
general fiber, which we christen a brick manifold, is a toric variety. In order
to do so we use the moment map of a Bott-Samelson variety to translate this
problem into one in terms of the ""subword complexes"" of Knutson and Miller.
Pilaud and Stump realized certain subword complexes as the dual of the boundary
of a polytope which generalizes the brick polytope defined by Pilaud and
Santos. For a nice family of words, the brick polytope is the generalized
associahedron realized by Hohlweg and Lange. These stories connect in a nice
way: the moment polytope of the brick manifold is the brick polytope. In
particular, we give a nice description of the toric variety of the
associahedron. We give each brick manifold a stratification dual to the subword
complex. In addition, we relate brick manifolds to Brion's resolutions of
Richardon varieties.

  Let $G$ be a vertex weighted undirected graph on $n$ vertices. A vertex

there exist $x,y\in S$ such that the difference of distances (in terms of

finding a DRS in $G$ with minimum total weight. We establish $\Theta(\ln n)$

that these variations are correlated between the radio and the optical

the common Plurality rule is particularly prone to strategic behavior of the
voters and empirical studies show that people often vote strategically in
practice. Multiple game-theoretic models have been proposed to better
understand and predict such behavior and the outcomes it induces. However,
these models often make unrealistic assumptions regarding voters' behavior and
the information on which they base their vote.
  We suggest a new model for strategic voting that takes into account voters'
bounded rationality, as well as their limited access to reliable information.
We introduce a simple behavioral heuristic based on \emph{local dominance},
where each voter considers a set of possible world states without assigning
probabilities to them. This set is constructed based on prospective candidates'
scores (e.g., available from an inaccurate poll). In a \emph{voting
equilibrium}, all voters vote for candidates not dominated within the set of
possible states.
  We prove that these voting equilibria exist in the Plurality rule for a broad
class of local dominance relations (that is, different ways to decide which
states are possible). Furthermore, we show that in an iterative setting where
voters may repeatedly change their vote, local dominance-based dynamics quickly
converge to an equilibrium if voters start from the truthful state. Weaker
convergence guarantees in more general settings are also provided.
  Using extensive simulations of strategic voting on generated and real
preference profiles, we show that convergence is fast and robust, that emerging
equilibria are consistent across various starting conditions, and that they
replicate widely known patterns of human voting behavior such as Duverger's
law. Further, strategic voting generally improves the quality of the winner
compared to truthful voting.

$S_{18}(0)$, is determined by a three-body coupled-channels analysis of the
transfer reaction $^{8}$B($d$,$n$)$^{9}$C at 14.4 MeV/nucleon. Effects of the
breakup channels of $d$ and $^9$C are investigated with the
continuum-discretized coupled-channels method. It is found that, in the initial
and final channels, respectively, the transfer process through the breakup
states of $d$ and $^9$C, its interference with that through their ground states
in particular, gives a large increase in the transfer cross section. The
finite-range effects with respect to the proton-neutron relative coordinate are
found to be about 20%. As a result of the present analysis, $S_{18}(0)=22 \pm
6~{\rm eV~b}$ is obtained, which is smaller than the result of the previous
distorted-wave Born approximation analysis by about 51%.

effi-ciency. They are of different types viz. Time complexity, Space
complexity, etc. However, none of them consider the execution path as a
complexity measure. Ashok et al, firstly proposed the notion of the Path
Complexity of a pro-gram/algorithm, which defined based on the number of
execution paths as a function of the input size. However, the notion of path
complexity of the pro-gram, cannot apply to the object-oriented environment.
Therefore, Anupam et al, has extended the notion of path complexity to the
class as follows. The notion of the state of the class is defined based on
structural representation (aka state) of the class. The class contains data
members and data operations. It considers only those data operations that
change the state of the class. The path complexity of the class is defined to
be the number of valid input sequences, each of them con-taining valid data
operations. Anupam et al, had applied this notion to the class Stack. However,
the stack is basic and simple data structures. Therefore, in this research we
have used a more complex class to understand the path complexity behavior in
the object oriented environment. Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of the well
known (and more complex too) data structure, which is useful in sorting,
searching, Traffic Engineering and many more applications. We have analyzed the
path complexity of the class BST based on the algorithms for insert and delete
operations. Additionally, we have modified the delete operation to minimize the
path complexity for the class BST.

$S$ of a potentially large universe $U$ such that the elements in $S$ satisfy a
suitably chosen sampling condition. Given a subset $\mathcal{I}\subseteq U$ it
should be possible to quickly compute $\mathcal{I}\cap S$, i.e., the elements
in $\mathcal{I}$ satisfying the sampling condition. Consistent sampling has
important applications in similarity estimation, and estimation of the number
of distinct items in a data stream.
  In this paper we generalize consistent sampling to the setting where we are
interested in sampling size-$k$ subsets occurring in some set in a collection
of sets of bounded size $b$, where $k$ is a small integer. This can be done by
applying standard consistent sampling to the $k$-subsets of each set, but that
approach requires time $\Theta(b^k)$. Using a carefully designed hash function,
for a given sampling probability $p \in (0,1]$, we show how to improve the time
complexity to $\Theta(b^{\lceil k/2\rceil}\log \log b + pb^k)$ in expectation,
while maintaining strong concentration bounds for the sample. The space usage
of our method is $\Theta(b^{\lceil k/4\rceil})$.
  We demonstrate the utility of our technique by applying it to several
well-studied data mining problems. We show how to efficiently estimate the
number of frequent $k$-itemsets in a stream of transactions and the number of
bipartite cliques in a graph given as incidence stream. Further, building upon
a recent work by Campagna et al., we show that our approach can be applied to
frequent itemset mining in a parallel or distributed setting. We also present
applications in graph stream mining.

to introduce the concept of Master Equation originally proposed by Lions in his
lectures at the Coll\`ege de France. Controlling the limit N tends to the
infinity of the explicit solution of the N-player game, we highlight the
stochastic nature of the limit distributions of the states of the players due
to the fact that the random environment does not average out in the limit, and
we recast the Mean Field Game (MFG) paradigm in a set of coupled Stochastic
Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). The first one is a forward stochastic
Kolmogorov equation giving the evolution of the conditional distributions of
the states of the players given the common noise. The second is a form of
stochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation providing the solution of the
optimization problem when the flow of conditional distributions is given. Being
highly coupled, the system reads as an infinite dimensional Forward Backward
Stochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE). Uniqueness of a solution and its
Markov property lead to the representation of the solution of the backward
equation (i.e. the value function of the stochastic HJB equation) as a
deterministic function of the solution of the forward Kolmogorov equation,
function which is usually called the decoupling field of the FBSDE. The
(infinite dimensional) PDE satisfied by this decoupling field is identified
with the \textit{master equation}. We also show that this equation can be
derived for other large populations equilibriums like those given by the
optimal control of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. The paper
is written more in the style of a review than a technical paper, and we spend
more time and energy motivating and explaining the probabilistic interpretation
of the Master Equation, than identifying the most general set of assumptions
under which our claims are true.

memory has become a popular topic in the last decade. Different variations of
the problem have been studied, depending on whether the graph edges are
provided in an arbitrary order or as incidence lists. However, with a few
exceptions, the algorithms have considered {\em insert-only} streams. We
present a new algorithm estimating the number of triangles in {\em dynamic}
graph streams where edges can be both inserted and deleted. We show that our
algorithm achieves better time and space complexity than previous solutions for
various graph classes, for example sparse graphs with a relatively small number
of triangles. Also, for graphs with constant transitivity coefficient, a common
situation in real graphs, this is the first algorithm achieving constant
processing time per edge. The result is achieved by a novel approach combining
sampling of vertex triples and sparsification of the input graph. In the course
of the analysis of the algorithm we present a lower bound on the number of
pairwise independent 2-paths in general graphs which might be of independent
interest. At the end of the paper we discuss lower bounds on the space
complexity of triangle counting algorithms that make no assumptions on the

complexity of its trajectory. By identifying the six most stable configurations
of the He pair in W and decomposing its motion into rotational, translational,
and rotational-translational routines, we are able to determine its migration
barrier and trajectory. Our density functional theory calculations demonstrate
a He pair has three modes of motion: a close or open circular two-dimensional
motion in (100) plane with an energy barrier of 0.30 eV, a snaking motion along
[001] direction with a barrier of 0.30 eV, and a twisted-ladder motion along
[010] direction with the two He swinging in the plane (100) and a barrier of
0.31 eV. The graceful associative movements of a He pair are related to the
chemical-bonding-like He-He interaction being much stronger than its migration
barrier in W. The excellent agreement with available experimental measurements
(0.24-0.32 eV) on He migration makes our first-principles result a solid input

functions over the uniform distribution on the Boolean hypercube ${0,1}^n$.
Informally, a function $f:{0,1}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is self-bounding if
for every $x \in {0,1}^n$, $f(x)$ upper bounds the sum of all the $n$ marginal
decreases in the value of the function at $x$. Self-bounding functions include
such well-known classes of functions as submodular and fractionally-subadditive
(XOS) functions. They were introduced by Boucheron et al. (2000) in the context
of concentration of measure inequalities. Our main result is a nearly tight
$\ell_1$-approximation of self-bounding functions by low-degree juntas.
Specifically, all self-bounding functions can be $\epsilon$-approximated in
$\ell_1$ by a polynomial of degree $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ over
$2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)}$ variables. We show that both the degree and
junta-size are optimal up to logarithmic terms. Previous techniques considered
stronger $\ell_2$ approximation and proved nearly tight bounds of
$\Theta(1/\epsilon^{2})$ on the degree and $2^{\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)}$ on the
number of variables. Our bounds rely on the analysis of noise stability of
self-bounding functions together with a stronger connection between noise
stability and $\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials. This technique
can also be used to get tighter bounds on $\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree
polynomials and faster learning algorithm for halfspaces.
  These results lead to improved and in several cases almost tight bounds for
PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions relative to the uniform
distribution. In particular, assuming hardness of learning juntas, we show that
PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions have complexity of
$n^{\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon)}$.

structural and mixing behaviors of Mn$_m$Tc$_n$ alloy clusters with $m+n =$13

calculations. Our study reports a favorable mixing tendency for the alloy
clusters. The average bond lengths of the minimum energy structures show an
overall linear variation with concentrations, indicating a Vegard's law like
variation for the nano alloy clusters, though the optimized structures undergo
a structural transition from a closed and compact structure for the Mn-rich

and magnetization properties of the alloy clusters, which plays a vital role
for the Vegard's law like variation in their average bond lengths.

Towards this end, we consider coordination games where agents have different
intrinsic preferences but they stand to gain if others choose the same strategy
as them. For non-trivial versions of our game, stable solutions like Nash
Equilibrium may not exist, or may be socially inefficient even when they do
exist. This motivates us to focus on designing efficient algorithms to compute
(almost) stable solutions like Approximate Equilibrium that can be realized if
agents are provided some additional incentives. Our results apply in many
settings like adoption of new products, project selection, and group formation,
where a central authority can direct agents towards a strategy but agents may
defect if they have better alternatives. We show that for any given instance,
we can either compute a high quality approximate equilibrium or a near-optimal
solution that can be stabilized by providing small payments to some players. We
then generalize our model to encompass situations where player relationships
may exhibit complementarities and present an algorithm to compute an
Approximate Equilibrium whose stability factor is linear in the degree of
complementarity. Our results imply that a little influence is necessary in

a defining feature of superconductors; in Type-II superconductors above the
lower critical field, this screening takes the form of a lattice of magnetic
flux vortices. Using implanted spin-1/2 positive muons, one can measure the
vortex lattice field distribution through the spin precession and deduce key
parameters of the superconducting ground state, and thereby fundamental
properties of the superconducting pairing. Muon spin rotation/relaxation
($\mu$SR) experiments have indeed revealed much interesting physics in the
underdoped cuprates, where superconductivity is closely related to, or
coexistent with, disordered or fluctuating magnetic and charge excitations.
Such complications should be absent in overdoped cuprates, which are believed
to exhibit conventional Fermi liquid behaviour. These first transverse field
(TF)-$\mu^+$SR experiments on heavily-overdoped single crystals reveal a
superfluid density exhibiting a clear inflection point near 0.5$T_c$, with a
striking doping-independent scaling. This reflects hitherto unrecognized
physics intrinsic to $d$-wave vortices, evidently generic to the cuprates, and
may offer fundamentally new insights into their still-mysterious

detail in previous publications by some of us, where we proposed a new
formulation of (non-supersymmetric) gravity theories employing an alternative
volume form (volume element, or generally-covariant integration measure) in the
pertinent Lagrangian action, defined in terms of auxiliary (pure-gauge) fields
instead of the standard Riemannian metric volume form. Invariance under
supersymmetry of the new modified N=1 supergravity action is preserved due to
the addition of an appropriate compensating antisymmetric tensor gauge field.
This new formalism naturally triggers the appearance of a dynamically generated
cosmological constant as an arbitrary integration constant which signifies a
spontaneous (dynamical) breaking of supersymmetry. Furthermore, applying the
same formalism to anti-de Sitter supergravity allows us to appropriately choose
the above mentioned arbitrary integration constant so as to obtain
simultaneously a very small positive effective observable cosmological constant

scenarios for slowly expanding universe of today.

applications, tracking of movements becomes more evident since, in these

connected groups of nodes (modules) have relatively few interconnections.
Modularity had been shown to have an important effect on the evolution and
stability of biological networks, on the scalability and efficiency of
large-scale infrastructure, and the development of economic and social systems.
An analytical framework for understanding modularity and its effects on network
vulnerability is still missing. Through recent advances in the understanding of
multilayer networks, however, it is now possible to develop a theoretical
framework to systematically study this critical issue. Here we study,
analytically and numerically, the resilience of modular networks under attacks
on interconnected nodes, which exhibit high betweenness values and are often
more exposed to failure. Our model provides new understandings into the
feedback between structure and function in real world systems, and consequently
has important implications as diverse as developing efficient immunization
strategies, designing robust large-scale infrastructure, and understanding

observing a subset of the vertex correlations. Specifically, we consider the
inverse problem with observed variables $Y=B_G x \oplus Z$, where $B_G$ is the
incidence matrix of a graph $G$, $x$ is the vector of unknown vertex variables
(with a uniform prior) and $Z$ is a noise vector with Bernoulli$(\varepsilon)$
i.i.d. entries. All variables and operations are Boolean. This model is
motivated by coding, synchronization, and community detection problems. In
particular, it corresponds to a stochastic block model or a correlation
clustering problem with two communities and censored edges. Without noise,
exact recovery (up to global flip) of $x$ is possible if and only the graph $G$
is connected, with a sharp threshold at the edge probability $\log(n)/n$ for
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. The first goal of this paper is to determine
how the edge probability $p$ needs to scale to allow exact recovery in the
presence of noise. Defining the degree (oversampling) rate of the graph by
$\alpha =np/\log(n)$, it is shown that exact recovery is possible if and only
if $\alpha >2/(1-2\varepsilon)^2+ o(1/(1-2\varepsilon)^2)$. In other words,
$2/(1-2\varepsilon)^2$ is the information theoretic threshold for exact
recovery at low-SNR. In addition, an efficient recovery algorithm based on
semidefinite programming is proposed and shown to succeed in the threshold
regime up to twice the optimal rate. For a deterministic graph $G$, defining
the degree rate as $\alpha=d/\log(n)$, where $d$ is the minimum degree of the
graph, it is shown that the proposed method achieves the rate $\alpha>
4((1+\lambda)/(1-\lambda)^2)/(1-2\varepsilon)^2+ o(1/(1-2\varepsilon)^2)$,
where $1-\lambda$ is the spectral gap of the graph $G$.

relativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a
central spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must
be removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired
singularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but
when one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical
singularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands
for ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black
hole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in
Nature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends
on the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role
and our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper
adjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that
the ""correct answer"" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de
Sitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de
Sitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore
we believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase
of a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states.

some work considers the correlation but overlooks the discriminative ability of
sparsity. Different from these existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a
framework called Adaptive Sparse Representation based Classification (ASRC) in
which sparsity and correlation are jointly considered. Specifically, when the
samples are of low correlation, ASRC selects the most discriminative samples
for representation, like SRC; when the training samples are highly correlated,
ASRC selects most of the correlated and discriminative samples for
representation, rather than choosing some related samples randomly. In general,
the representation model is adaptive to the correlation structure, which
benefits from both $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_2$-norm.

According to the traditional diagrammatic technique of transport coefficients,
the finite thermal width of boson or fermion is introduced in their internal
lines during the evaluation of boson-boson or fermion-fermion loop diagram.
These thermal widths of $\phi$ boson and $\psi$ fermion are respectively

observatory, will measure the degree to which two test-masses can be put into
free-fall, aiming to demonstrate a residual relative acceleration with a power
spectral density (PSD) below 30 fm/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ around 1 mHz. In LPF data
analysis, the measured relative acceleration data series must be fit to other
various measured time series data. This fitting is required in different
experiments, from system identification of the test mass and satellite dynamics
to the subtraction of noise contributions from measured known disturbances. In
all cases, the background noise, described by the PSD of the fit residuals, is
expected to be coloured, requiring that we perform such fits in the frequency
domain. This PSD is unknown {\it a priori}, and a high accuracy estimate of
this residual acceleration noise is an essential output of our analysis. In
this paper we present a fitting method based on Bayesian parameter estimation
with an unknown frequency-dependent background noise. The method uses noise
marginalisation in connection with averaged Welch's periodograms to achieve
unbiased parameter estimation, together with a consistent, non-parametric
estimate of the residual PSD. Additionally, we find that the method is
equivalent to some implementations of iteratively re-weighted least-squares
fitting. We have tested the method both on simulated data of known PSD, and to
analyze differential acceleration from several experiments with the LISA
Pathfinder end-to-end mission simulator.

recently attracted considerable interest. In order to do this in parallel, we
need to partition them into pieces of about equal size. Unfortunately, previous
parallel graph partitioners originally developed for more regular mesh-like
networks do not work well for these networks. This paper addresses this problem
by parallelizing and adapting the label propagation technique originally
developed for graph clustering. By introducing size constraints, label
propagation becomes applicable for both the coarsening and the refinement phase
of multilevel graph partitioning. We obtain very high quality by applying a
highly parallel evolutionary algorithm to the coarsened graph. The resulting
system is both more scalable and achieves higher quality than state-of-the-art
systems like ParMetis or PT-Scotch. For large complex networks the performance
differences are very big. For example, our algorithm can partition a web graph
with 3.3 billion edges in less than sixteen seconds using 512 cores of a high
performance cluster while producing a high quality partition -- none of the
competing systems can handle this graph on our system.

reality they can be more complex. Indeed they may also display a diverse array
of antagonistic interactions, such as competition and victim--exploiter
interactions. In some cases mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are
carried-out by the same species but at different life-stages. As a consequence,
population structure affects the balance of inter-specific associations, a
topic that is receiving increased attention. In this paper, we developed a
model that captures the basic features of the interaction between a flowering
plant and an insect with a larval stage that feeds on the plant's vegetative
tissues (e.g. leaves) and an adult pollinator stage. Our model is able to
display a rich set of dynamics, the most remarkable of which involves
victim--exploiter oscillations that allow plants to attain abundances above
their carrying capacities, and the periodic alternation between states
dominated by mutualism or antagonism. Our study indicates that changes in the
insect's life cycle can modify the balance between mutualism and antagonism,
causing important qualitative changes in the interaction dynamics. These
changes in the life cycle could be caused by a variety of external drivers,
such as temperature, plant nutrients, pesticides and changes in the diet of
adult pollinators.

atmospheric composition of the giant planets of our solar system. A remarkable
example of the superiority of in situ probe measurements is illustrated by the
exploration of Jupiter, where key measurements such as the determination of the
noble gases abundances and the precise measurement of the helium mixing ratio
have only been made available through in situ measurements by the Galileo
probe. This paper describes the main scientific goals to be addressed by the
future in situ exploration of Saturn placing the Galileo probe exploration of
Jupiter in a broader context and before the future probe exploration of the
more remote ice giants. In situ exploration of Saturn's atmosphere addresses
two broad themes that are discussed throughout this paper: first, the formation
history of our solar system and second, the processes at play in planetary
atmospheres. In this context, we detail the reasons why measurements of
Saturn's bulk elemental and isotopic composition would place important
constraints on the volatile reservoirs in the protosolar nebula. We also show
that the in situ measurement of CO (or any other disequilibrium species that is
depleted by reaction with water) in Saturn's upper troposphere would constrain
its bulk O/H ratio. We highlight the key measurements required to distinguish
competing theories to shed light on giant planet formation as a common process
in planetary systems with potential applications to most extrasolar systems. In
situ measurements of Saturn's stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics,
chemistry and cloud-forming processes will provide access to phenomena
unreachable to remote sensing studies. Different mission architectures are
envisaged, which would benefit from strong international collaborations.

screen periodically pierced by subwavelength holes. The study is restricted to
normal incidence and to the case of neglected evanescent fields (far-field)
which covers many common cases. When only one non-degenerate mode propagates in
cavities, they take identical forms to those of a polarizer, with
Fabry-Perot-like spectral resonant factors depending on bigrating parameters.
The isotropic or birefringent properties are then obtained when holes support
two orthogonal polarization modes. This basic formalism is finally applied to
design compact and efficient metallic half-wave plates.
