masers throughout the Galaxy using a J=1-0 transition of the CO isotopologues.
  Methods:Using the 13.7-meter telescope at the Purple Mountain Observatory
(PMO), we have obtained ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO (1-0) lines for 160 methanol masers
sources from the first to the third Galactic quadrants. We made efforts to
resolve the distance ambiguity by careful comparison with the radio continuum
and HI 21 cm observations.
  Results: First, the maser sources show increased ^{13}CO line widths toward
the Galactic center, suggesting that the molecular gas are more turbulent
toward the Galactic center. This trend can be noticeably traced by the ^{13}CO
line width. Second, the ^{12}CO excitation temperature shows a noticeable
correlation with the H_2 column density. A possible explanation consistent with
the collapse model is that the higher surface-density gas is more efficient to
the stellar heating and/or has a higher formation rate of high-mass stars.
Third, comparing the IRDCs, the maser sources on average have significantly
lower H_2 column densities, moderately higher temperatures, and similar line
widths. Fourth, in the mapped regions, 51 ^{13}CO cores have been revealed.
Only 17 coincide with the radio continuum emission (F_{cm}>6 mJy), while a
larger fraction (30 cores) coincide with the infrared emissions. The IR-bright
and radio-bright sources exhibit significantly higher $^{12}$CO excitation
temperatures than the IR-faint and radio-faint sources, respectively.
  Conclusions: The 6.7 GHz masers show a moderately low ionization rate but
have a common-existing stellar heating that generates the IR emissions. The
relevant properties can be characterized by the ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO (1-0)
emissions in several aspects as described above.

software for science are becoming a growing concern. Many scientists' research
increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which
their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences,
the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and
Experiences (WSSSPE1) was held in November 2013 in conjunction with the SC13
Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54)
of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and
presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and
discussion was taken during the workshop.
  Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive
documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and
career paths for developers. Attribution systems that account for evidence of
software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms
such as Digital Object Identifiers, publication of ""software papers"", and the
use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub.
  This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed,
including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature
seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is
impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the
extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term,
for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It
also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to
successful scientific software.

reconcile the group-theoretical objects emerging from our calculation with the

a natural extension of the Standard Model (SM) and the nature of Dark Matter
(DM) are two of the most compelling questions in high-energy particle physics.
Composite Higgs models may provide a unified picture in which both the Higgs
boson and the DM particle arise as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a
spontaneously broken global symmetry at a scale $f\sim$ TeV. In this paper we
analyze a general class of these models based on the coset SO(6)/SO(5).
Assuming the existence of light and weakly coupled spin-1 and spin-1/2
resonances which mix linearly with the elementary SM particles, we are able to
compute the effective potential of the theory by means of some generalized
Weinberg sum rules. The properties of the Higgs boson, DM, top quark and the
above resonances are thus calculable and tightly connected. We perform a wide
phenomenological analysis, considering both collider physics at the LHC and
astrophysical observables. We find that these models are tightly constrained by
present experimental data, which are able to completely exclude the most
natural setup with $f\simeq 800$ GeV. Upon increasing the value of $f$, an
allowed region appears. In particular for $f\simeq 1.1$ TeV we find a concrete
realization that predicts $m_{DM}\simeq 200$ GeV for the DM mass. This DM
candidate lies close to the present sensitivity of direct detection experiments
and will be ruled out - or discovered - in the near future.

recover rapidly the results already existing in the literature for the

the expected cold dark matter power spectrum with redshift distortions in the

parameter {\beta} that depend on redshift but are independent of scale. The
intensity fluctuations introduce a scale dependence in both b_{\delta} and

absorbers of the ionising background. We also compute a second term affecting
the Ly{\alpha} spectrum, due to shot noise in the sources of radiation. This
term is very large if luminous quasars are assumed to produce the ionising
background and to emit isotropically with a constant luminosity, but should be
reduced by a contribution from galaxies, and by the finite lifetime and

(2012) have shown that this does not contradict the magnetocentrifugal
mechanism that is believed to launch such outflows. Signatures of motions
transverse to the jet axis and in opposite directions have recently been
measured in M87 (Meyer et al. 2013). One possible interpretation of this motion
is the one of counter rotating knots. Here, we extend our previous analytical
derivation of counter-rotation to relativistic jets, demonstrating that
counter-rotation can indeed take place under rather general conditions. We show
that both the magnetic field and a non-negligible enthalpy are necessary at the
origin of counter-rotating outflows, and that the effect is associated with a
transfer of energy flux from the matter to the electromagnetic field. This can
be realized in three cases : if a decreasing enthalpy causes an increase of the
Poynting flux, if the flow decelerates, or, if strong gradients of the magnetic
field are present. An illustration of the involved mechanism is given by an
example of relativistic MHD jet simulation.

new measure of non-monotonicity: the orientation of a function $f$ is the
characteristic vector of the minimum sized set of negated variables needed in
any DeMorgan circuit computing $f$. We prove trade-off results between the
depth and the weight/structure of the orientation vectors in any circuit $C$
computing the Clique function on an $n$ vertex graph. We prove that if $C$ is
of depth $d$ and each gate computes a Boolean function with orientation of
weight at most $w$ (in terms of the inputs to $C$), then $d \times w$ must be
$\Omega(n)$. In particular, if the weights are $o(\frac{n}{\log^k n})$, then
$C$ must be of depth $\omega(\log^k n)$. We prove a barrier for our general
technique. However, using specific properties of the Clique function and the
Karchmer-Wigderson framework (Karchmer and Wigderson, 1988), we go beyond the
limitations and obtain lower bounds when the weight restrictions are less
stringent. We then study the depth lower bounds when the structure of the
orientation vector is restricted. Asymptotic improvements to our results (in
the restricted setting), separates NP from NC. As our main tool, we generalize
Karchmer-Wigderson gamefor monotone functions to work for non-monotone circuits
parametrized by the weight/structure of the orientation. We also prove
structural results about orientation and prove connections between number of
negations and weight of orientations required to compute a function.

photospheric umbral dots and they rather tend to occur above darkest parts of
the umbra, where magnetic fields are strongest. The spikes exhibit up and down
oscillatory motions and their spectral evolution suggests that they might be
driven by upward propagating shocks generated by photospheric oscillations. It
is worth noting that triggering of the running penumbral waves seems to occur
during the interval when the spikes reach their maximum height.

exoplanets and other solar systems, is limited by difficulty of separating the
planetary emission from the effects of optical aberrations that are not
compensated by the adaptive optics (AO) system, so-called ""non-common path
aberrations"" (NCPAs). Simultaneous ($\sim$ millisecond) exposures by the
science camera and the AO system enable the use of ""phase diversity"" to
estimate both the NCPAs and the scene via a processing procedure first
described by the author (R. Frazin 2013, ApJ, 767, article id. 21). This method
is fully compatible with more standard concepts used in long-exposure
high-contrast imaging, such as angular differential imaging and spectral
deconvolution. Long-exposure methods find time-dependent NCPAs, such as those
caused by vibrations, particularly challenging. Here, an NCPA of the form of
$\alpha \cos(k \cdot r - \omega t + \vartheta)$ is considered. It is shown
that, when sampled at millisecond time-scales, the image plane data are
sensitive to $\mbox{arg}(\alpha)$, $\vartheta$ and $\omega$, and, therefore
such NCPAs can be simultaneously estimated with the scene. Simulations of
observations with ms exposure times are reported. These simulations include
substantial detector noise and a sinusoidal NCPA that places a speckle exactly
at the location of a planet. Simulations show that the effects of detector
noise can be mitigated by mixing exposures of various lengths, allowing
estimation of the planet's brightness.

impact induces a set of resonances that are dominated by Zero Group Velocity

detected. These experiments confirm that the temporal decay of ZGV modes
follows a $t^{-0.5}$ law and show that the temporal decay of the thickness
resonances is much faster. Similar decays are obtained by numerical simulations
achieved with a finite difference code. A simple model is proposed to describe
the thickness resonances. It predicts that a thickness mode decays as
$t^{-1.5}$ for large times and that the resonance amplitude is proportional to
$D^{-1.5}$ where $D$ is the curvature of the dispersion curve $\omega(k)$ at
$k=0$. This curvature depends on the order of the mode and on the Poisson's

demonstrated past (1960-2012) strong correlation between first-difference
atmospheric CO2 and global surface temperature. It does this, for the period
from the present to 2050, for a comprehensive range of future global fossil
fuel energy use scenarios. The results show that even for a business-as-usual
(the mid-level IPCC) fossil fuel use estimate, global surface temperature will
rise at a slower rate than for the recent period 1960-2000. Concerning peak
fossil fuel, for the most common scenario the currently observed
(1998-2013)temperature plateau will turn into a decrease. The observed trend to
date for temperature is compared with that for global climate disasters: these
peaked in 2005 and are notably decreasing. The temperature and disaster results
taken together are consistent with either a reduced business-as-usual fossil
fuel use scenario into the future, or a peak fossil fuel scenario, but not with
the standard business-as-usual scenario. If the future follows a peak fossil
fuel pathway, a markedly decreasing trend in global surface temperature should
become apparent over the next few years. If entertained, these results are
evidence that the climate problem may require less preventative action. If so,
the same evidence is support for the case that the peak fossil fuel problem
does require preventative action. This action is the same as it would have been
for climate - the rapid transition to a predominantly renewable global energy
system.

  towards the Master's Degree in Physics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used statistical models for modeling
sequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an
important learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation
are based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer
from high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence
of spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of
moments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade
and Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012
(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic
data, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral
methods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method
applying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a
much more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the
algorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability
issues are encountered in this regime. In view of learning from real-world
experimental data, the representation of real-valued observations for the use

network structures, the K-user Gaussian multiple access (MAC) wiretap channel
and the K-user interference channel (IC) with secrecy constraints, have been
determined recently as K(K-1)/(K(K-1)+1) [1,2] and K(K-1)/(2K-1) [3,4],
respectively. In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these
two channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the
converse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to
secrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region
close to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to
secrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper
bounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,
in order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the
IC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not
illustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,
we use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,
we develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope
region given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC
region are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,
by setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure
(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are
achieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N
external eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in
this paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of
the s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC
and IC channel models.

voting, in each step every vertex chooses a neighbour uniformly at random, and
adopts its opinion. The voting is completed when all vertices hold the same
opinion. On many graph classes including regular graphs, pull voting requires
$\Theta(n)$ expected steps to complete, even if initially there are only two
distinct opinions.
  In this paper we consider a related process which we call two-sample voting:
every vertex chooses two random neighbours in each step. If the opinions of
these neighbours coincide, then the vertex revises its opinion according to the
chosen sample. Otherwise, it keeps its own opinion. We consider the performance
of this process in the case where two different opinions reside on vertices of
some (arbitrary) sets $A$ and $B$, respectively. Here, $|A| + |B| = n$ is the
number of vertices of the graph.
  We show that there is a constant $K$ such that if the initial imbalance
between the two opinions is ?$\nu_0 = (|A| - |B|)/n \geq K \sqrt{(1/d) +
(d/n)}$, then with high probability two sample voting completes in a random $d$
regular graph in $O(\log n)$ steps and the initial majority opinion wins. We
also show the same performance for any regular graph, if $\nu_0 \geq K
\lambda_2$ where $\lambda_2$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the transition
matrix. In the graphs we consider, standard pull voting requires $\Omega(n)$
steps, and the minority can still win with probability $|B|/n$.

spray drying and particle flame synthesis. These processes have in common that
nano-particles collide at low concentrations and get irreversibly linked at the
point of contact due to plastic deformation. In this paper, we investigate
several models of irreversible connections, which require only local
interactions between the colliding nano-particles and thus allow for scalable
simulations. The models investigated here connect the particles upon collision
by non-bonded strongly attractive interactions, bonded interactions or by
binding agents placed at the point of contact. Models using spherically
symmetric interactions form compact agglomerates and are therefore unsuitable
to study agglomeration. In contrast, models that are either based on both
central and angular potentials (type one) or on binding agents (type two)
efficiently prevent restructuring of the agglomerates, and are therefore useful
for modeling contacts formed by plastic deformation. Moreover, both types of
models allow to control the rigidity and by that the degree of restructuring.
The first type of model is computationally more efficient at low fractional
dimensions of the aggregates, while the second gives easy access to local shear
forces, which is important when breaking of agglomerates is to be considered.
As example applications, we reproduce the well-known diffusion-limited
agglomeration (DLA) and report results on soot aggregation.

be modest at $N_H = 6 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^2$, and does not introduce any
significant curvature in the Fe K band. We are able to place a strong
constraint on the presence of a broadened Fe K{\alpha} line: $E =

range in broad Fe K{\alpha} line strengths observed in nearby, bright AGN
(roughly an order of magnitude), and imply a corresponding range in the
physical properties of the inner accretion disk in these sources. We have also
updated our previously reported measurement of the high-energy cutoff of the
hard X-ray emission using both observatories rather than just NuSTAR alone:
$E_{cut} = 186 \pm 14$ keV. This high-energy cutoff acts as a proxy for the
temperature of the coronal electron plasma, enabling us to further separate
this parameter from the optical depth of the plasma and to update our results

planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and radial velocity (RV)
surveys, we present a method for comparing the statistical constraints on
exoplanet demographics inferred from these methods. We first derive the mapping
from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an
analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict
the distribution of RV observables for the planet population inferred from
microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly
marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected
systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a
fiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the
microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We find that RV
and microlensing surveys have some overlap, specifically for super-Jupiter mass
planets ($m_p \gtrsim 1~M_{\rm Jup}$) with periods between $\sim 3-10~$years.
However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing
implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller
frequency than the overall giant planet frequency ($m_p\gtrsim 0.1~M_{\rm
Jup}$) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible
to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet
detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider
regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a
companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative
microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs
with orbits of $\lesssim 30~$years.

is found dominate the power-law throughout most of the soft state, with
increasing supremacy as the source decays. We discuss potential dynamics
driving this, favouring inner disc truncation and decreasing coronal height for

and the nature of the GC's binary population. The size of the BH+MSP population
is sensitive to several uncertain parameters, including the BH mass function,
the BH retention fraction, and the binary fraction in GCs. Based on our models,
we estimate that there are $0.6\pm0.2$ dynamically formed BH+MSP binaries in

abundances, while the RR Lyraes in the relatively metal rich group I clusters
like M3 are mostly produced by first generation stars (G1) without these
enhancements. This population shift within the instability strip with
metallicity can create the observed period-shift between the two groups, since
both helium and CNO abundances play a role in increasing the period of RR Lyrae
variables. The presence of more metal-rich clusters having
Oosterhoff-intermediate characteristics, such as NGC 1851, as well as of most
metal-rich clusters having RR Lyraes with longest periods (group III) can also
be reproduced, as more helium-rich third and later generations of stars (G3)
penetrate into the instability strip with further increase in metallicity.

shown to evolve more slowly, on average, than surface sites with few contacts.
Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous
structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we
considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility),
packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as
measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral
angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural
flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on 9
non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous
variants of those proteins, where available. We obtained measures of
variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta
software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site
variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally
weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1 to 0.4). Moreover, we found that
buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation
than was structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures
was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than was buriedness or
packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best
structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness
and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than are
more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of

article, we investigate the consequences of several such factors that are
common to neuromorphic devices, more specifically limited hardware resources,
limited parameter configurability and parameter variations. Our final aim is to
provide an array of methods for coping with such inevitable distortion
mechanisms. As a platform for testing our proposed strategies, we use an
executable system specification (ESS) of the BrainScaleS neuromorphic system,
which has been designed as a universal emulation back-end for neuroscientific
modeling. We address the most essential limitations of this device in detail
and study their effects on three prototypical benchmark network models within a
well-defined, systematic workflow. For each network model, we start by defining
quantifiable functionality measures by which we then assess the effects of
typical hardware-specific distortion mechanisms, both in idealized software
simulations and on the ESS. For those effects that cause unacceptable
deviations from the original network dynamics, we suggest generic compensation
mechanisms and demonstrate their effectiveness. Both the suggested workflow and
the investigated compensation mechanisms are largely back-end independent and
do not require additional hardware configurability beyond the one required to
emulate the benchmark networks in the first place. We hereby provide a generic
methodological environment for configurable neuromorphic devices that are
targeted at emulating large-scale, functional neural networks.

affected by mass loss through dusty stellar winds. Dynamic atmosphere and wind
models are an essential tool for studying these evolved stars, both
individually and as members of stellar populations, to understand their
contribution to the integrated light and chemical evolution of galaxies.
  This paper is part of a series testing state-of-the-art atmosphere and wind
models of carbon stars against observations, and making them available for use
in various theoretical and observational studies.
  We have computed low-resolution spectra and photometry (in the wavelength
range 0.35-25 mu) for a grid of 540 dynamic models with stellar parameters
typical of solar-metallicity C-rich AGB stars and with a range of pulsation
amplitudes. The models cover the dynamic atmosphere and dusty outflow (if
present), assuming spherical symmetry, and taking opacities of gas-phase
species and dust grains consistently into account. To characterize the
time-dependent dynamic and photometric behaviour of the models in a concise way
we defined a number of classes for models with and without winds.
  Comparisons with observed data in general show a quite good agreement for
example regarding mass-loss rates vs. (J-K) colours or K magnitudes vs. (J-K)
colours. Some exceptions from the good overall agreement, however, are found
and attributed to the range of input parameters (e.g. relatively high carbon
excesses) or intrinsic model assumptions (e.g. small particle limit for grain
opacities).
  While current results indicate that some changes in model assumptions and
parameter ranges should be made in the future to bring certain synthetic
observables into better agreement with observations, it seems unlikely that
these pending improvements will significantly affect the mass-loss rates of the
models.

for a realizable machine will then be respect to the number of copies of the

exact measurement of conjugate variables, although approximate measurement may
be performed as circumscribed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. When
considering the measurement of a variable, there might be residual uncertainty

the quantum measurement complexity of linear polarization of photons that is
used in several quantum cryptography schemes and we present a relation using

reductions in the speed of sound during uninterrupted slow-roll inflation, a
theoretically well motivated and self-consistent regime that admits an
effective single-field description. The signatures on the power spectrum and
bispectrum were previously computed using a slow-roll Fourier transform (SRFT)
approximation, and here we compare it with generalized slow-roll (GSR) and
in-in methods, for which we derive new formulas that account for moderately
sharp features. The agreement between them is excellent, and also with the
power spectrum obtained from the numerical solution to the equation of motion.
We show that, in this regime, the SRFT approximation correctly captures with
simplicity the effect of higher derivatives of the speed of sound in the mode
equation, and makes manifest the correlations between power spectrum and
bispectrum features. In a previous paper we reported hints of these
correlations in the Planck data and here we perform several consistency checks
and further analyses of the best fits, such as polarization and local
significance at different angular scales. For the data analysis, we show the
excellent agreement between the CLASS and CAMB Boltzmann codes. Our results
confirm that the theoretical framework is consistent, and they suggest that the

$\gamma\gamma$ to meson pair amplitudes as possible. Having data with limited
angular coverage, typically $|\cos \theta| < 0.6-0.8$, and no polarization
information for reactions in which spin is an essential complication, the
determination of the underlying amplitudes might appear an intractable problem.
However, imposing the basic constraints required by analyticity, unitarity, and
crossing-symmetry makes up for the experimentally missing information.
  Final state interactions among the meson pairs are critical to this analysis.
To fix these, we include the latest $\pi\pi\to\pi\pi$, ${\overline K}K$
scattering amplitudes given by dispersive analyses, supplemented in the
${\overline K}K$ threshold region by the recent precision Dalitz plot analysis

Despite considerable effort, this model does not at present provide a

predictively successful description of galaxy dynamics, but is mute on the
subject of cosmology. Here I briefly review these contradictory world views,
emphasizing the wealth of distinct, interlocking lines of evidence that went
into the development of LCDM while highlighting the practical impossibility
that it can provide a satisfactory explanation of the observed MOND
phenomenology in galaxy dynamics. I also briefly review the baryon budget in
groups and clusters of galaxies where neither paradigm provides an entirely
satisfactory description of the data. Relatively little effort has been devoted
to the formation of structure in MOND; I review some of what has been done. The
amplitude ratio of the first to second peak in the CMB power spectrum was
correctly predicted a priori, but the third peak is more natural to LCDM. MOND
anticipates that structure forms more quickly than in LCDM. This motivated the
prediction that reionization would happen earlier in MOND than originally
expected in LCDM, as subsequently observed. This also provides a natural
explanation for massive, early clusters of galaxies and large, empty voids.
However, it is far from obvious that the mass spectrum of galaxy clusters or
the power spectrum of galaxies can be explained in MOND, two things that LCDM
does well. Critical outstanding issues are the development of an acceptable
relativistic parent theory for MOND, and the reality of the non-baryonic dark
matter of LCDM. Do suitable dark matter particles exist, or are they a modern
aether?

mass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover or `knee' at
stellar masses around $10^{10} M_\odot$. At stellar masses higher than the
characteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as
metallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the
mass-metallicity relation depends only on evolution of the characteristic
turnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass
normalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We
find that the redshift independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is
set by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The
turnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen
abundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low mass stars
is an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars.
The characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass where the stellar-to-gas
mass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between
metallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift independent, universal
relationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity
relation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between
metallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio. We test the validity of this
universal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass,
metallicity and gas mass measurements are available. The data are consistent
with a universal metallicity relation. We derive an equation for estimating the
hydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for
$z\lesssim1.6$ and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.

designing and analyzing randomized experiments that aim to reduce this bias and
thereby reduce overall error. In design, we consider the ability to perform
random assignment to treatments that is correlated in the network, such as
through graph cluster randomization. In analysis, we consider incorporating
information about the treatment assignment of network neighbors. We prove
sufficient conditions for bias reduction through both design and analysis in
the presence of potentially global interference. Through simulations of the
entire process of experimentation in networks, we measure the performance of
these methods under varied network structure and varied social behaviors,
finding substantial bias and error reductions. These improvements are largest
for networks with more clustering and data generating processes with both
stronger direct effects of the treatment and stronger interactions between
units.

chromatic polynomial. The key motivation for studying the structure of a
chromatic symmetric function is to answer positivity conjectures by Stanley in
1995 and Gasharov in 1996. As a symmetric function one can write the chromatic
symmetric function in the basis of Schur functions. In this paper we address
the positivity of the Schur coefficients when the parameter of the Schur
function is a hook shape. Furthermore, when a graph is the incomparability
graph of a poset with specific properties we construct a correspondence between
acyclic orientations of the graph and P-tableaux with a hook shape.

a result of the interference between two paths: one involving a discrete
resonance and the other a continuum. Compared to a conventional resonance,
characterized by a Lorentzian spectral response, the characteristic asymmetric
and sharp spectral response of a Fano resonance is suggested to enable photonic
switches and sensors with superior characteristics. While experimental
demonstrations of the appearance of Fano resonances have been made in both
plasmonic and photonic-crystal structures, the control of these resonances is
experimentally challenging, often involving the coupling of near-resonant
cavities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two simple structures that allow
surprisingly robust control of the Fano spectrum. One structure relies on
controlling the amplitude of one of the paths and the other uses symmetry
breaking. Short-pulse dynamic measurements show that besides drastically
increasing the switching contrast, the transmission dynamics itself is strongly
affected by the nature of the resonance. The influence of slow-recovery tails
implied by a long carrier lifetime can thus be reduced using a Fano resonance
due to a hitherto unrecognized reshaping effect of the nonlinear Fano transfer
function. For the first time, we present a system application of a Fano
structure, demonstrating its advantages by the experimental realization of 10
Gbit/s all-optical modulation with bit-error-ratios on the order of 10$^{-7}$
for input powers less than 1 mW. These results represent a significant
improvement compared to the use of a conventional Lorentzian resonance.

co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), clustering with dynamic time warping

studied these algorithms in both simulated settings and case study data. Our
investigations showed that FCM performed very well when gene curves were short

curves similar to one another. Overall, ACF performed poorly in these
applications. In terms of computation time, FCM, SSC and DTW were considerably
slower than MCLUST and WGCNA. WGCNA outperformed MCLUST by generating more

forgetting an atom from a program amounts to a reduction in the signature of

that if two programs are strongly equivalent, then the results of forgetting an
atom in each program should also be strongly equivalent. Our central definition
of forgetting is impractical but satisfies this goal: Forgetting an atom is
characterised by the set of SE consequences of the program that do not mention
the atom to be forgotten. We then provide an equivalent, practical definition,
wherein forgetting an atom $p$ is given by those rules in the program that
don't mention $p$, together with rules obtained by a single inference step from
rules that do mention $p$. Forgetting is shown to have appropriate properties;
as well, the finite characterisation results in a modest (at worst quadratic)
blowup. Finally we have also obtained a prototype implementation of this
approach to forgetting.

determine the nature of the sources and of their radio emission. A proper
motion study was also performed for several of these radio sources using radio
observation previously reported. Our analysis shows that 11 radio sources can
be related with Galactic objects, most of them probably young stars.
Interestingly, eight of these sources are in an area less than 1 square
arcminute in size. The importance of such compact clusters resides in that all
its members can be observed in a single pointing with most telescopes, and are,
therefore, ideal for multi-wavelength studies of variability. Another 4 of the
detected sources are clearly extragalactic. Finally, we propose from
statistical arguments that from the remaining sources, about 10 are Galactic,
but our study does not allow us to identify which of the sources fall in that
specific category. The relatively large proper motions observed for the sources
in HH~124~IRS suggest that this region is located at about 400 pc from the Sun.

of independence relationships for investigating brain networks, genomic
networks, and other measurement technologies. Estimation of these graphs
depends on two steps. First is a feature extraction by summarizing measurements
within a parcellation, regional or set definition to create nodes. Secondly,
these summaries are then used to create a graph representing relationships of
interest. In this manuscript we study the impact of dimension reduction on
graphs that describe different notions of relations among a set of random
variables. We are particularly interested in undirected graphs that capture the
random variables' independence and conditional independence relations. A
dimension reduction procedure can be any mapping from high dimensional spaces
to low dimensional spaces. We exploit a general framework for modeling the raw
data and advocate that in estimating the undirected graphs, any acceptable
dimension reduction procedure should be a graph-homotopic mapping, i.e., the
graphical structure of the data after dimension reduction should inherit the
main characteristics of the graphical structure of the raw data. We show that,
in terms of inferring undirected graphs that characterize the conditional
independence relations among random variables, many dimension reduction
procedures, such as the mean, median, or principal components, cannot be
theoretically guaranteed to be a graph-homotopic mapping. The implications of
this work are broad. In the most charitable setting for researchers, where the
correct node definition is known, graphical relationships can be contaminated
merely via the dimension reduction. The manuscript ends with a concrete
example, characterizing a subset of graphical structures such that the
dimension reduction procedure using the principal components can be a
graph-homotopic mapping.

retinal waves drives activity-dependent developmental programs. Early-stage
waves mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) manifest as slow, spreading bursts of
action potentials. They are believed to be initiated by the spontaneous firing
of Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), whose dense, recurrent connectivity then
propagates this activity laterally. Their extended inter-wave intervals and
shifting wave boundaries are the result of the slow after-hyperpolarization of
the SACs creating an evolving mosaic of recruitable and refractory cells, which
can and cannot participate in waves, respectively. Recent evidence suggests
that cholinergic waves may be modulated by the extracellular concentration of
ACh. Here, we construct a simplified, biophysically consistent,
reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves capable of recapitulating
wave dynamics observed in mice retina recordings. The dense, recurrent
connectivity of SACs is modeled through local, excitatory coupling occurring
via the volume release and diffusion of ACh. In contrast with previous,
simulation-based models, we are able to use non-linear wave theory to connect
wave features to underlying physiological parameters, making the model useful
in determining appropriate pharmacological manipulations to experimentally
produce waves of a prescribed spatiotemporal character. The model is used to
determine how ACh mediated connectivity may modulate wave activity, and how the
noise rate and sAHP refractory period contributes to critical wave size
variability.

spectral clustering in recovering the latent labels of i.i.d. samples from a
finite mixture of nonparametric distributions. The difficulty of this label
recovery problem depends on the overlap between mixture components and how
easily a mixture component is divided into two nonoverlapping components. When
the overlap is small compared to the indivisibility of the mixture components,
the principal eigenspace of the population-level normalized Laplacian operator
is approximately spanned by the square-root kernelized component densities. In
the finite sample setting, and under the same assumption, embedded samples from
different components are approximately orthogonal with high probability when
the sample size is large. As a corollary we control the fraction of samples
mislabeled by spectral clustering under finite mixtures with nonparametric

commonly in support of some decision-making process (e.g., for design or

quantities of interest or QoIs) are generally not experimentally observable
before the prediction, since otherwise no prediction would be needed. Assessing
the validity of such extrapolative predictions, which is critical to informed
decision-making, is challenging. In classical approaches to validation, model
outputs for observed quantities are compared to observations to determine if
they are consistent. By itself, this consistency only ensures that the model
can predict the observed quantities under the conditions of the observations.
This limitation dramatically reduces the utility of the validation effort for
decision making because it implies nothing about predictions of unobserved QoIs
or for scenarios outside of the range of observations. However, there is no
agreement in the scientific community today regarding best practices for
validation of extrapolative predictions made using computational models. The
purpose of this paper is to propose and explore a validation and predictive
assessment process that supports extrapolative predictions for models with
known sources of error. The process includes stochastic modeling, calibration,
validation, and predictive assessment phases where representations of known
sources of uncertainty and error are built, informed, and tested. The proposed
methodology is applied to an illustrative extrapolation problem involving a

revealing the bulk energetic properties and ionization state of our universe

cosmological signal, and are the principal challenge faced by these
experiments. While synchrotron radiation is thought to be spectrally smooth and
described by relatively few degrees of freedom, the instrumental response to
bright foregrounds may be much more complex. To deal with such complexities, we
develop an approach that discovers contaminated spectral modes using spatial
fluctuations of the measured data. This approach exploits the fact that
foregrounds vary across the sky while the signal does not. The discovered modes
are projected out of each line-of-sight of a data cube. An angular weighting
then optimizes the cosmological signal amplitude estimate by giving preference
to lower-noise regions. Using this method, we show that it is essential for the
passband to be stable to at least ~10^{-4}. In contrast, the constraints on the
spectral smoothness of the absolute calibration are mainly aesthetic if one is
able to take advantage of spatial information. To the extent it is understood,
controlling polarization to intensity leakage at the ~10^{-2} level will also
be essential to rejecting Faraday rotation of the polarized synchrotron
emission.

theory, compressive sensing (CS) theory demonstrates that, a signal can be

Most of the conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of
fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a
signal, which are irrespective of the non-stationarity of natural signals and
cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor CS
recovery performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image
compressive sensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0
minimization. The intrinsic sparsity of natural images is enforced
substantially by sparsely representing overlapped image patches using the
adaptively learned sparsifying basis in the form of L0 norm, greatly reducing
blocking artifacts and confining the CS solution space. To make our proposed
scheme tractable and robust, a split Bregman iteration based technique is
developed to solve the non-convex L0 minimization problem efficiently.
Experimental results on a wide range of natural images for CS recovery have
shown that our proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvements
over many current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits good convergence

coexistence is expected to give rise to exotic transport properties, which,
however, have not been explored so far. Here, we report a magneto-transport

transferred between two spatially separated subspaces of a bipartite quantum

of photonic states, this process is probabilistic due to the impossibility of
performing a two-particle complete Bell state analysis with linear optics. In
order to achieve a deterministic teleportation scheme, harnessing other degrees
of freedom of a single particle, rather than a third particle, has been
proposed. Indeed, this leads to a novel type of deterministic teleportation
scheme, the so-called hybrid teleportation. Here we report the first
realization of photonic hybrid quantum teleportation from spin-to-orbital
angular momentum degrees of freedom. In our scheme, the polarization state of
photon A is transferred to orbital angular momentum of photon B. The teleported
states are visualized in real-time by means of an intensified CCD camera. The
quality of teleported states is verified by performing quantum state
tomography, which confirms an average fidelity higher than 99.4%. We believe
this experiment paves the route towards a novel way of quantum communication in

in FRII radio galaxies by Fernandes et al., was extended to cover the full
range of jet power by Punsly. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations on jet formation mainly focused on the enhancement of jet
power. In this work, we suggest that the jet efficiency could be very high even
for conventional jet power if the radiative efficiency of disk were much
smaller. We adopt the model of a thin disk with magnetically driven winds to
investigate the observational high efficiency jets in FRII radio galaxies. It
is found that the structure of a thin disk can be significantly altered by the
feedback of winds. The temperature of disk gradually decreases with increasing
magnetic field; the disk density, surface density and pressure also change
enormously. The lower temperature and higher surface density in inner disk
result in the rapid decrease of radiative efficiency. Thus, the jet efficiency
is greatly improved even the jet power is conventional. Our results can explain
the observations quite well. A theoretical maximum jet efficiency $R \sim 1000$
suggested by our calculations is large enough to explain all the high jet
efficiency in observations even considering the episodic activity of jets.

plasmon resonances for which the metal loss is overcompensated by gain. The
on-resonance transmission can vary widely from lower than --20dB to higher than
20dB for a range of gain coefficient. A reversible transition between the
high-quality amplification and the suppression can be induced by a quite small
change of gain coefficient for a moderately increased distance between the
waveguide and the resonator. It is expected that in practice a small change of
gain coefficient can be made by flexibly controlling pumping rate or utilizing
nonlinear gain. Additionally, based on the frequency-dependant model for
gain-transition susceptibility, it is shown that the wide variation of the
on-resonance transmission can also be observed for defferent detuning of the
gain-transition line-center. Such a widely controllable on-resonance
transmission is promising for applications such as well-controlled lumped
amplification of surface plasmon-polariton as well as plasmonic switching.

stellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar mass

constructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the
galaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the
star-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling
in large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce
galaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure
feedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the
mass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too
steep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. The metallicity
dependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed
mass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in
addition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution. Our simple
phenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to study

this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands

derive a new Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel

technique used for characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an

whose Fourier components in time are known. DMD terms with Fourier frequencies
near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions
of the given video frames, and the terms with Fourier frequencies bounded away
from the origin are their sparse counterparts. An approximate low-rank/sparse
separation is achieved at the computational cost of just one singular value
decomposition and one linear equation solve, thus producing results orders of
magnitude faster than a leading separation method, namely robust principal

demonstrated to work robustly in real-time with personal laptop-class computing

  v1: Major revision of arXiv:1209.1644 under a new title. v2: Minor revision",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stricker's theorem states that a Gaussian process is a semimartingale in its
natural filtration if and only if it is the sum of an independent increment
Gaussian process and a Gaussian process of finite variation, see [1983, Z.
Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 64(3)]. We consider extensions of this result to non
Gaussian infinitely divisible processes. First we show that the class of
infinitely divisible semimartingales is so large that the natural analog of
Stricker's theorem fails to hold. Then, as the main result, we prove that an
infinitely divisible semimartingale relative to the filtration generated by a
random measure admits a unique decomposition into an independent increment
process and an infinitely divisible process of finite variation. Consequently,
the natural analog of Stricker's theorem holds for all strictly representable
processes (as defined in this paper). Since Gaussian processes are strictly
representable due to Hida's multiplicity theorem, the classical Stricker's
theorem follows from our result. Another consequence is that the question when
an infinitely divisible process is a semimartingale can often be reduced to a
path property, when a certain associated infinitely divisible process is of
finite variation. This gives the key to characterize the semimartingale
property for many processes of interest. Along these lines, we characterize
semimartingales within a large class of stationary increment infinitely
divisible processes; this class includes many infinitely divisible processes,
including linear fractional processes, mixed moving averages, and supOU
processes, as particular cases. The proof of the main theorem relies on series
representations of jumps of cadlag infinitely divisible processes given in
Basse-O'Connor and Rosinski [2013, Ann. Probab. 41(6)] combined with techniques
of stochastic analysis.

exponent function, computed at the rate of the entire code, independently of
the exponential rate of the size of the bin. (ii) for this ensemble of codes,

one with a misorientation angle of $9.4^\circ$ and an out-of-plane buckling 0.6

transmission exceeds 95 % for wavelengths above 1 nm. The buckled boundaries
have a substantially lower transmission in this wavelength range, with a
minimum transmission of 20 % for the $17.9^\circ$ boundary and 40 % for the

scattering of long-wavelength flexural phonons at grain boundaries in graphene
is mainly due to out-of-plane buckling. A continuum mechanical model of the

  In doing this: i) a bound for the entropy of any lump of matter with a given

independent of the theory of gravity we use; this quantity is the variation of
the Clausius entropy of a suitable horizon when the element of matter crosses
it; ii) by making use of the equations of motion of the theory, the same
quantity is then expressed as the variation of Wald's entropy of that horizon

connected, {\it i.e} a temporal path (also called a {\em journey}) exists
between all pairs of vertices. We consider a discrete version of the problem,
where the topology is given as an evolving graph ${\cal
G}=\{G_1,G_2,...,G_{k}\}$ whose set of vertices is invariant and the set of
(directed) edges varies over time. Two cases are studied, depending on whether
a single edge or an unlimited number of edges can be crossed in a same $G_i$
(strict journeys {\it vs} non-strict journeys).
  In the case of {\em strict} journeys, a number of existing algorithms
designed for more general problems can be adapted. We adapt one of them to the
above formulation of the problem and characterize its running time complexity.
The parameters of interest are the length of the graph sequence $k=|{\cal G}|$,
the maximum {\em instant} density $\mu=max(|E_i|)$, and the {\em cumulated}
density $m=|\cup E_i|$. Our algorithm has a time complexity of $O(k\mu n)$,
where $n$ is the number of nodes. This complexity is compared to that of the
other solutions: one is always more costly (keep in mind that is solves a more
general problem), the other one is more or less costly depending on the
interplay between instant density and cumulated density. The length $k$ of the
sequence also plays a role. We characterize the key values of $k, \mu$ and $m$
for which either algorithm should be used.
  In the case of {\em non-strict} journeys, for which no algorithm is known, we
show that some pre-processing of the input graph allows us to re-use the same
algorithm than before. By chance, these operations happens to cost again
$O(k\mu n)$ time, which implies that the second problem is not more difficult
than the first.

We develop a Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for shielding. A strong advantage of
the LM test is that it only requires fitting a much simpler model that assumes
no shielding. We show that, under the null hypothesis and some mild regularity
conditions and as the detection time increases, LM test statistic for
(composite) shielding is asymptotically Chi-square with the degree of freedom
equal to the presumed number of shielding materials. We also derive the local
power of the LM test. Extensive simulation studies suggest that the test is
robust to the number and nature of the intervening materials, which owes to the
fact that common intervening materials have broadly similar attenuation

the vacuum structure and the anomaly cancellation mechanism of four dimensional

supersymmetric localization calculations in the 2d gauged linear sigma model on
the hemisphere are used to check and extend this method. The result allows us
to study the superpotential and the Weil-Petersson metric and an associated tt*

vacua at orbifold points and argue that fluxes can be chosen that fix the
complex moduli of F-theory compactifications at gauge enhancements including

most generic complex structure families of elliptic Calabi-Yau 4-fold
fibrations over a given base. We classify these families in toric ambient

the creating of matter and Yukawa structures in F-theory. We construct two

an $E_8$-type singularity on the fiber and explore their embeddings in the

interference. Here we show that in a quantum coherent graphene nanostructure
the non-local voltage is strongly modulated. Using non-local measurements, we
separate the signal in spin dependent and spin independent contributions. We
show that the spin dependent contribution is about two orders of magnitude
larger than the spin independent one, when corrected for the finite

modulated but also changes polarity as a function of the applied gate voltage.
By locally tuning the carrier density in the constriction we show that the

a spin filter device. Our results show the potential of quantum coherent

VaR forecasts which lead on average to smaller expected shortfalls. We

be associated with massive star forming galaxies, which have significantly
enriched their surroundings. To test this idea with high column density CIV
absorption systems at z~5.7, we study the projected distribution of galaxies
and characterise the environment of CIV systems in two independent quasar
lines-of-sight: J103027.01+052455.0 and J113717.73+354956.9. Using wide field
photometry (~80x60h$^{-1}$ comoving Mpc), we select bright (Muv(1350\AA)<-21.0
mag.) Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z~5.7 in a redshift slice \Delta z~0.2 and
we compare their projected distribution with z~5.7 narrow-band selected Lyman
alpha emitters (LAEs, \Delta z~0.08).
  We find that the CIV systems are located more than 10h$^{-1}$ projected
comoving Mpc from the main concentrations of LBGs and no candidate is closer
than ~5h$^{-1}$ projected comoving Mpc. In contrast, an excess of LAEs -lower
mass galaxies- is found on scales of ~10h$^{-1}$ comoving Mpc, suggesting that
LAEs are the primary candidates for the source of the CIV systems. Furthermore,
the closest object to the system in the field J1030+0524 is a faint LAE at a
projected distance of 212h$^{-1}$ physical kpc. However, this work cannot rule
out undiscovered lower mass galaxies as the origin of these absorption systems.
  We conclude that, in contrast with lower redshift examples (z<3.5), strong
CIV absorption systems at z~5.7 trace low-to-intermediate density environments
dominated by low-mass galaxies. Moreover, the excess of LAEs associated with
high levels of ionizing flux agrees with the idea that faint galaxies dominate
the ionizing photon budget at this redshift.

oscillation (QO) experiments for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+{\delta}}$ (YBCO) [3] and
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$ (Hg1201) [4]. Consequently, the observation of bulk
CDW order in YBCO was a significant development [5,6,7]. Hg1201 features
particularly high structural symmetry and recently has been demonstrated to
exhibit Fermi-liquid charge transport in the relevant temperature-doping range
of the phase diagram, whereas for YBCO and other cuprates this underlying
property of the CuO$_2$ planes is partially or fully masked [8-10]. It
therefore is imperative to establish if the pristine transport behavior of
Hg1201 is compatible with CDW order. Here we investigate Hg1201 ($T_c$ = 72 K)
via bulk Cu L-edge resonant X-ray scattering. We indeed observe CDW
correlations in the absence of a magnetic field, although the correlations and
competition with superconductivity are weaker than in YBCO. Interestingly, at
the measured hole-doping level, both the short-range CDW and Fermi-liquid
transport appear below the same temperature of about 200 K. Our result points
to a unifying picture in which the CDW formation is preceded at the higher
pseudogap temperature by $q$ = 0 magnetic order [11,12] and the build-up of
significant dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations [13]. Furthermore, the
smaller CDW modulation wave vector observed for Hg1201 is consistent with the
larger electron pocket implied by both QO [4] and Hall-effect [14]
measurements, which suggests that CDW correlations are indeed responsible for
the low-temperature QO phenomenon.

  General aspects of MOND theories are then described, after which I list
briefly presently known theories, both nonrelativistic and relativistic. Most
full-fledged theories modify the gravitational action, hinge on a0, introduce
an interpolating function between the low and high accelerations, and obey MOND
requirements in the opposite limits. These theories have much heuristic value
as proofs of various concepts (e.g., that covariant MOND theories can be
written with correct gravitational lensing). But, probably, they are, at best,
effective theories of limited applicability.
  I then outline several other promising approaches to constructing MOND
theories that strive to obtain MOND as an effective theory from deeper
concepts, for example, by modifying inertia and/or gravity as a result of
interactions with some omnipresent agent.
  Some theories do enjoy a natural appearance of a cosmological-constant-like
contribution that, furthermore, exhibits the observed connection with a0.
However, none were shown to address fully the mass discrepancies in cosmology

matter.

structure and composition of the absorbing gas in the foreground galaxy. In
particular, we find absorption over large velocity intervals (gtrsim 100 km/s)
toward both lensed images of the blazar. This suggests either that the galaxy
inclination is intermediate and that we sample velocity gradients or streaming
motions in the disk plane, that the molecular gas has a large vertical
distribution or extraplanar components, or that the absorber is not a simple
spiral galaxy but might be a merger system. The number of detected species is
now reaching a total of 42 different species plus 14 different rare
isotopologues toward the SW image, and 14 species toward the NE line-of-sight.
The abundances of CH, H2O, HCO+, HCN, and NH3 relative to H2 are found to be
comparable to those in the Galactic diffuse medium. Of all the lines detected
so far toward PKS1830-211, the ground-state line of ortho-water has the deepest

connected network, each vertex of which has initially two possible types. The
vertices may have a few additional possible states and can interact in pairs
only if they share an edge. Any (population) protocol is required to stabilize
in the initial majority. We first present and analyze a protocol with 4 states
per vertex that always computes the initial majority value, under any fair
scheduler. As we prove, this protocol is optimal, in the sense that there is no
population protocol that always computes majority with fewer than 4 states per
vertex. However this does not rule out the existence of a protocol with 3
states per vertex that is correct with high probability. To this end, we
examine a very natural majority protocol with 3 states per vertex, introduced
in [Angluin et al. 2008] where its performance has been analyzed for the clique
graph. We study the performance of this protocol in arbitrary networks. We
prove that, when the two initial states are put uniformly at random on the
vertices, this protocol converges to the initial majority with probability
higher than the probability of converging to the initial minority. In contrast,
we present an infinite family of graphs, on which the protocol can fail whp,
even when the difference between the initial majority and the initial minority
is $n - \Theta(\ln{n})$. We also present another infinite family of graphs in
which the protocol of Angluin et al. takes an expected exponential time to
converge. These two negative results build upon a very positive result
concerning the robustness of the protocol on the clique. Surprisingly, the
resistance of the clique to failure causes the failure in general graphs. Our
techniques use new domination and coupling arguments for suitably defined
processes whose dynamics capture the antagonism between the states involved.

(Cherry 1926, Moser 1956, 1958, Giorgilli 2001). The unstable and stable
manifolds intersect at an infinity of homoclinic points, generating a
complicated homoclinic tangle. In the case of simple mappings it was found (Da
Silva Ritter et al. 1987) that the domain of convergence of the formal series
extends to infinity along the invariant manifolds. This allows in practice to
study the homoclinic tangle using only series. However in the case of
Hamiltonian systems, or mappings with a finite analyticity domain,the
convergence of the series along the asymptotic manifolds is also finite. Here,
we provide numerical indications that the convergence does not reach any
homoclinic points. We discuss in detail the convergence problem in various
cases and we find the degree of approximation of the analytical invariant
manifolds to the real (numerical) manifolds as i) the order of truncation of
the series increases, and ii) we use higher numerical precision in computing
the coefficients of the series. Then we introduce a new method of series
composition, by using action-angle variables, that allows the calculation of
the asymptotic manifolds up to an a arbitrarily large extent. This is the first

heterogeneous, and to follow periodic (daily and weekly) patterns. In many
cases, the regularity and the correlation of those patterns is problematic: for
network applications, many connected users create peaks of demand; in contrast,
in peer-to-peer scenarios, having few users online results in a scarcity of
available resources. On the other hand, since connectivity patterns exhibit a
periodic behavior, they are to some extent predictable. This work shows how
this can be exploited to anticipate future user connectivity and to have
applications proactively responding to it. We evaluate the probability that any
given user will be online at any given time, and assess the prediction on
six-month availability traces from three different Internet applications.
Building upon this, we show how our probabilistic approach makes it easy to
evaluate and optimize the performance in a number of diverse network
application models, and to use them to optimize systems. In particular, we show
how this approach can be used in distributed hash tables, friend-to-friend

which naturally arises from well-known Bogoliubov transformations and is

investigated by monitoring specific ro-vibrational lines of CO2 in the 2 mm

factor of the PA signal exceeds 1200, which is due to the acoustic resonance of
the tube and the absorption enhancement of the integrating sphere relatively to

signals are highly attenuated due to the thermal conduction and diffusion

that this variation is in fact consistent with predictions for liquids with
hidden scale invariance: measures of dynamics at constant volume are invariant
along isochrones, called isomorphs in such liquids, but contributions to
fluctuations from long-wavelength fluctuations can vary. This is related to the
known non-invariance of the isothermal bulk modulus. Considering the version of
$\chi_4$ defined for the NVT ensemble, data from simulations of a binary

This is a true departure from the formal invariance expected for this quantity.

biological and technological networks. A bow-tie in a multi-layered structure
occurs when intermediate layers have much fewer components than the input and
output layers. Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks
mediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass
components, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor
types passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple
output genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.
Here, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of
multi-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find
that bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the
evolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal
number of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of
mutations on interaction intensities between components are described by
product rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.
Product-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used
sum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These
conditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the
intermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank
of the evolutionary goal. These findings can help explain the presence of
bow-ties in diverse biological systems, and can also be relevant for machine
learning applications that employ multi-layered networks.

their mechanism of transposition. Tyrosine recombinase elements (YREs) are
relatively rare and poorly understood, despite sharing characteristics with
both DNA and RNA elements. Previously, the Nematoda have been reported to have
a substantially different diversity of YREs compared to other animal phyla: the
Dirs1-like YRE retrotransposon was encountered in most animal phyla but not in
Nematoda, and a unique Pat1-like YRE retrotransposon has only been recorded
from Nematoda. We explored the diversity of YREs in Nematoda by sampling
broadly across the phylum and including 34 genomes representing the three
classes within Nematoda. We developed a method to isolate and classify YREs
based on both feature organization and phylogenetic relationships in an open
and reproducible workflow. We also ensured that our phylogenetic approach to
YRE classification identified truncated and degenerate elements, informatively
increasing the number of elements sampled. We identified Dirs1-like elements
(thought to be absent from Nematoda) in the nematode classes Enoplia and
Dorylaimia indicating that nematode model species do not adequately represent
the diversity of transposable elements in the phylum. Nematode Pat1-like
elements were found to be a derived form of another pat1-like element that is
present more widely in animals. Several sequence features used widely for the
classification of YREs were found to be homoplasious, highlighting the need for

the dynamics of N-body systems containing central black holes, or of
hierarchical triple systems with a relativistic inner binary, may not be
adequate when the goal is to study the evolution of the system over a timescale
related to relativistic secular effects, such as the precession of the
pericenter. For such problems, it may necessary to include post-Newtonian
""cross terms"" in the equations of motion in order to capture relativistic
effects consistently over the long timescales. Cross terms are post-Newtonian
(PN) terms that explicitly couple the two-body relativistic perturbations with
the Newtonian perturbations due to other bodies in the system. In this paper,
we show that the total energy and the normal component of total angular
momentum of a hierarchical triple system is manifestly conserved to Newtonian
order over the relativistic pericenter precession timescale of the inner binary
if and only if PN cross-term effects in the equations of motion are taken
carefully into account.

maintain up-to-date positions for making successful forwarding decisions. The
geographic location coordinates of the nodes by the periodic broadcasting of
beacon packets is a trendy method used by the majority geographic routing
protocols to preserve neighbour positions. We contend and display that periodic
beaconing apart from of the node mobility and traffic patterns in the network
is not nice-looking from both update cost and routing recital points of view.
We recommend the Adaptive Position Update (APU) strategy for geographic
routing, which enthusiastically adjusts the occurrence of position updates
based on the mobility dynamics of the nodes and the forwarding patterns in the
system. APU is based on two easy principles: 1) nodes whose arrangements are
harder to guess update their positions more recurrently (and vice versa), and
(ii) nodes faster to forwarding paths update their positions more recurrently
(and vice versa). Our speculative analysis, which is validated by NS2
simulations of a well-known geographic routing procedure, Greedy Perimeter
Stateless Routing Protocol (GPSR),shows that APU can drastically reduce the
update cost and pick up the routing performance in terms of packet delivery
ratio and regular end-to-end delay in assessment with periodic beaconing and
other recently proposed updating schemes. The benefits of APU are additional
confirmed by responsibility evaluations in realistic network scenarios, which
account for localization error, practical radio propagation, and sparse system.

We propose a method to capture regime transitions based on the decomposition of

energy $e_{tor}$ is not affected by rotation and remains equal to that in the

at rotation rates where $e_{tor} > e^0_{tor}$ and ending at a critical inverse
Rossby number $1/Ro_{cr}$ that is determined by the balance of the toroidal and
poloidal energy, $e_{tor} = e_{pol}$. Third, a rotation dominated regime, where
the toroidal energy $e_{tor}$ is larger than both, $e_{pol}$ and $e^0_{tor}$.
Fourth, a geostrophic turbulence regime for high rotation rates where the
toroidal energy drops below the value of non-rotating convection.

to test the $\Delta m^2$~1 eV$^2$ region of the sterile neutrino hypothesis by
observing $\nu_e$ ($\bar\nu_e$) charged current quasi-elastic signals from a
$\nu_\mu$ ($\bar\nu_\mu$) beam. MiniBooNE observed excesses of $\nu_e$ and
$\bar\nu_e$-candidate events in neutrino and anti-neutrino mode, respectively.
To date, these excesses have not been explained within the neutrino Standard
Model ($\nu$SM), the Standard Model extended for three massive neutrinos.
Confirmation is required by future experiments such as MicroBooNE. MiniBooNE
also provided an opportunity for precision studies of Lorentz violation. The
results set strict limits for the first time on several parameters of the
Standard Model-Extension, the generic formalism for considering Lorentz
violation. Most recently, an extension to MiniBooNE running, with a beam tuned
in beam-dump mode, is being performed to search for dark sector particles. This
review describes these studies, demonstrating that short baseline neutrino

hominins in Eurasian genomes, without referring to archaic hominin sequences.
We focused on mutations emerged in archaic hominins after their divergence from
modern humans (denoted as archaic-specific mutations), and identified
introgressive segments which showed significant enrichment of archaic-specific
mutations over the rest of the genome. Furthermore, boundaries of
introgressions were identified using a dynamic programming approach to
partition whole genome into segments which contained different levels of
archaic-specific mutations. We found that detected introgressions shared more
archaic-specific mutations with Altai Neanderthal than they shared with
Denisovan, and 60.3% of archaic hominin introgressions were from Neanderthals.
Furthermore, we detected more introgressions from two unknown archaic hominins
whom diverged with modern humans approximately 859 and 3,464 thousand years
ago. The latter unknown archaic hominin contributed to the genomes of the
common ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals. In total, archaic hominin
introgressions comprised 2.4% of Eurasian genomes. Above results suggested a

equation determining the energy of the hybridization state between the 1DW and
SOC modes and an analytic formula for the single-photon transmission. Through
them, we recognize that the single-photon transmission-dip position can be
changed by adjusting the SOC size and the coupling strength between the 1DW and
SOC. The transmission spectra strongly depends on the nonlocal-coupling
function between the 1DW and SOC, and holds an asymmetry line shape. At last,
we simulate the asymmetry of the single-photon transmission by a gold-based
waveguide coupled with a rectangular SOC.

the resulting equatorial superrotating jet in a vertical stratified atmosphere
of a tidally-locked hot Jupiter are investigated. Taking the hot Jupiter HD
189733b as a fiducial example, we analytically solve a set of linear equations
subject to stationary stellar heating with a uniform zonal-mean flow included.
We also extract wave information in the final equilibrium state of the
atmosphere from the radiative hydrodynamical simulation for HD 189733b by
Dobbs-Dixon & Agol (2013). We find that the analytic wave solutions are able to
qualitatively explain the three-dimensional simulation results. Studying the
vertical structure of waves allows us to explore new wave features such as the
westward tilt of wavefronts related to the Rossby-wave resonance as well as
double gyres of dispersive Rossby waves. We also make an attempt to apply our
linear wave analysis to explain some numerical features associated with the
equatorial jet development seen in the GCM by Showman & Polvani (2011). During
the spin-up phase of the equatorial jet, the acceleration of the jet as a
result of the divergence of the wave momentum flux can be in principle boosted
by the Rossby-wave resonance as the superrotating jet speed is close to the
phase speed of the Rossby waves. However, we also find that as the jet speed
increases, the Rossby-wave structure shifts eastward, while the Kelvin-wave
structure remains approximately stationary, leading to the decline of the
acceleration rate. Our analytic model of jet evolution implies that there
exists only one stable equilibrium state of the atmosphere, possibly implying
that the final state of the atmosphere is independent of initial conditions in
the linear regime. Limitations and future improvements are also discussed.

a great achievement. Its interpretation as a Brout-Englert-Higgs boson is very
plausible and appealing to complete the zoology of fundamental particles in the
Standard Model. The interplay between theorists and experimentalists that we
have witnessed has come with a huge work to determine with enough precision the
parameters of the Standard Model: couplings, masses, mixing angles. Among the
various tools developed by physicists, lattice QCD is particularly suitable to
know those parameters in the quark sector. In this report I discuss the lattice
measurement of Standard Model fundamental parameters that are closely related
to Higgs boson: its main production mode is the gluon-gluon fusion, whose the
magnitude is governed by the strong coupling constant, while its most favored
decay channel, $H \to b \bar{b}$, has a coupling proportional to the $b$ quark
mass. I outline the improvements brought by the lattice community: simulations
with $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical quarks are crucial to study how much the charm quark
impacts the strong coupling constant calculation. A non perturbative matching
between Heavy Quark Effective Theory and QCD is welcome to handle in an
appropriate way the $b$ quark physics. An extensive methodological exploration
is necessary to get rid of contribution from excited states in correlation
functions computed to extract hadron masses and decay constants. The effort to
measure the $u/d$, $s$ and $c$ quark masses is also discussed, illustrating the
benefit of using an automatic $O(a)$ improved lattice regularization.

the fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential well. Due to the
non-locality of the fractional Laplacian, it is challenging to find the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation either
analytically or numerically. We first introduce a fractional gradient flow with
discrete normalization and then discretize it by using the trapezoidal type
quadrature rule in space and the semi-implicit Euler method in time. Our method
can be used to compute the ground and first excited states not only in the
linear cases but also in the nonlinear cases. Moreover, it can be generalized
to solve the fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) with Riesz
fractional derivatives in space. Our numerical results suggest that the
eigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential
well are significantly different from those of the standard (non-fractional)
Schrodinger equation. In addition, we find that the strong nonlocal
interactions represented by the fractional Laplacian can lead to a large
scattering of particles inside of the potential well. Compared to the ground
states, the scattering of particles in the first excited states is larger.
Furthermore, boundary layers emerge in the ground states and additionally inner
layers exist in the first excited states of the fractional nonlinear
Schrodinger equation.

gravitational effect is described by these equations are lastly unknown. If
renormalizable fields are assumed, then results are obtained only in the case
of a at space. Therefore, there is still no generally recognized quantum theory
of gravitation and electromagnetism. In this work the solution of these quantum
mechanic problems are forced in some sense: the metric tensor is linearized,
and it is required that the entire system of equations is invariant with
respect to the symmetry group of the linearized Einstein equations. The field
which represents this symmetry group only allows a measurement within the
horizon to simulate the event horizon. It is shown that the number of quants of
this field is constant. There are 4 types of solutions in the 2-quantum space,
of which one has particle-like properties. This particular solution has a
gravitational effect which can be externally arbitrarily small, as compared to
its electromagnetic effect. In contrast, this does not apply to the other 3
solutions. The model might be used to explain why gravitation is so much weaker
than the electromagnetic interaction in real physics. Accordingly, the Higgs
boson is possibly not necessarily be required for the mass scale. Likewise, an
explanation could be made why gravitation and electromagnetic inter- actions
had the same intensity during the early stages of the universe. A peculiarity
of the model provides a mechanism for the Big Bang in all four types of
solutions, although there is no singularity. As a consequence of the inferred
change in the microstructure, a change in the macrostructure of the cosmos is
suggested, allowing an understanding of the particular properties of the Dark
