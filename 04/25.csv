measure must satisfy some basic laws. Most important of them is the invariance
of entanglement under local unitary operations. We show that this is no longer
true with local ${\cal {PT}}$ symmetric unitary operations. If two parties
share a maximally entangled state, then under local ${\cal {PT}}$ symmetric
unitary evolution the entropy of entanglement for pure bipartite states does
not remain invariant. Furthermore, we show that if one of the party has access
to ${\cal {PT}}$-symmetric quantum world, then a maximally entangled state in
usual quantum theory appears as a non-maximally entangled states for the other
party. This we call as the ""entanglement mismatch"" effect which can lead to the
violation of the no-signaling condition.

Almost all ice that forms under
""mild"" conditions (temperatures > -40 degrees Celsius) requires the presence of
a nucleating agent - a solid particle that facilitates the freezing process -
such as clay mineral dust, soot or bacteria. In a computer simulation, the
presence of such ice nucleating agents does not necessarily alleviate the
difficulties associated with forming ice on accessible timescales.
Nevertheless, in this work we present results from molecular dynamics
simulations in which we systematically compare homogeneous and heterogeneous
ice nucleation, using the atmospherically important clay mineral kaolinite as
our model ice nucleating agent. From our simulations, we do indeed find that
kaolinite is an excellent ice nucleating agent but that contrary to
conventional thought, non-basal faces of ice can nucleate at the basal face of
kaolinite. We see that in the liquid phase, the kaolinite surface has a drastic
effect on the density profile of water, with water forming a dense, tightly
bound first contact layer. Monitoring the time evolution of the water density
reveals that changes away from the interface may play an important role in the
nucleation mechanism. The findings from this work suggest that heterogeneous
ice nucleating agents may not only enhance the ice nucleation rate, but also
alter the macroscopic structure of the ice crystals that form.

developed two variants of hyperonic EoS tables: in the np$\Lambda \phi$ case
the repulsive hyperon-hyperon interaction mediated by the strange $\phi$ meson
is taken into account, and in the np$\Lambda$ case it is not. The EoS tables
for the two cases encompass wide range of density ($10^{-12}$ to $\sim$ 1

0.60). The effects of $\Lambda$ hyperons on thermodynamic quantities such as
free energy per baryon, pressure, or entropy per baryon are investigated and
found to be significant at high densities. The cold, $\beta$-equilibrated EoS
(with the crust included self-consistently) results in a 2.1 M$_{\odot}$

consequence of inherent characteristics of these metals and their inability to

Particularly, we examine faculty-level data collected from different sources,
covering 55 Italian Economics faculties in the academic year 2009/2010. Making
use of a clustering framework, we introduce a biclustering model that accounts
for both homogeneity/heterogeneity among faculties and correlations between

of the institutions, namely the Private and Public profiles . Each of the two
groups has its own peculiar features and its own group-specific list of

considered in current stellar evolution codes thanks to phenomenologically
derived diffusion coefficients. Recent local numerical simulations (Prat &
Ligni\`eres 2013, A&A, 551, L3) suggest that the coefficient for radial
turbulent diffusion due to radial differential rotation satisfies $D_{\rm
t}\simeq0.058\kappa/Ri$, in qualitative agreement with Zahn's model. However,
this model does not apply when differential rotation is strong with respect to
stable thermal stratification or when chemical stratification has a significant
dynamical effect, a situation encountered at the outer boundary of
nuclear-burning convective cores. We extend our numerical study to consider the
effects of chemical stratification and of strong shear, and compare the results
with prescriptions used in stellar evolution codes. We performed local, direct
numerical simulations of stably stratified, homogeneous, sheared turbulence in
the Boussinesq approximation. The regime of high thermal diffusivities, typical
of stellar radiative zones, is reached thanks to the so-called
small-P\'eclet-number approximation, which is an asymptotic development of the
Boussinesq equations in this regime. The dependence of the diffusion
coefficient on chemical stratification was explored in this approximation.
Maeder's extension of Zahn's model in the strong-shear regime is not supported
by our results, which are better described by a model found in the geophysical
literature. As regards the effect of chemical stratification, our quantitative
estimate of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the mean gradient of
mean molecular weight leads to the formula $D_{\rm t}\simeq
0.45\kappa(0.12-Ri_\mu)/Ri$, which is compatible in the weak-shear regime with
the model of Maeder & Meynet (1996, A&A, 313, 140).

simple and efficient algorithms that generate multi-term orthonormal entangled
Bell-like bases. All algorithms thus far known for constructing entangled bases
turn out to be special cases of our method. The Bell-like states in any basis
is superposition of $2^m$-terms with equal probabilities (that is, their
amplitudes being $\pm 1/\sqrt{2^m}$). The orthogonality of the basis does not
permit arbitrary amplitudes. The quantum correlations of these bases are
investigated; we find that the Bell-like bases obtained using different
controlled-unitaries have different entanglement contents. We also learn that
monogamy score is able to distinguish these bases in the situations where other
quantum correlations fail to do so indicating that monogamy score is a more
fundamental quantum correlation measure. Our approach can be extended to qudit
systems as well.

binary systems at the onset of super-Eddington mass transfer. We incorporate
the physics of ideal inviscid hydrodynamical flow, Newtonian self-gravity, and
radiation transport on a three-dimensional uniformly rotating cylindrical
Eulerian grid. Care has been taken to conserve the key physical quantities such
as angular momentum and energy. Our new method conserves total energy to a
higher degree of accuracy than other codes that are presently being used to
model mass-transfer in DWD systems. We present the results of verification
tests and we simulate the first 20+ orbits of a binary system of mass ratio q =
0.7 at the onset of dynamically unstable direct impact mass transfer. The mass
transfer rate quickly exceeds the critical Eddington limit by many orders of
magnitude, and thus we are unable to model a trans-Eddington phase. It appears
that radiation pressure does not significantly effect the accretion flow in the
highly super-Eddington regime. An optically thick common envelope forms around
the binary within a few orbits. Although this envelope quickly exceeds the
spatial domain of the computational grid, the fraction of the common envelope
that exceeds zero gravitational binding energy is extremely small, suggesting
that radiation-driven mass loss is insignificant in this regime. It remains to
be seen whether simulations that capture the trans-Eddington phase of such
flows will lead to the same conclusion or show that substantial material gets
expelled.

uncomfortably large if $f_{\rm eff}/f_0 \gtrsim {\cal O}(100)$ as suggested by
the recent BICEP2 results. We note that the KNP mechanism can be realized with
the anomaly coefficients of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ if the number of axions $N$ is
large as $N\ln N\gtrsim 2\ln (f_{\textrm{eff}}/f_0)$, in which case the

scenario which requires $N \sim f_{\textrm{eff}}^2/f_0^2$, the KNP mechanism
has a virtue of not invoking to a too large number of axions, although it
requires a specific alignment of the anomaly coefficients, which can be
achieved with a probability of ${\cal O}(f_0/f_{\rm eff})$ under a random
choice of the anomaly coefficients. We also present a simple model realizing a
multiple axion monodromy along the inflaton direction.

field evolving on a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
background. We consider cosmological models including the Hilbert-Einstein
curvature term and the $N$ degree monomial of the scalar field nonminimally
coupled to gravity. The potential of the scalar field is the $n$ degree
monomial or polynomial. We describe several qualitatively different types of
dynamics depending on values of power indices $N$ and $n$. We identify that
three main possible pictures correspond to $n<N$, $N<n<2N$ and $n>2N$ cases.
Some special features connected with the important cases of $N=n$ (including
the quadratic potential with quadratic coupling) and $n=2N$ (which shares its
asymptotics with the potential of the Higgs-driven inflation) are described
separately. A global qualitative analysis allows us to cover the most
interesting cases of small $N$ and $n$ by a limiting number of phase-space
diagrams. The influence of the cosmological constant to the global features of
dynamics is also studied.

is introduced to estimate the responsibility of entities of an ecosystem on the
footprint of each other. It assumed that the ecosystem is comprised of end
users, service providers, and utilities. The proposed MEIO modeling approach
can be seen as a realization of the Everybody-in-the-Loop (EitL) framework,
which promotes a sustainable future using behaviors and actions that are aware
of their ubiquitous eco-socio-environment impacts. In this vision, the
behavioral changes could be initiated by providing all actors with their
footprint statement, which would be estimated using the MEIO models. First, a
naive MEIO model is proposed in the form of a graph of actions and
responsibility by considering interactions and goods transfers among the
entities and actors along four channels. Then, the unnormalized responsibility
and also the final responsibility among the actors are introduced, and then are
used to re-allocate immediate footprint of actors among themselves. The
footprint in the current model is limited to three major impacts: Water,
Energy, and GHG emissions. The naive model is then generalized to
Provider-perspective (P-perspective) and End User-perspective (E-perspective)
MEIO models in order to make it more suitable to cases where a large number of
end users are served by a provider. The E-perspective modeling approach
particularly allows estimating the footprint associated to a specific end user.
In two use cases from the auto and Telco industries, it has been observed that
the proposed MEIO models are practical and dependable in allocating footprint
to the provider and also to the end user, while i) avoiding footprint leakage
to the end users and ii) handling the large numbers end users. In addition, it
will be shown that the MEIO models could be sued to integrate Scope-3 and LCA
approaches.

collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, and surprisingly also for

confirmed in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. In this
$p_T$ range, the LHC results for pions nearly overlap the RHIC results but the
flatter spectrum at LHC implies that the energy loss in the medium must be
$\sim 40$% larger than at RHIC. At LHC, the unique and beautiful measurement of
the fractional transverse momentum imbalance
$1-\langle{\hat{p}_{T_2}/\hat{p}_{T_1}}\rangle$ of di-jets in Pb+Pb collisions
relative to p-p collisions, shows $\approx 15\%$ for jets with
$120\leq\hat{p}_{T_1}\leq 360$ GeV/c. This is a much smaller fractional jet
imbalance than the $\approx 45\%$ derived from two-particle correlations of
di-jet fragments at RHIC corresponding to jet $\hat{p}_T\approx 10-20$ GeV/c.
This presents a challenge to both theory and experiment for improved
understanding. There are many other such unresolved issues, for instance, the
absence of evidence for a $\hat{q}$ effect by observation of momentum
transferred to the medium by outgoing partons. An implied hard scattering
component for the soft physics multiplicity distributions in A+A collisions

deviation from $N_{\rm part}$ scaling. Based on recent p-p and d+A
measurements, a more physical way is presented along with several other
stimulating results and ideas from recent d+Au (p+Pb) measurements.

$\theta$-graphs with at least six cones. Given a set of points in the plane, a
$\theta$-graph partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones,
each having aperture $\theta=2\pi/m$, and adds an edge to the `closest' vertex
in each cone. We show that for any integer $k \geq 1$, $\theta$-graphs with
$4k+2$ cones have a spanning ratio of $1+2\sin(\theta/2)$ and we provide a
matching lower bound, showing that this spanning ratio tight.
  Next, we show that for any integer $k \geq 1$, $\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$
cones have spanning ratio at most
$1+2\sin(\theta/2)/(\cos(\theta/2)-\sin(\theta/2))$. We also show that
$\theta$-graphs with $4k+3$ and $4k+5$ cones have spanning ratio at most
$\cos(\theta/4)/(\cos(\theta/2)-\sin(3\theta/4))$. This is a significant
improvement on all families of $\theta$-graphs for which exact bounds are not
known. For example, the spanning ratio of the $\theta$-graph with 7 cones is
decreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 3.5132. These spanning proofs also
imply improved upper bounds on the competitiveness of the $\theta$-routing
algorithm. In particular, we show that the $\theta$-routing algorithm is
$(1+2\sin(\theta/2)/(\cos(\theta/2)-\sin(\theta/2)))$-competitive on
$\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones and that this ratio is tight.
  Finally, we present improved lower bounds on the spanning ratio of these
graphs. Using these bounds, we provide a partial order on these families of
$\theta$-graphs. In particular, we show that $\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones
have spanning ratio at least $1+2\tan(\theta/2)+2\tan^2(\theta/2)$. This is
somewhat surprising since, for equal values of $k$, the spanning ratio of
$\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones is greater than that of $\theta$-graphs with
$4k+2$ cones, showing that increasing the number of cones can make the spanning
ratio worse.

particular focussing on the issues raised by their use in inflationary models

the large-field and low-energy regimes coincide the scalar dynamics is most
effectively described in terms of an asymptotic large-field expansion whose
form can be dictated by approximate symmetries, which also help control the
size of quantum corrections. We discuss several possible symmetries that can
achieve this, including pseudo-Goldstone inflatons characterized by a coset
$G/H$ (based on abelian and non-abelian, compact and non-compact symmetries),
as well as symmetries that are intrinsically higher dimensional. Besides the
usual trigonometric potentials of Natural Inflation we also find in this way
simple {\em large-field} power laws (like $V \propto \phi^2$) and exponential
potentials, $V(\phi) = \sum_{k} V_k \; e^{-k \phi/M}$. Both of these can
describe the data well and give slow-roll inflation for large fields without
the need for a precise balancing of terms in the potential. The exponential
potentials achieve large $r$ through the limit $|\eta| \ll \epsilon$ and so
predict $r \simeq \frac83(1-n_s)$; consequently $n_s \simeq 0.96$ gives $r
\simeq 0.11$ but not much larger (and so could be ruled out as measurements on
$r$ and $n_s$ improve). We examine the naturalness issues for these models and
give simple examples where symmetries protect these forms, using both
pseudo-Goldstone inflatons (with non-abelian non-compact shift symmetries
following familiar techniques from chiral perturbation theory) and
extra-dimensional models.

selected in the 2500 deg^2 South Pole Telescope survey and observed with the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. We divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20
clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an X-ray fit to all
clusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the
temperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the
temperature profile over 0<r<1.5R500, which would be impossible on a
per-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on
average, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first
constraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 to
z=1.2. We find that high-z (0.6<z<1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler both
in the inner (r<0.1R500) and outer (r>R500) regions than their low-z
(0.3<z<0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with
measured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average
pressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Overall, our observed
pressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,
suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the
core. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at
r<0.7R500. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r>R500 in
our high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due
to the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 keV) halos, which would go
undetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. This
work demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved cluster
properties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but the
number of observed clusters is high.

consumption and ejection of vast quantities of gas. In contrast, the
conventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning a
large gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due to
external ram pressure. This picture needs revision. Our modern understanding of
the baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the
fresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping events
occur, a process we call overconsumption. We compile measurements from the
literature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to
determine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas
stripping events -- either direct stripping of the disk (ram pressure
stripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or from
internally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. The observed
timescales show significant deviation from the evolution expected for gas
stripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is much
more efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellites
before orbit-based stripping occurs. Given the strong redshift evolution of
star formation rates, at high redshift (z > 1.5) even moderate outflow rates
will lead to extremely short quenching times with the expectation that such
satellites will be quenched almost immediately following the cessation of
cosmological inflow, regardless of stripping events. Observations of high
redshift satellites give an indirect but sensitive measure of the outflow rate
with current measurements suggesting that outflows are no larger than 2.5 times
the star formation rate for galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^{10.5} solar
masses.

estimate the rotation velocities in their outer parts. We derive baryonic

baryons constitute at least 30$\%$ of the total mass. Despite the star
formation having injected $\sim$10$^{56}$ ergs in the ISM in the last $\sim$500

to shed light on the processes which regulate the mass distribution in
different environments. While the mass functions in the field and in its finer
environments (groups, binary and single systems) are well matched in the local
universe down to the completeness limit of the observational sample, the model
over-predicts the number of low mass galaxies in the field at z~0.6 and in
clusters at both redshifts. Above M_*=10^10.25 M_sun, it reproduces the
observed similarity of the cluster and field mass functions, but not the
observed evolution. Our results point out two shortcomings of the model: an
incorrect treatment of cluster-specific environmental effects and an
over-efficient galaxy formation at early times (as already found by e.g.
Weinmann et al. 2012). Next, we consider only simulations. Using also the Guo
et al. (2011) model, we find that the high mass end of the mass functions
depends on halo mass: only very massive halos host massive galaxies, with the
result that their mass function is flatter. Above M_*=10^9.4 M_sun, simulations
show an evolution in the number of the most massive galaxies in all the
environments. Mass functions obtained from the two prescriptions are different,
however results are qualitatively similar, indicating that the adopted recipes
to model the evolution of central and satellite galaxies still have to be
better implemented in semi-analytic models.

parameter is only sensitive to quantum corrections from physical states.
Starting from a scale-free electroweak sector at tree-level, we postulate that
quantum effects of heavy right-handed neutrinos induce a mass term for a scalar
weak doublet that contains the dark matter particle. In turn, below the scale
of heavy neutrinos, the dark matter sector sets the scale of the Higgs
potential. We show that this framework can lead to a Higgs mass that respects
physical naturalness, while also providing a viable scalar dark matter
candidate, realistic light neutrino masses, and the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe via leptogenesis. The proposed scenario can remain perturbative and
stable up to the Planck scale, thereby accommodating simple extensions to
include a high scale (2\times 10^{16} GeV) inflationary sector, implied by
recent measurements. In that case, our model typically predicts that the dark
matter scalar is close to 1 TeV in mass and could be accessible in near future
direct detection experiments.

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there have been growing interests in solving consensus optimization
problems in a multi-agent network. In this paper, we develop a decentralized
algorithm for the consensus optimization problem
$$\min\limits_{x\in\mathbb{R}^p}~\bar{f}(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n
f_i(x),$$ which is defined over a connected network of $n$ agents, where each
function $f_i$ is held privately by agent $i$ and encodes the agent's data and
objective. All the agents shall collaboratively find the minimizer while each
agent can only communicate with its neighbors. Such a computation scheme avoids
a data fusion center or long-distance communication and offers better load
balance to the network.
  This paper proposes a novel decentralized EXact firsT-ordeR Algorithm
(abbreviated as EXTRA) to solve the consensus optimization problem. ""exact""
means that it can converge to the exact solution. EXTRA can use a fixed large
step size, {which is independent of the network size}, and has synchronized
iterations. The local variable of every agent $i$ converges uniformly and
consensually to an exact minimizer of $\bar{f}$. In contrast, the well-known
decentralized gradient descent (DGD) method must use diminishing step sizes in
order to converge to an exact minimizer. EXTRA and DGD have the same choice of
mixing matrices and similar per-iteration complexity. EXTRA, however, uses the
gradients of last two iterates, unlike DGD which uses just that of last
iterate.
  EXTRA has the best known convergence rates among the existing first-order
decentralized algorithms. Specifically, if $f_i$'s are convex and have
Lipschitz continuous gradients, EXTRA has an ergodic convergence rate
$O(\frac{1}{k})$ in terms of the first-order optimality residual. If $\bar{f}$
is also restricted strongly convex, EXTRA converges to an optimal solution at a
linear rate $O(C^{-k})$ for some constant $C>1$.

basis of experimental data obtained at three frequencies modeled frequency and
phase response and their changes during losing of freshness and appearance of
destructive processes. Discussion and conclusions. In fresh and stale fruit
modulus and phase of the impedance at low and high frequencies have
characteristic differences. But this is especially evident on the
phase-frequency characteristic, which can be seen that the value of the phase
with the loss of freshness at low frequency decreases and increases at high
more than twice during one week. Therefore, to assess the functional state of
fresh and stale products we suggest use phase portraits of phase response.

problem that has received increasing research attention. Given the huge amount

shown promising results, especially when they are underpinned by a learned

studied in the past decades, most existing algorithms are impractical to handle
large-scale data sets. In this paper, we present an image similarity learning
method that can scale well in both the number of images and the dimensionality
of image descriptors. To this end, similarity comparison is restricted to each
sample's local neighbors and a discriminative similarity measure is induced
from large margin neighborhood embedding. We also exploit the ensemble of
projections so that high-dimensional features can be processed in a set of
lower-dimensional subspaces in parallel without much performance compromise.
The similarity function is learned online using a stochastic gradient descent
algorithm in which the triplet sampling strategy is customized for quick
convergence of classification performance. The effectiveness of our proposed
model is validated on several data sets with scales varying from tens of
thousands to one million images. Recognition accuracies competitive with the
state-of-the-art performance are achieved with much higher efficiency and

called Hanle effect, provides an unique insight into spin properties of a
non-magnetic material. In practice, the spin signal is fitted to the analytic
solution of the spin Bloch equation, which accounts for diffusion, relaxation
and precession effects on spin. The analytic formula, however, is derived for
an infinite length of the 1D spin channel. This is usually not satisfied in the
real devices. The finite size of the channel length $l_{\text{dev}}$ leads to
confinement of spins and increase of spin accumulation. Moreover, reflection of
spins from the channel ends leads to spin interference, altering the
characteristic precession lineshape. In this work we study the influence of
finite $l_{\text{dev}}$ on the Hanle lineshape and show when it can lead to a
two-fold discrepancy in the extracted spin coefficients. We propose the
extension of the Hanle analytic formula to include the geometrical aspects of
the real device and get an excellent agreement with a finite-element model of
spin precession, where this geometry is explicitly set. We also demonstrate
that in the limit of a channel length shorter than the spin relaxation length
$\lambda_{s}$, the spin diffusion is negligible and a 0D spin transport
description, with Lorentzian precession dependence applies. We provide a
universal criterion for which transport description, 0D or 1D, to apply
depending on the ratio $l_{\text{dev}}/\lambda_{s}$ and the corresponding
accuracy of such a choice.

properties of force networks in dense particulate systems. The presented
approach is based on persistent homology and allows for extracting precise,
quantitative measures that describe the evolution of geometric features of the
interparticle forces, without necessarily considering the details related to
individual contacts between particles. The networks considered emerge from
discrete element simulations of two dimensional particulate systems consisting
of compressible frictional circular disks. We quantify the evolution of the
networks for slowly compressed systems undergoing jamming transition. The main
findings include uncovering significant but localized changes of force networks
for unjammed systems, global (system-wide) changes as the systems evolve
through jamming, to be followed by significantly less dramatic evolution for
the jammed states. We consider both connected components, related in loose
sense to force chains, and loops, and find that both measures provide a
significant insight into the evolution of force networks. In addition to
normal, we consider also tangential forces between the particles and find that
they evolve in the consistent manner. Consideration of both frictional and
frictionless systems leads us to the conclusion that friction plays a
significant role in determining the dynamical properties of the considered
networks. We find that the proposed approach describes the considered networks
in a precise yet tractable manner, allowing to identify novel features which
could be difficult or impossible to describe using other approaches.

interactions at the molecular scale, whose sheer size obfuscates understanding.
In light of limited experimental data, many parameters of such dynamics are
unknown, and thus models built on the detailed, mechanistic viewpoint overfit
and are not predictive. At the other extreme, simple ad hoc models of complex
processes often miss defining features of the underlying systems. Here we
propose an approach that instead constructs phenomenological, coarse-grained
models of network dynamics that automatically adapt their complexity to the
amount of available data. Such adaptive models lead to accurate predictions
even when microscopic details of the studied systems are unknown due to
insufficient data. The approach is computationally tractable, even for a
relatively large number of dynamical variables, allowing its software
realization, named Sir Isaac, to make successful predictions even when
important dynamic variables are unobserved. For example, it matches the known
phase space structure for simulated planetary motion data, avoids overfitting
in a complex biological signaling system, and produces accurate predictions for
a yeast glycolysis model with only tens of data points and over half of the
interacting species unobserved.

precision measurement and quantum information processing. These applications
depend vitally on the accurate measurement of transition energies between the
OH levels. Significant sources of systematic errors in these measurements are
shifts based on the geometric phase arising from the magnetic and electric
fields used for manipulating OH. In this article, we present these geometric
phases for fields that vary harmonically in time, as in the Ramsey technique.
Our calculation of the phases is exact within the description provided by our
recent analytic solution of an effective Stark-Zeeman Hamiltonian for the OH
ground state. This Hamiltonian has earlier been shown to model experimental
data accurately. We find that the OH geometric phases exhibit rich structure as
a function of the field rotation rate. Remarkably, we find rotation rates where
the geometric phase accumulated by a specific state is zero, or where the
relative geometric phase between two states vanishes. We expect these findings
to be of importance to precision experiments on OH involving time-varying
fields. More specifically, our analysis quantitatively characterizes an
important item in the error budget for precision spectroscopy of ground state
OH.

this second paper in a series, we explore the behavior of this low Mach number
convection in mixed hydrogen/helium layers on the surface of a neutron star
using two-dimensional simulations with the Maestro code. Maestro takes
advantage of the highly subsonic flow field by filtering dynamically
unimportant sound waves while retaining local compressibility effects, such as
those due to stratification and energy release from nuclear reactions. In these
preliminary calculations, we find that the rp-process approximate network
creates a convective region that is split into two layers. While this splitting
appears artificial due to the approximations of the network regarding nuclear
flow out of the breakout reaction 18Ne(a,p)21Na, these calculations hint at
further simplifications and improvements of the burning treatment for use in
subsequent calculations in three dimensions for a future paper.

more sophisticated statistical methodologies to discover interesting patterns
and better extract information from these data. The large scale of the data
often results in challenging high-dimensional estimation problems where only a
minority of the data shows specific grouping patterns. To address these
emerging challenges, we develop a new clustering methodology that introduces
the idea of a regularization path into unsupervised learning. A regularization
path for a clustering problem is created by varying the degree of sparsity
constraint that is imposed on the differences between objects via the minimax
concave penalty with adaptive tuning parameters. Instead of providing a single
solution represented by a cluster assignment for each object, the method
produces a short sequence of solutions that determines not only the cluster
assignment but also a corresponding number of clusters for each solution. The
optimization of the penalized loss function is carried out through an MM
algorithm with block coordinate descent. The advantages of this clustering
algorithm compared to other existing methods are as follows: it does not
require the input of the number of clusters; it is capable of simultaneously
separating irrelevant or noisy observations that show no grouping pattern,
which can greatly improve data interpretation; it is a general methodology that
can be applied to many clustering problems. We test this method on various
simulated datasets and on gene expression data, where it shows better or
competitive performance compared against several clustering methods.

Si iv 1393.76 {\AA} lines in the sunspot. The intensity change is about 30%.
The Doppler shift oscillation reveals a sawtooth pattern with an amplitude of
about 10 km/s in Si iv. In the umbra the Si iv oscillation lags those of Cii

as the Doppler shift changes from redshift to blueshift. However, we
demonstrate that this increase is caused by the superposition of two emission
components. We then perform detailed analysis of the line profiles at a few
selected locations on the slit. The temporal evolution of the line core is
dominated by the following behavior: a rapid excursion to the blue side,
accompanied by an intensity increase, followed by a linear decrease of the
velocity to the red side. The maximum intensity slightly lags the maximum
blueshift in Si iv, whereas the intensity enhancement slightly precedes the
maximum blueshift in Mgii. We find a positive correlation between the maximum

light curves. The plateau is believed to be the result of a recombination wave
that propagates through the outflowing massive hydrogen envelope. Here, we
analytically investigate the transition from a fully ionized envelope to a
partially recombined one and its effects on the SN light curve. The motivation
is to establish the underlying processes which dominate the evolution at late
times when recombination takes place in the envelope, yet early enough so that
$^{56}$Ni decay is a negligible source of energy. We assume a simple, yet
adequate, hydrodynamic profile of the envelope and study the mechanisms which
dominate the energy emission and the observed temperature. We consider the
diffusion of photons through the envelope while analyzing the ionization
fraction and the coupling between radiation and gas. We find that once
recombination starts, the observed temperature decreases slowly in time.
However, in a typical red supergiant (RSG) explosion, the recombination wave
does not affect the bolometric luminosity immediately. Only at later times, the
cooling wave may reach layers that are deep enough to affect the luminosity. We
find that the plateau is not a generic result of a recombination process in
expanding gas. Instead it depends on the density profile of the parts of the
envelope which undergo recombination. Our results are useful to investigate the
light curves of RSG explosions. We show the resulting light curves of two
examples of RSG explosions according to our model and discuss their
compatibility with observations. In addition, we improve the analytical
relations between the plateau luminosity and plateau duration to the properties
of the pre-explosion progenitor (Arnett 1980; Popov 1993).

its topology does not change with time in the linear regime in the standard

effects are introduced due to the finite size of pixels used to define the
density field, non-linear gravitational evolution, redshift-space distortion,
shot noise (discrete sampling), and bias in the distribution of the density
field tracers. We study the various systematic effects on the genus curve to a
great accuracy by using the Horizon Run 2 simulation of a {\Lambda}CDM
cosmology. We numerically measure the genus curve from the gravitationally
evolved matter and dark matter halo density fields. It is found that all the
non-Gaussian deviations due to the systematic effects can be modeled by using a
few low-order Hermite polynomials from H0 to H4. We compare our results with
the analytic theories whenever possible, and find many new terms in the Hermite
series that are making significant contributions to the non-Gaussian

model that has been widely studied in statistics, physics and computer science.
In its simplest form, the model is a random graph with two equal-sized
clusters, with intra-cluster edge probability p, and inter-cluster edge
probability q. We focus on the sparse case, i.e., p, q = O(1/n), which is
practically more relevant and also mathematically more challenging. A
conjecture of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore and Zdeborova, based on ideas from
statistical physics, predicted a specific threshold for clustering. The
negative direction of the conjecture was proved by Mossel, Neeman and Sly
(2012), and more recently the positive direction was proven independently by
Massoulie and Mossel, Neeman, and Sly.
  In many real network clustering problems, nodes contain information as well.
We study the interplay between node and network information in clustering by
studying a labeled block model, where in addition to the edge information, the
true cluster labels of a small fraction of the nodes are revealed. In the case
of two clusters, we show that below the threshold, a small amount of node
information does not affect recovery. On the other hand, we show that for any
small amount of information efficient local clustering is achievable as long as
the number of clusters is sufficiently large (as a function of the amount of
revealed information).

""foreseer"" adversary. For both models, the adversaries are placing themselves
arbitrarily on the routes, keeping their placement fixed throughout the
transmission block. This placement may or may not be known to the transmitter.
The adversaries can choose their best modification strategy to increase the
error at the legitimate receiver, subject to a maximum distortion constraint.
We investigate the communication rates that can be achieved in the presence of
the two types of adversaries and the channel (benign) stochastic behavior. For
memoryless adversaries, the capacity is derived. Our method is to use the
typical set of the anticipated received signal for all possible adversarial
strategies (including their best one) in a compound channel that also captures
adversarial placement. For the foreseer adversaries, which have enhanced
observation capabilities compared to the memoryless ones, we propose a new
coding scheme to guarantee resilience, i.e., recovery of the codeword
independently of the adversarial (best) choice. We derive an achievable rate
and we propose an upper bound on the capacity. We evaluate our general results

gain insights.

response of submicron sized crystals it is crucial to determine the dislocation
distribution near the boundaries. In this paper a phase field type of continuum
theory of the time evolution of an ensemble of parallel edge dislocations with
identical Burgers vectors, corresponding to the dislocation geometry near

scale free ($1/r$), apart from the average dislocation spacing the theory
cannot contain any length scale parameter. As shown, the continuum theory

tunneling is studied through both exact diagonalization and mean field theory
(MFT). When pair tunneling is strong enough, the ground state wavefunction
predicted by the MFT is complex and doubly degenerate while the quantum ground
state wavefunction is always real and unique. The time reversal symmetry is
spontaneously broken when the system transfers from the quantum ground state
into one of the mean field ground states upon a small perturbation. As the gap
between the lowest two levels decreases exponentially with particle number, the
required perturbation inducing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is
infinitesimal for particle number of typical cold atom systems. The quantum
ground state is further analyzed with the Penrose-Onsager criterion, and is
found to be a fragmented condensate. The state also develops the pair
correlation and has non-vanishing pair order parameter instead of the
conventional single particle order parameter. When this model is generalized to
optical lattice, a pair superfluid can be generated. The mean field ground
state can be regarded as effective ground state in this simple model. The
detailed computation for this model enables us to offer an in-depth discussion
of the relation between SSB and effective ground state, giving a glimpse on how
nonlinearity arises in the SSB of a quantum system.

the age distribution of the central stars of planetary nebulae that belong to

observations of 31 compact planetary nebulae are used to derive their central
star masses. The Bloecker tracks with the cluster IFMR result in ages, which
are unexpectedly young. We find that the Bloecker post-AGB tracks need to be
accelerated by a factor of three to fit the local white dwarf masses. This
acceleration extends the age distribution. We adjust the IFMR as a free
parameter to map the central star ages on the full age range of bulge stellar
populations. This fit requires a steeper IFMR than the cluster relation. We
find a star-formation rate in the Galactic bulge, which is approximately
constant between 3 and 10 Gyr ago. The result indicates that planetary nebulae
are mainly associated with the younger and more metal-rich bulge populations.
The constant rate of star-formation between 3 and 10 Gyr agrees with
suggestions that the metal-rich component of the bulge is formed during an
extended process, such as a bar interaction.

to forced deformation provide a context for testing hypotheses about the
dynamics and rheology of the mantle. Here our hypothesis is that the aggregate
viscosity of partially molten mantle is anisotropic, and that this anisotropy
arises from deviatoric stresses in the rock matrix. We formulate a model of
pipe Poiseuille flow based on theory by Takei and Holtzman [2009a] and Takei
and Katz [2013]. Pipe Poiseuille is a configuration that is accessible to
laboratory experimentation but for which there are no published results. We
analyse the model system through linearised analysis and numerical simulations.
This analysis predicts two modes of melt segregation: migration of melt from
the centre of the pipe toward the wall and localisation of melt into
high-porosity bands that emerge near the wall, at a low angle to the shear
plane. We compare our results to those of Takei and Katz [2013] for plane
Poiseuille flow; we also describe a new approximation of radially varying
anisotropy that improves the self-consistency of models over those of Takei and
Katz [2013]. This study provides a set of baseline, quantitative predictions to
compare with future laboratory experiments on forced pipe Poiseuille flow of
partially molten mantle.

consistent with the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The obtained effective
interactions contain extra parameters reflecting the Higgs mixing effect. Next,
We study the constraints on the anomalous coupling constants of H from both the
requirement of the unitarity of the S matrix and the exclusion bounds on the SM
Higgs boson obtained from the experimental data at the 7--8 TeV LHC. From this
we obtain the available range of the anomalous coupling constants of H, with
which H is not excluded by the yet known theoretical and experimental
constraints. We then study the signatures of H at the 14 TeV LHC. In this
paper, we suggest taking weak-boson scattering and pp to VH* to VVV as
sensitive processes for probing H model independently at the 14 TeV LHC. We
take several examples with the anomalous HVV coupling constants in the
available ranges to do the numerical study. a full tree-level calculation at
the hadron level is given with signals and backgrounds carefully calculated. We
impose a series of proper kinematic cuts to effectively suppress the
backgrounds. It is shown that, in both the VV scattering and the pp to VH* to
VVV processes, H boson can be discovered from the invariant mass distributions
of the final state particles with reasonable integrated luminosity. Especially,
in the pp to VH* to VVV process, the invariant mass distribution of the final
state jets can show a clear resonance peak of H. Finally, we propose several
physical observables from which the values of the anomalous coupling constants
f_W and f_{WW} can be measured experimentally.

the consistency of each model by demanding a simultaneous account of the
azimuthal, the transverse momentum, and the centrality dependence of the data

independent energy-loss models $dE/dx= \kappa(T) x^z T^{2+z} \zeta_q$ that,
when coupled to bulk constrained temperature fields T(x,t), can account for the
current data at the $\chi^2<2$ level with different temperature-dependent
jet-medium couplings and path-length dependence exponents $0\le z \le 2$. We
test the sensitivity of predictions to different skewed energy-loss
fluctuations via a convenient scaling factor distributed in a finite range $0<
\zeta_q < 2+q$ with unit mean. While a previously proposed AdS/CFT jet-energy
loss model with a temperature-independent jet-medium coupling as well as a
near-$T_c$ dominated, pQCD-inspired energy-loss scenario are shown to be
inconsistent with the LHC data, once the parameters are constrained by fitting
to RHIC results, we find several new solutions with a temperature-dependent
jet-medium coupling. We conclude that the current level of statistical and
systematic uncertainties of the measured data does not allow a constraint on

The competition between the different phonon-induced orderings clearly shows a
repulsive interaction between phonons at small and large wavevector transfers.
We further discuss the influence of phonon-mediated interactions on
electronically-driven instabilities induced by onsite, nearest neighbor and
next-to-nearest neighbor density-density interactions. We find an extension of
the parameter regime of the spin density wave order going along with an
increase of the critical scales where ordering occurs, and a suppression of

routinely characterised experimentally to understand their acoustic performance
as part of the continuing trend for quiet, high efficiency design. The
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) method 5136 is widely used
in industry and academia to determine the sound radiated into a duct. This
involves placing the device at the centre of a long cylindrical duct with
anechoic terminations at each end to eliminate reflections. A single off-axis
microphone is used on the inlet and outlet sides that can theoretically capture
the plane-wave mode amplitudes but this does not provide enough information to
fully account for higher-order modes. In this study, the 'two-port' source
model is formulated to include higher-order modes and applied for the first
three modes as a proof of concept. This requires six independent surface
pressure measurements on each side or 'port'. The resulting experimental set-up
is much shorter than the ISO rig and does not require anechoic terminations.
The relative importance of the higher-order modes has been considered and the
inaccuracies when using the ISO method to find source sound power has been
analysed.

MeV, 300 MeV--1 GeV and 1--3 GeV from observations by the \emph{Fermi} Large
Area Telescope (LAT). We also use the \emph{Swift}--XRT flux from 0.3--10 keV
obtained from archival data. We supplement these with the 0.07--0.4 TeV
observations with MAGIC telescope, available in the literature. The detection
of source at very high energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) with a differential photon
spectral index of $2.7\pm0.3$ and the rapid variability associated with it
suggests that the emission arises from a compact region located beyond the
broad line emitting region. The plausible $\gamma$-ray emission mechanism can
then be inverse Compton scattering of IR photons from obscuring torus. Further,
the decay time of LAT flare cannot be explained by considering simple radiative
loss mechanisms. Hence, to interpret the LAT light curves, we develop a model
where the broadband emission originates from a compact region, arising
plausibly from the compression of jet matter at the recollimation zone. The
flare is then expressed as an outcome of jet deceleration probably associated
with this focusing effect. The parameters of the model are further constrained
by reproducing the broadband spectral energy distribution of the source
obtained during the flare episode. Our study suggests that the particle energy
density exceeds magnetic energy density by a large factor which in turn may
cause rapid expansion of the emission region. However, near equipartition can
be achieved towards the end of LAT flare during which the compact emission
region would have expanded to the size of jet cross-section.

evident when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size
determined solely by Planck's constant h. The observations of quantized steps
in the electric conductance have provided important insights into the physics
of mesoscopic systems and allowed for the development of quantum electronic
devices. Even though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of
electric charges, it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In
its most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi
gas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with
dimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength. Here we report on the
observation of quantized conductance in the transport of neutral atoms. We
employ high resolution lithography to shape light potentials that realize
either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These constrictions
are imprinted on a quasi two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting two
adjustable reservoirs of quantum degenerate fermionic lithium atoms. By tuning
either a gate potential or the transverse confinement of the constrictions, we
observe distinct plateaus in the conductance for atoms. The conductance in the
first plateau is found to be equal to 1/h, the universal conductance quantum.
For low gate potentials we find good agreement between the experimental data
and the Landauer formula, with all parameters determined a priori. Our
experiment constitutes the cold atom version of a mesoscopic device and can be
readily extended to more complex geometries and interacting quantum gases.

containers with finite volumes. We consider systems where the container
restricts the motions of particles combining two familiar methods: spherically
symmetric linear potential and the container edge wall. In such systems, the
following two segregation patterns are observed. When the container radius is
large enough, more weakly fluctuated particles accumulate around the center of
the container than strongly fluctuated particles. On the other hand, inverted
distributions of strongly and weakly fluctuated particles are observed when the
container radius is small. We also found a similar segregation and phase
inversion if such particle mixtures construct a chain (hetero-fluctuated

the qualitative mechanism and the relationships for the biopolymer behaviors of
such phase inversions.

investigated how changes in the relative timing of incoming visual stimulation
affect the representation of object information by recording intracranial field

propose a variance component test for the total effect of SNPs and a gene
expression on disease risk. We cast the test within the causal mediation
analysis framework with the gene expression as a potential mediator. For eQTL
SNPs, the use of gene expression information can enhance power to test for the
total effect of a SNP-set, which is the combined direct and indirect effects of
the SNPs mediated through the gene expression, on disease risk. We show that
the test statistic under the null hypothesis follows a mixture of $\chi^2$
distributions, which can be evaluated analytically or empirically using the
resampling-based perturbation method. We construct tests for each of three
disease models that are determined by SNPs only, SNPs and gene expression, or
include also their interactions. As the true disease model is unknown in
practice, we further propose an omnibus test to accommodate different
underlying disease models. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the
proposed methods using simulation studies, and show that our proposed test
performs well and the omnibus test can almost reach the optimal power where the
disease model is known and correctly specified. We apply our method to

we show that SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model accurately
enough reproduces real curves of flu activity. It contains variable reaction
rate, which is a function of mean daily temperature. The proposed alternation
of variables represents SIRS equations as the second-order ODE with an outer
excitation. It reveals an origin of such predictive efficiency and explains
analytically the 1:1 dynamical resonance, which is known as a crucial property
of epidemic behavior. Our work opens the perspectives for the development of
instant short-time prediction of a normal level of flu activity based on the
weather forecast, and allow to estimate a current epidemic level more
precisely. The latter fact is based on the explicit difference between the
expected weather-based activity and instant anomalies.

in anything other than parallel-plate geometries due to its non-additive
nature. This means that for more complicated, realistic geometries one usually
has to resort to approaches such as making the crude proximity force
approximation (PFA). Another issue with calculation of Casimir forces in
real-world situations (such as with realistic materials) is that there are
continuing doubts about the status of the standard Lifshitz treatment as a true
quantum theory. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach to calculation of
Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries which sidesteps both these problems.
Our calculations are based upon a Born expansion of the Green's function of the
quantised electromagnetic vacuum field, interpreted as multiple scattering,
with the relevant coupling strength being the difference in the dielectric
functions of the various materials involved. This allows one to consider
arbitrary geometries in single or multiple scattering simply by integrating
over the desired shape, meaning that extension beyond the PFA is trivial. This
work is mostly dedicated to illustration of the method by reproduction of known
parallel-slab results -- a process that turns out to be non-trivial and
provides several useful insights. We also present a short example of
calculation of the Casimir energy for a more complicated geometry, namely that
of two finite slabs.

only relatively small lattice sizes could be considered so one can wonder
whether this Griffiths phase will not shrink and collapse into a single point,
the critical point, as the lattice size is increased to much larger values. In
this paper, the 2D eight-state Potts model is numerically studied for four
different disorder correlations. It is shown that the Griffiths phase cannot be
explained as a simple spreading of local transition temperatures caused by
disorder fluctuations. As a consequence, the vanishing of the latter in the
thermodynamic limit does not necessarily imply the collapse of the Griffiths

controlled by the disorder strength. However, for disorder correlations
decaying slower than $1/r$, no cross-over to a more usual critical behavior

using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian

multi-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for

be stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve
better accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the
CFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are
sufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift
distribution, $N(z)$, to an accuracy of 99.9% when compared to the one built
using the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\delta z = 0.01$,
reducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten

published a novel concept for pressure actuated cellular structures. This
article extends previous work by introducing a modular approach to adaptive
structures. An algorithm that breaks down any continuous target shapes into a
small number of standardized modules is presented. Furthermore it is shown how
cytoskeletons within each cell enhance the properties of adaptive modules. An
adaptive passenger seat and an aircrafts leading, trailing edge is used to
demonstrate the potential of a modular approach.

quantify input and output perturbation using similarity functions. We show that

  fixations in an object search task","8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When searching for an object in a scene, how does the brain decide where to
look next? Theories of visual search suggest the existence of a global
attentional map, computed by integrating bottom-up visual information with
top-down, target-specific signals. Where, when and how this integration is
performed remains unclear. Here we describe a simple mechanistic model of
visual search that is consistent with neurophysiological and neuroanatomical
constraints, can localize target objects in complex scenes, and predicts
single-trial human behavior in a search task among complex objects. This model
posits that target-specific modulation is applied at every point of a
retinotopic area selective for complex visual features and implements local
normalization through divisive inhibition. The combination of multiplicative
modulation and divisive normalization creates an attentional map in which
aggregate activity at any location tracks the correlation between input and
target features, with relative and controllable independence from bottom-up
saliency. We first show that this model can localize objects in both composite
images and natural scenes and demonstrate the importance of normalization for
successful search. We next show that this model can predict human fixations on
single trials, including error and target-absent trials. We argue that this
simple model captures non-trivial properties of the attentional system that
guides visual search in humans.

method can be active by sending traffic to the target device, or passive by
just observing the traffic sent by the target device. Many passive
fingerprinting methods rely on the observation of one particular network
feature, such as the rate switching behavior or the transmission pattern of
probe requests. In this work, we evaluate a set of global wireless network
parameters with respect to their ability to identify 802.11 devices. We
restrict ourselves to parameters that can be observed passively using a
standard wireless card. We evaluate these parameters for two different tests:
i) the identification test that returns one single result being the closest
match for the target device, and ii) the similarity test that returns a set of
devices that are close to the target devices. We find that the network
parameters transmission time and frame inter-arrival time perform best in
comparison to the other network parameters considered. Finally, we focus on
inter-arrival times, the most promising parameter for device identification,
and show its dependency from several device characteristics such as the
wireless card and driver but also running applications.

our pneumatic muscles. The followed approach is based on the analytical
description of the system. For this, we describe the pneumatic muscles
behaviour with an easy-invertible polynomial fit function in order to model its

media analysis. Most of the traditional approaches detect events based on fixed
temporal and spatial resolutions, while in reality events of different scales
usually occur simultaneously, namely, they span different intervals in time and
space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards multiscale event
detection using social media data, which takes into account different temporal
and spatial scales of events in the data. Specifically, we explore the
properties of the wavelet transform, which is a well-developed multiscale
transform in signal processing, to enable automatic handling of the interaction
between temporal and spatial scales. We then propose a novel algorithm to
compute a data similarity graph at appropriate scales and detect events of
different scales simultaneously by a single graph-based clustering process.
Furthermore, we present spatiotemporal statistical analysis of the noisy
information present in the data stream, which allows us to define a novel
term-filtering procedure for the proposed event detection algorithm and helps
us study its behavior using simulated noisy data. Experimental results on both
synthetically generated data and real world data collected from Twitter
demonstrate the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our
framework further extends to numerous application domains that involve
multiscale and multiresolution data analysis.

terms of 2-spinors defined over the split-quaternions. In this formalism, a
Lorentz transformation is represented as a $2 \times 2$ unitary matrix over the
split-quaternions. The corresponding Dirac equation is then derived in terms of
these 2-spinors. In this framework the $SO(3,2; {\bf R})$ symmetry of the
Lorentz invariant scalar $\overline{\psi}\psi$ is manifest.

Vincent Poor, Xinghua Shi","Nonparametric Detection of Anomalous Data Streams","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2015",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A nonparametric anomalous hypothesis testing problem is investigated, in
which there are totally n sequences with s anomalous sequences to be detected.
Each typical sequence contains m independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) samples drawn from a distribution p, whereas each anomalous sequence
contains m i.i.d. samples drawn from a distribution q that is distinct from p.
The distributions p and q are assumed to be unknown in advance.
Distribution-free tests are constructed using maximum mean discrepancy as the
metric, which is based on mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space. The probability of error is bounded as a function of the
sample size m, the number s of anomalous sequences and the number n of
sequences. It is then shown that with s known, the constructed test is
exponentially consistent if m is greater than a constant factor of log n, for
any p and q, whereas with s unknown, m should has an order strictly greater
than log n. Furthermore, it is shown that no test can be consistent for
arbitrary p and q if m is less than a constant factor of log n, thus the
order-level optimality of the proposed test is established. Numerical results
are provided to demonstrate that our tests outperform (or perform as well as)
the tests based on other competitive approaches under various cases.
