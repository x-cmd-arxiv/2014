spectrum, has brought millimeter wave (mmW) bands to the forefront of candidate
solutions for the next-generation cellular networks. Highly directional
transmissions are essential for cellular communication in these frequencies to
compensate for high isotropic path loss. This reliance on directional
beamforming, however, complicates initial cell search since the mobile and base
station must jointly search over a potentially large angular directional space
to locate a suitable path to initiate communication. To address this problem,
this paper proposes a directional cell discovery procedure where base stations
periodically transmit synchronization signals, potentially in time-varying
random directions, to scan the angular space. Detectors for these signals are
derived based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) under various
signal and receiver assumptions. The detectors are then simulated under
realistic design parameters and channels based on actual experimental
measurements at 28~GHz in New York City. The study reveals two key findings:
(i) digital beamforming can significantly outperform analog beamforming even
when the digital beamforming uses very low quantization to compensate for the
additional power requirements; and (ii) omni-directional transmissions of the
synchronization signals from the base station generally outperforms random
directional scanning.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1312.1992",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convex relaxations of non-convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems have
recently attracted significant interest. While existing relaxations globally
solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing
relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies
moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations
are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment
problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in
""tighter"" relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite
programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many
small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity
and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global
solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of
an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the
higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the
algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the
existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.

economic principles. Here I assume an optimal allocation of enzyme resources
and postulate a general principle for metabolism: each enzyme must convert less
valuable into more valuable metabolites to justify its own cost. The ""values"",
called economic potentials, describe the individual contributions of
metabolites to cell fitness. Local value production implies that the cost of an
enzyme must be balanced by a benefit, given by the economic potential
difference the catalysed reaction multiplied by the flux. Flux profiles that
satisfy this principle - i.e. for which consistent potentials can be found -
are called economical. Economical fluxes must lead from lower to higher
economic potentials, so certain flux cycles are incompatible with any choice of
economic potentials and can be excluded. To obtain economical flux profiles,
non-beneficial local patterns, called futile motifs, can be systematically
removed from a given flux distribution. The principle of local value production
resembles thermodynamic principles and complements them in models. Here I
describe a modelling framework called Value Balance Analysis (VBA) that uses
the two principles and yields the same solution as enzyme cost minimisation (in
kinetic models) and flux cost minimisation (in FBA). Given an economical flux
distribution, kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states and with these fluxes can
be constructed systematically. VBA justifies the principle of minimal fluxes
and the exclusion of futile cycles, predicts enzymes that could be plausible
targets for regulation, provides criteria for the usage of enzymes and
pathways, and explains the choice between high-yield and low-yield flux modes.

densities in the Bose-Einstein condensate of a system of hard-core bosons with
nearest neighbor attractive interactions is presented.
  In general, two species of solitons appear: A nonpersistent (NP) type that
fully delocalizes at its maximum speed, and a persistent (P) type that survives
even at its maximum speed, and transforms into a periodic train of solitons
above this speed. When the background condensate density is nonzero, both
species coexist, the soliton is associated with a constant intrinsic frequency,
and its maximum speed is the speed of sound. In contrast, when the background
condensate density is zero, the system has neither a fixed frequency, nor a
speed of sound. Here, the maximum soliton speed depends on the frequency, which
can be tuned to lead to a cross-over between the NP-type and the P-type at a
certain critical frequency, determined by the energy parameters of the system.
We provide a single functional form for the soliton profile, from which diverse
characteristics for various background densities can be obtained. Using the
mapping to spin systems enables us to characterize the corresponding class of
magnetic solitons in
  Heisenberg spin chains with different types of anisotropy, in a unified

induce isometric embeddings for certain metrics. By contrast, winding number
zero satellite operators are bounded functions and hence quasi-contractions.

Ca2CrReO6 and Ca2FeReO6 with high magnetic Curie temperatures of 360 and 522 K,
we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties of Ca2MReO6 (M=Cr,Fe) using the full-potential linear augmented
plane wave (FP-LAPW) method within the density functional theory. Our full
optimization confirms the stable ground-state structure with $P2_1/n$ symmetry.
The modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential is used for investigating
electronic structures. Our mBJ calculation shows that they are both
ferrimagnetic semiconductors with semiconductor gaps of 0.38 eV and 0.05 eV,
respectively, in contrast with wrong metallic phases from the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA). The origin of semiconductor gap is due to the
further distortion of ReO$_6$ octahedra caused by John-Teller effect, which
drives the three partially-occupied Re $t_{2g}$ bands split into two
fully-filled bands and one empty band in the minority-spin channel. With the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) taken into account, the Ca2MReO6 (M=Cr,Fe) shows high
magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) with the magnetic easy axis along
pseudocubic [010] direction, and the total magnetic moments increase by
0.209$\mu_B$ and 0.258$\mu_B$ per formula unit, respectively, due to the strong
SOC effect on Re ion. Although reducing to 0.31 and 0.03 eV, the semiconductor
gaps remain open in spite of the SOC broadening of the Re $t_{2g}$-related
bands. Therefore, our DFT investigation with mBJ has established the correct
ferrimagnetic semiconductor ground state for the double perovskites Ca2MReO6
(M=Cr,Fe). This mechanism, different from that in double perovskite Sr2CrOsO6,
can help understand physical properties of other similar compounds.

the sum of a convex function (not strictly convex) and absolute values of a
subset of variables (or equivalently the l1-norm of the variables). This
problem appears exten- sively in modern statistical applications associated
with high-dimensional data or ""big data"", and corresponds to optimizing
l1-regularized likelihoods in the context of model selection. In such
applications, cyclic coordinatewise minimization (CCM), where the objective
function is sequentially minimized with respect to each individual coordi-
nate, is often employed as it offers a computationally cheap and effective
optimization method. Consequently, it is crucial to obtain theoretical
guarantees of convergence for the sequence of iterates produced by the cyclic
coordinatewise minimization in this setting. Moreover, as the objective
corresponds to at l1-regularized likelihoods of many variables, it is important
to obtain convergence of the iterates themselves, and not just the function
values. Previous results in the literature only establish either, (i) that
every limit point of the sequence of iterates is a stationary point of the
objective function, or (ii) establish convergence under special assumptions, or
(iii) establish con- vergence for a different minimization approach (which uses
quadratic approximation based gradient descent followed by an inexact line
search), (iv) establish convergence of only the function values of the sequence
of iterates produced by random coordinatewise minimization (a variant of CCM).
In this paper, a rigorous general proof of convergence for the cyclic

behaviors and timing properties of the QPO have been studied since its
discovery. We present an analysis of the QPO in RE J1034+396 based on the
Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Comparing other time-frequency analysis methods,
the Hilbert spectrum reveals the variation of the QPO period in great detail.
Furthermore, the empirical mode decomposition provides band-pass filtered data
that can be used in the O -- C and correlation analysis. We suggest that it is
better to divide the evolution of the QPO in this observation into three epochs
according to their different periodicities. In addition to the periodicities,
the correlations between the QPO periods and corresponding mean count rates are
also different in these three epochs. Further examining the phase lags in these
epochs, we found no significant phase lags between the soft and hard X-ray
bands, which is also confirmed in the QPO phase-resolved spectral analysis.
Finally, we discuss the indications of current models including a spotted

interact with antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T-lymphocyte cells (T-cells)
to promote and to regulate different stages of immune response, we developed a
coarse grained kinetic model in an attempt to quantify the role of vitamin-D in
immunomodulatory responses. Our kinetic model, developed using the ideas of
chemical network theory, leads to a system of nine coupled equations that we
solve both by direct and by stochastic (Gillespie) methods. Both the analyses
consistently provide detail information on the dependence of immune response to
the variation of critical rate parameters. We find that although vitamin-D
plays a negligible role in the initial immune response, it exerts a profound
influence in the long term, especially in helping the system to achieve a new,
stable steady state. The study explores the role of vitamin-D in preserving an
observed bistability in the phase diagram (spanned by system parameters) of
immune regulation, thus allowing the response to tolerate a wide range of
pathogenic stimulation which could help in resisting autoimmune diseases. We
also study how vitamin-D affects the time dependent population of dendritic
cells that connect between innate and adaptive immune responses. Variations in
dose dependent response in anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory T-cell
populations to vitamin-D correlate well with recent experimental results. Our
kinetic model allows for an estimation of the range of optimum level of
vitamin-D required for smooth functioning of the immune system and for control
of both hyper-regulation and inflammation. Most importantly, the present study
reveals that an overdose or toxic level of vitamin-D or any steroid analogue

scalar-tensor correlation to the CMB temperature power spectrum vanishes once
summed over the angular mode $m$ so the tension between BICEP2 and Planck can
not be reconciled. The reason is that one has to use the spin-weighted

These nonzero spin-weighted spherical harmonics are subject to orthogonality
conditions when summed over the angular direction and thus the desired
cross-correlation between the scalar and tensor perturbations in CMB map
vanishes.

Bayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with

interaction theory. Since we do not have any information concerning the
azimuthal wavenumber $m$ and spherical harmonic degree $l$ for each of the

retrograde in the observer's frame and they are all associated with a single

estimate the amount of angular momentum transferred by the oscillations for

transport of angular momentum by waves stochastically excited in the core of Be

(i) rotation characteristics depend on the ratio $k=l_{s}/D$ ($l_{s}$ denotes
the slip length, resulting from the interface's impact on the structure of the
liquid and $D$ denotes the film's diameter). (ii) As $k$ ($k>-1/2$) increases:
(a) PLFMs subsequently exhibit rotation characteristics under ""negative-"",
""no-"", ""partial-"" and ""perfect-"" slip boundary conditions; (b) the maximum
value of the linear velocity of the steady rotating liquid film increases and
its location approaches the film's border; (c) the decay of the angular
velocities' dependency on the distance from the center of the film slows down,
resulting in a macroscopic flow near the boundary. (iii) In addition to $k$,
the rotation characteristics of the AC PLFM depend on the magnitudes, the
frequencies, and the phase difference of the AC fields. (iv) Our analytical
derived rotation speed distributions are consistent with the existing

topological supercondutor is studied, after quenches to either non-topological
phases or other topological phases. Both instantaneous and slow quenches are
considered. In general, the Majorana modes decay and, in the case of
instantaneous quenches, their revival times scale to infinity as the system
size grows. Considering fast quantum quenches within the same topological
phase, leads, in some cases, to robust edge modes. Quenches to a topological
$Z_2$ phase reveal some robustness of the Majorana fermions. Comparing strong
spin-orbit coupling with weak spin-orbit coupling, it is found that the
Majorana fermions are fairly robust, if the pairing is not aligned with the
spin-orbit Rashba coupling. It is also shown that the Chern number remains
invariant after the quench, until the propagation of the mode along the
transverse direction reaches the middle point, beyond which the Chern number
oscillates between increasing values. In some cases, the time average Chern
number seems to converge to the appropriate value, but often the decay is very
slow. The effect of varying the rate of change in slow quenches is also
analysed. It is found that the defect production is non-universal and does not
follow the Kibble-Zurek scaling with the quench rate, as obtained before for
other systems with topological edge states.

feedforward neural networks is presented. The algorithm has been implemented
with two very different learning methods: a standard Back-propagation (BP)
procedure and an evolutionary algorithm. First, we have demonstrated that the
EA training method converges faster and gives more accurate results than BP.
Then we have made a full analysis of the effects of turning off different
combinations of neurons after the training phase. We demonstrate that EA is
much more robust than BP for all the cases under study. Even in the case when
two hidden neurons are lost, EA training is still able to give good average
results. This difference implies that we must be very careful when pruning or
redundancy effects are being studied since the network performance when losing
neurons strongly depends on the training method. Moreover, the influence of the
individual inputs will also depend on the training algorithm. Since EA keeps a
good classification performance when units are lost, this method could be a
good way to simulate biological learning systems since they must be robust
against deficient neuron performance. Although biological systems are much more
complex than the simulations shown in this article, we propose that a smart
training strategy such as the one shown here could be considered as a first
protection against the losing of a certain number of neurons.

modifies the spin orbit couplings. The Hamiltonian is exactly solved for the
intrinsic spin orbit interaction and perturbatively for the Rashba spin orbit
interaction. It is shown that there exists the Kramer's degenerate midgap
localized spin separated fluxon states around the defect. These zero energy
spin separated states occur at the external magnetic flux value
$\Phi\pm\Delta\Phi$. The external magnetic flux $\Phi$ is introduced to make
the wave-function periodic when the electron circulates around the defect. It
is found that this separation occurs due to the effect of the conical curvature
on the spin orbit coupling. Further, we find these results are robust to the
addition of the Rashba spin orbit interaction which is important for the

single integer counter that cannot be fully tested for zero. They form a
natural subclass of both One-Counter Automata, which allow zero-tests and Petri
Nets/VASS, which allow multiple such weak counters.
  The trace inclusion problem has recently been shown to be undecidable for
OCN. In this paper, we contrast the complexity of two natural restrictions
which imply decidability.
  First, we show that trace inclusion between an OCN and a deterministic OCN is
NL-complete, even with arbitrary binary-encoded initial counter-values as part

universality problem of nondeterministic OCN. This problem is equivalent to
checking trace inclusion between a finite and a OCN-process.

to the nature of the dust features seen in their Spitzer spectra, Galactic disc

F) and subtypes (amorphous and crystalline, and aliphatic and aromatic).
Nebular gas abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, as well as plasma
parameters (e.g. Ne, Te) are homogeneously derived and we study the median
chemical abundances and nebular properties in Galactic disc and bulge PNe
depending on their Spitzer dust types and subtypes. A comparison of the derived
median abundance patterns with AGB nucleosynthesis predictions show mainly that
i) DC PNe, both with amorphous and crystalline silicates, display
high-metallicity (solar/supra-solar) and the highest He abundances and N/O
ratios, suggesting relatively massive (~3-5 M_sun) hot bottom burning AGB stars
as progenitors; ii) PNe with O-rich and C-rich unevolved dust (amorphous and
aliphatic) seem to evolve from subsolar metallicity (z~0.008) and lower mass
(<3 M_sun) AGB stars; iii) a few O-rich PNe and a significant fraction of
C-rich PNe with more evolved dust (crystalline and aromatic, respectively)
display chemical abundances similar to DC PNe, suggesting that they are related
objects. A comparison of the derived nebular properties with predictions from
models combining the theoretical central star evolution with a simple nebular
model is also presented. Finally, a possible link between the Spitzer dust
properties, chemical abundances, and evolutionary status is discussed.

the Lense-Thirring one can be measured by astronomical observations at 10

attended problem is that the SMBH has not only spin but also spin precession

such spin precession on the orbital precessions of orbiting stars. Our results
show that the spin precession can produce a periodic oscillation on the
precession of the star's orbital plane, but no obvious effect on the periapse
shift. For stars with $O(0.1)$yr period, such visible oscillations occur while
the SMBH's spin-precession period is about from few tens of years to hundreds
of years. And the period of oscillation is the same with the one of the spin
precession. In principle, this oscillating orbital plane's precession can be
observed and then the spin and spin precession of the nearest supermassive

and volume shrinkage at drying depend on the same soil water content. In
addition the two following results are used: (i) the available two-factor
(capillarity and shrinkage) model of clay suction enables one to connect a clay
suction and clay water content using the clay matrix structure; and (ii) the
recent reference shrinkage curve model based on the concepts of intra-aggregate
soil structure permits one to connect the soil water content at shrinkage with
the water content of the contributive clay. With that the available two-factor
model was essentially modified and, in particular, the effect of adsorbed water
film was taken into account. The developed model includes the following input
parameters: the solid density, relative volume of contributive-clay solids,
relative volume of contributive clay in the oven-dried state, soil clay
content, aggregate/intra-aggregate mass ratio, and specific volume of lacunar
pores in the aggregates at maximum swelling. The validation of the model is
based on available data of water retention and the above input parameters for

side. They are also named cometaries. In a series of recent works we have
discovered a number of issues that lead us to consider them extremely
interesting targets. First, from images, they are disks with a lopsided
starburst. This result is firmly established with long slit spectroscopy in a
nearby representative sample. They rotate with the head following the rotation
pattern but displaced from the rotation center. Moreover, in a search for
extremely metal poor (XMP) galaxies, we identified tadpoles as the dominant
shapes in the sample- nearly 80% of the local XMP galaxies have a tadpole
morphology. In addition, the spatially resolved analysis of the metallicity
shows the remarkable result that there is a metallicity drop right at the
position of the head. This is contrary to what intuition would say and
difficult to explain if star formation has happened from gas processed in the
disk. The result could however be understood if the star formation is driven by
pristine gas falling into the galaxy disk. If confirmed, we could be unveiling,
for the first time, cool flows in action in our nearby world. The tadpole class
is relatively frequent at high redshift - 10% of resolvable galaxies in the
Hubble UDF but less than 1% in the local Universe. They are systems that could

theorem it is only needed to follow the evolution of the border of these

tracing isocontours of $f$. This method, which is entropy conserving in
essence, is very accurate and can trace very well non linear instabilities as
illustrated by specific examples.
  As an application of the method, we generate an ensemble of single waterbag
simulations with decreasing thickness, to perform a convergence study to the
cold case. Our measurements show that the system relaxes to a steady state
where the gravitational potential profile is a power-law of slowly varying
index $\beta$, with $\beta$ close to $3/2$ as found in the literature. However,
detailed analysis of the properties of the gravitational potential shows that
at the center, $\beta > 1.54$. Moreover, our measurements are consistent with
the value $\beta=8/5=1.6$ that can be analytically derived by assuming that the
average of the phase-space density per energy level obtained at crossing times
is conserved during the mixing phase. These results are incompatible with the
logarithmic slope of the projected density profile $\beta-2 \simeq -0.47$

independent of macroscopicity of the quantum state for a fixed degree of
fuzziness in the coarsened references of measurements. Here, a general
situation, that is the degree of fuzziness can change with the rotation angle
between two states (different rotation angles represent different references),
is researched based on the reason that the fuzziness of reference can come from
two kinds: the Hamiltonian (rotation frequency) and the timing (rotation time).
Our results show that, for the fuzziness of Hamiltonian alone, the degree of
fuzziness for reference will change with the rotation angle between two states
and the quantum effects can still be observed no matter how much degree of
fuzziness of Hamiltonian; for the fuzziness of timing, the degree of coarsening
reference is unchanged with the rotation angle. Moreover, during the rotation
of the measurement axis, the decoherence environment can also help the
classical-to-quantum transition due to changing the direction of measurement
axis.

up to the Planck scale, where gravitational effects are of comparable strength.
String theory provides a perturbatively consistent scheme to explore how the
parameters of the Standard Model may be determined from a theory of quantum
gravity. The free fermionic heterotic string models provide concrete examples
of exact string solutions that reproduce the spectrum of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model. Contemporary studies entail the development of
methods to classify large classes of models. This led to the discovery of
exophobic heterotic-string vacua and the observation of spinor-vector duality,
which provides an insight to the global structure of the space of (2,0)
heterotic-string vacua. Future directions entail the study of the role of the
massive string states in these models and their incorporation in cosmological
scenarios. A complementary direction is the formulation of quantum gravity from
the principle of manifest phase space duality and the equivalence postulate of
quantum mechanics, which suggest that space is compact. The compactness of
space, which implies intrinsic regularisation, may be tightly related to the
intrinsic finite length scale, implied by string phenomenology.

timing arrays for GWs from binary SMBHs, in the frequency band
$\sim1-100$\,nHz, include the assumptions that all binaries are circular and
evolve only through GW emission. However, dynamical studies have shown that the
only way that binary SMBH orbits can decay to separations where GW emission
dominates the evolution is through interactions with their environments. We
augment an existing galaxy and SMBH formation and evolution model with
calculations of binary SMBH evolution in stellar environments, accounting for
non-zero binary eccentricities. We find that coupling between binaries and
their environments causes the expected GW spectral energy distribution to be
reduced with respect to the standard assumption of circular, GW-driven
binaries, for frequencies up to $\sim20$\,nHz. Larger eccentricities at binary
formation further reduce the signal in this regime. We also find that GW bursts
from individual eccentric binary SMBHs are unlikely to be detectable with
current pulsar timing arrays. The uncertainties in these predictions are large,
owing to observational uncertainty in SMBH-galaxy scaling relations and the
galaxy stellar mass function, uncertainty in the nature of binary-environment
coupling, and uncertainty in the numbers of the most massive binary SMBHs. We
conclude, however, that low-frequency GWs from binary SMBHs may be more
difficult to detect with pulsar timing arrays than currently thought.

vanish as the signal dimension, the number of features, and the number of
subspaces to be discerned all approach infinity. Second, we define the
diversity-discrimination tradeoff which, by analogy with the

relationships between the number of discernible subspaces and the
misclassification probability as the noise power approaches zero. We derive
upper and lower bounds on these measures which are tight in many regimes.

challenging question. For the fundamental model system of Rock-Paper-Scissors
(RPS) game, classic game theory of infinite rationality predicts the Nash
equilibrium (NE) state with every player randomizing her choices to avoid being
exploited, while evolutionary game theory of bounded rationality in general
predicts persistent cyclic motions, especially for finite populations. However,
as empirical studies on human subjects have been relatively sparse, it is still
a controversial issue as to which theoretical framework is more appropriate to
describe decision making of human subjects. Here we observe population-level
cyclic motions in a laboratory experiment of the discrete-time iterated RPS
game under the traditional random pairwise-matching protocol. The cycling
direction and frequency are not sensitive to the payoff parameter a. This
collective behavior contradicts with the NE theory but it is quantitatively
explained by a microscopic model of win-lose-tie conditional response without
any adjustable parameter. Our theoretical calculations reveal that this new
strategy may offer higher payoffs to individual players in comparison with the
NE mixed strategy, suggesting that high social efficiency is achievable through
optimized conditional response.

argued by Fei, Giombi, and Klebanov. The location of the minimum is generically
different from the minimum of the lower bound of the energy-momentum tensor

  To better understand the situation, we examine the lower bounds of the

smaller $N$ with the other sectors of the conformal bootstrap.

posterior probability distributions in stochastic kinetic models (SKMs). SKMs
are multivariate Markov jump processes that model the interactions among
species in biochemical systems according to a set of uncertain parameters.
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been typically preferred for this
Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the particle MCMC (pMCMC) method has
been recently shown to be an effective, while computationally demanding, method
applicable to this problem. Within the pMCMC framework, importance sampling
(IS) has been used only as the basis of the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
approximation of the acceptance ratio in the Metropolis-Hastings kernel.
However, the recently proposed nonlinear population Monte Carlo (NPMC)
algorithm, based on an iterative IS scheme, has also been shown to be effective
as a Bayesian inference tool for low dimensional (predator-prey) SKMs. In this
paper, we provide an extensive performance comparison of pMCMC versus NPMC,
when applied to the challenging prokaryotic autoregulatory network. We show how
the NPMC method can greatly outperform the pMCMC algorithm in this scenario,
with an overall moderate computational effort. We complement the numerical
comparison of the two techniques with an asymptotic convergence analysis of the
nonlinear IS scheme at the core of the proposed method when the importance
weights can only be computed approximately.

new framework to correctly calculate the cosmological perturbations in the
interacting dark energy models. Inspired by the well-known parametrized
post-Friedmann approach, the condition of the dark energy pressure perturbation
is replaced with the relationship between the momentum density of dark energy

evolutions on the large and small scales, one can complete the perturbation
equations system. The large-scale instability can be successfully avoided and
the well-behaved density and metric perturbations are obtained within this

not always smaller than the expected minimal investment risk. That is, using a
well-known approach from operations research, it is possible to derive a
strategy that minimizes the expected investment risk, but this strategy does
not always result in the best rate of return on assets. Prior to making
investment decisions, it is important to an investor to know the potential
minimal investment risk (or the expected minimal investment risk) and to
determine the strategy that will maximize the return on assets. We use the
self-averaging property to analyze the potential minimal investment risk and
the concentrated investment level for the strategy that gives the best rate of
return. We compare the results from our method with the results obtained by the
operations research approach and with those obtained by a numerical simulation
using the optimal portfolio. The results of our method and the numerical
simulation are in agreement, but they differ from that of the operations
research approach.

of the one-electron reduced density matrix (1-RDM) to be bounded by one and
zero. However, for a 1-RDM from a wave function, there exist additional
conditions on the spectrum of occupation numbers, known as pure
N-representability conditions or generalized Pauli conditions. For atoms and
molecules, we measure through a Euclidean-distance metric the proximity of the
1-RDM spectrum to the facets of the convex set (polytope) generated by the
generalized Pauli conditions. For the ground state of any spin symmetry, as
long as time-reversal symmetry is considered in the definition of the polytope,
we find that the 1-RDM's spectrum is pinned to the boundary of the polytope. In
contrast, for excited states, we find that the 1-RDM spectrum is not pinned.
Proximity of the 1-RDM to the boundary of the polytope provides a measurement
and classification of electron correlation and entanglement within the quantum
system. For comparison, this distance to the boundary of the generalized Pauli
conditions is also compared to the distance to the polytope of the traditional
Pauli conditions, and the distance to the nearest 1-RDM spectrum from a Slater
determinant. We explain the difference in pinning in the ground- and
excited-state 1-RDMs through a connection to the N-representability conditions
of the two-electron reduced density matrix.

generalized Fibonacci polynomials (GFPs) under convolution product, in terms of

GFPs and for weighted isobaric polynomials (WIPs), which appeared in an earlier
paper by MacHenry and Tudose, make use of two types of operators. These
operators are derived from the generating functions for Stirling numbers of the
first kind and second kind. Hence we call them Stirling operators. To construct
matrix representations of the roots of GFPs, we use the Stirling operators of
the first kind. We give explicit examples to show how the Stirling operators of
the second kind appear in the low degree cases for the WIP-roots. As a
consequence of the matrix construction, we have matrix representations of
multiplicative arithmetic functions under the Dirichlet product into its
divisible closure.

$N$-representability conditions (conditions for the 2-RDM to represent an
ensemble $N$-electron quantum system), yields a rigorous lower bound to the
ground-state energy in contrast to variational wavefunction methods. We
characterize the performance of two sets of approximate constraints,
(2,2)-positivity (DQG) and approximate (2,3)-positivity (DQGT) conditions, at
capturing correlation in one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional (ladder)
Hubbard models. We find that, while both the DQG and DQGT conditions capture
both the weak and strong correlation limits, the more stringent DQGT conditions
improve the ground-state energies, the natural occupation numbers, the pair
correlation function, the effective hopping, and the connected (cumulant) part
of the 2-RDM. We observe that the DQGT conditions are effective at capturing
strong electron correlation effects in both one- and quasi-one-dimensional
lattices for both half filling and less-than-half filling.

the Glauber two variable coherent states, respectively depending on which of

that the resolution of identity condition is realized with respect to an
appropriate measure on the complex plane, too. We have compared our results
with the similar quantum states of Agarwal's type and seen that in our case
amount of quantum fluctuations are much controllable. Moreover, we have also
more flexibility to establish and set-out of their features. Also, there is a
discussion on the statistical properties, can unveil (non-)classical properties
of these states. For instance their Poissonian statistics are significant
similar to what we saw earlier in the Glauber two variable coherent states.
Interestingly, depending on the particular choice of the parameters of the
above scenarios, we are able to determine the status of compliance with
squeezing properties in field quadratures. The last stage is devoted to some
theoretical framework to generate them in cavities.

porosity and the permeability of the porous medium are variable across the

normal to the plate. The fluid temperature at the plate is constant and
different from that of the ambient fluid. This temperature difference creates a
buoyancy force and the flow is characterized as mixed convection. The partial
differential equations of the boundary layer flow are transformed into ordinary
differential equations and subsequently are solved with the Runge-Kutta
Fehlberg method. The results are presented in two tables and 11 figures.
