gravity using polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. Since
such a parity violation would lead to non-zero TB and EB correlations, this
makes those odd-parity angular power spectra a potential probe of parity
violation in the gravitational sector. These spectra are modeled incorporating
the impact of lensing and we explore their possible detection in the context of
small-scale (balloon-borne or ground-based) experiments and a future satellite
mission dedicated to B-mode detection. We assess the statistical uncertainties
on their reconstruction using mode-counting and a (more realistic) pure
pseudospectrum estimator approach. Those uncertainties are then translated into
constraints on the level of parity asymmetry. We found that detecting chiral
gravity is impossible for ongoing small-scale experiments. However, for a
satellite-like mission, a parity asymmetry of at least 50% could be detected at
68% of confidence level, and a parity asymmetry of 100% is measurable with at
least a confidence level of 95%. We also assess the impact of a possible
miscalibration of the orientation of the polarized detectors, leading to
spurious TB and EB cross-correlations. We show that in the context of
pseudospectrum estimation of the angular power spectra, self-calibration of
this angle could significantly reduce the statistical significance of the
measured level of parity asymmetry (by e.g. a factor ~2.4 for a miscalibration
angle of 1 degree). For chiral gravity and assuming a satellite mission
dedicated to primordial B-mode, a non detection of the TB and EB correlation
would translate into an upper bound on parity violation of 39% at 95%

However, the majority of mechanistic models used in analyzing

proposed to explain co-evolution of host and microbes, are based on averages
across a host population. By assuming that observed variations are random and
independent, these models overlook the role of inter-host differences. Here we
analyze mechanisms underlying host-to-host variations, using the
well-characterized experimental infection model of polymicrobial otitis media
(OM) in chinchillas, in combination with population dynamic models and a
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based inference scheme. We find that the nature of the
interactions among bacterial species critically regulates host-to-host
variations of these interactions. Surprisingly, seemingly unrelated phenomena,
such as the efficiency of individual bacterial species in utilizing nutrients
for growth and the microbe-specific host immune response, can become
interdependent in a host population. The latter finding suggests a potential
mechanism that could lead to selection of specific strains of bacterial species
during the coevolution of the host immune response and the bacterial species.

Items arrive one by one in a buffer and depart from it as soon as possible but

a finite set of classes $\maV$ for the items, and the allowed matchings depend
on the classes, according to a {\em matching graph} on $\maV$. Upon arrival, an
item may find several possible matches in the buffer. This indeterminacy is
resolved by a {\em matching policy}. When the sequence of classes of the

unicast users send imperfect (or no) CSI and infrequent acknowledgements (ACKs)

sequences, information about the proximities between residues derived from
covariation maps can be sufficient to predict a protein fold. If the structure
is already known, information on the covarying positions can be valuable to
understand the protein mechanism.
  In this study we have sought to determine whether a multivariate extension of
traditional mutual information (MI) can be an additional tool to study
covariation. The performance of two multidimensional MI (mdMI) methods,
designed to remove the effect of ternary/quaternary interdependencies, was
tested with a set of 9 MSAs each containing <400 sequences, and was shown to be
comparable to that of methods based on maximum entropy/pseudolikelyhood
statistical models of protein sequences. However, while all the methods tested
detected a similar number of covarying pairs among the residues separated by <
8 {\AA} in the reference X-ray structures, there was on average less than 65%
overlap between the top scoring pairs detected by methods that are based on
different principles.
  We have also attempted to identify whether the difference in performance
among methods is due to different efficiency in removing covariation
originating from chains of structural contacts. We found that the reason why
methods that derive partial correlation between the columns of a MSA provide a
better recognition of close contacts is not because they remove chaining
effects, but because they filter out the correlation between distant residues
that originates from general fitness constraints. In contrast we found that
true chaining effects are expression of real physical perturbations that
propagate inside proteins, and therefore are not removed by the derivation of
partial correlation between variables.

that the data has been encoded and stored in the clouds using fixed rate
forward error correction (FEC) codes with parameters (n, k). That is, each file
is divided into k equal-sized chunks, which are then expanded into n chunks
such that any k chunks out of the n are sufficient to successfully restore the
original file. The model can be depicted as a multiple-server queue with
arrivals of data retrieving requests and a server corresponding to a thread.
However, this is not a typical queueing model because a server can terminate
its operation, depending on when other servers complete their service (due to
the redundancy that is spread across the threads). Hence, to the best of our
knowledge, the analysis of this queueing model remains quite uncharted.
  Recent traces from Amazon S3 show that the time to retrieve a fixed size
chunk is random and can be approximated as a constant delay plus an i.i.d.
exponentially distributed random variable. For the tractability of the
theoretical analysis, we assume that the chunk downloading time is i.i.d.
exponentially distributed. Under this assumption, we show that any
work-conserving scheme is delay-optimal among all on-line scheduling schemes
when k = 1. When k > 1, we find that a simple greedy scheme, which allocates
all available threads to the head of line request, is delay optimal among all
on-line scheduling schemes. We also provide some numerical results that point
to the limitations of the exponential assumption, and suggest further research

obtaining this information is costly in terms of bandwidth, time, and power,
and could result in large overhead. Therefore, a critical question is how to
optimally manage network resources in the absence of such information. To that
end, we develop a cross-layer solution for downlink cellular systems with
imperfect (and possibly no) CSI at the transmitter. We use rateless codes to
resolve channel uncertainty. To keep the decoding complexity low, we explicitly
incorporate time-average block-size constraints, and aim to maximize the system
utility. The block-size of a rateless code is determined by both the network
control decisions and the unknown CSI of many time slots. Therefore, unlike
standard utility maximization problems, this problem can be viewed as a
constrained partial observed Markov decision problem (CPOMDP), which is known
to be hard due to the ""curse of dimensionality."" However, by using a modified
Lyapunov drift method, we develop a dynamic network control scheme, which
yields a total network utility within O(1/Lav) of utility-optimal point
achieved by infinite block-size channel codes, where Lav is the enforced value
of the time-average block-size of rateless codes. This opens the door of being
able to trade complexity/delay for performance gains in the absence of accurate
CSI. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the network
throughput by up to 68% over schemes that use fixed-rate codes.

the low-$k$ to high-$k$ transition near $k \approx 2\pi/0.6 \mathrm{nm}$ when
an empirically matched number of Gaussian links is about one-third of the total
number of effective-atom sites. This short distance-scale boundary of 0.6 nm is
directly verified with the $r$-space distributions, and this distance is thus
identified with a natural size for coarsened monomers. The probability
distribution of $R_g{}^2$ is compared with the classic predictions for both
Gaussian model and freely-jointed chains. $\left\langle
R_g{}^2(j)\right\rangle$, the contribution of the $j$-th chain segment to

contour occupy the center of the chain globule. The density profiles of chain
segments relative to their center of mass can show distinctive density
structuring for smaller chains due close proximity of central elements to the
globule center. But that density structuring washes-out for longer chains where
many chain elements additively contribute to the density profiles.

A. W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 107}, 157201 (2011)] based on valence-bond
quantum Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin systems. Using several
different one-dimensional models, we characterize $S=1/2$ spinon excitations
using the spinon size and confinement length (the size of a bound state). The
spinons have finite size in valence-bond-solid states, infinite size in the
critical region, and become ill-defined in the N\'eel state. We also verify
that pairs of spinons are deconfined in these uniform spin chains but become
confined upon introducing a pattern of alternating coupling strengths
(dimerization) or coupling two chains (forming a ladder). In the dimerized
system an individual spinon can be small when the confinement length is
large---this is the case when the imposed dimerization is weak but the ground
state of the corresponding uniform chain is a spontaneously formed
valence-bond-solid (where the spinons are deconfined). Based on our numerical
results, we argue that the situation $\lambda \ll \Lambda$ is associated with
weak repulsive short-range spinon-spinon interactions. In principle both the
length-scales can be individually tuned from small to infinite (with $\lambda
\le \Lambda$) by varying model parameters. In the ladder system the two lengths
are always similar, and this is the case also in the dimerized systems when the
corresponding uniform chain is in the critical phase. In these systems the
effective spinon-spinon interactions are purely attractive and there is only a

typically represented as a matrix containing the known interaction values.
Additional side information may consist of feature vectors specific to entities
corresponding to the rows and/or columns of such a matrix. Further information
may also be available in the form of interactions or hierarchies among entities
along the same mode (axis). We propose a novel approach for modeling
transposable data with missing interactions given additional side information.
The interactions are modeled as noisy observations from a latent noise free
matrix generated from a matrix-variate Gaussian process. The construction of
row and column covariances using side information provides a flexible mechanism
for specifying a-priori knowledge of the row and column correlations in the
data. Further, the use of such a prior combined with the side information
enables predictions for new rows and columns not observed in the training data.
In this work, we combine the matrix-variate Gaussian process model with low
rank constraints. The constrained Gaussian process approach is applied to the
prediction of hidden associations between genes and diseases using a small set
of observed associations as well as prior covariances induced by gene-gene
interaction networks and disease ontologies. The proposed approach is also
applied to recommender systems data which involves predicting the item ratings
of users using known associations as well as prior covariances induced by
social networks. We present experimental results that highlight the performance
of constrained matrix-variate Gaussian process as compared to state of the art
approaches in each domain.

background has focussed attention on inflaton potentials $V(\phi) \propto
\phi^\alpha$ with $\alpha=2$ (""chaotic"" or ""$m^2\phi^2$"" inflation) or with
smaller values of $\alpha$, as may arise in axion-monodromy models. Here we
show that reheating considerations may provide additional constraints to these
models. The reheating phase preceding the radiation era is modeled by an
effective equation-of-state parameter $w_{\rm re}$. The canonical reheating
scenario is then described by $w_{\rm re}=0$. The simplest $\alpha=2$ models
are consistent with $w_{\rm re} = 0$ for values of $n_s$ well within the
current $1\sigma$ range. Models with $\alpha=1$ or $\alpha=2/3$ require a more
exotic reheating phase, with $-1/3<w_{\rm re}<0$, unless $n_s$ falls above the
current $1\sigma$ range. Likewise, models with $\alpha=4$ require a physically
implausible $w_{\rm re}>1/3$, unless $n_s$ is close to the lower limit of the
$2\sigma$ range. For $m^2\phi^2$ inflation and canonical reheating as a
benchmark, we derive a relation $\log_{10}\left(T_{\rm re}/10^6\,{\rm GeV}
\right) \simeq 2000\,(n_s-0.96)$ between the reheat temperature $T_{\rm re}$
and the scalar spectral index $n_s$. Thus, if $n_s$ is close to its central
value, then $T_{\rm re}\lesssim 10^6$~GeV, just above the electroweak scale. If
the reheat temperature is higher, as many theorists may prefer, then the scalar
spectral index should be closer to $n_s\simeq0.965$ (at the pivot scale
$k=0.05\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), near the upper limit of the $1\sigma$ error range.
Improved precision in the measurement of $n_s$ should allow $m^2\phi^2$,
axion-monodromy, and $\phi^4$ models to be distinguished, even without precise
measurement of $r$, and to test the $m^2\phi^2$ expectation of
$n_s\simeq0.965$.

quantum spin tunnelling. With an odd number of sites, the N\'eel state must

the ground state is $N$-fold degenerate. This set of states reorganizes into a

the Floras (e.g., the Vesta, Baptistina, and Nysa-Polana families), and the
removal of a significant fraction of Floras via the nearby $\nu_6$ resonance
complicates the Flora family's distinction in both proper orbital elements and
reflectance properties. Here we use orbital information from the Asteroids
Dynamic Site, color information from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and albedo
information from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to obtain the median
orbital and reflectance properties of the Floras by sampling the core of the
family in multidimensional phase space. We find the median Flora SDSS colors to
be $a^*$ = 0.126 $\pm$ 0.007 and $i-z = -0.037 \pm 0.007$; the median Flora
albedo is $p_V$ = 0.291 $\pm$ 0.012. These properties allow us to define ranges
for the Flora family in orbital and reflectance properties, as required for a
detailed dynamical study. We use the young Karin family, for which we have an
age determined via direct backward integration of members' orbits, to calibrate
the Yarkovsky drift rates for the Flora family without having to estimate the
Floras' material properties. The size-dependent dispersion of the Flora members
in semimajor axis (the ""V"" plot) then yields an age for the family of
$910^{+160}_{-120}$ My, with the uncertainty dominated by the uncertainty in
the material properties of the family members (e.g., density and surface
thermal properties). We discuss the effects on our age estimate of two
independent processes that both introduce obliquity variations among the family
members on short (My) timescales: 1) the capture of Flora members in spin-orbit

multiplicity of interacting parts, quantum mechanics calls for an explanatory
concept that proceeds in the opposite direction: from unity to multiplicity. It
concerns the process by which what Sellars called the Manifest Image of the
world comes into being. This process consists in the progressive
differentiation of an intrinsically undifferentiated entity. By entering into
reflexive spatial relations, this gives rise to (i) what looks like a
multiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is not taken
into account, and (ii) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial
quality of the relations is reified. If there is a distinctly quantum domain,
it is a non-spatial and non-temporal dimension across which the transition from
the unity of this entity to the multiplicity of the world takes place. Instead
of being constituents of the physical world, subatomic particles, atoms, and
molecules are instrumental in its manifestation. These conclusions are based on
the following interpretive principle: whenever calculating probabilities calls
for the addition of amplitudes, the distinctions we make between the
alternatives lack objective reality. Applied to alternatives involving
distinctions between regions of space, this principle implies that the
spatiotemporal differentiation of the physical world is incomplete: the
existence of a real-valued spatiotemporal background is an unrealistic
idealization. This guarantees the existence of observables whose values are
real *per se*, as against ""real by virtue of being indicated by the values of
observables that are real *per se*."" Applied to alternatives involving
distinctions between things, it implies that, intrinsically, all fundamental
particles are numerically identical and thus identifiable with the
aforementioned undifferentiated entity.

functional sub-space, regardless of the record's origin. The tidal sub-space
basis can be derived via Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of a
tidal record of a single buoy. Decomposition of a tsunami buoy record in a
functional space of tidal EOFs presents an efficient tool for a short-term
tidal forecast, as well as for an accurate tidal removal (Tolkova, E. 2009.
Principal Component Analysis of Tsunami Buoy Record: Tide Prediction and
Removal. Dyn. Atmos. Oceans, 46 (1-4): 62-82.) EOF analysis of a time series,
however, assumes that the time series represents a stationary (in the weak
sense) process. In the present work, a modification of one-dimensional EOF
formalism not restricted to stationary processes is introduced. With this
modification, the EOF-based de-tiding/forecasting technique can be interpreted
in terms of a signal passage through a filter bank, which is unique for the
sub-space spanned by the EOFs. This interpretation helps to identify a harmonic
content of a continuous process whose fragments are decomposed by given EOFs.
In particular, seven EOFs and a constant function are proved to decompose
1-day-long tidal fragments at any location. Filtering by projection into a
reduced sub-space of the above EOFs is capable of separating a tsunami wave
from a tidal component within a few millimeter accuracy from the first minutes
of the tsunami appearance on a tsunami buoy record, and is reliable in the
presence of data gaps. EOFs with ~3-day duration (a reciprocal of either tidal
band width) allow short-term (24.75 hour in advance) tidal predictions using
the inherent structure of a tidal signal. The predictions do not require any a
priori knowledge of tidal processes at a particular location, except for recent
49.5 hour long recordings at the location.

leads to a Clausius-type inequality which suggests a new interpretation of the
exchange process as an irreversible relaxation due to a contact with a
reservoir of a special type. Only in some special cases when equilibrium
distribution is exactly a gamma distribution, this inequality results in the
H-theorem with monotonically growing `entropy' functional which differs from
the Boltzmann entropy by an additional term. But for arbitrary exchange rule

metal/carbon nanotubes is a fundamental scientific and technological challenge
for realizing high performance transistors\cite{Francois,Franklin}. A Schottky
Barrier(SB) is usually formed at the interface of the $2D$ metal electrode with
the $1D$ semiconducting carbon nanotube. As yet,
experimental\cite{Appenzeller,Chen, Heinze, Derycke} and numerical
\cite{Leonard, Jimenez} studies have generally failed\cite{Svensson} to come up
with any functional relationship among the relevant variables affecting carrier
transport across the SB owing to their unique geometries and complicated
electrostatics. Here, we show that localized states called the metal induced
gap states (MIGS)\cite{Tersoff,Leonard} already present in the barrier
determines the transistor drain characteristics. These states seem to have
little or no influence near the ON-state of the transistor but starts to affect
the drain characteristics strongly as the OFF-state is approached. The role of
MIGS is characterized by tracking the dynamics of the onset bias, $V_o$ of
non-linear conduction in the drain characteristics with gate voltage $V_g$. We
find that $V_o$ varies with the zero-bias conductance $G_o(V_g)$ for a gate
bias $V_g$ as a power-law: $V_o$ $\sim $ ${G_o(V_g)}^x$ with an exponent $x$.
The origin of this power-law relationship is tentatively suggested as a result
of power-law variation of effective barrier height with $V_g$, corroborated by
previous theoretical and experimental results\cite{Appenzeller}. The influence
of MIGS states on transport is further verified independently by temperature
dependent measurements. The unexpected scaling behavior seem to be very generic
for metal/CNT contact providing an experimental forecast for designing state of
the art CNT devices.

data drawn from a union of multiple linear subspaces. Recent works by using
sparse representation, low rank representation and their extensions attract
much attention. If the subspaces from which the data drawn are independent or
orthogonal, they are able to obtain a block diagonal affinity matrix, which
usually leads to a correct segmentation. The main differences among them are
their objective functions. We theoretically show that if the objective function
satisfies some conditions, and the data are sufficiently drawn from independent
subspaces, the obtained affinity matrix is always block diagonal. Furthermore,
the data sampling can be insufficient if the subspaces are orthogonal. Some
existing methods are all special cases. Then we present the Least Squares
Regression (LSR) method for subspace segmentation. It takes advantage of data
correlation, which is common in real data. LSR encourages a grouping effect
which tends to group highly correlated data together. Experimental results on
the Hopkins 155 database and Extended Yale Database B show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond segmentation
accuracy, all experiments demonstrate that LSR is much more efficient.

environments. Previous works have shown that UWA channel noise statistics are
not necessary Gaussian, especially in a shallow water environment which is
dominated by impulsive noise sources. In this case, noise is best represented
by the Generalized Gaussian (GG) noise model with a shaping parameter $\beta$.
On the other hand, fading in the UWA channel is generally represented using an
$\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution, which is a generalization of a wide range of well
known fading distributions. We show that the Additive White Generalized
Gaussian Noise (AWGGN) channel capacity is upper bounded by the AWGN capacity
in addition to a constant gap of $\frac{1}{2} \log \left(\frac{\beta^{2} \pi
e^{1-\frac{2}{\beta}} \Gamma(\frac{3}{\beta})}{2(\Gamma(\frac{1}{\beta}))^{3}}

capacity of AWGGN channels with $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading compared to the faded
AWGN channel capacity. We justify our results by revisiting the sphere-packing
problem, which represents a geometric interpertation of the channel capacity.
Moreover, UWA channel secrecy rates are characterized and the dependency of UWA
channel secrecy on the shaping parameters of the legitimate and eavesdropper
channels is highlighted.

integration of sub-components. Usually these sub-components are already
verified to guarantee their correct functional behavior. By integration of
these verified subcomponents into the overall system, emergent behavior may
occur, i.e. behavior that evolves by the assembling of the subcomponents. For
system integration testing, both, the correct functional behavior of the
overall system, and, the proper functioning of the sub-components in their
system environment, have to be verified. In this work we present the idea of an
approach for system integration testing based on formal verification. The
system components are modeled in SystemC. In a first step these components are
formally verified. Then a model of the overall system is built. In a second
step this system model is formally verified. The novelty of this approach is
given by two aspects: First, up to now the available verification frameworks
for SystemC-models are more a proof of concept than really applicable to real
industrial case studies. Secondly, although formal verification techniques are
a common technique for the verification of software and hardware, by now they
have only marginally considered for system integration testing.

  extensional flows, and its implications for capillary thinning of liquid
  bridges of dilute polymer solutions","52 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The coil-stretch transition in extensional flows of viscoelastic dilute
polymer solutions is known to be associated with a strong hysteresis in
molecular conformations and rheo-optical properties. At infinite dilution,
hysteresis is caused by the large difference in frictional drag coefficient
between undeformed isotropic polymer coils and highly stretched conformations.
At the low extension rates in the hysteresis regime, stretched molecules
pervade larger volumes than equilibrium coils since the flow is too weak to
suppress transverse fluctuations. The onset of intermolecular overlap occurs
for such stretched conformations at polymer concentrations much smaller than
c*, the conventional critical overlap concentration for equilibrium coils.
Therefore, for a range of concentrations c < c*, intramolecular hydrodynamic
interactions may be significantly screened in stretched conformations. Scaling
arguments based on ""blob"" concepts are used here to argue that the stretched
state drag coefficient can grow strongly with concentration in the dilute
regime. A dumbbell model with conformation-dependent drag model is used to
predict a concomitant strong enhancement of coil-stretch hysteresis with
increasing concentration in the dilute regime. This extensional flow induced
self-concentration leads to a maximum in hysteretic effects around c*, which
progressively diminish in the semi-dilute regime where screening in isotropic
coils reduces the difference in drag coefficient between stretched and coiled
states. It is shown that the concentration dependence observed by Clasen et al.
(2006) of capillary-thinning dynamics in liquid bridges of polymer solutions
provides direct evidence of coil-stretch hysteresis enhancement by
self-concentration.

  Abstract shortened to fit arXiv constraints",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201423714",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple generations of stars are routinely encountered in globular clusters
but no convincing evidence has been found in Galactic open clusters to date. In
this paper we use new photometric and spectroscopic data to search for multiple
stellar population signatures in the old, massive open cluster, Melotte~66. The
cluster is known to have a red giant branch wide in color, which could be an
indication of metallicity spread. Also the main sequence is wider than what is
expected from photometric errors only. This evidence might be associated with
either differential reddening or binaries. Both hypothesis have, however, to be
evaluated in detail before recurring to the presence of multiple stellar
populations. New, high-quality, CCD UBVI photometry have been acquired to this
aim with high-resolution spectroscopy of seven clump stars, that are
complemented with literature data. Our photometric study confirms that the
width of the main sequence close to the turn off point is entirely accounted
for by binary stars and differential reddening, with no need to advocate more
sofisticated scenarios, such as metallicity spread or multiple main sequences.
By constructing synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, we infer that the binary
fraction has to be as large as 30$%$ and their mass ratio in the range 0.6-1.0.
As a by-product of our simulations, we provide new estimates of the cluster
fundamental parameters. We measure a reddening E(B-V)=0.15$\pm$0.02, and
confirm the presence of a marginal differential reddening. The distance to the
cluster is $4.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} $kpc and the age is 3.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr, which is
somewhat younger and better constrained than previous estimates. Our detailed
abundance analysis reveals that, overall, Melotte~66 looks like a typical
object of the old thin disk population.

distribution in Higgs production is studied within the framework of TMD
factorization. For this purpose we consider the TMD evolution for general
colorless scalar boson production, from the lower mass $C$-even scalar
quarkonium states $\chi_{c0}$ and $\chi_{b0}$ to the Higgs mass scale. In the
absence of an intrinsic nonperturbative linearly polarized gluon distribution
the results correspond to the CSS formalism, indicating a rather rapid decrease
with increasing energy scale. At the Higgs mass scale the contribution from
linearly polarized gluons is in this case found to be on the percent level,
somewhat larger than an earlier finding in the literature. At the lower mass
scale of quarkonium states $\chi_{c0}$ and $\chi_{b0}$ we find contributions at
the 15-70% level, albeit with considerable uncertainty. In the presence of an
intrinsic linear gluon polarization, percent level effects are also found at
the Higgs mass scale, but with a considerably slower evolution. Although these
results were obtained using a model for the TMDs that are approximately
Gaussian at small transverse momenta and have the correct perturbative power
law fall off at large transverse momenta, it illustrates well the differences
that can exist between results obtained from a TMD formalism as compared to a
CSS formalism. The behavior of the TMDs at small $p_T$ can affect the results
for all transverse momenta of the produced boson, even for a particle as heavy
as the Higgs. The TMD evolution from $\chi_{c0}$ to $\chi_{b0}$ may be used to
constrain the nonperturbative contributions and improve on the prediction of
the effect at the Higgs mass scale.

optical phonon and starts the next period of acceleration. The inclusion of
spin degree of freedom into the streaming-regime kinetics gives rise to rich
and interesting spin-related phenomena. Firstly, in the streaming regime the
spin relaxation is substantially modified, and the current-induced spin
orientation is remarkably increased. Under short-pulsed photoexcitation at the
bottom of conduction band the photoelectrons execute a periodic damped motion
in the energy space with the period equal to the free flight time of an

polarized so that the photocarriers are spin oriented, then the spin energy
distribution is oscillating in time as well, which can be detected in the

stochastically in space and time. The population is composed of two morphs
(that is, individuals of the same species with different genotypes). In terms
of survival and reproductive success, the associated phenotypes differ only in
their habitat selection strategies. We compute invasion rates corresponding to
the rates at which the abundance of an initially rare morph increases in the
presence of the other morph established at equilibrium. If both morphs have
positive invasion rates when rare, then there is an equilibrium distribution
such that the two morphs coexist; that is, there is a protected polymorphism
for habitat selection. Alternatively, if one morph has a negative invasion rate
when rare, then it is asymptotically displaced by the other morph under all
initial conditions where both morphs are present. We refine the
characterization of an evolutionary stable strategy for habitat selection from
[Schreiber, 2012] in a mathematically rigorous manner. We provide a necessary
and sufficient condition for the existence of an ESS that uses all patches and
determine when using a single patch is an ESS. We also provide an explicit
formula for the ESS when there are two habitat types. We show that adding
environmental stochasticity results in an ESS that, when compared to the ESS
for the corresponding model without stochasticity, spends less time in patches
with larger carrying capacities and possibly makes use of sink patches, thereby
practicing a spatial form of bet hedging.

underlying set system is formalized in terms of a hypergraph $G = (V, E)$ whose
edges arrive one-by-one and the goal is to construct an edge cover $F \subseteq
E$ with the objective of minimizing the cardinality (or cost in the weighted
case) of $F$. We consider a parameterized relaxation of this problem, where
given some $0 \leq \epsilon < 1$, the goal is to construct an edge $(1 -
\epsilon)$-cover, namely, a subset of edges incident to all but an
$\epsilon$-fraction of the vertices (or their benefit in the weighted case).
The key limitation imposed on the algorithm is that its space is limited to
(poly)logarithmically many bits per vertex.
  Our main result is an asymptotically tight trade-off between $\epsilon$ and
the approximation ratio: We design a semi-streaming algorithm that on input
graph $G$, constructs a succinct data structure $\mathcal{D}$ such that for
every $0 \leq \epsilon < 1$, an edge $(1 - \epsilon)$-cover that approximates
the optimal edge \mbox{($1$-)cover} within a factor of $f(\epsilon, n)$ can be
extracted from $\mathcal{D}$ (efficiently and with no additional space
requirements), where \[ f(\epsilon, n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} O (1 /
\epsilon), & \text{if } \epsilon > 1 / \sqrt{n} \\ O (\sqrt{n}), &
\text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \, . \] In particular for the traditional
set cover problem we obtain an $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation. This algorithm is
proved to be best possible by establishing a family (parameterized by
$\epsilon$) of matching lower bounds.

the region) at which to offer its channel without knowing the transmission
qualities of the channels of its competitors. We formulate the above problem as
a non-cooperative game. We consider two scenarios-i) when the region is small,
ii) when the region is large. In the first setting, we focus on a class of
conflict graphs, known as mean valid graphs which commonly arise when the
region is small. We explicitly compute a symmetric Nash equilibrium (NE); the
NE is threshold type in that primaries only choose independent set whose
cardinality is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold on the
cardinality increases with increase in quality of the channel on sale. We show
that the symmetric NE strategy profile is unique in a special class of conflict
graphs (linear graph). In the second setting, we consider node symmetric
conflict graphs which arises when the number of locations is large
(potentially, infinite). We explicitly compute a symmetric NE that randomizes
equally among the maximum independent sets at a given channel state vector. In
the NE a primary only selects the maximum independent set at a given channel
state vector. We show that the two symmetric NEs computed in two settings
exhibit important structural difference.

assumption on the predictors and (3) moment conditions on the noise appearing
in the linear representation. Two kinds of aggregations are considered giving
rise to different moment conditions on the noise and more or less sharp oracle
inequalities. We apply this approach for deriving an adaptive predictor for
locally stationary time varying autoregressive (TVAR) processes. It is obtained
by aggregating a finite number of well chosen predictors, each of them enjoying
an optimal minimax convergence rate under specific smoothness conditions on the
TVAR coefficients. We show that the obtained aggregated predictor achieves a
minimax rate while adapting to the unknown smoothness. To prove this result, a
lower bound is established for the minimax rate of the prediction risk for the
TVAR process. Numerical experiments complete this study. An important feature
of this approach is that the aggregated predictor can be computed recursively
and is thus applicable in an online prediction context.

cyclically adjacent transpositions is not normal. In the present paper, it is
proved that the complete transposition graph is not a normal Cayley graph, for
all $n \ge 3$. Furthermore, the automorphism group of the complete
transposition graph is shown to equal \[ \Aut(\Cay(S_n,S)) = (R(S_n) \rtimes
\Inn(S_n)) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2, \] where $R(S_n)$ is the right regular
representation of $S_n$, $\Inn(S_n)$ is the group of inner automorphisms of
$S_n$, and $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \langle h \rangle$, where $h$ is the map $\alpha
\mapsto \alpha^{-1}$.

  Granular Filters","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As deposits accumulate in a granular filter, pressure drop across the filter
bed required to maintain a constant fluid flow rate may increase. Two pressure
drop increase patterns had been observed. In slow sand filters pressure drop
remains unchanged for a certain period of time then increases exponentially
with the volume of filtrate; in granular aerosol filters pressure drop
increases linearly with the amount of deposits from the beginning of the
filtration process. New concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous depositions
were introduced in this paper. A statistical model based on these new concepts
was developed. This non-linear model was able to reproduce both observed
pressure drop increase patterns, including the linear one. Excellent agreements
between the present model and experimental measurements were obtained. It was
concluded that the two pressure drop increase patterns were indeed caused by
different deposit distributions rather than different pressure drop increase
mechanisms.

values (VEVs) of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor for a massive
scalar field with general curvature coupling for a cylindrical shell in
background of dS spacetime. The field is prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum
state and on the shell the corresponding operator obeys Robin boundary
condition. In the region inside the shell and for non-Neumann boundary
conditions, the Bunch-Davies vacuum is a physically realizable state for all
values of the mass and curvature coupling parameter. For both interior and
exterior regions, the VEVs are decomposed into boundary-free dS and
shell-induced parts. We show that the shell-induced part of the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor has a nonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to
the energy flux along the radial direction. Unlike to the case of a shell in
Minkowski bulk, for dS background the axial stresses are not equal to the
energy density. In dependence of the mass and of the coefficient in the
boundary condition, the vacuum energy density and the energy flux can be either
positive or negative. The influence of the background gravitational field on
the boundary-induced effects is crucial at distances from the shell larger than
the dS curvature scale. In particular, the decay of the VEVs with the distance
is power-law (monotonic or oscillatory with dependence of the mass) for both
massless and massive fields. For Neumann boundary condition the decay is faster
than that for non-Neumann conditions.
