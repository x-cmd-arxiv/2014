the qualitative implications for the statistics of work coming from considering
processes described by operators that either commute or do not commute with the
unperturbed Hamiltonian of a given system. We consider a quantum many-body

interpretation, for a thermal initial state, to all of the cumulants of the
work in the case of quenched operators commuting with the unperturbed
Hamiltonian. In the commuting case the observables that we need to measure have
an intuitive physical meaning. Conversely, in the non-commuting case we show
that, although it is possible to operate fully within the single-measurement
framework irrespectively of the size of the quench, some difficulties are faced
in providing a clear-cut physical interpretation to the cumulants. This
circumstance makes the study of the physics of the system non-trivial and
highlights the non-intuitive phenomenology of the emergence of thermodynamics
from the fully quantum microscopic description. We illustrate our ideas with
the example of the Ising model in a transverse field showing the interesting

evolution of supermassive black holes. Measuring the intrinsic luminosity
function is difficult in practice, due to a multitude of observational and
systematic effects. As sample sizes increase and measurement errors drop,
characterizing the systematic effects is becoming more important. It is well
known that the continuum emission from the accretion disk of quasars is
anisotropic --- in part due to its disk-like structure --- but current
luminosity function calculations effectively assume isotropy over the range of
unobscured lines of sight. Here, we provide the first steps in characterizing
the effect of random quasar orientations and simple models of anisotropy on
observed luminosity functions. We find that the effect of orientation is not
insignificant and exceeds other potential corrections such as those from
gravitational lensing of foreground structures. We argue that current
observational constraints may overestimate the intrinsic luminosity function by
as much as a factor of ~2 on the bright end. This has implications for models
of quasars and their role in the Universe, such as quasars' contribution to
cosmological backgrounds.

inspired new theories of planet formation that invoke gravitation interactions

including many potentially rocky planets. Most of these systems include
multiple planets with closely-spaced orbits and sizes between that of Earth and
Neptune. These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of
planetary systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to
explain the properties of giant exoplanets. Presently, we have limited
knowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their sizes and orbital
periods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler,
the method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique
for characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations
for hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise (but complex) constraints on
planetary masses, densities and orbits, even for planetary systems with faint
host stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations
into increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution
of planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler

affected by a `damping effect' which occurs whenever the light emitted by the
quasar travels through regions of the Universe with higher matter
concentration. To decode the information conveyed by the Lyman-alpha forest
about the matter distribution, we must be able to separate the smooth
`continuum' from the noise and the contribution of the damping effect in the

use a nonparametric functional regression model in which both the response and
the predictor variable (the smooth part of the damping-free portion of the

introduce large biases in the extracted masses and spins. The use of a model

from $s$ to $t$, guaranteeing a small relative error as long $\pi_s(t)>\delta$.
Existing algorithms for this problem have a running-time of $\Omega(1/\delta)$;
in comparison, FAST-PPR has a provable average running-time guarantee of
${O}(\sqrt{d/\delta})$ (where $d$ is the average in-degree of the graph). This
is a significant improvement, since $\delta$ is often $O(1/n)$ (where $n$ is
the number of nodes) for applications. We also complement the algorithm with an
$\Omega(1/\sqrt{\delta})$ lower bound for PageRank estimation, showing that the
dependence on $\delta$ cannot be improved.
  We perform a detailed empirical study on numerous massive graphs, showing
that FAST-PPR dramatically outperforms existing algorithms. For example, on the
2010 Twitter graph with 1.5 billion edges, for target nodes sampled by
popularity, FAST-PPR has a $20$ factor speedup over the state of the art.
Furthermore, an enhanced version of FAST-PPR has a $160$ factor speedup on the

concept of a transfer function of linear input-plant-output systems to
arbitrary quantum nonlinear Markovian input-output models. This is intended as
a tool in the characterization of quantum feedback control systems that fits in
with the general theory of networks. The definition exploits the linearity of
noise differentials in both the plant Heisenberg equations of motion and the
differential form of the input-output relations. Mathematically, the
characteristic operator is a matrix of dimension equal to the number of outputs
times the number of inputs (which must coincide), but with entries that are
operators of the plant system. In this sense the characteristic operator
retains details of the effective plant dynamical structure and is an
essentially quantum object. We illustrate the relevance to model reduction and
simplification by showing that the convergence of the characteristic operator
in adiabatic elimination limit models requires the same conditions and
assumptions appearing in the work on limit quantum stochastic differential
theorems of Bouten and Silberfarb. This approach also shows in a natural way
that the limit coefficients of the quantum stochastic differential equations in
adiabatic elimination problems arise algebraically as Schur complements, and
amounts to a model reduction where the fast degrees of freedom are decoupled
from the slow ones, and eliminated.

the 1.0-4.0 microns wavelength range. These diffraction limited images reveal
an extended circumstellar dust lane in front of the star, that exhibits a high
opacity in the J band and becomes translucent in the H and K bands. In the L
band, extended thermal emission from the dust is detected. We reproduce these
observations using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer modeling of a dust disk with
the RADMC-3D code. We also present new interferometric observations with the
VLTI/VINCI and MIDI instruments. We measure in the K band an upper limit to the
limb-darkened angular diameter of theta_LD = 17.9 +/- 1.6 mas, converting to a
maximum linear radius of R = 123 +/- 14 Rsun. Considering the geometry of the
extended K band emission in the NACO images, this upper limit is probably close
to the actual angular diameter of the star. The position of L2 Pup in the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msun
and is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. We
do not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics and
interferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobble
in the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellar
material. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as the
large loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the disk
in our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar wind
of L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object. The geometric configuration that we

  3D streaks",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Global and local absolute instabilities of 2D wakes are known to be
stabilized by spanwise periodic modulations of the wake profile. The present
study shows that this stabilizing effect is of general nature and can be
mimicked by enforcing spanwise periodic modulations of the wave advection
velocity in the generalized complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. The first order
sensitivity of the absolute and global growth rate to the enforced modulation
is zero, exactly as in the Navier-Stokes case. We show that a second order
sensitivity analysis is effective to quantify and interpret the observed
stabilizing effect. The global growth rates predicted by the second order
expansion closely match those issued from a direct computation of the
eigenvalues. It is shown that, at leading order, the modulation of the wave
advection velocity alters the effective wave diffusion coefficient in the
dispersion relation and that this variation induces a reduction of the absolute
growth rate and the stabilization of the global instability.

changes of the initial state decay, to a chaotic, where they grow
exponentially. We show, that this mechanism is regulated through \textsf{the

first, we have the case where each link can change with probability pt, i.e.
the network changes occur locally and independently at each node. Secondly we
consider the case where the entire connectivity matrix changes with probability
pt, i.e. the change is global. We show that network changes, occurring both
locally and globally, yield an enhanced range of synchronization. When the
connections are changed slowly (i.e. pt is low) the nodes display nearly
synchronized intervals interrupted by intermittent unsynchronized chaotic
bursts. However when the connections are switched quickly (i.e. pt is large),
the intermittent behavior quickly settles down to a steady synchronized state.
Furthermore we find that the mean time taken to reach synchronization from
generic random initial states is significantly reduced when the underlying
links change more rapidly. We also analyze the probabilistic dynamics of the
system with changing connectivity and the stable synchronized range thus
obtained is in broad agreement with those observed numerically.

incidence algebras and M\""obius inversion: it is a simplicial infinity-groupoid
satisfying an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition, which
expresses decomposition. We work on the objective level of homotopy linear
algebra with coefficients in infinity-groupoids, developed along the way. To
any (complete) decomposition space there is associated an incidence (co)algebra
(with coefficients in infinity-groupoids), shown to satisfy a sign-free version
of the M\""obius inversion principle. Examples of decomposition spaces beyond
Segal spaces are given by the Waldhausen S-construction and by Schmitt
restriction species. Imposing certain homotopy finiteness conditions yields the
notion of M\""obius decomposition space, an extension of the notion of M\""obius
category of Leroux. We take a functorial viewpoint throughout, emphasising
conservative ULF functors, and show that most reduction procedures in the
classical theory are examples of this notion, and in particular that many are
examples of decalage of decomposition spaces. Our main theorem concerns the
Lawvere-Menni Hopf algebra of M\""obius intervals, which contains the universal
M\""obius function (but does not come from a M\""obius category): we establish
that M\""obius intervals form a decomposition space, which is in some sense
universal.
  NOTE: The notion of decomposition space was arrived at independently by
Dyckerhoff and Kapranov (arXiv:1212.3563) who call it unital 2-Segal space. Our
theory is quite orthogonal to theirs.

destroyed upon disc passage, unless the initial cloud mass is well in excess of

became the subject of an intensive multi-wavelength observational campaign. We
analyze data from the Swift and Suzaku satellites to produce a detailed X-ray
light curve augmented by epochs of spectral information. X-ray observations
yield mostly non-detections in the first four months of outburst, but both a
super-soft and hard X-ray component rise rapidly after Day 115. The super-soft
X-ray component, attributable to the photosphere of the nuclear-burning white
dwarf, is relatively cool (~45 eV) and implies that the white dwarf in T Pyx is
significantly below the Chandrasekhar mass (~1 M_sun). The late turn-on time of
the super-soft component yields a large nova ejecta mass (>~10^-5 M_sun),
consistent with estimates at other wavelengths. The hard X-ray component is
well fit by a ~1 keV thermal plasma, and is attributed to shocks internal to
the 2011 nova ejecta. The presence of a strong oxygen line in this thermal
plasma on Day 194 requires a significantly super-solar abundance of oxygen and
implies that the ejecta are polluted by white dwarf material. The X-ray light
curve can be explained by a dual-phase ejection, with a significant delay
between the first and second ejection phases, and the second ejection finally
released two months after outburst. A delayed ejection is consistent with

the basic ingredients of spintronic devices. Long spin lifetimes during transit
are an important ingredient in realizing this technology. An attractive
platform for this purpose is graphene, which has high mobilities and low
spin-orbit coupling. Unfortunately, measured spin lifetimes are orders of
magnitude smaller than theoretically expected. A source of spin loss is the
resistance mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene. While
this has been studied numerically, here we provide a closed form expression for
Hanle spin precession which is the standard method of measuring spin lifetimes.

masses and predominantly passive stellar populations. A variety of processes
have been suggested that could reduce the star formation in such galaxies to
observed levels, including quasar mode feedback, virial shock heating, or
galactic winds driven by stellar feedback. However, the main quenching
mechanisms have yet to be identified. Here we study the origin of star
formation quenching using Argo, a cosmological, hydrodynamical zoom-in
simulation that follows the evolution of a massive galaxy at $z\geq{}2$. This
simulation adopts the same sub-grid recipes of the Eris simulations, which have
been shown to form realistic disk galaxies, and, in one version, adopts also a
mass and spatial resolution identical to Eris. The resulting galaxy has
properties consistent with those of observed, massive (M_* ~ 1e11 M_sun)
galaxies at z~2 and with abundance matching predictions. Our models do not
include AGN feedback indicating that supermassive black holes likely play a
subordinate role in determining masses and sizes of massive galaxies at high z.
The specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the simulated galaxy matches the
observed M_* - sSFR relation at early times. This period of smooth stellar mass
growth comes to a sudden halt at z=3.5 when the sSFR drops by almost an order
of magnitude within a few hundred Myr. The suppression is initiated by a
leveling off and a subsequent reduction of the cool gas accretion rate onto the
galaxy, and not by feedback processes. This ""cosmological starvation"" occurs as
the parent dark matter halo switches from a fast collapsing mode to a slow
accretion mode. Additional mechanisms, such as perhaps radio mode feedback from
an AGN, are needed to quench any residual star formation of the galaxy and to
maintain a low sSFR until the present time.

Webb Space Telescope may distinguish this hypothesis from alternatives such as
a dynamically excited Kuiper Belt analogue. Although competing hypotheses
exist, the observation that $\gtrsim 15\%$ of young white dwarfs possess such

evidence that low mass gas giants (thought necessary to produce an Oort cloud)

eliminate the use of range rate measurement by using an estimated range rate,

is required for proper development in vertebrates, and changes in CpG
methylation are essential to cellular differentiation. Genome-wide DNA
methylation assays have become increasingly common, and recently distinct
stages across differentiating cellular lineages have been assayed. How- ever,
current methods for modeling methylation dynamics do not account for the
dependency structure between precursor and dependent cell types. We developed a
continuous-time Markov chain approach, based on the observation that changes in
methylation state over tissue differentiation can be modeled similarly to DNA
nucleotide changes over evolutionary time. This model explicitly takes
precursor to descendant relationships into account and enables inference of CpG
methylation dynamics. To illustrate our method, we analyzed a high-resolution
methylation map of the differentiation of mouse stem cells into several blood
cell types. Our model can successfully infer unobserved CpG methylation states
from observations at the same sites in related cell types (90% correct), and
this approach more accurately reconstructs missing data than imputation based
on neighboring CpGs (84% correct). Additionally, the single CpG resolution of
our methylation dynamics estimates enabled us to show that DNA sequence context
of CpG sites is informative about methylation dynamics across tissue
differentiation. Finally, we identified genomic regions with clusters of highly
dynamic CpGs and present a likely functional example. Our work establishes a
framework for inference and modeling that is well-suited to DNA methylation
data, and our success suggests that other methods for analyzing DNA nucleotide
substitutions will also translate to the modeling of epigenetic phenomena.

  Among other things we extended the classical notion of a Gibbsian
specification on $\mathbb{N}$ in such way that the similarity of many results

result claims that the construction of the conformal Measures in Dynamical
Systems for Walters potentials, using the Ruelle operator, can be formulated in
terms of Specification. We also describe the Ising model, with
$1/r^{2+\varepsilon}$ interaction energy, in the Thermodynamic Formalism

present an explicit expression. We also provide an alternative way for
obtaining the uniqueness of the DLR-Gibbs measures.

pages in a multi-article layout is a common layout challenge for most
commercially printed newspapers and magazines. To date, no one has created an
algorithm that determines a minimal pagination break point based on the content
of the article. Existing approaches for automatic multi-article layout focus
exclusively on maximizing content (number of articles) and optimizing aesthetic
presentation (e.g., spacing between articles). However, disregarding the
semantic information within the article can lead to overly aggressive cutting,
thereby eliminating key content and potentially confusing the reader, or
setting too generous of a break point, thereby leaving in superfluous content
and making automatic layout more difficult. This is one of the remaining
challenges on the path from manual layouts to fully automated processes that
still ensure article content quality. In this work, we present a new approach
to calculating a document minimal break point for the task of pagination. Our
approach uses a statistical language model to predict minimal break points
based on the semantic content of an article. We then compare 4 novel candidate
approaches, and 4 baselines (currently in use by layout algorithms). Results
from this experiment show that one of our approaches strongly outperforms the
baselines and alternatives. Results from a second study suggest that humans are
not able to agree on a single ""best"" break point. Therefore, this work shows
that a semantic-based lower bound break point prediction is necessary for ideal
automated document synthesis within a real-world context.

symmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law. It is, however, deficient
in several respects: (i) it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system
interacts with an environment, and (ii) even in the case where the system is
isolated, if the quantum state is mixed then the Noether conservation laws do
not capture all of the consequences of the symmetries. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce measures of the extent to which a quantum state
breaks a symmetry. Such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions:
for nonisolated systems, they cannot increase, while for isolated systems they
are conserved. We demonstrate that the problem of finding nontrivial asymmetry
measures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory.
Applications include deriving model-independent bounds on the quantum noise in
amplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high-precision
metrology.

be written as the sum of r rank-one nonnegative matrices. The nonnegative rank
has received a lot of attention recently due to its application in
optimization, probability and communication complexity. In this paper we study
a class of atomic rank functions defined on a convex cone which generalize
several notions of ""positive"" ranks such as nonnegative rank or cp-rank (for
completely positive matrices). The main contribution of the paper is a new
method to obtain lower bounds for such ranks which improve on previously known
bounds. Additionally the bounds we propose can be computed by semidefinite
programming. The idea of the lower bound relies on an atomic norm approach
where the atoms are self-scaled according to the vector (or matrix, in the case
of nonnegative rank) of interest. This results in a lower bound that is
invariant under scaling and that is at least as good as other existing
norm-based bounds.
  We mainly focus our attention on the two important cases of nonnegative rank
and cp-rank where our bounds satisfying interesting properties: For the
nonnegative rank we show that our lower bound can be interpreted as a
non-combinatorial version of the fractional rectangle cover number, while the
sum-of-squares relaxation is closely related to the Lov\'asz theta number of
the rectangle graph of the matrix. We also prove that the lower bound inherits
many of the structural properties satisfied by the nonnegative rank such as
invariance under diagonal scaling, subadditivity, etc. We also apply our method
to obtain lower bounds on the cp-rank for completely positive matrices. In this
case we prove that our lower bound is always greater than or equal the plain
rank lower bound, and we show that it has interesting connections with
combinatorial lower bounds based on edge-clique cover number.

our study, strong sinusoidal signals (peak-to-peak amplitudes >2%) are confined
to the L/T transition (4/16 objects with L9-T3.5 spectral types and 0/41
objects for all other spectral types). The probability that the observed
occurrence rates for strong variability inside and outside the L/T transition
originate from the same underlying true occurrence rate is excluded with >99.7%
confidence. These observations suggest that the settling of condensate clouds
below the photosphere in brown dwarf atmospheres does not occur in a spatially
uniform manner. Rather, the formation and sedimentation of dust grains at the
L/T transition is coupled to atmospheric dynamics, resulting in highly
contrasting regions of thick and thin clouds and/or clearings. Outside the L/T
transition we identify 5 weak variables (peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.6%-1.6%).

between strong variability and L/T transition spectral types, providing
evidence in support of the hypothesis that cloud holes contribute to the abrupt

superlinearly, as $x^q$, $q\ge 1$, with the amount $x$ of resources used. We
define a novel linear programming relaxation for such problems, and then show
that the integrality gap of the relaxation is $A_q$, where $A_q$ is the $q$-th

obtain approximation algorithms for the Minimum Energy Efficient Routing,
Minimum Degree Balanced Spanning Tree, Load Balancing on Unrelated Parallel

  Our analysis relies on the decoupling inequality for nonnegative random

C_q \,\big \|\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\big\|_{q},$$ where $X_i$ are independent

proved by de la Pe\~na in 1990. De la Pe\~na, Ibragimov, and Sharakhmetov
(2003) showed that $C_q\leq 2$ for $q\in (1,2)$ and $C_q\leq A_q^{1/q}$ for
$q\geq 2$. We show that the optimal constant is $C_q=A_q^{1/q}$ for any $q\geq
1$. We then prove a more general inequality: For every convex function
$\varphi$, $$\mathbb{E}[\varphi\Big(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Big)]\leq

force-free field (NLFFF) in solar active region 11158 to clarify the dynamics
of an X2.2-class solar flare. We found that the NLFFF never shows the drastic
dynamics seen in observations, i.e., it is in stable state against the
perturbations. On the other hand, the MHD simulation shows that when the
strongly twisted lines are formed at close to the neutral line, which are
produced via tether-cutting reconnection in the twisted lines of the NLFFF,
consequently they erupt away from the solar surface via the complicated
reconnection. This result supports the argument that the strongly twisted lines
formed in NLFFF via tether-cutting reconnection are responsible for breaking
the force balance condition of the magnetic fields in the lower solar corona.
In addition to this the dynamical evolution of these field lines reveals that
at the initial stage the spatial pattern of the footpoints caused by the
reconnection of the twisted lines appropriately maps the distribution of the
observed two-ribbon flares. Interestingly, after the flare the reconnected
field lines convert into the structure like the post flare loops, which is
analogous to EUV image taken by SDO. Eventually, we found that the twisted
lines exceed a critical height at which the flux tube becomes unstable to the
torus instability. These results illustrate the reliability of our simulation

with filamentous actin (F-actin) networks to generate contractile forces in

varying stiffness is poorly understood. Here, we incorporated literature values
for properties of myosin II isoforms into a cross-bridge model. Similar actin
gliding speeds and force-velocity curves expected from previous experiments
were observed. Motor force output on an elastic load was regulated by two
timescales--that of their attachment to F-actin, which varied sharply with the
ensemble size, motor duty ratio, and external load, and that of force build up,
which scaled with ensemble stall force, gliding speed, and load stiffness.
While such regulation did not require force-dependent kinetics, the myosin
catch bond produced positive feedback between attachment time and force to
trigger switch-like transitions from short attachments and small forces to high
force-generating runs at threshold parameter values. Parameters representing
skeletal muscle myosin, non-muscle myosin IIB, and non-muscle myosin IIA
revealed distinct regimes of behavior respectively: (1) large assemblies of
fast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of
environmental stiffness, (2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as
high-affinity cross-links with force build-up times that exceed physiological
timescales, and (3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at
intermediate speeds may respond sharply to changes in mechanical context--at
low forces or stiffness, they serve as low affinity cross-links but they can
transition to effective force production via the positive feedback mechanism

relevant consequences when the task is the interpretation of quantum mechanics

quantum states of subsystems in the same sense as quantum states are states of
the whole composite system. After clearly stating the problem, our argument is
developed in three stages. First, we consider the phenomenon of
environment-induced decoherence as an example of the case in which the
subsystems interact with each other; we show that decoherence does not solve
the measurement problem precisely because the reduced state of the measuring
apparatus is not its quantum state. Second, the non-interacting case is
illustrated in the context of no-collapse interpretations, in which we show
that certain well-known experimental results cannot be accounted for due to the
fact that the reduced states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus
are conceived as their quantum states. Finally, we prove that reduced states
are a kind of coarse-grained states, and for this reason they cancel the
correlations of the subsystem with other subsystems with which it interacts or
is entangled.

access the licensed channels opportunistically. A fundamental and essential
operation for SUs is to establish communication through choosing a common
channel at the same time slot, which is referred to as rendezvous problem. In
this paper, we study strategies to achieve fast rendezvous for two secondary
users.
  The channel availability for secondary nodes is subject to temporal and
spatial variation. Moreover, in a distributed system, one user is oblivious of
the other user's channel status. Therefore, a fast rendezvous is not trivial.
Recently, a number of rendezvous strategies have been proposed for different
system settings, but rarely have they taken the temporal variation of the
channels into account. In this work, we first derive a time-adaptive strategy
with optimal expected time-to-rendezvous (TTR) for synchronous systems in
stable environments, where channel availability is assumed to be static over
time. Next, in dynamic environments, which better represent temporally dynamic
channel availability in CRNs, we first derive optimal strategies for two
special cases, and then prove that our strategy is still asymptotically optimal
in general dynamic cases.
  Numerous simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our
strategies, and validate the theoretical analysis. The impacts of different
parameters on the TTR are also investigated, such as the number of channels,
the channel open possibilities, the extent of the environment being dynamic,
and the existence of an intruder.

(NIR) emission emanating from the innermost parts of some debris disks. The
origin of this dust, however, is still a matter of debate. We test whether hot
exozodiacal dust can be supplied from an exterior parent belt by
Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag, paying special attention to the pile-up of dust
that occurs due to the interplay of P-R drag and dust sublimation.
Specifically, we investigate whether pile-ups still occur when collisions are
taken into account, and if they can explain the observed NIR excess. We compute
the steady-state distribution of dust in the inner disk by solving the
continuity equation. First, we derive an analytical solution under a number of
simplifying assumptions. Second, we develop a numerical debris disk model that
for the first time treats the complex interaction of collisions, P-R drag, and
sublimation in a self-consistent way. From the resulting dust distributions we
generate thermal emission spectra and compare these to observed excess NIR
fluxes. We confirm that P-R drag always supplies a small amount of dust to the
sublimation zone, but find that a fully consistent treatment yields a maximum
amount of dust that is about 7 times lower than that given by analytical
estimates. The NIR excess due this material is much smaller (<10^-3 for A-type
stars with parent belts at >1 AU) than the values derived from interferometric
observations (~10^-2). Pile-up of dust still occurs when collisions are
considered, but its effect on the NIR flux is insignificant. Finally, the
cross-section in the innermost regions is clearly dominated by barely bound
grains.

CoREAS simulations for more than 300 measured events with energy above
$10^{17}\,$eV and zenith angles smaller than $45^\circ$, we find that the radio
wavefront of cosmic-ray air showers is of approximately hyperbolic shape. The
simulations predict a slightly steeper wavefront towards East than towards
West, but this asymmetry is negligible against the measurement uncertainties of
LOPES. At axis distances $\gtrsim 50\,$m, the wavefront can be approximated by
a simple cone. According to the simulations, the cone angle is clearly
correlated with the shower maximum. Thus, we confirm earlier predictions that
arrival time measurements can be used to study the longitudinal shower
development, but now using a realistic wavefront. Moreover, we show that the
hyperbolic wavefront is compatible with our measurement, and we present several
experimental indications that the cone angle is indeed sensitive to the shower
development. Consequently, the wavefront can be used to statistically study the
primary composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At LOPES, the
experimentally achieved precision for the shower maximum is limited by
measurement uncertainties to approximately $140\,$g/cm$^2$. But the simulations
indicate that under better conditions this method might yield an accuracy for
the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$, better than
$30\,$g/cm$^2$. This would be competitive with the established air-fluorescence
and air-Cherenkov techniques, where the radio technique offers the advantage of
a significantly higher duty-cycle. Finally, the hyperbolic wavefront can be
used to reconstruct the shower geometry more accurately, which potentially
allows a better reconstruction of all other shower parameters, too.

MC-FRUC is affected by the distance between the available frames used for the
interpolation. Moreover, the dependency in temporal-distance implies an inverse
effect of the frame-rate. FRUC performance analysis considers the prediction
error variance, since it equals to the mean-squared-error of the interpolation.
However, MC-coding analysis requires the entire autocorrelation function of the
error; hence, analytic simplicity is beneficial. Therefore, we propose two
constructions of a separable autocorrelation function for prediction error in
MC-coding. We conclude by comparing our estimations with experimental results.

Unfortunately, an embedding of $n$ points is specified by $n^3$ triplets,
making collecting every triplet an expensive task. In noticing this difficulty,
other researchers have investigated more intelligent triplet sampling
techniques, but they do not study their effectiveness or their potential
drawbacks. Although it is important to reduce the number of collected triplets,
it is also important to understand how best to display a triplet collection
task to a user. In this work we explore an alternative display for collecting
triplets and analyze the monetary cost and speed of the display. We propose
best practices for creating cost effective human intelligence tasks for
collecting triplets. We show that rather than changing the sampling algorithm,
simple changes to the crowdsourcing UI can lead to much higher quality
embeddings. We also provide a dataset as well as the labels collected from
crowd workers.

transport properties of rarified gases in matter. It describes the dynamics of
a cloud of non-interacting point particles in an infinite array of fixed
spherical scatterers. More than one hundred years after its conception, it is
still a major challenge to understand the nature of the kinetic transport
equation that governs the macroscopic particle dynamics in the limit of low
scatterer density (the Boltzmann-Grad limit). Lorentz suggested that this
equation should be the linear Boltzmann equation. This was confirmed in three
celebrated papers by Gallavotti, Spohn, and Boldrighini, Bunimovich and Sinai,
under the assumption that the distribution of scatterers is sufficiently
disordered. In the case of strongly correlated scatterer configurations (such
as crystals or quasicrystals), we now understand why the linear Boltzmann
equation fails and what to substitute it with. A particularly striking feature
of the periodic Lorentz gas is a heavy tail for the distribution of free path
lengths, with a diverging second moment, and superdiffusive transport in the
limit of large times.

baryon physics on the small scale problems of the CDM model. We show that,
using this model, the cusp/core problem, the missing satellite problem (MSP),
the Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problem, and the angular momentum catastrophe can be
reconciled with observations. Concerning the cusp/core problem, the interaction
among dark matter (DM) and baryonic clumps of 1% the mass of the halo, through
dynamical friction (DF), is able to flatten the inner cusp of the density
profiles. We moreover assume that haloes form primarily through quiescent
accretion, in agreement with the spherical collapse model (SCM)-secondary
infall model (SIM) prescriptions. The results of this paper follow from the two
assumptions above. Concerning the MSP and TBTF problem, applying to the Via
Lactea II (VL2) subhaloes a series of corrections similar to those of Brooks et
al. (2013), namely applying a Zolotov et al. (2012)-like correction obtained
with our model, and further correcting for the UV heating and tidal stripping,
we obtain that the number of massive, luminous satellites is in agreement with
the number observed in the MW. The model also produces an angular momentum
distribution in agreement with observations, that is with the distribution of
the angular spin parameter and angular momentum of the dwarfs studied by van
den Bosch, Burkert, & Swaters (2001). In conclusion, the small scale problems
of the CDM model can all be solved by introducing baryon physics.

the citation impact of institutions be compared? In educational and
psychological testing, percentiles are already used widely as a standard to
evaluate an individual's test scores - intelligence tests for example - by
comparing them with the percentiles of a calibrated sample. Percentiles, or
percentile rank classes, are also a very suitable method for bibliometrics to
normalize citations of publications in terms of the subject category and the
publication year and, unlike the mean-based indicators (the relative citation
rates), percentiles are scarcely affected by skewed distributions of citations.
The percentile of a certain publication provides information about the citation
impact this publication has achieved in comparison to other similar
publications in the same subject category and publication year. Analyses of
percentiles, however, have not always been presented in the most effective and
meaningful way. New APA guidelines (American Psychological Association, 2010)
suggest a lesser emphasis on significance tests and a greater emphasis on the
substantive and practical significance of findings. Drawing on work by Cumming
(2012) we show how examinations of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d statistic) and
confidence intervals can lead to a clear understanding of citation impact
differences.

models solvable in terms of the general Heun functions. Each of the classes is
defined by a pair of generating functions the first of which is referred to as
the amplitude- and the second one as the detuning-modulation function. The
classes suggest numerous families of specific field configurations with
different physical properties generated by appropriate choices of the
transformation of the independent variable, real or complex. There are many
families of models with constant detuning or constant amplitude, numerous
classes of chirped pulses of controllable amplitude and/or detuning, families
of models with double or multiple (periodic) crossings, periodic amplitude
modulation field configurations, etc. We present several families of
constant-detuning field configurations the members of which are symmetric or
asymmetric two-peak finite-area pulses with controllable distance between the
peaks and controllable amplitude of each of the peaks. We show that the edge
shapes, the distance between the peaks as well as the amplitude of the peaks
are controlled almost independently, by different parameters. We identify the
parameters controlling each of the mentioned features and discuss other basic
properties of pulse shapes. We show that the pulse edges may become step-wise
functions and determine the positions of the limiting vertical-wall edges. We
show that the pulse width is controlled by only two of the involved parameters.
For some values of these parameters the pulse width diverges and for some other
values the pulses become infinitely narrow. We show that the effect of the two
mentioned parameters is almost similar, that is, both parameters are able to
independently produce pulses of almost the same shape and width.

experimental artifacts as results of poor KLJN design, which can lead to GAA's
