The charge density wave phase at higher electron doping concentrations as

reasonable to expect that most core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) take place in
binaries and the existence of a companion star may leave some imprints in
observed features. Having this in mind, we have conducted two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of the collisions of CCSNe ejecta with the companion
star in an almost-equal-mass ($\sim 10M_\odot$) binary to find out possible
consequences of such events. In particular we pay attention to the amount of
mass removed and its dependence on the binary separation. In contrast to the
previous surmise, we find that the companion mass is stripped not by momentum
transfer but by shock heating. Up to $25\%$ of the original mass can be removed
for the closest separations and the removed mass decreases as $M_{ub} \propto
a^{-4.3}$ with the binary separation $a$. By performing some experimental
computations with artificially-modified densities of incident ejecta, we show
that if the velocity of ejecta is fixed, the density of incident ejecta is the
single important parameter that actually determines the removed mass as $M_{ub}
\propto \rho_{ej} ^{1.4} $. On the other hand, another set of simulations with
modified velocities of incident ejecta demonstrate that the strength of the
forward shock, which heats up the stellar material and causes the mass loss of
the companion star, is actually the key parameter for the removed mass.

  Over a global field $K$ (number field, or function field of a curve over a
finite field $F$), arithmetic duality theorems for the Galois cohomology of
tori and finite Galois modules have long been known. More recent work
investigates the case where $K$ is the function fields of of a curve over a
$p$-adic field.
  For $K$ the function field of a curve over the formal series field $F={\bf
C}((t))$, we establish analogous duality theorems. We thus control the
obstruction to the local-global principle and to weak approximation for
homogeneous spaces of tori.
  There are differences with the afore described cases. For example the Hasse
principle need not hold for principal homogeneous spaces of a $K$-rational
torus.

DNA through a nanopore. The majority of these studies investigate the
translocation process in a relatively generic sense and do not endeavour to
match any particular set of experimental conditions. In this manuscript, we use
the concept of a P\'eclet number for translocation, $P_t$, to compare the
drift-diffusion balance in a typical experiment vs a typical simulation. We
find that the standard coarse-grained approach over-estimates diffusion effects
by anywhere from a factor of 5 to 50 compared to experimental conditions using
dsDNA. By defining a coarse-graining parameter, $\lambda$, we are able to
correct this and tune the simulations to replicate the experimental $P_t$ (for
dsDNA and other scenarios). To show the effect that a particular $P_t$ can have
on the dynamics of translocation, we perform simulations across a wide range of
$P_t$ values for two different types of driving forces: a force applied in the
pore and a pulling force applied to the end of the polymer. As $P_t$ brings the
system from a diffusion dominated to a drift dominated regime, a variety of
effects are observed including a non-monotonic dependence of the translocation
time $\tau$ on $P_t$ and a steep rise in the probability of translocating.
Comparing the two force cases illustrates the impact of the crowding effects
that occur on the trans side: a non-monotonic dependence of the width of the
$\tau$ distributions is obtained for the in-pore force but not for the pulling
force.

large fraction of the incident light into the central slit. The Double-Pixel is
optimized to resolve two different frequencies in the near infrared. This

optimization procedure combining stochastic gradient descent followed by a
fine-tuning step using the weak supervision provided by blending automatically

code to generate a stellar atmosphere model to fit the observed spectrum and
obtain physical magnitudes. The synthetic spectrum was used as a template for
cross-correlation with the observed spectra to measure radial velocities. The
radial velocity curve provided an orbital solution for the system. We have also
analysed the RXTE/ASM and Swift/BAT light curves to confirm the stability of
the periodicity. BD +6073 is a BN0.7 Ib low-luminosity supergiant located at an
approximate distance of 3.1 kpc, in the CasOB4 association. We derive
Teff=24000 K and log gc=3.0, and chemical abundances consistent with a
moderately high level of evolution. The spectroscopic and evolutionary masses
are consistent at the 1 sigma level with a mass of 15 solar masses. The
recurrence time of the X-ray flares is the orbital period of the system. The NS
is in a high eccentricity (e=0.56) orbit, and the X-ray emission is strongly
peaked around orbital phase 0.2, though the observations are consistent with
some level of X-ray activity happening at all orbital phases. The X-ray
behaviour of IGR J00370+6122 is reminiscent of intermediate SFXTs, though its
peak luminosity is rather low. The orbit is somewhat wider than those of
classical persistent supergiant X-ray binaries, which, combined with the low
luminosity of the mass donor, explains the low X-ray luminosity. IGR
J00370+6122 will likely evolve towards a persistent supergiant system,
highlighting the evolutionary connection between different classes of
wind-accreting X-ray sources.

the study of the isomorphism problem for the zig-zag product is equivalent to
the study of the same problem for the associated pseudo-replacement graph. The
latter is defined in a natural way, by a construction generalizing the
classical replacement product, and its degree is smaller than the degree of the
zig-zag product graph.
  Two particular classes of products are studied in detail: the zig-zag product
of a complete graph with a cycle graph, and the zig-zag product of a
$4$-regular graph with the cycle graph of length $4$. Furthermore, an example
coming from the theory of Schreier graphs associated with the action of
self-similar groups is also considered: the graph products are completely

discrete model. A set of $n$ processors is connected into a $d$-regular
undirected network. In every time step, each processor exchanges some of its
tokens with each of its neighbors in the network. The goal is to minimize the
discrepancy between the number of tokens on the most-loaded and the
least-loaded processor as quickly as possible.
  Rabani et al. (1998) present a general technique for the analysis of a wide
class of discrete load balancing algorithms. Their approach is to characterize
the deviation between the actual loads of a discrete balancing algorithm with
the distribution generated by a related Markov chain. The Markov chain can also
be regarded as the underlying model of a continuous diffusion algorithm. Rabani
et al. showed that after time $T = O(\log (Kn)/\mu)$, any algorithm of their
class achieves a discrepancy of $O(d\log n/\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the spectral
gap of the transition matrix of the graph, and $K$ is the initial load
discrepancy in the system.
  In this work we identify some natural additional conditions on deterministic
balancing algorithms, resulting in a class of algorithms reaching a smaller
discrepancy. This class contains well-known algorithms, eg., the Rotor-Router.
Specifically, we introduce the notion of cumulatively fair load-balancing
algorithms where in any interval of consecutive time steps, the total number of
tokens sent out over an edge by a node is the same (up to constants) for all
adjacent edges. We prove that algorithms which are cumulatively fair and where
every node retains a sufficient part of its load in each step, achieve a
discrepancy of $O(\min\{d\sqrt{\log n/\mu},d\sqrt{n}\})$ in time $O(T)$. We
also show that in general neither of these assumptions may be omitted without
increasing discrepancy. We then show by a combinatorial potential reduction
argument that any cumulatively fair scheme satisfying some additional
assumptions achieves a discrepancy of $O(d)$ almost as quickly as the
continuous diffusion process. This positive result applies to some of the
simplest and most natural discrete load balancing schemes.

thermal stability, and oxidation resistance. However, especially for
arc-evaporated Ti-Al-Ta-N coatings only limited information on the detailed
influence of the elements on various properties is available. Therefore, we
have developed arc-evaporated Ti1-x-yAlxTayN coatings with various Al (x = 0.50
- 0.65) and Ta (y = 0.00 - 0.15) contents. While the thermal stability of our
coatings during annealing in inert He atmosphere increases with increasing Ta
content, best results are obtained for specific Ta-Al ratios during oxidation.
Single phase cubic Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N yields a mass-gain of only ~5 % after 5
h at 950 {\deg}C in synthetic air, whereas Ti0.35Al0.65N is completely oxidized
after 15 min. This is in part based on the suppressed anatase and direct rutile
TiO2 formation at a defined Ta-Al content. Consequently, the anatase-to-rutile
transformation, generally observed for Ti1-xAlxN, is absent. This reduces the
generation of pores and cracks within the oxide scale and especially at the
nitride-oxide interface, leading to the formation of a protective rutile and
corundum based oxide scale. This is also reflected in the pronounced decrease
in activation energy for the protective scale formation from 232 kJ/mol for
Ti0.35Al0.65N down to 14.5 kJ/mol for Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N. Based on our results
we can conclude that especially phase transformations within the oxide scale
need to be suppressed, as the connected volume changes lead to the formation of
cracks and pores.

state of the dynamical system. These measurements are then used to encode the

don't need to have memory and the optimal linear decoders have an order of at

optimal linear filters. For the case where the transmitter has access to noisy

of multivariate stable densities that can also be represented as Bayesian
networks whose edges encode linear dependencies between random variables. One
major hurdle to the extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a
closed-form analytical expression for their densities. This makes penalized
maximum-likelihood based learning computationally demanding. We establish
theoretically that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can asymptotically
be reduced to the computationally more tractable minimum dispersion criterion
(MDC) and develop StabLe, a structure learning algorithm based on MDC. We use
simulated datasets for five benchmark network topologies to empirically
demonstrate how StabLe improves upon ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
We also apply StabLe to microarray gene expression data for lymphoblastoid
cells from 727 individuals belonging to eight global population groups. We
establish that StabLe improves test set performance relative to OLS via
ten-fold cross-validation. Finally, we develop SGEX, a method for quantifying

applying a previously determined nuclear density of $^{48}$Ca, the neutron
densities of the zirconium isotopes are adjusted to optimize the fit to the
fusion data, whereas the proton densities are determined by electron scattering
experiments. It is shown that the fusion data can be explained fairly well by
including couplings to one- and two-phonon excitations of the reacting nuclei
and to one- and two-nucleon transfer reactions but there is also some
sensitivity to multiphonon excitations. The neutron skin thicknesses extracted
for the two zirconium isotopes are consistent with anti-proton measurements.
The densities of the zirconium isotopes are used together with the previously

potentials and predict the fusion cross sections of $^{40}$Ca+$^{90,96}$Zr. The
predicted cross sections for $^{40}$Ca+$^{90}$Zr are in reasonable agreement

transfer is considered. The prediction of the $^{40}$Ca+$^{96}$Zr fusion cross
section, on the other hand, is poor and under-predicts the data by 30 to 40%.
Although couplings to transfer channels with positive $Q$ values were expected
to play an important role, they are not able to explain the data, primarily
because the predicted Coulomb barrier is about 1.5 MeV too high. Possible

eleven old to intermediate age open clusters. The masses of these stars are all
above the Kraft break, so that they lose negligible amounts of their birth
angular momentum (AM) during the main sequence evolution. However, they do span
a mass range with quite different AM distributions imparted during formation,
with the stars less massive than ~1.6 M_Sun arriving on the main sequence with
lower rotation rates than the more massive stars. The majority of RGs in this
study are slow rotators across the entire red giant branch regardless of mass,
supporting the picture that intermediate mass stars rapidly spin down when they
evolve off the main sequence and develop convection zones capable of driving a
magnetic dynamo. Nevertheless, a small fraction of RGs in open clusters show
some level of enhanced rotation, and faster rotators are as common in these
clusters as in the field red giant population. Most of these enhanced rotators
appear to be red clump stars, which is also true of the underlying stellar
sample, while others are clearly RGs that are above or below the clump. In
addition to rotational velocities, the radial velocities and membership
probabilities of individual stars are also presented. Cluster heliocentric
radial velocities for NGC 6005 and Pismis 18 are reported for the first time.

close-in to be significantly affected by tidal dissipation in the parent star,
to a degree parametrized by the tidal quality factor $Q_*$. This process speeds
up their stars' rotation rate while reducing the planets' semimajor axis. In

(EoR) power spectrum, it is crucial that strong foreground contaminants be
robustly suppressed. These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as
Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all
share the property of being spectrally smooth, and when viewed through the
chromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature ""wedge"" region in
cylindrical $k_\perp k_\parallel$ Fourier space. The complement of the
foreground wedge is termed the ""EoR window"", and is expected to be mostly
foreground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper
is a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical
framework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use
our framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be
enlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement.
We adapt the FKP approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm
cosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler
estimators that ignore covariances between different Fourier modes. The optimal
quadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of
$\sim 10^5$ in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the
detection of the cosmological signal from $12\sigma$ to $50\sigma$ at the
midpoint of reionization in our fiducial models. If numerical issues can be
finessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged,
enabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These
techniques do not assume that foreground are Gaussian-distributed, and we
additionally prove that a final round of foreground subtraction can be
performed after decorrelation in a way that is guaranteed to have no
cosmological signal loss.

twofold. First, it compensates for a repulsion created by the so-called
diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC). Second, the GP enhances the
non-adiabatic transition probability for a wave-packet part that experiences a
central collision with the CI. To assess the significance of both GP
contributions we propose two indicators that can be computed from parameters of
electronic surfaces and initial conditions. To generalize our analysis to
N-dimensional systems we introduce a reduction of a general N-dimensional LVC
model to an effective 2D LVC model using a mode transformation that preserves
short-time dynamics of the original N-dimensional model. Using examples of the
bis(methylene) adamantyl and butatriene cations, and the pyrazine molecule we

full detailed solution of the multi-level NLTE problem coupled to the solution

the micro physics description. We extend the use of a rate operator developed
to solve the coupled NLTE problem in spherically symmetric 1D systems. In order
to spread memory among processors we have implemented the NLTE/3D module with a
hierarchical domain decomposition method that distributes the NLTE levels,
radiative rates, and rate operator data over a group of processes so that each
process only holds the data for a fraction of the voxels. Each process in a
group holds all the relevant data to participate in the solution of the 3DRT
problem so that the 3DRT solution is parallelized within a domain decomposition
group. We solve a spherically symmetric system in 3D spherical coordinates in

astrophysical problems are solvable now, but they do require significant

from which one of two agents (the leader) can select a most preferred policy to
control a dynamic system that is also affected by the control decisions of the
other agent (the follower). The problem is described by an infinite horizon,
partially observed Markov game (POMG). At each decision epoch, each agent
knows: its past and present states, its past actions, and noise corrupted
observations of the other agent's past and present states. The actions of each
agent are determined at each decision epoch based on these data. The leader
considers multiple objectives in selecting its policy. The follower considers a
single objective in selecting its policy with complete knowledge of and in
response to the policy selected by the leader. This leader-follower assumption
allows the POMG to be transformed into a specially structured, partially
observed Markov decision process (POMDP). This POMDP is used to determine the
follower's best response policy. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is
used to create the next generation of leader policies based on the fitness
measures of each leader policy in the current generation. Computing a fitness
measure for a leader policy requires a value determination calculation, given
the leader policy and the follower's best response policy. The policies from
which the leader can select a most preferred policy are the non-dominated
policies of the final generation of leader policies created by the MOGA. An
example is presented that illustrates how these results can be used to support
a manager of a liquid egg production process (the leader) in selecting a
sequence of actions to best control this process over time, given that there is
an attacker (the follower) who seeks to contaminate the liquid egg production
process with a chemical or biological toxin.

warping is to change the spin texture which exists when a finite gap is
included by magnetic doping, although the in-plane spin component remains
locked perpendicular to momentum. It also changes the orbital magnetic moment,
the matrix element for optical absorption and the circular dichroism. We find
that the Fermi surface average of z-component of spin is closely related to the
value of the Berry phase. This holds even when the Hamiltonian includes a
subdominant non-relativistic quadratic in momentum term (which provides
particle-hole asymmetry) in addition to the dominant relativistic Dirac term.
There is also a qualitative correlation between $\left\langle S_z

occurs for certain subsequences or, in fact, in the limit. Here we prove that
divergence occurs in the limit.
  We consider three canonical reconstruction methods for functions in the
Paley-Wiener space $\mathcal{PW}^1_\pi$. For each of these we prove an instance
when the reconstruction diverges in the limit. This is a much stronger
statement than previous results that provide only $\limsup$ divergence. We also
address reconstruction for functions in the Hardy space $\mathcal{H}^1$ and
show that for any subsequence of the natural numbers there exists a function in
$\mathcal{H}^1$ for which reconstruction diverges in $\limsup$. For two of
these sampling series we show that when divergence occurs, the sampling series
has strong oscillations so that the maximum and the minimum tend to positive
and negative infinity. Our results are of interest in functional analysis
because they go beyond the type of result that can be obtained using the
Banach-Steinhaus Theorem. We discuss practical implications of this work; in
particular the work shows that methods using specially chosen subsequences of
reconstructions cannot yield convergence for the Paley-Wiener Space

net are, respectively, the sets of vertices and edges which remain unvisited by
the walk at a given step $t$.%These sets induce subgraphs of the underlying

walk at step $t$. Similarly, let $\widehat \Gamma(t)$ be the subgraph of $G$
induced by the edges of the vacant net. For random $r$-regular graphs $G_r$, it
was previously established that for a simple random walk, the graph $\Gamma(t)$
of the vacant set undergoes a phase transition in the sense of the phase
transition on Erd\H{os}-Renyi graphs $G_{n,p}$. Thus, for $r \ge 3$ there is an
explicit value $t^*=t^*(r)$ of the walk, such that for $t\leq (1-\epsilon)t^*$,
$\Gamma(t)$ has a unique giant component, plus components of size $O(\log n)$,
whereas for $t\geq (1+\epsilon)t^*$ all the components of $\Gamma(t)$ are of
size $O(\log n)$. We establish the threshold value $\widehat t$ for a phase
transition in the graph $\widehat \Gamma(t)$ of the vacant net of a simple
random walk on a random $r$-regular graph. We obtain the corresponding
threshold results for the vacant set and vacant net of two modified random
walks. These are a non-backtracking random walk, and, for $r$ even, a random
walk which chooses unvisited edges whenever available. This allows a direct
comparison of thresholds between simple and modified walks on random
$r$-regular graphs. The main findings are the following: As $r$ increases the
threshold for the vacant set converges to $n \log r$ in all three walks. For
the vacant net, the threshold converges to $rn/2 \; \log n$ for both the simple
random walk and non-backtracking random walk. When $r\ge 4$ is even, the
threshold for the vacant net of the unvisited edge process converges to $rn/2$,
which is also the vertex cover time of the process.

to observationally test these models by studying the environment of W43, a
molecular cloud complex near the tip of the Galactic long bar. Using
Galaxy-wide HI and 12CO surveys we searched for gas flowing toward the W43
molecular cloud complex. We also estimated the HI and H2 mass surface densities
to constrain the transition from atomic to molecular gas around and within W43.
We found 3 cloud ensembles within the position-velocity diagrams of 12CO and HI
gases. They are separated by 20km/s along the line of sight and extend into the
13CO velocity structure of W43. Since their velocity gradients are consistent
with free-fall, they could be nearby clouds attracted by, and streaming toward,
the W43 10^7Msun potential well. We show that the HI surface density,
Sigma_HI=45-85Msun/pc2, does not reach any threshold level but increases when
entering the 130pc-wide molecular complex previously defined. This suggests
that an equilibrium between H2 formation and photodissociation has not yet been
reached. The H2-to-HI ratio measured over the W43 region and its surroundings,
R_H2~3.5, is high, indicating that most of the gas is already in molecular form
in W43 and in structures several hundreds of parsecs downstream along the
Scutum-Centaurus arm. The W43 molecular cloud complex may have formed, and in
fact may still be accreting mass from the agglomeration of clouds. Already in
the molecular-dominated regime, most of these clouds are streaming from the
Scutum-Centaurus arm. This is in clear disagreement with quasi-static and
steady-state models of molecular cloud formation.

an equivalent role as the top graphene layer in the structure. Here we report
the electronic spectra of slightly twisted graphene bilayers studied by
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experiment demonstrates
that twist-induced van Hove singularities are ubiquitously present for rotation
angles theta less than about 3.5o, corresponding to moir\'e-pattern periods D
longer than 4 nm. However, they totally vanish for theta > 5.5o (D < 2.5 nm).
Such a behavior indicates that the continuum models, which capture

to investigate the convective core overshoot. It has been performed on some
binary stars to restrict the classical overshoot model which simply extends the
boundary of fully mixed region. However, the classical overshoot model is
physically unreasonable and inconsistent with the helioseismic investigation.
An updated model of the overshoot mixing was established recently. There is a
key parameter in the model. In this paper, we use the observations of four
eclipsing binary stars, i.e., HY Vir, YZ Cas, $\rm{\chi^2}$ Hya and VV Crv, to
investigate the suitable value for the parameter. It is found that the
suggested value by the calibrations on eclipsing binary stars is same as the
recommended value by other ways. And we have studied the effects of the updated
overshoot model on the stellar structure. The diffusion coefficient of the
convective/overshoot mixing is very high in the convection zone, then quickly
decreases near the convective boundary, and exponentially decreases in the
overshoot region. The low value of the diffusion coefficient in the overshoot
region leads to weak mixing and the partially mixed overshoot region. The
semi-convection, which appears in the standard stellar models of low-mass stars
with convective core, is removed by the partial overshoot mixing.

are developed. Besides dramatically reducing the storage complexity and running
time, the new algorithms are quite flexible and robust to noise because any
well-established LRA approaches can be applied. We also show how nonnegativity
incorporating sparsity substantially improves the uniqueness property and
partially alleviates the curse of dimensionality of the Tucker decompositions.

problem of nonparametrically estimating a copula density is addressed. Arguably
the most popular nonparametric density estimator, the kernel estimator is not
suitable for the unit-square-supported copula densities, mainly because it is
heavily affected by boundary bias issues. In addition, most common copulas
admit unbounded densities, and kernel methods are not consistent in that case.
In this paper, a kernel-type copula density estimator is proposed. It is based
on the idea of transforming the uniform marginals of the copula density into
normal distributions via the probit function, estimating the density in the
transformed domain, which can be accomplished without boundary problems, and
obtaining an estimate of the copula density through back-transformation.
Although natural, a raw application of this procedure was, however, seen not to
perform very well in the earlier literature. Here, it is shown that, if
combined with local likelihood density estimation methods, the idea yields very
good and easy to implement estimators, fixing boundary issues in a natural way
and able to cope with unbounded copula densities. The asymptotic properties of
the suggested estimators are derived, and a practical way of selecting the
crucially important smoothing parameters is devised. Finally, extensive
simulation studies and a real data analysis evidence their excellent
performance compared to their main competitors.

individual stars within these foreground galaxies, and (3) individual stars
within our own galaxy, which may act as lenses for microlensing events. We
found that intervening galaxies close to the line-of-sight are unlikely to lead
to significant excess $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. This opens up the prospect of
detecting lensed gamma-ray blazars at energies above 10 GeV with their
gamma-ray spectra effectively only affected by the EBL. The most luminous stars
located either in intervening galaxy or in our galaxy provides an environment
in which these gamma-rays could, in principle, be significantly absorbed.

gravitational potentials of such intervening stars to projected distances

negligible. Thus, neither of the intervening excess photon fields considered

(GB) modified Randall-Sundrum (RS) type II braneworld cosmology is
investigated. The existing study of symmetric dark matter in a GB braneworld
(Okada and Okada, 2009) found that the expansion rate was reduced compared to
that in standard General Relativity (GR), thereby delaying particle freeze-out
and resulting in relic abundances which are suppressed by up to
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. This is in direct contrast to the behaviour observed in
RS braneworlds where the expansion rate is enhanced and the final relic
abundance boosted. However, this finding that relic abundances are suppressed
in a GB braneworld is based upon a highly contrived situation in which the GB
era evolves directly into a standard GR era, rather than passing through a RS
era as is the general situation. This collapse of the RS era requires equating
the mass scale $m_{\alpha}$ of the GB modification and the mass scale
$m_{\sigma}$ of the brane tension. However, if the GB contribution is to be
considered as the lowest order correction from string theory to the RS action,
we would expect $m_{\alpha} > m_{\sigma}$. We investigate the effect upon the
relic abundance of choosing more realistic values for the ratio
$\mathcal{R}_{m} \equiv m_{\alpha}/m_{\sigma}$ and find that the relic
abundance can be either enhanced or suppressed by more than two orders of
magnitude. However, suppression only occurs for a small range of parameter
choices and, overwhelmingly, the predominant situation is that of enhancement
as we recover the usual Randall-Sundrum type behaviour in the limit
$\mathcal{R}_m \gg 1$. We use the latest observational bound $\Omega_{DM}h^2 =
0.1187 \pm 0.0017$ to constrain the various model parameters and briefly

between a verifier and a prover. However, in contrast to a conventional
wireless communication system, distance bounding systems introduce tight
requirements on the processing delay at the prover and require high distance
measurement precision making their practical realization challenging. Prior
proposals of distance bounding systems focused primarily on building provers
with minimal processing delays but did not consider the power limitations of
provers and verifiers. However, in a wide range of applications (e.g., physical
access control), provers are expected to be fully or semi-passive introducing
additional constraints on the design and implementation of distance bounding
systems.
  In this work, we propose a new physical layer scheme for distance bounding
and leverage this scheme to implement a distance bounding system with a
low-power prover. Our physical layer combines frequency modulated continuous
wave (FMCW) and backscatter communication. The use of backscatter communication
enables low power consumption at the prover which is critical for a number of
distance bounding applications. By using the FMCW-based physical layer, we
further decouple the physical distance estimation from the processing delay at
the prover, thereby enabling the realization of the majority of distance
bounding protocols developed in prior art. We evaluate our system under various
attack scenarios and show that it offers strong security guarantees against
distance, mafia and terrorist frauds. Additionally, we validate the
communication and distance measurement characteristics of our system through
simulations and experiments and show that it is well suited for short-range

distinguished from the usual theories where $\lambda$ is directly identified
with ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$ alone. Also in this mechanism, whether
$\lambda$ vanishes or not is basically determined by the tensor structure of
the scalar potential density, not by the zero or nonzero values of the scalar
potential itself. As a result of this application we find that the natural
scenario for the vanishing $\lambda$ of the present universe is to take one of
the AdS (rather than dS) vacua of KKLT as the background vacuum of our present
universe. This AdS vacuum scenario has more nice properties as compared with dS
vacua of the usual flux compctifications. The background vacuum is stable both
classically and quantum mechanically (no tunneling instabilities), and the
value $\lambda =0$ is also stable against quantum corrections because in this
scenario the perturbative corrections of ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar}$ and
quantum fluctuations $\delta_Q {\hat I}_{\rm brane}^{(NS)} + \delta_Q {\hat
I}_{\rm brane}^{(R)}$ on the branes are all gauged away by an automatic
cancelation between ${\mathcal V}_{\rm scalar} + \delta_Q {\hat I}_{\rm
brane}^{(NS)} + \delta_Q {\hat I}_{\rm brane}^{(R)}$ and ${\mathcal E}_{\rm
SB}$.

spin-polarization and magnetism. In this work, free-standing Fe atomic chains
were proposed to be used as the thinnest wires to generate spin-polarized
currents due to the spin-polarized energy bands. By ab initio calculations, the
zigzag structure was found more stable than the wide-angle zigzag structure and
has higher ratio of spin-up and spin-down currents. By our theoretical
prediction, Fe atomic chains have sufficiently long thermal lifetime only at
T<=150 K, while C atomic chains are very stable even at T=1000 K. This result
means that the spintronic devices based on Fe chains could only work at low
temperature. A system constructed by a short Fe chain sandwiched between two
graphene electrodes was proposed as a spin-polarized current generator, while a
C chain does not have such property. The present work may be instructive and
meaningful to further practical applications based on recent technical
development on the preparation of metal atomic chains [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

not be derived directly from spectroscopy because of the low luminosity of
these stars. Here we report on the first sensitive X-ray observations of two
sdB binaries with compact companions. CD -30 11223 is the sdB binary with the
shortest known orbital period (1.2 h) and its companion is certainly a white
dwarf. PG 1232-136 is an sdB binary considered the best candidate to host a
black hole companion. We observed these stars with XMM-Newton in August 2013

1232-136 is poorly constrained, owing to the unknown efficiency for black hole
accretion. On the other hand, in the case of CD -30 11223 we could derive,
under reasonable assumptions, an upper limit of about 3x10^-13 solar masses/yr

macroscopic system interacting with its environment, under the general
assumptions, i.e., without assuming any form of the interaction Hamiltonian.
The lowest order perturbation leads that the interaction energy shifts the
phase factors of the state vectors. For a macroscopic system, these factors are
the macroscopic quantities even for the very weak interaction. When we group
the state vector of the total system by the view point of environmental side,
the destructive interference occurs and the stationary phase approximation can
be adopted. Only the pointer states then survive and the decoherence also
occurs. The present approach is within the standard quantum mechanics as same

Results suggest that the long-term presence of terrestrial planets is
jeopardized due to gravitational interactions if giant planets are present. But
habitability of inner rocky planets may be supported in those planetary systems
hosting giant planets.
  Gravitational interactions within a complex multiple-body structure including
giant planets may supply terrestrial planets with materials which formed in the
colder region of the proto-planetary disk. During these processes, water, the
prime requisite for habitability, is delivered to the inner system. This may
occur either during the main accretion phase of terrestrial planets or via
impacts during a post-accretion bombardment. Results for both processes are
summarized and discussed with reference to the lunar crater record.
  Starting from a scenario involving migration of the giant planets this
contribution discusses the delivery of water to Earth, the modification of
atmospheres by impacts in a planetary system context and the likelihood of the
existence of extrasolar Earth-like habitable worlds.

the type of DPT can be determined by the key characteristic of whether the

These distributions are a generalization of commonly studied Gaussian

includes also heavy-tailed behavior with a divergent second moment. These types
of distributions give rise to novel effects, such as exchange broadening of the
absorption spectra and anomalous localization of the excitonic states, which
has been found in various excitonic systems. We provide a thorough examination
of the localization behavior and the absorption spectra of excitons in chains
with L\'evy $\alpha$-stable diagonal disorder. Several regimes are considered
in detail: (i) weak disorder and small systems, where finite size effects
become significant; (ii) intermediate disorder and/or larger systems for which
exciton states around the exciton band edge spread over a number of monomers,
and (iii) strong disorder where the exciton wave functions resemble the
individual molecular states. We propose analytical approaches to describe the
disorder scaling of relevant quantities for these three regimes of
localization, which match excellently with numerical results. We also show the
appearance of short localization segments caused by outliers (monomers having
transition energies larger than the exciton band width). Such states give rise
to an additional structure in the absorption spectrum, density of states, and

illumination, it is clear that the exomoon habitable zone (EHZ) - the set of
moon and host planet orbits that permit liquid water on an Earthlike moon's
surface - is a manifold of higher dimension than the planetary HZ.
  This paper outlines the first attempt to produce climate models of exomoons
which possess all the above sources and sinks of energy. We expand on our
previous 1D latitudinal energy balance models (LEBMs), which follow the
evolution of the temperature on an Earthlike moon orbiting a Jupiterlike
planet, by adding planetary illumination.
  We investigate the EHZ in four dimensions, running two separate suites of
simulations. The first investigates the EHZ by varying the planet's orbit,
keeping the moon's orbit fixed, to compare the EHZ with planetary habitable
zones. In general, planetary illumination pushes EHZs slightly further away
from the star.
  Secondly, we fix the planet's orbit and vary the moon's orbit, to investigate
the circumplanetary inner habitable edge. We demonstrate that an outer edge can
exist due to eclipses (rather than merely orbital stability), but this edge may
be pushed outwards when the effect of the carbonate-silicate cycle is taken
into account.

collaborating nanomachines. This work investigates the channel transfer
function for molecular communication via diffusion. In nature,
information-carrying molecules are generally absorbed by the target node via
receptors. Using the concentration function, without considering the absorption
process, as the channel transfer function implicitly assumes that the receiver
node does not affect the system. In this letter, we propose a solid analytical
formulation and analyze the signal metrics (attenuation and propagation delay)
for molecular communication via diffusion channel with an absorbing receiver in
a 3-D environment. The proposed model and the formulation match well with the
simulations without any normalization.

occurs due to the change in the density of states at a critical Raman coupling
where the degeneracy of the ground states is lifted. Relative drop in the
critical temperature depends on the diluteness of the gas as well as on the
spin-orbit coupling strength. In the presence of a harmonic trap, the cusp in

  The Tree Search Problem with Non-Uniform Cost is: given a tree $T$ where each
edge has an associated cost, construct a strategy that minimizes the total cost
of the identification in the worst case.
  Finding the strategy guaranteeing the minimum possible cost is an NP-complete
problem already for input tree of degree 3 or diameter 6. The best known

a common way to obtain a linear representation of $k$-truncation of linear
matroids, which has many algorithmic applications. A common way to compute a
rank $k$-truncation of a $n \times m$ matrix is to multiply the matrix with a
random $k\times n$ matrix (with the entries from a field of an appropriate
size), yielding a simple randomized algorithm. So a natural question is whether
it possible to obtain a rank $k$-truncations of a matrix, {\em
deterministically}. In this paper we settle this question for matrices over any
finite field or the field of rationals ($\mathbb Q$). We show that given a
matrix $M$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ we can compute a $k$-truncation $M_k$ over
the ring $\mathbb{F}[X]$ in deterministic polynomial time.

to the five-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to a single scalar, the
dilaton. The asymptotic solutions of the system for a general dilaton potential
are employed to study the power contributions of various quantities. If the
dilaton is dual to the dimension-4 operator ${\rm Tr} F_{\mu\nu}^2$, no power
corrections would be generated. Then the thermal quantities approach their
asymptotic values much more quickly than those observed in lattice simulation.
When the dimension of the dual operator is different from 4, various power
terms are generated. The lowest power contributions to the thermal quantities
are always quadratic in the dilaton, while that of the Polyakov loop is linear.
As a result, the quadratic terms in inverse temperature for both the trace
anomaly and the Polyakov loop, observed in lattice simulation, cannot be
implemented consistently in the system. This is in accordance with the field
theory expectation, where no gauge-invariant operator can accommodate such
contributions. Two simple models, where the dilaton is dual to operators with
different dimensions, are studied in detail to clarify the conclusion.

find that the Tc slope significantly correlates (at more than 4sigma) with the
stellar age and the stellar surface gravity. We also find tentative evidence
that the Tc slope correlates with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars
(Rmean), suggesting that those stars that originated in the inner Galaxy have
fewer refractory elements relative to the volatiles. While the average Tc slope
for planet-hosting solar analogs is steeper than that of their counterparts
without planets, this difference probably reflects the difference in their age

parameter needed for convergence of IPH leads to slow convergence of the
classical additive Schwarz method, and propose a modified solver which leads to
much faster convergence. Our analysis is entirely at the discrete level, and
thus holds for arbitrary interfaces between two subdomains. We then generalize
the method to the case of many subdomains, including cross points, and obtain a
new class of preconditioners for Krylov subspace methods which exhibit better
convergence properties than the classical additive Schwarz preconditioner. We
illustrate our results with numerical experiments.

half a million objects including ellipticals and bulges. The angular size of

particular First Fit and Best Fit had optimal average-case ratio of 1 but a
worst-case competitive ratio of 1.7. The wasted space of First Fit and Best Fit
for a uniform random sequence of length $n$ is expected to be $\Theta(n^{2/3})$

be improved to 1.691 using the Harmonic algorithm; further variations of this
algorithm can push down the competitive ratio to 1.588. However, Harmonic and
its variations have poor performance on average; in particular, Harmonic has
average-case ratio of around 1.27. In this paper, first we introduce a simple
algorithm which we term Harmonic Match. This algorithm performs as well as Best
Fit on average, i.e., it has an average-case ratio of 1 and expected wasted

the algorithm is as good as Harmonic, i.e., it converges to $ 1.691$ which is
an improvement over 1.7 of Best Fit and First Fit. We also introduce a
different algorithm, termed as Refined Harmonic Match, which achieves an
improved competitive ratio of $1.636$ while maintaining the good average-case
performance of Harmonic Match and Best Fit. Finally, our extensive experimental
evaluation of the studied bin packing algorithms shows that our proposed
algorithms have comparable average-case performance with Best Fit and First

to control and understand the spreading capabilities of the system as well as
to ensure an efficient information diffusion such as in rumor-like dynamics.
Recent works have suggested that the identification of influential spreaders is
not independent of the dynamics being studied. For instance, the key disease
spreaders might not necessarily be so when it comes to analyze social contagion
or rumor propagation. Additionally, it has been shown that different metrics
(degree, coreness, etc) might identify different influential nodes even for the
same dynamical processes with diverse degree of accuracy. In this paper, we
investigate how nine centrality measures correlate with the disease and rumor
spreading capabilities of the nodes that made up different synthetic and
real-world (both spatial and non-spatial) networks. We also propose a
generalization of the random walk accessibility as a new centrality measure and
derive analytical expressions for the latter measure for simple network
configurations. Our results show that for non-spatial networks, the $k$-core
and degree centralities are most correlated to epidemic spreading, whereas the
average neighborhood degree, the closeness centrality and accessibility are
most related to rumor dynamics. On the contrary, for spatial networks, the
accessibility measure outperforms the rest of centrality metrics in almost all
cases regardless of the kind of dynamics considered. Therefore, an important
consequence of our analysis is that previous studies performed in synthetic
random networks cannot be generalized to the case of spatial networks.

scattering) data on $F_2^{\gamma p}$ at small values of Bjorken $x$, including
the data at {\em very low} $Q^2$, using a new model for $F_2^{\gamma p}$ which
both includes an asymptotic (high energy) part that satisfies a saturated
Froissart bound behavior, with a vector-dominance like mass factor in the
parameterization, and extends smoothly to $Q^2=0$. We require that the
corresponding part of the virtual $\gamma^* p$ cross section match the known
asymptotic part of the real $\gamma p$ cross section at $Q^2=0$, a cross
section which is determined by strong interactions and asymptotically satisfies
a saturated Froissart bound of the form $\alpha +\beta\ln s+\gamma\ln^2s$.
Using this model for the asymptotic part of $F_2^{\gamma p}$ plus a known
valence contribution, we fit the asymptotic high energy part of the HERA data
with $x\le 0.1$ and $W\ge 25$ GeV; the fit is excellent. We find that the mass
parameter in the fit lies in the region of the light vector mesons, somewhat
above the $\rho$ meson mass, and is compatible with vector dominance. We use
this fit to obtain accurate results for the high energy $ep$ and isoscalar $\nu
N$ total cross sections. Both cross sections obey an analytic expression of the
type $a +b \ln E +c \ln^2 E +d \ln^3 E$ at large energies $E$ of the incident
particle, reflecting the fact that the underlying strong interaction parts of
the $\gamma^*p$, $Z^*N$ and $W^*N$ cross sections satisfy the saturated
Froissart bound. Since approximately 50% of the $\nu N$ center of mass (cms)
energy is found in $W$---the cms energy of the strongly interacting
intermediate vector boson-nucleon system---a study of ultra-high-energy
neutrino-nucleon cross sections would allow us, for the first time, to explore

effectiveness has been shown to outperform conventional targeted ads.
Retargeting ads are not only based on users' interests, but also on their
intents, i.e. commercial products users have shown interest in. Existing
retargeting systems heavily rely on tracking, as retargeting companies need to
know not only the websites a user has visited but also the exact products on
these sites. They are therefore very intrusive, and privacy threatening.
Furthermore, these schemes are still sub-optimal since tracking is partial, and
they often deliver ads that are obsolete (because, for example, the targeted
user has already bought the advertised product).
  This paper presents the first privacy-preserving retargeting ads system. In
the proposed scheme, the retargeting algorithm is distributed between the user
and the advertiser such that no systematic tracking is necessary, more control
and transparency is provided to users, but still a lot of targeting flexibility
is provided to advertisers. We show that our scheme, that relies on homomorphic
encryption, can be efficiently implemented and trivially solves many problems

Background Independence, necessitating in particular an ab initio derivation of
the arena all non-gravitational physics takes place in, namely spacetime. Using
the background field technique, this requirement translates into the condition
of an unbroken split-symmetry connecting the (quantized) metric fluctuations to
the (classical) background metric. If the regularization scheme used violates
split-symmetry during the quantization process it is mandatory to restore it in
the end at the level of observable physics. In this paper we present a detailed
investigation of split-symmetry breaking and restoration within the Effective
Average Action (EAA) approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with a special
emphasis on the Asymptotic Safety conjecture. In particular we demonstrate for
the first time in a non-trivial setting that the two key requirements of
Background Independence and Asymptotic Safety can be satisfied simultaneously.
Carefully disentangling fluctuation and background fields, we employ a
`bi-metric' ansatz for the EAA and project the flow generated by its functional
renormalization group equation on a truncated theory space spanned by two
separate Einstein-Hilbert actions for the dynamical and the background metric,
respectively. A new powerful method is used to derive the corresponding

  Latex 45 pages",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large scale organization in ensembles of events of atmospheric convection can
be generated by the combined effect of forcing and of the interaction between
the raising plumes and the environment. Here the ""large scale"" refers to the
space extension that is larger or comparable with the basic resolved cell of a
numerical weather prediction system. Under the action of external forcing like
heating individual events of convection respond to the slow accumulation of
vapor by a threshold-type dynamics. This is due to the a time-scale separation,
between the slow drive and the fast convective response, expressed as the
""quasi-equilibrium"". When there is interaction between the convection plumes,
the effect is a correlated response. We show that the correlated response have
many of the characteristics of the self-organized criticality (SOC). It is
suggested that from the SOC perspective, a description of the specific dynamics
induced by ""quasi-equilibrium"" can be provided by models of ""punctuated
equilibrium"". Indeed the Bak-Sneppen model is able to reproduce (within
reasonable approximation) two of the statistical results that have been
obtained in observations on the organized convection.
  We also give detailed derivation of the equations connecting the
probabilities of the states in the update sequence of the Bak-Sneppen model
with $K=2$ random neighbors. This analytical framework allows the derivation of
scaling laws for the size of avalanches, a result that gives support to the SOC
interpretation of the observational data.

shearlet transforms applied for orientation sensitive image analysis and
restoration. The square integrable representations of the shearlet groups
provide not only the basis for the shearlet transforms but also for a very
natural definition of scales of smoothness spaces, called shearlet coorbit
spaces. The aim of this paper is twofold: first we discover isomorphisms
between shearlet groups and other well-known groups, namely extended Heisenberg
groups and subgroups of the symplectic group. Interestingly, the connected
shearlet group with positive dilations has an isomorphic copy in the symplectic
group, while this is not true for the full shearlet group with all nonzero
dilations. Indeed we prove the general result that there exist, up to adjoint
action of the symplectic group, only one embedding of the extended Heisenberg
algebra into the Lie algebra of the symplectic group.
  Having understood the various group isomorphisms it is natural to ask for the
relations between coorbit spaces of isomorphic groups with equivalent
representations. These connections are examined in the second part of the
paper. We describe how isomorphic groups with equivalent representations lead
to isomorphic coorbit spaces. In particular we apply this result to square
integrable representations of the connected shearlet groups and metaplectic
representations of subgroups of the symplectic group. This implies the
definition of metaplectic coorbit spaces.
  Besides the usual full and connected shearlet groups we also deal with
Toeplitz shearlet groups.

deterministically jobs to a set of non-observable queues working in parallel.
In this setting, the fundamental problem is which policy should the dispatcher
implement to minimize the stationary mean waiting time of the incoming jobs. We
present a structural property that holds in the classic scaling of the system
where the network demand (arrival rate of jobs) grows proportionally with the
number of queues. Assuming that each queue of type $r$ is replicated $k$ times,
we consider a set of policies that are periodic with period $k \sum_r p_r$ and
such that exactly $p_r$ jobs are sent in a period to each queue of type $r$.
When $k\to\infty$, our main result shows that all the policies in this set are
equivalent, in the sense that they yield the same mean stationary waiting time,
and optimal, in the sense that no other policy having the same aggregate
arrival rate to \emph{all} queues of a given type can do better in minimizing
the stationary mean waiting time. This property holds in a strong probabilistic
sense. Furthermore, the limiting mean waiting time achieved by our policies is
a convex function of the arrival rate in each queue, which facilitates the
development of a further optimization aimed at solving the fundamental problem
above for large systems.

reproducibility in a species. In the present work we analyze the robustness of
the patterning for the ocellar complex formation in Drosophila melanogaster
fly. We have systematically pruned the GRN that drives the development of this
visual system to obtain the minimum pathway able to satisfy this pattern. We
found that the mechanism underlying the patterning obeys to the dynamics of a
3-nodes network motif with a double negative feedback loop fed by a
morphogenetic gradient that triggers the inhibition in a French flag problem
fashion. A Boolean modeling of the GRN confirms robustness in the patterning
mechanism showing the same result for different network complexity levels.
Interestingly, the network provides a steady state solution in the interocellar
part of the patterning and an oscillatory regime in the ocelli. This
theoretical result predicts that the ocellar pattern may underlie oscillatory
dynamics in its genetic regulation.

the fact that we are primarily interested in energy eigenstates and not

folded strings on $S^5$ and for two-particle states. Our prescription for
two-particle states with the dilaton leads to a volume dependence which matches
exactly to the structure of finite volume diagonal formfactors. As the volume

superfluid turbulence, a phenomenon recently also reported in trapped atomic

dependence of vortex motion on temperature in such systems, vortex
reconnections are actually temperature independent on the typical length/time

Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the condensate, coupled to a semiclassical
Boltzmann equation for the thermal cloud (the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin

further show reconnections to be insensitive to the inhomogeneity in the
background density.

quantum dense coding protocol than states with low entanglement. Such a
correspondence, however, does not exist even for pure quantum states in the
multipartite domain. We establish a connection between the multiparty capacity
of classical information transmission in quantum dense coding and several
multipartite quantum correlation measures of the shared state, used in the
dense coding protocol. In particular, we show that for the noiseless channel,
if multipartite quantum correlations of an arbitrary multipartite state of
arbitrary number of qubits is the same as that of the corresponding generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, then the multipartite dense coding
capability of former is the same or better than that of the generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Interestingly, in a noisy channel scenario,
where we consider both uncorrelated and correlated noise models, the relative
abilities of the quantum channels to transfer classical information can get
inverted by administering a sufficient amount of noise. When the shared state
is an arbitrary multipartite mixed state, we also establish a link between the
classical capacity for the noiseless case and multipartite quantum correlation
measures.

  Twenty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014)",,,,"cs.GT cs.CC cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scoring systems are an extremely important class of election systems. A
length-$m$ (so-called) scoring vector applies only to $m$-candidate elections.
To handle general elections, one must use a family of vectors, one per length.
The most elegant approach to making sure such families are ""family-like"" is the
recently introduced notion of (polynomial-time uniform) pure scoring rules
[Betzler and Dorn 2010], where each scoring vector is obtained from its
precursor by adding one new coefficient. We obtain the first dichotomy theorem
for pure scoring rules for a control problem. In particular, for constructive
control by adding voters (CCAV), we show that CCAV is solvable in polynomial
time for $k$-approval with $k \leq 3$, $k$-veto with $k \leq 2$, every pure
scoring rule in which only the two top-rated candidates gain nonzero scores,
and a particular rule that is a ""hybrid"" of 1-approval and 1-veto. For all
other pure scoring rules, CCAV is NP-complete. We also investigate the
descriptive richness of different models for defining pure scoring rules,
proving how more rule-generation time gives more rules, proving that rationals
give more rules than do the natural numbers, and proving that some restrictions
previously thought to be ""w.l.o.g."" in fact do lose generality.

  pages",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this Ph.D thesis three main projects are presented. In the first one the
phenomenology associated with the neutralinos and charginos sector of the
left-right symmetric supersymmetric model is explored. After a detailed
motivation of the study and construction of such models, it is shown that these
models can be easily discovered in multi-leptonic final states as they lead to
signatures very different from those induced by the Standard Model or its
supersymmetric version. In the second project, we concentrate on the
phenomenology associated with doubly-charged particles. Starting from the
hypothesis that such a particle is discovered at the LHC, we build several
effective field theories depending on both the representation under SU(2)_L to
which they belong the particle and their spin and perform a Monte Carlo
analysis highlighting some key observables that would help to determine their
quantum numbers. Another part of my thesis, complementary to the phenomenology
work, has consisted in developping computer programs that might be helpful for
phenomenological studies. Working in the framework of the Mathematica package
FeynRules, I took part in the development of a routine able to extract
automatically the analytical expressions of the renormalization group equations
at the two-loop level for any renormalizable supersymmetric model. I have also
been involved in the development of another module of FeynRules able to extract
automatically the analytical expressions for the mass matrices associated to
any model implemented in FeynRules and to export these equations in the form of
a C++ source code able to diagonalize the matrices and store the mixing
matrices as well as the spectrum in an SLHA-compliant file.

three reliable entities : (i) influence of a potential vector on the de Broglie
wavelength (ii) a G.P. Thomson-like experimental arrangement and (iii) a
special coil designed to create a homogeneous vector potential. The alluded
property is not connected with magnetic fluxes surrounded by the vector
potential field lines, but it depends on the fluxes which are outside of the
respective lines. Also the same property shows that in the tested case the
vector potential field is uniquely defined physical quantity, free of any
adjusting gauge. So the phenomenology of the suggested quantum test differs on
that of macroscopic theory where the vector potential is not uniquely defined
and allows a gauge adjustment. Of course that the proposed test has to be
subjected to adequate experimental validation.
