an image cipher based on transformed logistic maps and proves that the image
cipher can be deciphered efficiently under two different conditions: 1) two
pairs of known plain-images and the corresponding cipher-images with
computational complexity of $O(2^{18}+L)$; 2) two pairs of chosen plain-images
and the corresponding cipher-images with computational complexity of $O(L)$,
where $L$ is the number of pixels in the plain-image. In contrast, the required
condition in the previous deciphering method is eighty-seven pairs of chosen
plain-images and the corresponding cipher-images with computational complexity
of $O(2^{7}+L)$. In addition, three other security flaws existing in most
Logistic-map-based ciphers are also reported.

problem of minimizing the delay of instantly decodable network coding (IDNC)
for cooperative data exchange (CDE) in decentralized wireless network. In this
configuration, clients cooperate with each other to recover the erased packets
without a central controller. Game theory is employed herein as a tool for
improving the distributed solution by overcoming the need for a central
controller or additional signaling in the system. We model the session by
self-interested players in a non-cooperative potential game. The utility
functions are designed such that increasing individual payoff results in a
collective behavior achieving both a desirable system performance in a shared
network environment and the Nash bargaining solution. Three games are
developed: the first aims to reduce the completion time, the second to reduce
the maximum decoding delay and the third the sum decoding delay. We improve
these formulations to include punishment policy upon collision occurrence and
achieve the Nash bargaining solution. Through extensive simulations, our
framework is tested against the best performance that could be found in the
conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) recovery process in numerous cases:
first we simulate the problem with complete information. We, then, simulate
with incomplete information and finally we test it in lossy feedback scenario.
Numerical results show that our formulation with complete information largely
outperforms the conventional PMP scheme in most situations and achieves a lower
delay. They also show that the completion time formulation with incomplete
information also outperforms the conventional PMP.

removing components. Consequently, lower complexity reduction schemes can be
used with the proposed filter without losing estimation accuracy and precision.

consisting in the fact that the standard statistics of the large-scale

beyond $\Lambda $CDM when multiple extensions of the standard scenario coexist
in nature. In particular, it was shown that the characteristic features of an
$f(R)$ Modified Gravity theory and of massive neutrinos with an appreciable
total mass $\Sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ are suppressed in most of the basic
large-scale structure observables for a specific combination of the main
parameters of the two non-standard models. In the present work, we explore the
possibility that the mean specific size of the supercluster spines -- which was
recently proposed as a non-standard statistics by Shim and Lee to probe gravity
at large scales -- can help to break this cosmic degeneracy. By analyzing the
halo samples from N-body simulations featuring various combinations of $f(R)$
and $\Sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ we find that -- at the present epoch -- the value
of $\Sigma _{i}m_{\nu _{i}}$ required to maximally suppress the effects of
$f(R)$ gravity on the specific sizes of the superclusters spines is different
from that found for the other standard statistics. Furthermore, it is also
shown that at higher redshifts ($z\ge 0.3$) the deviations of the mean specific
sizes of the supercluster spines for all of the four considered combinations
from its value for the standard $\Lambda$CDM case are statistically
significant.

counterparts at a high significance level. The X-ray luminosities of these
source are $\sim 10^{38}$ $\rm ergs~s^{-1}$ and are also variable on similar
time-scales. The optical variability implies that the optical emission is
associated with the X-ray source itself rather than being the integrated light
from a host globular cluster. For one source the change in optical magnitude is
$> 0.3$, which is one of the highest reported for this class of X-ray sources

infinite dimensional (but locally compact) space Omega. It arises in
representation theory as the space of indecomposable characters of the
infinite-dimensional unitary group U(infinity).
  Alternatively, Omega can be defined in combinatorial terms as the boundary of
the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph --- an infinite graded graph that encodes the
classical branching rule for characters of the compact unitary groups U(N).
  We also discuss two other topics concerning the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph:
  (1) Computation of the number of trapezoidal Gelfand-Tsetlin schemes (one
could also say, the number of integral points in a truncated Gelfand-Tsetlin

useful for quantum computation. The RG allows to obtain the phase diagram of

outreach and accessibility, but they require instructors to come up with
scalable alternates to traditional student evaluation. Peer grading -- having
students assess each other -- is a promising approach to tackling the problem
of evaluation at scale, since the number of ""graders"" naturally scales with the
number of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means
that one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional
settings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide
and more reliable than cardinal feedback, it is therefore desirable to allow
peer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. ""project X is better than project
Y"") and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. ""project X is a
B-""). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring
student grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that
require cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem
as a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models
under which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the
applicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real
class -- with instructor and TA grades as a baseline -- and demonstrate the
efficacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer
grading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to
traditional evaluation techniques.

part of the paper we discuss the case where the tensor modes of the geometry
are absent and we argue that the B mode recently detected by the Bicep2
collaboration cannot be explained by a large-scale magnetic field rotating,
through the Faraday effect, the well established E mode polarization. In this
case, the observed temperature autocorrelations would be excessively distorted
by the magnetic field. In the second part of the paper the formation of Faraday
rotation is treated as a stationary, random and Markovian process with the aim
of generalizing a set of scaling laws originally derived in the absence of the
tensor modes of the geometry. We show that the scalar, vector and tensor modes
of the brightness perturbations can all be Faraday rotated even if the vector
and tensor parts of the effect have been neglected, so far, by focussing the
attention on the scalar aspects of the problem. The mixing between the power
spectra of the E mode and B mode polarizations involves a unitary
transformation depending nonlinearly on the Faraday rotation rate. The present
approach is suitable for a general scrutiny of the polarization observables and
of their frequency dependence.

have profound effects on the magnetization induced by orbital motion of
electrons. Here we derive a formula for the orbital magnetization of
interacting electrons in terms of the full Green's function and vertex
functions. The formula is applied within dynamical mean-field theory to the
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model that allows both topological and trivial insulating
phases. We study the insulating and metallic phases in the presence of an
exchange magnetic field. In the presence of interactions, the orbital
magnetization of the quantum spin Hall insulating phase with inversion symmetry
is renormalized by the bulk quasi-particle weight. The orbital magnetization
vanishes for the in-plane antiferromagnetic phase with trivial topology. In the
metallic phase, the enhanced effective spin-orbit coupling due to the
interaction sometimes leads to an enhancement of the orbital magnetization.
However, at low doping, magnetization is suppressed at large interaction
strengths.

One of the right-handed neutrinos ($N_1$), being lightest among them, is a

imposed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on this model. The second lightest right-handed
neutrino ($N_2$) is assumed to be nearly degenerated with the lightest one
enhancing the co-annihilation between them. The effective interaction term
among the lightest, second lightest right-handed neutrinos and photon

This radiative decay of heavier right-handed neutrino %to the the lightest one

Instantly Decodable Network Coding (IDNC) were considered separately and were
thought to completely act against each other. Recently, some works aimed to
balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics but none of them
studied a further optimization of one by controlling the other. In this paper,
we study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion
time below its currently best known solution in persistent erasure channels. We
first derive the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall
completion times. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall
completion time is NP-hard, we design two novel heuristics that minimizes the
probability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent
completion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control
of their decoding delays. We, then, extend our study to the limited feedback
scenario. Simulation results show that our new algorithms achieves both a lower
mean completion time and mean decoding delay compared to the best known
heuristic for completion time reduction. The gap in performance becomes
significant for harsh erasure scenarios.

uncertainties inherent in predictions of future weather states. However, biases
and dispersion errors often present in forecast ensembles require statistical
post-processing. Univariate post-processing models such as Bayesian model
averaging (BMA) have been successfully applied for various weather quantities.
Nonetheless, BMA and many other standard post-processing procedures are
designed for a single weather variable, thus ignoring possible dependencies
among weather quantities. In line with recently upcoming research to develop
multivariate post-processing procedures, e.g., BMA for bivariate wind vectors,
or flexible procedures applicable for multiple weather quantities of different
types, a bivariate BMA model for joint calibration of wind speed and
temperature forecasts is proposed based on the bivariate truncated normal
distribution. It extends the univariate truncated normal BMA model designed for
post-processing ensemble forecast of wind speed by adding a normally
distributed temperature component with a covariance structure representing the
dependency among the two weather quantities.
  The method is applied to wind speed and temperature forecasts of the
eight-member University of Washington mesoscale ensemble and of the
eleven-member ALADIN-HUNEPS ensemble of the Hungarian Meteorological Service
and its predictive performance is compared to that of the general Gaussian
copula method. The results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and
accuracy of point forecasts in comparison to the raw ensemble and the overall
performance of this model is able to keep up with that of the Gaussian copula
method.

each hypothetical system, we calculate the outer edge of habitability for two

eccentricity and obliquity fixed at their average values. We recover previous
results that higher values of fixed obliquity and eccentricity expand the

measurable properties. Assessing the effect that such constraints impose on
their observables is thus a crucial aspect to be taken into account in their
analysis. To this end,we examine the effect of fixing the strength sequence in
multi-edge networks on several network observables such as degrees, disparity,
average neighbor properties and weight distribution using an ensemble approach.
We provide a general method to calculate any desired weighted network metric
and we show that several features detected in real data could be explained
solely by structural constraints. We thus justify the need of analytical null
models to be used as basis to assess the relevance of features found in real
data represented in weighted network form.

relax to the Standard Model vacuum well before the electroweak scale. We find
that this is consistent with the high inflationary scale only if the top mass
$m_t$ is significantly below the best fit value. The region within $2\sigma$
errors of the measured $m_t$, the Higgs mass $m_h$ and the strong coupling
$\alpha_s$ and consistent with inflation covers approximately the interval $m_t

magnetic fields both inside and outside the Milky Way. Building on our earlier
estimate of the Galactic contribution, we set out to estimate the extragalactic

that taking the difference between the observed values and the Galactic
foreground reconstruction is not a good estimate for the extragalactic
contributions. We point out a degeneracy between the contributions to the
observed values due to extragalactic magnetic fields and observational noise
and comment on the dangers of over-interpreting an estimate without taking into
account its uncertainty information. To overcome these difficulties, we develop
an extended reconstruction algorithm based on the assumption that the
observational uncertainties are accurately described for a subset of the data,
which can overcome the degeneracy with the extragalactic contributions. We
present a probabilistic derivation of the algorithm and demonstrate its
performance using a simulation, yielding a high quality reconstruction of the
Galactic Faraday rotation foreground, a precise estimate of the typical
extragalactic contribution, and a well-defined probabilistic description of the
extragalactic contribution for each data point. We then apply this
reconstruction technique to a catalog of Faraday rotation observations. We vary
our assumptions about the data, showing that the dispersion of extragalactic
contributions to observed Faraday depths is most likely lower than 7 rad/m^2,
in agreement with earlier results, and that the extragalactic contribution to
an individual data point is poorly constrained by the data in most cases.

holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most important motivating
forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we consider the notion of status
from the perspective of a position or title held by a person in an enterprise.
We study the intersection of social status and social networks in an
enterprise. We study whether enterprise communication logs can help reveal how
social interactions and individual status manifest themselves in social
networks. To that end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication
channels --- voice call, short message, and email --- to demonstrate the
social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status. We have
several interesting findings and based on these findings we also develop a
model to predict social status. On the individual level, high-status
individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural holes by linking to
people in parts of the enterprise networks that are otherwise not well
connected to one another. On the community level, the principle of homophily,
social balance and clique theory generally indicate a ""rich club"" maintained by
high-status individuals, in the sense that this community is much more
connected, balanced and dense. Our model can predict social status of
individuals with 93% accuracy.

+\delta_{\partial\Omega}\otimes V$ and $-\Delta+\delta_{\partial\Omega}'\otimes
V\partial_\nu$ where $\Omega$ is strictly convex with smooth boundary,
$V:L^2(\partial\Omega)\to L^2(\partial\Omega)$ may depend on frequency, and
$\delta_{\partial\Omega}$ is the surface measure on $\partial\Omega$. These
operators are model Hamiltonians for quantum corrals and leaky quantum graphs.
We give a quantum version of the Sabine Law from the study of acoustics for
both the $\delta$ and $\delta'$ interactions. It characterizes the decay rates
(imaginary parts of resonances) in terms of the system's ray dynamics. In
particular, the decay rates are controlled by the average reflectivity and
chord length of the barrier.
  For the $\delta$ interaction we show that generically there are infinitely
many resonances arbitrarily close to the resonance free region found by our
theorem. In the case of the $\delta'$ interaction, the quantum Sabine law gives
the existence of a resonance free region that converges to the real axis at a
fixed polynomial rate and is optimal in the case of the unit disk in the plane.
As far as the author is aware, this is the only class of examples that is known
to have resonances converging to the real axis at a fixed polynomial rate but
no faster.
  The proof of our theorem requires several new technical tools. We adapt
intersecting Lagrangian distributions to the semiclassical setting and give a
description of the kernel of the free resolvent as such a distribution. We also
construct a semiclassical version of the Melrose--Taylor parametrix for complex
energies. We use these constructions to give a complete microlocal description
of boundary layer operators and to prove sharp high energy estimates on the
boundary layer operators in the case that $\partial\Omega$ is smooth and
strictly convex.

spontaneously-broken supergravity with conventional moduli stabilization by
fluxes and non-perturbative effects. The main ingredient is a shift-symmetric
Kahler potential, supplemented by flux-induced shift symmetry breaking in the
superpotential. The central technical observation is that all these features
are present for D7-brane position moduli in Type IIB orientifolds, allowing for
a realization of the axion monodromy proposal in a controlled string theory
compactification. On the one hand, in the large complex structure regime the
D7-brane position moduli inherit a shift symmetry from their mirror-dual Type
IIA Wilson lines. On the other hand, the Type IIB flux superpotential
generically breaks this shift symmetry and allows, by appealing to the large
flux discretuum, to tune the relevant coefficients to be small. The
shift-symmetric direction in D7-brane moduli space can then play the role of
the inflaton: While the D7-brane circles a certain trajectory on the Calabi-Yau
many times, the corresponding F-term energy density grows only very slowly,
thanks to the above-mentioned tuning of the flux. Thus, the large-field
inflationary trajectory can be realized in a regime where Kahler, complex
structure and other brane moduli are stabilized in a conventional manner, as we
demonstrate using the example of the Large Volume Scenario.

years. Recent studies of the excess in data from the Fermi telescope have cast
doubt on an explanation for the excess arising from unknown astrophysical
sources. A potential source of the excess is the annihilation of dark matter
into standard model final states, giving rise to gamma ray production. The
spectrum of the excess is well fit by 30 GeV dark matter annihilating into a
pair of b quarks with a cross section of the same order of magnitude as
expected for a thermal relic. Simple models that can lead to this annihilation
channel for dark matter are in strong tension with null results from direct
detection experiments. We construct a renormalizable model where dark
matter-standard model interactions are mediated by a pseudoscalar that mixes
with the CP-odd component of a pair of Higgs doublets, allowing for the gamma
ray excess to be explained while suppressing the direct detection signal. We
consider implications for this scenario from Higgs decays, rare B meson decays
and monojet searches and also comment on some difficulties that any dark matter
model explaining the gamma ray excess via direct annihilation into quarks will
encounter.

review of the current status of this field are first given, with a particular
emphasis on universal subleading terms characterizing different quantum phases
of matter, and associated transitions. We highlight the connection with the
related entanglement entropies and spectra when this is possible.
  In a second part, new results are presented for the participation spectra of
interacting spin models, mostly based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations, but
also using perturbation theory in some cases. For full antiferromagnetic
systems, participation spectra are analyzed in terms of ferromagnetic domain
walls which experience a repulsive pairwise interaction. This confinement
potential is either linear for long-range N\'eel order, or logarithmic for
quasi-long-range order. The case of subsystems is also analyzed in great detail
for a 2d dimerized Heisenberg model undergoing a quantum phase transition
between a gapped paramagnet and a N\'eel phase. Participation spectra of line
shaped (1d) sub-systems are quantitatively compared with finite temperature
participation spectra of ansatz effective boundary (1d) entanglement
Hamiltonians. While short-range models describe almost perfectly the gapped
side, the N\'eel regime is best compared using long-range effective
Hamiltonians. Spectral comparisons performed using Kullback-Leibler
divergences, a tool potentially useful for entanglement spectra, provide a
quantitative way to identify both the best boundary entanglement Hamiltonian

making it the currently most distant mini-halo known. Radio mini-halos have
been explained by synchrotron emitting particles re-accelerated via turbulence,
possibly induced by gas sloshing generated from a minor merger event. Chandra
observations show a non-concentric X-ray surface brightness distribution, which
is consistent with this sloshing interpretation. The mini-halo has a flux
density of $17\pm5$ mJy, resulting in a 1.4 GHz radio power of ($10.4\pm3.5)
\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The combined cluster emission, which includes the
central compact radio source, is also detected in a shallow GMRT 156 MHz
observation and together with the 610 MHz data we compute a spectral index of
$-0.84\pm0.12$ for the overall cluster radio emission. Given that mini-halos
typically have steeper radio spectra than cluster radio galaxies, this spectral
index should be taken as an upper limit for the mini-halo.

for evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxy
formation physics. We show that the widely used method of abundance matching
based on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two of
its underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below
10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lower
rate due to the effect of baryons. In this regime, reliance on dark matter only
simulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. We
find that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halo
masses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching does
not point to a failure of LCDM, but simply to a failure to account for baryonic
effects. Our results also imply that the Local Group contains only a few
hundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs that
abundance matching would suggest. We show how relations derived from abundance
matching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently to
calibrate models of galaxy formation.

density field from simulations with Gaussian and three different non-Gaussian
initial conditions: a local model with f_NL=100, an equilateral model with
f_NL=-400, and an orthogonal model with f_NL=-400. We show that the moments of
the dark matter density field differ significantly between Gaussian and
non-Gaussian models. We also make the measurements on mock galaxy catalogs that
contain galaxies with clustering properties similar to those of luminous red
galaxies (LRGs). We find that, in the case of skewness and kurtosis, galaxy
bias reduces the detectability of non-Gaussianity, though we can still clearly
discriminate between different models in our simulation volume. However, in the
case of the variance, galaxy bias greatly amplifies the detectability of
non-Gaussianity. In all cases we find that redshift distortions do not
significantly affect the detectability. When we restrict our measurements to
volumes equivalent to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) or Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) samples, the probability of detecting a
departure from the Gaussian model is high by using measurements of the
variance, but very low by using only skewness and kurtosis measurements. We
find that skewness and kurtosis measurements are never likely to yield useful
constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity, but future surveys should be large
enough to place meaningful constraints using measurements of the galaxy

behavior of macroscopic objects. However, efforts towards realizing nonlinear
behavior at the single photon level have been inhibited by the small size of
the radiation pressure interaction. Here we show that it is not necessary to
reach the single-photon strong-coupling regime in order to realize significant
optomechanical nonlinearities. Instead, nonlinearities at the few quanta level
can be achieved, even with weak-coupling, in a two-mode optomechanical system
driven near instability. In this limit, we establish a new figure of merit for
realizing strong nonlinearity which scales with the single-photon
optomechanical coupling and the sideband resolution of the mechanical mode with
respect to the cavity linewidth. We find that current devices based on
optomechanical crystals, thought to be in the weak-coupling regime, can still
achieve strong quantum nonlinearity; enabling deterministic interactions
between single photons.

by quiescent synchrotron emission with flat spectra extending up to the hard

well as in improved upper limits for HESS J1943+213. We also present the
analysis results of newly acquired Suzaku data for HESS J1943+213. The X-ray
spectrum is well represented by a single power law extending up to 25 keV with
photon index 2.00+/-0.02 and a moderate absorption in excess of the Galactic
value, in agreement with previous X-ray observations. No short-term X-ray

most plausible option, since in particular the broad-band spectra of the two
analyzed sources along with the source model parameters closely resemble each
other, and the newly available WISE and UKIDSS data for HESS J1943+213 are

liquid theory are the most relevant to solids. We investigate the stability of
the resulting gapless excitations - Nambu Goldstone bosons (NGBs) and Landau
quasiparticles - when coupled to one another, which is of direct relevance to
metals with a broken continuous symmetry. Typically, the coupling between NGBs

unaffected. If however the low energy coupling is non-vanishing, non-Fermi

criterion which specifies when the coupling is non-vanishing. It is satisfied
by the case of a nematic Fermi fluid, consistent with earlier microscopic

breaking - of magnetic translations - where non-vanishing couplings should
arise, opening a new route to realizing non-Fermi liquid phases.

dark atom models that match the X-ray observations and are consistent with
other constraints. In the first, the hyperfine excited state is long-lived
compared to the age of the universe, and the dark atom mass is relatively
unconstrained; dark atoms could be strongly self-interacting in this case. In
the second, the excited state is short-lived and viable models are
parameterized by the value of the dark proton-to-electron mass ratio $R$: for

corresponding notion of quantum information complexity for bipartite quantum
channels, and then investigate the properties of such quantities. These are the
fully quantum generalizations of the analogous quantities for bipartite
classical functions that have found many applications recently, in particular
for proving communication complexity lower bounds. Our definition is strongly
tied to the quantum state redistribution task.
  Previous attempts have been made to define such a quantity for quantum
protocols, with particular applications in mind; our notion differs from these
in many respects. First, it directly provides a lower bound on the quantum
communication cost, independent of the number of rounds of the underlying
protocol. Secondly, we provide an operational interpretation for quantum
information complexity: we show that it is exactly equal to the amortized
quantum communication complexity of a bipartite channel on a given state. This
generalizes a result of Braverman and Rao to quantum protocols, and even
strengthens the classical result in a bounded round scenario. Also, this
provides an analogue of the Schumacher source compression theorem for
interactive quantum protocols, and answers a question raised by Braverman.
  We also discuss some potential applications to quantum communication
complexity lower bounds by specializing our definition for classical functions
and inputs. Building on work of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen, we provide new
evidence suggesting that the bounded round quantum communication complexity of
the disjointness function is \Omega (n/M + M), for M-message protocols. This
would match the best known upper bound.

physical cosmology, but it has not been precisely tested during the current
epoch, when dark energy is dominant. Anisotropic expansion will produce a
shearing velocity field, causing objects to stream toward directions of faster
expansion and away from directions of slower expansion. This work tests the
basic cosmological assumption of isotropic expansion and thus the isotropy of
dark energy. The simplest anisotropy will manifest as a quadrupolar curl-free
proper motion vector field. We derive this theoretical signature using a
tri-axial expanding metric with a flat geometry (Bianchi I model), generalizing
and correcting previous work. We then employ the best current data, the Titov &
Lambert (2013) proper motion catalog of 429 objects, to measure the isotropy of
universal expansion. We demonstrate that the Hubble expansion is isotropic to
7% (1 $\sigma$), corresponding to streaming motions of 1 microarcsecond/yr, in
the best-constrained directions (-19% and +17% in the least-constrained
directions) and does not significantly deviate from isotropy in any direction.
The Gaia mission, which is expected to obtain proper motions for 500,000
quasars, will likely constrain the anisotropy below 1%.

is disfavored by the existing experimental data. Currently AMS-02 positron
measurements provide stringent bounds on cross sections of dark matter
annihilation into leptonic final states, and $e^+e^-$ final state is in severe
tension with this constraint, if not ruled out. The $e^+e^-$ channel will be
complementarily verified in an early stage of ILC and future CMB measurements.
Light quark final states ($q\bar q$) are relatively strongly constrained by the

description of laser beam propagation in nonlinear media that were deduced
under the assumption of homogeneity of dielectric constant of the media and for
the case of planar wave front. Here, we deduce complete wave propagation
equation that includes inhomogeneity of the dielectric constant and present
this propagation equation in compact vector form. Although similar equations
are known in the narrow fields, such as, radio wave propagation in ionosphere
and electro-magnetic and acoustic wave propagation in stratified media, we
develop here a novel approach of using such equations in modeling of laser beam
propagation in nonlinear media. The inadequacy of the assumptions under which
the propagation equations are derived in the current model is demonstrated.
Also, mathematical derivation is presented that describes foundation and
validates our previously reported method for modeling of laser beam propagation
in nonlinear media by blending solution of linear Helmholtz equation with a
correction term representing nonlinear field perturbation expressed in terms of
paraxial ray-optics (eikonal) equation. Unlike all previous theoretical
approaches developed during past five decades, our approach satisfies
correspondence principle since in the limit of zero-length wavelength it
reduces from physical to geometrical optics.

several measurement vectors, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. It is common in both signal
processing and statistics to assume the linear response model y_i = <a_i, x> +
e_i, where e_i is a noise term. However, in practice the precise relationship
between the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,
and in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this
paper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation
y_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the
dependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,
and it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized
linear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some
structure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some
known (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using
the signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean
width of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective
dimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step
procedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation
followed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which
the estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing
conclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the
observations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the
signal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible. Our results may be
specialized to understand the effect of non-linearities in compressed sensing.

classical damped binary collisions and fusion-fission, but also substantially
different from what is being termed in the literature as fast fission or quasi
fission. These signatures point to a scenario where the system fuses
transiently while virtually equilibrating mass asymmetry and energy and, yet,
keeping part of the energy stored in a collective shock-imparted and, possibly,
angular momentum bearing form of excitation. Subsequently the system fissions
dynamically along the collision or shock axis with the emerging fragments
featuring a broad mass spectrum centered around symmetric fission, relative
velocities somewhat higher along the fission axis than in transverse direction,
and virtually no intrinsic spin. The class of massasymmetric fission events
shows a distinct preference for the more massive fragments to proceed along the
beam direction, a characteristic reminiscent of that reported earlier for
dynamic fragmentation of projectile-like fragments alone and pointing to the
memory of the initial mass and velocity distribution.

independent. Our variable temperature transport measurements reveal a
metal-insulator transition at a characteristic conductivity of e2/h. The
mobility of MoSe2 devices extracted from the metallic region on both SiO2 and
parylene-C increases up to ~ 500 cm2V-1s-1 as the temperature decreases to ~
100 K, with the mobility of MoSe2 on SiO2 increasing more rapidly. In spite of
the notable variation of charged impurities as indicated by the strongly sample
dependent low temperature mobility, the mobility of all MoSe2 devices on SiO2
converges above 200 K, indicating that the high temperature (> 200 K) mobility
in these devices is nearly independent of the charged impurities. Our atomic
force microscopy study of SiO2 and parylene-C substrates further rule out the
surface roughness scattering as a major cause of the substrate dependent
mobility. We attribute the observed substrate dependence of MoSe2 mobility
primarily to the surface polar optical phonon scattering originating from the
SiO2 substrate, which is nearly absent in MoSe2 devices on parylene-C
substrate.

these settings, the asymptotic distribution of the plug-in estimator $\phi(\hat

differentiability of $\phi$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for
bootstrap consistency whenever the limiting distribution of $\hat \theta_n$ is
Gaussian. An alternative resampling scheme is proposed which remains consistent
when the bootstrap fails, and is shown to provide local size control under
restrictions on the directional derivative of $\phi$. We illustrate the utility
of our results by developing a test of whether a Hilbert space valued parameter

started as supporting research for the science of an X-ray laser (SwissFEL).
X-ray lasers have recently drawn great attention as an unprecedented tool for
scientific research on the ultrafast scale..... To answer this fundamental
question, we performed original numerical simulations using a coupled Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert Maxwell model. ... Those requirements were the motivations for
the experiments performed in the second part of the thesis. To shape the
terahertz pulses, .... Regarding the field intensities, we followed two
approaches. The first deals with field enhancement in nanoslits arrays. We
designed a subwavelength structure characterized by simultaneous high field
enhancement and high transmission at terahertz frequencies to suit nonlinear
sources. The second approach depended on up-scaling the generation from
laser-induced plasma by increasing the pump wavelengths. Numerical calculations
have also brought to our attention the importance of linear magnetoterahertz
effects. In particular, the simulations showed that the ultrafast dynamics
could lead to significant rotation of the polarization plane of the triggering
terahertz pulse. Motivated by this finding, we focused in the last part of the
thesis on the linear effects. We performed three original studies coming out
with first demonstrations of broadband non-reciprocal terahertz phase
retarders, terahertz magnetic modulators, and the non-reciprocal terahertz
isolators. In the first two experiments, we extended the unique properties of
the magnetic liquids (Ferrofluids) to the terahertz regime. In the latter
experiment, we used a permanent magnet (Ferrite) to experimentally show
complete isolation (unidirectional transmission) of the terahertz waves.

take into account not only kinetic and Coulomb potential energies but also the
so-called relativistic corrections to electron motion in a hydrogen atom.
Inequivalence between passive and active gravitational masses and energy at a
macroscopic level is demonstrated to reveal itself as time dependent
oscillations of the expectation values of the gravitational masses for
superpositions of stationary quantum states. Breakdown of the equivalence
between passive gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level reveals
itself as unusual electromagnetic radiation, emitted by macroscopic ensemble of
hydrogen atoms, moved by small spacecraft with constant velocity in the Earth's

continually while the underlying costs change over time. The challenge is to
continually maintain near-optimal solutions to the underlying optimization
problems, without creating too much churn in the solution itself. We model this
as a multistage combinatorial optimization problem where the input is a
sequence of cost functions (one for each time step); while we can change the
solution from step to step, we incur an additional cost for every such change.
We study the multistage matroid maintenance problem, where we need to maintain
a base of a matroid in each time step under the changing cost functions and
acquisition costs for adding new elements. The online version of this problem
generalizes online paging. E.g., given a graph, we need to maintain a spanning
tree $T_t$ at each step: we pay $c_t(T_t)$ for the cost of the tree at time
$t$, and also $| T_t\setminus T_{t-1} |$ for the number of edges changed at
this step. Our main result is an $O(\log m \log r)$-approximation, where $m$ is
the number of elements/edges and $r$ is the rank of the matroid. We also give
an $O(\log m)$ approximation for the offline version of the problem. These
bounds hold when the acquisition costs are non-uniform, in which caseboth these
results are the best possible unless P=NP.
  We also study the perfect matching version of the problem, where we must
maintain a perfect matching at each step under changing cost functions and
costs for adding new elements. Surprisingly, the hardness drastically
increases: for any constant $\epsilon>0$, there is no
$O(n^{1-\epsilon})$-approximation to the multistage matching maintenance
problem, even in the offline case.

HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant planet companion in a close-in
orbit. Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3 micron,
obtained at a resolution of R~100,000, during three nights of observations with
CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the exoplanet was near superior
conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's thermal spectrum and the radial
component of its orbital velocity. We detect molecular absorption from carbon
monoxide and water vapor with a combined S/N of 6.3, at a projected planet
orbital velocity of K_P = (142.8 +- 3.4) km/s, which translates into a planet
mass of M_P = (0.98 +- 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital inclination of i =
(67.7 +- 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar radial velocity and stellar
mass. The detection of absorption features rather than emission means that,
despite being highly irradiated, HD 179949 b does not have an atmospheric
temperature inversion in the probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since
the host star is active (R_HK > -4.9), this is in line with the hypothesis that
stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion layers owing to UV flux
photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical absorbers. Finally, our analysis
favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD 179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet
cannot be statistically ruled out based on these data alone.

namely, the mass of the strange-flavor scalar meson is similar to that of the
non-strange one, is at variance with the naive expectation of the quark model.
Qualitatively, the approximate mass degeneracy can be understood as a
consequence of self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels which will
push down the mass of the heavy scalar meson in the strange sector more than
that in the non-strange partner. However, it works in the conventional model
without heavy quark expansion, but not in the approach of heavy meson chiral
perturbation theory as mass degeneracy and the physical masses of $D_{s0}^*$
and $D_0^*$ cannot be accounted for simultaneously. In the heavy quark limit,
near mass degeneracy observed in the scalar charm sector will imply the same
phenomenon in the $B$ system. We have the prediction $M_{B_0^*}\approx
M_{B_{s0}^*}\approx 5715\,{\rm MeV}+\delta\Delta_S$ based on heavy quark
symmetry and the leading-order QCD correction, where $\delta\Delta_S$ arises
from $1/m_Q$ corrections. A crude estimate indicates that $\delta\Delta_S$ is
of order $-35$ MeV or less. We stress that the closeness of $B_{s0}^*$ and
$B_0^*$ masses implied by heavy quark symmetry is not spoiled by $1/m_Q$ or QCD
corrections. The mass-shift effect on $K_0^*(1430)$ is discussed.

disparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while
simultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and
control paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase,
the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the
entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high,
even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in
robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and
customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic
applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices
found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an
open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1)
quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2)
automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its
components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt!
is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing
standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific
configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These
best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles
applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry
barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against
our design objectives for their effectiveness to users.

tetrachiral microstructure is dealt with two different techniques. The first
approach is based on the representation of the cellular solid as a beam-lattice
to be homogenized as a micropolar continuum. The second approach is developed
to analyse periodic cells conceived as a two-dimensional domain consisting of
deformable portions such as the ring, the ligaments and possibly an embedded
matrix internally to these. This approach is based on a second displacement
gradient computational homogenization proposed by the Authors (Bacigalupo and
Gambarotta, 2010). The elastic moduli obtained by the micropolar homogenization
are expressed in analytical form from which it appears explicitly their
dependence on the parameter of chirality, which is the angle of inclination of
the ligaments with respect to the grid of lines connecting the centers of the
rings. For hexachiral cells, the solution of Liu et al., 2012, is found,
showing the auxetic property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling
modulus between the normal and the asymmetric strains; a property that has been
confirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the hexagonal lattice, the
classical constitutive equations of the tetragonal lattice turns out to be
characterized by the coupling between the normal and shear strains through an
elastic modulus that is an odd function of the parameter of chirality.
Moreover, this lattice is found to exhibit a remarkable variability of the
Young's modulus and of the Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied
uniaxial stress. The properties of the equivalent micropolar continuum are
qualitatively detected also in the equivalent second-gradient continuum.

Depletion of natural resources,
climate protection, security of energy supply, and workplace collaborations are
all examples of social dilemmas. Since cooperative behaviour in a social
dilemma is individually costly, Nash equilibrium predicts that humans should
not cooperate. Yet experimental studies show that people do cooperate even in
anonymous one-shot interactions. In spite of the large number of participants
in many modern social dilemmas, little is known about the effect of group size
on cooperation. Does larger group size favour or prevent cooperation? We
address this problem both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, we
find that there is no general answer: it depends on the strategic situation.
Specifically, we find that larger groups are more cooperative in the Public
Goods game, but less cooperative in the N-person Prisoner's dilemma.
Theoretically, we show that this behaviour is not consistent with either the
Fehr & Schmidt model or (a one-parameter version of) the Charness & Rabin

solution of a four-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter equation, which is decomposed in
a Faddeev form. The projection onto the light-front of the coupled set of
integral equations is performed via a quasi-potential approach. The S-wave
$K\pi$ interaction is introduced in the resonant isospin $1/2$ and the
non-resonant isospin $3/2$ channels. The numerical solution of the light-front
tridimensional inhomogeneous integral equations for the Faddeev components of
the decay amplitude is performed perturbatively. The loop-expansion converges
fast, and the three-loop contribution can be neglected in respect to the
two-loop results for the practical application. The dependence on the model
parameters in respect to the input amplitude at the partonic level is exploited
and the phase found in the experimental analysis, is fitted with an appropriate
choice of the real weights of the isospin components of the partonic amplitude.
The data suggests a small mixture of total isospin $5/2$ to the dominant $3/2$
one. The modulus of the unsymmetrized decay amplitude, which presents a deep
valley and a following increase for $K\pi$ masses above $1.5$ GeV, is fairly
reproduced. This suggests the assignment of the quantum numbers $0^+$ to the

anisotropy of the upper critical field was discussed by analyzing the
temperature dependence of the temperature derivative of resistivity. The
temperature dependence of upper critical field showed an anomalous behavior
with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We revealed that the anomalous
behavior was caused by the existence of three kinds of upper critical field,
HC2max, HC2mid and HC2min in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field
HC2min is regarded as the Hc2 where the superconducting states of the grains
with an orientation of H // c are suppressed. The HC2max and HC2mid are
regarded as the Hc2 where the superconducting states of the grains with an
orientation of H // ab are suppressed. The difference between the HC2max and
HC2mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within
the Bi-S plane. The estimated anisotropy parameter of the upper critical fields
was about 7.4 for the high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline
sample. Since the value was clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over
30 observed in the previous report on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystals grown
under ambient pressure, we concluded that a larger anisotropy of
superconductivity was not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and lower
anisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.

predicted by the {\it Planck} cosmology. Bringing all the scales together, we
determine the normalised growth rate at $z=0$ to $\sim15\%$ in a manner {\it

the measurements of redshift-space distortions from 6dFGS. We pay particular
attention to systematic errors. We point out that the intrinsic scatter present

distance units; wrongly assuming it is Gaussian in linear (velocity) units can
bias cosmological constraints. We also analytically marginalise over zero-point
errors in distance indicators, validate the accuracy of all our constraints

common misconception is that the electron produces a detectable signal only
upon arrival at the electrode. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite.
The electron induces a detectable current in the electrode as soon as it starts
moving through the gas. This induced current vanishes when the electron arrives
at the plate. To illustrate this phenomenon experimentally, we use a gas-filled
parallel plate ionization chamber and a collimated $^{241}$Am alpha source,
which produces a track of a fixed number of ionization electrons at a constant
distance from the collection electrode. We find that the detected signal from
the ionization chamber grows with the electron drift distance, as predicted by
the model of charge induction, and in conflict with the idea that electrons are
detectable upon arrival at the collection plate.

impurity system with mutual capacitive interactions. Such system can be
implemented by a double quantum dot arrangement or by a quantum dot and nearby
quantum point contact, with independently connected sets of metallic terminals.
Many--body spin correlations arising within each dot--lead subsystem give rise
to the Kondo effect under appropriate conditions. The otherwise independent
Kondo ground states may be modified by the capacitive coupling, decisively
modifying the ground state of the double quantum impurity system. We analyze
this coupled system through variational methods and the numerical
renormalization group technique. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the
coupled system ground state on the electron--hole asymmetries of the individual
subsystems, as well as on their hybridization strengths to the respective
reservoirs. The electrostatic repulsion produced by the capacitive coupling
produces an effective shift of the individual energy levels toward higher
energies, with a stronger effect on the `shallower' subsystem (that closer to
resonance with the Fermi level), potentially pushing it out of the Kondo regime
and dramatically changing the transport properties of the system. The effective
remote gating that this entails is found to depend nonlinearly on the
capacitive coupling strength, as well as on the independent subsystem levels.
The analysis we present here of this mutual interaction should be important to
fully characterize transport through such coupled systems.

gravitational waves from Planck and BICEP2 for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
can be reconciled when an early dark energy was included. This early dark
energy behaves like a radiation component at very early epoch. This is
equivalent to induce additional number of effective neutrino species: $\Delta
N_{eff}=[\frac{7}{8}(\frac{4}{11})^{4/3}]^{-1}\rho_{de}(a)/\rho_{\gamma}(a)$,
where $\rho_{\gamma}(a)$ is the photon energy density and the numerical factors
arise from converting to effective neutrino species. And $\rho_{de}(a)$ is the
energy density of early dark energy. Combining the Planck temperature data, the
WMAP9 polarization data, and the baryon acoustic oscillation data with and
without BICEP2 data, we find that in this early dark energy model the tension
between the observations from Planck and BICEP2 was relived at $2\sigma$
regions. But it cannot be removed completely due to the small ratio of early
dark energy constrained by the other cosmic observations. As a byproduct, the
tension between observed values of Hubble parameter from Planck and the direct
measurement of the Hubble constant was removed in this early dark energy model.

the stress level is elevated when the degradation value of a product crosses a
pre-specified value, was proposed. The times of stress level elevating are
random and vary from product to product. In this paper we extend this model to
a more economic plan. The proposed extended model has two economical advantages
compared with the previous one. The first is that the times of stress level
elevating in the new model are identical for all products, which enable us to
use only one chamber (oven) for testing all test units. The second is that, the
new method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress
level, it is not necessary for the experimenter to inspect the value of the
degradation continually. The new method decrease the cost of measurement and
also there is no need to use electronic sensors to detect the first passage
time of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method. We assume
that the degradation path follows a gamma process. The stress level is elevated
as soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units, at one
of the specified times, exceeds the threshold value. Under the constraint that
the total experimental cost does not exceed a pre-specified budget, the optimal
settings including the optimal threshold value, sample size, measurement
frequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic
variance of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product.
A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed method.

the $\ell_1$ norm subject to $ |Ax| = b $ recovers $x_0$ up to multiplication
by a global sign. Moreover, we establish that the SRIP holds for the random

while the plume moves, which has the potential advantage of providing
continuous high-resolution images of fluid flow with the aid of data
processing. However, the applicability of this approach is limited by the high
computational cost associated with having to analyze large data sets within the
time constraints imposed by real-time monitoring. Existing data assimilation
methods have computational requirements that increase super-linearly with the
size of the unknowns $m$. In this paper, we present the HiKF, a new Kalman
filter (KF) variant powered by the hierarchical matrix approach that
dramatically reduces the computational and storage cost of the standard KF from
$\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, while producing practically the same
results. The version of HiKF that is presented here takes advantage of the
so-called random walk dynamical model, which is tailored to a class of data
assimilation problems in which measurements are collected quasi-continuously.
The proposed method has been applied to a realistic CO$_2$ injection model and
compared with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Numerical results show that
HiKF can provide estimates that are more accurate than EnKF, and also
demonstrate the usefulness of modeling the system dynamics as a random walk in

whether a cosmological constant energy component is needed to improve the

polarisation with a maximum fractional polarisation of 9% in a small area of
the north west limb. We estimate the size of N 70 to have a diameter of 104 pc
($\pm 1$ pc). The morphology of N 70 in X-rays closely follows that in radio

longer wavelengths. Purely thermal models adequately fit the soft X-ray

multi-scale features. We call this trend the {\it tendency} of a time series.
The tendency is defined empirically by a set of criteria and captures the
large-scale temporal variability of the original signal as well as the most
frequent events in its histogram. Among other properties, the tendency has a
variance no larger than that of the original signal; the histogram of the
difference between the original signal and the tendency is as symmetric as
possible; and with reduced complexity, the tendency captures essential features
of the signal.
  To find the tendency we first use the Intrinsic Time-Scale Decomposition
(ITD) of the signal, introduced in 2007 by Frei and Osorio, to produce a set of
candidate tendencies. We then apply the criteria to each of the candidates to
single out the one that best agrees with them.
  While the criteria for the tendency are independent of the signal
decomposition scheme, it is found that the ITD is a simple and stable
methodology, well suited for multi-scale signals. The ITD is a relatively new
decomposition and little is known about its outcomes. In this study we take the
first steps towards a probabilistic model of the ITD analysis of random time

its theoretical properties are known only for the single-slot case and
full-information setting, and even in this simple setting, the corresponding

a novel broad-match mechanism, which we call the Probabilistic Broad-Match

show that PBM-GSP can generate larger welfare than SBM-GSP under mild

dense neutrino gases, and it has been hypothesized that some solutions are
chaotic in nature. This is of particular interest in the case of neutrino
emission from core-collapse supernovae where the measurement of the spectral
shape for different flavors can provide crucial information about both neutrino
physics and the physical conditions close to the proto-neutron star. Whether a
system is chaotic or not can be assessed by the Lyapunov exponents which
quantify the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the system. We have
done a numerical case study for a simple toy model of two neutrino flavors with
two momentum states traveling against each other which is known to exhibit
flavor transition instabilities. We find the leading Lyapunov exponent to be
positive in all cases, confirming the chaoticity of the system for both the
normal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. However, more Lyapunov
exponents were approximately zero in the inverted hierarchy compared to the
normal which has implications for the stability of the system. To investigate
this, we have calculated a generalized set of normal modes, the so-called
covariant Lyapunov vectors. The covariant Lyapunov vectors associated with
vanishing Lyapunov exponents showed the existence of marginally stable
directions in phase space for some cases. While our analysis was done for a toy
model example, it should work equally well for more realistic cases of
neutrinos streaming from a proto-neutron star and provide valuable insight into
the nature of the flavor instability. We finally stress that our approach
captures many more properties of the physical system than the linear stability
analyses which have previously been performed.

  GaussianFace","Appearing in Proceedings of the 29th AAAI Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence (AAAI-15), Oral Presentation",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face verification remains a challenging problem in very complex conditions
with large variations such as pose, illumination, expression, and occlusions.
This problem is exacerbated when we rely unrealistically on a single training
data source, which is often insufficient to cover the intrinsically complex
face variations. This paper proposes a principled multi-task learning approach
based on Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, named
GaussianFace, to enrich the diversity of training data. In comparison to
existing methods, our model exploits additional data from multiple
source-domains to improve the generalization performance of face verification
in an unknown target-domain. Importantly, our model can adapt automatically to
complex data distributions, and therefore can well capture complex face
variations inherent in multiple sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model in learning from diverse data sources and
generalize to unseen domain. Specifically, the accuracy of our algorithm
achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 98.52% on the well-known and
challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark. For the first time, the
human-level performance in face verification (97.53%) on LFW is surpassed.

between different types of charged particles. In high-energy physics, where
trajectories are rather long, large size trackers must be used to achieve
sufficient position resolution. However, in low-background experiments tracks
are rather short and three dimensional trajectories could only be resolved in
time-projection chambers so far. For detectors of large volume and therefore
large drift distances, which are inevitable for low-background experiments,
this technique is limited by diffusion of charge carriers. In this work we
present a ""proof-of-principle"" experiment for a new method for the three
dimensional tracking of charged particles by scintillation light: We used a
setup consisting of a scintillator, mirrors, lenses and a novel imaging device
(the hybrid photo detector) in order to image two projections of electron
tracks through the scintillator. We took data at the T-24 beam-line at DESY
with relativistic electrons with a kinetic energy of 5 GeV and from this data
successfully reconstructed their three dimensional propagetion path in the
scintillator. With our setup we achieved a position resolution of about 28 mum
in the best case.

detected by the European New Gravitational Observatory (NGO: eLISA is derived

stronger gravitational wave (GW) radiation can be obtained from DCO sources

signals from the resolvable DCO sources in the Galaxy using a binary population

capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the density of states (DoS) and
energy gaps in this spectrum. Without a magnetic field, replica spectra are
seen as pronounced DoS minima surrounded by van Hove singularities. The
Hofstadter butterfly shows up as recurring Landau fan diagrams in high fields.
Electron-electron interactions add another twist to the self-similar behaviour.

with morphological and structural analyses of imagery and elevation data for
Aram Chaos in conjunction with numerical modeling of the morphological
evolution of the catastrophic carving of the outflow valley. The morphological
and geological analyses of Aram Chaos suggest large-scale collapse and
subsidence (1500 m) of the entire area, which is consistent with a massive
expulsion of liquid water from the subsurface in one single event. The combined
observations suggest a complex process starting with the outflow of water from
two small channels, followed by continuous groundwater sapping and headward
erosion and ending with a catastrophic lake rim collapse and carving of the
Aram Valley, which is synchronous with the 2.5 Ga stage of the Ares Vallis
formation. The water volume and formative time scale required to carve the Aram
channels indicate that a single, rapid (maximum tens of days) and catastrophic
(flood volume of 9.3?104 km3) event carved the outflow channel. We conclude
that a sub-ice lake collapse model can best explain the features of the Aram

of the CVaR in the form of a conditional expectation. Based on this formula, we
propose a novel sampling-based estimator for the CVaR gradient, in the spirit
of the likelihood-ratio method. We analyze the bias of the estimator, and prove
the convergence of a corresponding stochastic gradient descent algorithm to a
local CVaR optimum. Our method allows to consider CVaR optimization in new

learn a risk-sensitive controller for the game of Tetris.

universe. An excess of X-ray emission below about 2 keV, called soft-excess, is
very common in Type 1 AGN spectra. The origin of this feature remains debated.
Originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities to
model the soft-excess, including warm Comptonization and blurred ionized
reflection. In this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on Mrk 509, a
bright Seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order to
determine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. We use ten
simultaneous XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations performed every four days. We
present here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of the
parameters and the variability properties of the X-ray emission. The
application of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strong
reflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-band
spectrum of Mrk 509. Two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection are
discussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. In both cases we find
that the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating that
the model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. A
large, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard X-rays
could be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. However, such a
change does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.
Warm Comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in this
object. Nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warm
Comptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, one
dominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk and
the corona.

AdS black holes, but also rotating AdS black holes. Not only are the examples

presented for Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes. The specific heat at constant
pressure $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient $\alpha$ and the isothermal
compressibility coefficient $\kappa_T$ are found to diverge exactly at the
critical point. It has been verified that both Ehrenfest equations hold at the
critical point of $P-V$ criticality in the extended phase spaces of AdS black
holes. So the nature of the critical point of $P-V$ criticality of AdS black
holes has been demonstrated analytically to be a second-order phase transition.
These results are consistent with the nature of liquid-gas phase transition at
the critical point. In this sense, our research would deepen the understanding
of the relations of AdS black holes and liquid-gas systems. Moreover, our
successful approaches to introduce the original expressions of Erhenfest
equations directly into black hole phase transition research demonstrate again
that black hole thermodynamics is closely related to classical thermodynamics,

tensor modes by BICEP2 and the PLANCK constraints on isocurvature density
perturbations. A more interesting and still viable possibility is that the
string theoretic QCD axion is charged under an anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry.
In such case, the axion decay constant can be much lower than the GUT scale if
moduli are stabilized near the point of vanishing Fayet-Illiopoulos term, and
U(1)_A-charged matter fields get a vacuum value far below the GUT scale due to
a tachyonic SUSY breaking scalar mass. We examine the symmetry breaking pattern
of such models during the inflationary epoch with the Hubble expansion rate
10^{14} GeV, and identify the range of the QCD axion decay constant, as well as
the corresponding relic axion abundance, consistent with known cosmological
constraints. In addition to the case that the PQ symmetry is restored during
inflation, there are other viable scenarios, including that the PQ symmetry is
broken during inflation at high scales around 10^{16}-10^{17} GeV due to a
large Hubble-induced tachyonic scalar mass from the U(1)_A D-term, while the
present axion scale is in the range 10^{9}-5\times 10^{13} GeV, where the
present value larger than 10^{12} GeV requires a fine-tuning of the axion
misalignment angle. We also discuss the implications of our results for the

self-localization in an underwater acoustic sensor network where sensor nodes
are distributed randomly in an operating area. In terms of packet scheduling,
our goal is to minimize the localization time, and to do so we consider two
packet transmission schemes, namely a collision-free scheme (CFS), and a
collision-tolerant scheme (CTS). The required localization time is formulated
for these schemes, and through analytical results and numerical examples their
performances are shown to be generally comparable. However, when the packet
duration is short (as is the case for a localization packet), and the operating
area is large (above 3km in at least one dimension), the collision-tolerant
scheme requires a smaller localization time than the collision-free scheme.
After gathering enough measurements, an iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm is
employed by each sensor node for self-localization, and the Cramer Rao lower
bound is evaluated as a benchmark. Although CTS consumes more energy for packet
transmission, it provides a better localization accuracy. Additionally, in this
scheme the anchor nodes work independently of each other, and can operate
asynchronously which leads to a simplified implementation.

dynamics used so far to study the isotropic colloidal aggregation. It now
implements the classical Kern-Frenkel potential to describe patchy interactions
between particles. This technique gives access to static properties, dynamics
and kinetics of the system, even far from the equilibrium. Particle thermal
motions are modeled using billions of independent small random translations and
rotations, constrained by the excluded volume and the connectivity. This
algorithm, applied to a single polymer chain leads to correct static and
dynamic properties, in the framework where hydrodynamic interactions are
ignored. By varying patch angles, various chain flexibilities can be obtained.
We have used this new algorithm to model step-growth polymerization under
various solvent qualities. The polymerization reaction is modeled by an
irreversible aggregation between patches while an isotropic finite square-well
potential is superimposed to mimic the solvent quality. In bad solvent
conditions, a competition between a phase separation (due to the isotropic
interaction) and polymerization (due to patches) occurs. Surprisingly, an
arrested network with a very peculiar structure appears. It is made of strands
and nodes. Strands gather few stretched chains that dip into entangled globular
nodes. These nodes act as reticulation points between the strands. The system
is kinetically driven and we observe a trapped arrested structure. That
demonstrates one of the strengths of this new simulation technique. It can give
valuable insights about mechanisms that could be involved in the formation of
stranded gels.

magnetic helicity is gauge-dependent, its value in any gauge may be physically
interpreted as the average winding number among all pairs of field lines with
respect to some orthonormal frame field. In fact, the choice of gauge is
equivalent to the choice of reference field in the relative helicity, meaning
that the magnetic helicity is no less physically meaningful. We prove that a
particular gauge always measures the winding with respect to a fixed frame, and
propose that this is normally the best choice. For periodic fields, this choice
is equivalent to measuring relative helicity with respect to a potential
reference field. But for aperiodic fields, we show that the potential field can
be twisted. We prove by construction that there always exists a possible
untwisted reference field.

with unprecendented orbital coverage for many orbits continuously, we have
found a strong orbital dependence of the absorption column density and
equivalent width of the iron emission line. A very large equivalent width of
the iron line along with a small value of the column density in the orbital

density absorbing matter behind the neutron star in these orbital phase range.
A low energy excess is also found in the spectrum at orbital phases around the

used to examine the various models about mode of accretion onto the neutron

  Applications (edited by H. Boche, R. Calderbank, G. Kutyniok, J. Vybiral)",,,,"math.NA cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed sensing extends from the recovery of sparse vectors from
undersampled measurements via efficient algorithms to the recovery of matrices
of low rank from incomplete information. Here we consider a further extension
to the reconstruction of tensors of low multi-linear rank in recently
introduced hierarchical tensor formats from a small number of measurements.
Hierarchical tensors are a flexible generalization of the well-known Tucker
representation, which have the advantage that the number of degrees of freedom
of a low rank tensor does not scale exponentially with the order of the tensor.
While corresponding tensor decompositions can be computed efficiently via
successive applications of (matrix) singular value decompositions, some
important properties of the singular value decomposition do not extend from the
matrix to the tensor case. This results in major computational and theoretical
difficulties in designing and analyzing algorithms for low rank tensor
recovery. For instance, a canonical analogue of the tensor nuclear norm is
NP-hard to compute in general, which is in stark contrast to the matrix case.
In this book chapter we consider versions of iterative hard thresholding
schemes adapted to hierarchical tensor formats. A variant builds on methods
from Riemannian optimization and uses a retraction mapping from the tangent
space of the manifold of low rank tensors back to this manifold. We provide
first partial convergence results based on a tensor version of the restricted
isometry property (TRIP) of the measurement map. Moreover, an estimate of the
number of measurements is provided that ensures the TRIP of a given tensor rank
with high probability for Gaussian measurement maps.

Earth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the LOFAR
radio telescope. As the emission comes from a finite distance of a few
kilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. A spherical, conical or
hyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements of
individual air showers have been inconclusive so far. For a selected
high-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we have
reconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecond
precision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. For each measured air shower, we
have fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.
The fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the best
parametrization. Using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angular
resolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. Furthermore, a
dependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. This
suggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get an
additional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which is
sensitive to the mass of the primary particle.

asymmetry identical to the observed baryon asymmetry (Planck and Wilkinson

of the first generation of low-metallicity stars. The lifetimes of these stars
in different phases of stellar evolution are significantly extended, namely, in
the pre-main sequence, main sequence, and red giant phases. In particular,
intermediate-mass stars in the red giant phase experience significant changes
in their luminosity and chemical composition. The annihilations of dark matter
particles affect the interior of the star in such a way that the
$3\alpha-$reaction becomes less efficient in the production of carbon and
oxygen. This dark matter effect contradicts the excess of carbon and other
metals observed today in stars of low mass and low metallicity. Hence, we can
impose an upper limit on the dark matter halo density, and therefore on the
redshift, at which the first generation of low-metallicity stars formed.

it very difficult to predict the performance of a scheduling algorithm.
Therefore, dynamic solutions, where scheduling decisions are made at runtime
have overpassed static allocation strategies. The simplicity and efficiency of
dynamic schedulers such as Hadoop are a key of the success of the MapReduce
framework. Dynamic schedulers such as StarPU, PaRSEC or StarSs are also
developed for more constrained computations, e.g. task graphs coming from
linear algebra. To make their decisions, these runtime systems make use of some
static information, such as the distance of tasks to the critical path or the
affinity between tasks and computing resources (CPU, GPU,...) and of dynamic
information, such as where input data are actually located. In this paper, we
concentrate on two elementary linear algebra kernels, namely the outer product
and the matrix multiplication. For each problem, we propose several dynamic
strategies that can be used at runtime and we provide an analytic study of
their theoretical performance. We prove that the theoretical analysis provides
very good estimate of the amount of communications induced by a dynamic
strategy and can be used in order to efficiently determine thresholds used in
dynamic scheduler, thus enabling to choose among them for a given problem and

virtue of its relatively lower free energy. Their equilibrium phase conditions
are found to be: $D \geq 0$ (FO); $-\frac{1}{2} \gamma < D < 0$ (SO). Compared
numerically to the associated AFM and spin-flip phases, the deduced SO SFO

experimentally validate due to a general intolerance to substitution. Here,
using computational methods to predict co-evolving residues, we identify a
network of positions consisting of two catalytic metal-binding residues and two
adjacent non- catalytic residues in LAGLIDADG family homing endonucleases
(LHEs). Distinct combinations of residues in the network map to clades of LHE
sub-families, with a striking distribution of the metal-binding Asp (D) and Glu
(E) residues. Mutation of these four positions in two LHEs, I-LtrI and I-OnuI,
indicate that combinations of residues tolerated are specific to each enzyme.
Kinetic analyses under single-turnover conditions indicated a substantial
defect in either the catalytic rate (kcat*) or the Michaelis constant (KM*) for
I- LtrI variants with networks predicted to be suboptimal. Enzymatic activity
could be restored to near wild-type levels with a single compensatory mutation
that recreated a network of optimally predicted residues. Our results
demonstrate that LHE activity is constrained by an evolutionary barrier of
residues with strong context-dependent effects. Creation of optimal co-evolving
active site networks is therefore an important consideration in engineering of
LHEs and other enzymes.

nanosized magnetic particles, the nanoparticles accumulate around the
microparticle and form thick anisotropic clouds extended in the direction of
the applied magnetic field. This phenomenon promotes colloidal stabilization of
bimodal magnetic suspensions and allows efficient magnetic separation of
nanoparticles used in bioanalysis and water purification. In the present work,
size and shape of nanoparticle clouds under the simultaneous action of an
external uniform magnetic field and the flow have been studied in details. In
experiments, dilute suspension of iron oxide nanoclusters (of a mean diameter
of 60 nm) was pushed through a thin slit channel with the nickel microspheres
(of a mean diameter of 50$\mu$m) attached to the channel wall. The behavior of
nanocluster clouds was observed in the steady state using an optical
microscope. In the presence of strong enough flow, the size of the clouds
monotonically decreases with increasing flow speed in both longitudinal and
transverse magnetic fields. This is qualitatively explained by enhancement of
hydrodynamic forces washing the nanoclusters away from the clouds. In the
longitudinal field, the flow induces asymmetry of the front and the back
clouds. To explain the flow and the field effects on the clouds, we have
developed a simple model based on the balance of the stresses and particle
fluxes on the cloud surface. This model, applied to the case of the magnetic
field parallel to the flow, captures reasonably well the flow effect on the
size and shape of the cloud and reveals that the only dimensionless parameter
governing the cloud size is the ratio of hydrodynamic-to-magnetic forces - the
Mason number. At strong magnetic interactions considered in the present work
(dipolar coupling parameter $\alpha \geq 2$), the Brownian motion seems not to
affect the cloud behavior.

important intermediate step in recent computer vision algorithms. However, it
is severely underconstrained and difficult to solve. State-of-the-art
approaches include matting by graph Laplacian, which significantly improves the
underconstrained nature by reducing the solution space. However, matting by
graph Laplacian is still very difficult to solve and gets much harder as the
image size grows: current iterative methods slow down as $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2
\right)$ in the resolution $n$. This creates uncomfortable practical limits on
the resolution of images that we can matte. Current literature mitigates the
problem, but they all remain super-linear in complexity. We expose properties
of the problem that remain heretofore unexploited, demonstrating that an
optimization technique originally intended to solve PDEs can be adapted to take
advantage of this knowledge to solve the matting problem, not heuristically,
but exactly and with sub-linear complexity. This makes ours the most efficient
matting solver currently known by a very wide margin and allows matting finally
to be practical and scalable in the future as consumer photos exceed many
dozens of megapixels, and also relieves matting from being a bottleneck for

CCFT at the horizon of non-extreme black holes. By using our energy-momentum

Cardy-like formula for CCFT yields the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of
non-extreme BTZ. Our current work is the first step towards describing the
entropy of non-extreme black holes in terms of CCFTs microstates which live on

constant slope power-law behavior for the late X-ray luminosity in the source
rest-frame, which may lead to a new distance indicator for BdHNe. These
results, as well as the emitter size and Lorentz factor, appear to be

function of refractive-index mismatch for high-aperture confocal microscopy
imaging. We found that our scaling factors are almost completely linearly
dependent on refractive index and that they were in good agreement with
theoretical predictions that take the full vectorial properties of light into
account. There was however a strong deviation with the theoretical predictions
using (high-angle) geometrical optics, which predict much lower scaling
factors. As an illustration, we measured the point-spread-function of a
point-scanning confocal microscope and showed that an index-matched,
micron-sized spherical object is still significantly elongated due to this PSF,
which confirms that single micron-sized spheres are not well suited to
determine accurate axial calibration nor axial scaling.

perturbations in the cosmic density field, leading to galaxy clusters with up
to 10^15 Msun at the present day. Here, we review the formation of structures
in the Universe, considering the first primordial galaxies and the most massive
galaxy clusters as extreme cases of structure formation where fundamental
processes such as gravity, turbulence, cooling and feedback are particularly
relevant. The first non-linear objects in the Universe formed in dark matter
halos with 10^5-10^8 Msun at redshifts 10-30, leading to the first stars and
massive black holes. At later stages, larger scales became non-linear, leading
to the formation of galaxy clusters, the most massive objects in the Universe.
We describe here their formation via gravitational processes, including the
self-similar scaling relations, as well as the observed deviations from such
self-similarity and the related non-gravitational physics (cooling, stellar
feedback, AGN). While on intermediate cluster scales the self-similar model is
in good agreement with the observations, deviations from such self-similarity
are apparent in the core regions, where numerical simulations do not reproduce
the current observational results. The latter indicates that the interaction of
different feedback processes may not be correctly accounted for in current
simulations. Both in the most massive clusters of galaxies as well as during
the formation of the first objects in the Universe, turbulent structures and
shock waves appear to be common, suggesting them to be ubiquitous in the
non-linear regime.

an O-type young star in the northern hemisphere. We investigated the 3D
kinematics and dynamics of circumstellar gas with very high linear resolution,
from tens to 1500 AU, with the ultimate goal of building a comprehensive
dynamical model for this YSO. We employed four different observing epochs of
EVN data at 6.7 GHz, spanning almost eight years, which enabled us to measure,
besides line-of-sight (l.o.s.) velocities and positions, also l.o.s.
accelerations and proper motions of methanol masers. In addition, we imaged
with the JVLA-B array highly-excited ammonia inversion lines, from (6,6) to
(13,13), which enabled us to probe the hottest molecular gas very close to the
exciting source(s). We found five 6.7 GHz maser clusters which are distributed
over a region extended N-S across ~1500 AU and are associated with three peaks
of the radio continuum. We proposed that these maser clusters identify three
individual high-mass YSOs, named IRS1a, IRS1b, and IRS1c. We modeled the maser
clusters in IRS1a and IRS1b in terms of edge-on disks in centrifugal
equilibrium. In the first case, masers may trace a quasi-Keplerian thin disk,
orbiting around a high-mass YSO, IRS1a, of up to 25 solar masses. This YSO
dominates the bolometric luminosity of the region. The second disk is both
massive (<16 Msun within ~500 AU) and thick, and the mass of the central YSO,
IRS1b, is constrained to be at most a few solar masses. In summary, we present
compelling evidence that NGC7538 IRS1 is not forming just one single high-mass
YSO, but consists of a multiple system of high-mass YSOs, which are surrounded
by accretion disks, and are probably driving individual outflows. This new
model naturally explains all the different orientations and disk/outflow
structures proposed for the region in previous models.

three-dimensional potential of a perturbed harmonic oscillator with eight
possible channels of escape, which was chosen as an interesting example of open
three-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. In particular, we conduct a thorough
numerical investigation distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as
well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering unbounded motion for
several values of the energy. In an attempt to discriminate safely and with
certainty between ordered and chaotic motion, we use the Smaller ALingment
Index (SALI) detector, computed by integrating numerically the basic equations
of motion as well as the variational equations. Of particular interest, is to
locate the basins of escape towards the different escape channels and connect
them with the corresponding escape periods of the orbits. We split our study
into three different cases depending on the initial value of the $z$ coordinate
which was used for launching the test particles. We found, that when the orbits
are started very close to the primary $(x,y)$ plane the respective grids
exhibit a high degree of fractalization, while on the other hand for orbits
with relatively high values of $z_0$ several well-formed basins of escape
emerge thus, reducing significantly the fractalization of the grids. It was
also observed, that for values of energy very close to the escape energy the
escape times of orbits are large, while for energy levels much higher than the
escape energy the vast majority of orbits escape extremely fast or even
immediately to infinity. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further
understanding of the escape process in open 3D Hamiltonian systems.

organism is a power function of time). It is stated that such a model is valid
only in the initial period of growth. For the whole period of growth, a
generalization of Schmalhausen's model is advanced; it provides the same
accuracy as previously known models of quantitative description of kinetic
curves. Within the scope of the developed model, a number of interesting
results related to an allometry and biological time are obtained.

systems have negative phase velocities without double negative permittivity and
permeability can be described by a unified theory. People are interested in the
application of metamaterials and negative phase velocities but do not
appreciate the magnitude and significance to the spacetime conception of modern
physics and philosophy.

that massive gravitons lead to 3/4th the bending of light past the planet

super-radiance in the case of conventional BHs and Braneworld BH
super-radiance, which may delineate if Braneworlds contribute to an admissible
massive graviton in terms of removing the usual problem of the 3/4th the
bending of light past the planet Mercury which is normally associated with
massive gravitons. This leads to a fork in the road, between two alternatives
with the possibility of needing a multiverse containment of BH structure, or
embracing what Hawkings wrote up recently, namely a re do of the Event Horizon
hypothesis as we know it.

first-order sentence in prefix form built using existential quantifiers and all
Boolean connectives) is true in a finite partially ordered set (in short, a
poset). A poset is a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive digraph. The
problem encompasses the fundamental embedding problem of finding an isomorphic
copy of a poset as an induced substructure of another poset.
  Model checking existential logic is already NP-hard on a fixed poset; thus we
investigate structural properties of posets yielding conditions for
fixed-parameter tractability when the problem is parameterized by the sentence.
We identify width as a central structural property (the width of a poset is the
maximum size of a subset of pairwise incomparable elements); our main
algorithmic result is that model checking existential logic on classes of
finite posets of bounded width is fixed-parameter tractable. We observe a
similar phenomenon in classical complexity, where we prove that the isomorphism
problem is polynomial-time tractable on classes of posets of bounded width;
this settles an open problem in order theory.
  We surround our main algorithmic result with complexity results on less
restricted, natural neighboring classes of finite posets, establishing its
tightness in this sense. We also relate our work with (and demonstrate its
independence of) fundamental fixed-parameter tractability results for model
checking on digraphs of bounded degree and bounded clique-width.
