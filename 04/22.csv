satellite results, it has been observed that the simple single field chaotic
inflationary models provide a good agreement with their spectral index n_s and
large tensor-to-scalar ratio r (0.15 <r <0.26). To explore the other simple
models, we consider the fractional-chaotic inflationary potentials of the form
V_0 phi^(a/b) where a and b are relatively prime. We show that such kind of
inflaton potentials can be realized elegantly in the supergravity framework
with generalized shift symmetry and a nature bound a/b < 4 for consistency.
Especially, for the number of e-folding from 50 to 60 and some a/b from 2 to 3,
our predictions are nicely within at least 1 $\sigma$ region in the r-n_s
plane. We also present a systematic investigation of such chaotic inflationary
models with fractional exponents to explore the possibilities for the
enhancement in the magnitude of running of spectral index (\alpha_{n_s}) beyond
the simplistic models.

the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method,
surprisingly suggest that this tailoring is not necessary and that a single
efficient algorithm could achieve best possible guarantees for a wide range of
different problems.
  The Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) is a tantalizing conjecture in
computational complexity, which, if true, will shed light on the complexity of
a great many problems. In particular this conjecture predicts that a single
concrete algorithm provides optimal guarantees among all efficient algorithms
for a large class of computational problems.
  The Sum-of-Squares (SOS) method is a general approach for solving systems of
polynomial constraints. This approach is studied in several scientific
disciplines, including real algebraic geometry, proof complexity, control
theory, and mathematical programming, and has found applications in fields as
diverse as quantum information theory, formal verification, game theory and
many others.
  We survey some connections that were recently uncovered between the Unique
Games Conjecture and the Sum-of-Squares method. In particular, we discuss new
tools to rigorously bound the running time of the SOS method for obtaining
approximate solutions to hard optimization problems, and how these tools give
the potential for the sum-of-squares method to provide new guarantees for many
problems of interest, and possibly to even refute the UGC.

finding large Pareto optimal matchings. It is straightforward to show that no
deterministic truthful mechanism can approximate a maximum cardinality Pareto
optimal matching with ratio better than 2. We thus consider randomised
mechanisms. We give a natural and explicit extension of the classical Random
Serial Dictatorship Mechanism (RSDM) specifically for the House Allocation
problem where preference lists can include ties. We thus obtain a universally
truthful randomised mechanism for finding a Pareto optimal matching and show
that it achieves an approximation ratio of $\frac{e}{e-1}$. The same bound
holds even when agents have priorities (weights) and our goal is to find a
maximum weight (as opposed to maximum cardinality) Pareto optimal matching. On
the other hand we give a lower bound of $\frac{18}{13}$ on the approximation
ratio of any universally truthful Pareto optimal mechanism in settings with
strict preferences. In the case that the mechanism must additionally be
non-bossy with an additional technical assumption, we show by utilising a
result of Bade that an improved lower bound of $\frac{e}{e-1}$ holds. This
lower bound is tight since RSDM for strict preference lists is non-bossy. We

important cases, when the influence of the local perturbation, caused by the
lag, becomes insignificant at a distance, where the leading plane-state
asymptotics near the fracture front is still applicable. The universal
asymptotics are used for finding the matching constants of the basic (outer)

from concepts of metabolic control theory. Economic state variables, called
economic potentials and loads, describe how metabolites, reactions, and enzymes
contribute to metabolic performance. Economic potentials describe the indirect
value of metabolite production, while economic loads describe the indirect
value of metabolite concentrations. These economic variables, and others, are
linked by local balance equations. These laws for optimal metabolic states
define conditions for metabolic fluxes that hold for a wide range of rate laws.
To produce metabolic value, fluxes run from lower to higher economic
potentials, must be free of futile cycles, and satisfy a principle of minimal
weighted fluxes. Given an economical flux mode, one can systematically
construct kinetic models in which all enzymes have positive effects on
metabolic performance.

  problems with realistic interactions is a difficult problem that
  normally must be solved on powerful supercomputers, taking a lot
  of computer time. This strongly limits the possibility of accurate
  treatments for many important few-particle problems in different
  branches of quantum physics.
  Purpose: To develop a new general highly effective approach
  for the practical solution of few-body scattering equations that
  can be implemented on a graphics processing unit.
  Methods: The general approach is realized in three steps: (i)
  the reformulation of the scattering equations using a convenient
  analytical form for the channel resolvent operator; (ii) a complete
  few-body continuum discretization and projection of all operators
  and wave functions onto a $L_2$ basis constructed from
  stationary wave packets and (iii) the ultra-fast solution of the
  resulting matrix equations using graphics processor.
  Results: The whole approach is illustrated by a calculation of
  the neutron-deuteron elastic scattering cross section below and
  above the three-body breakup threshold with a realistic $NN$
  potential which is performed on a standard PC using a graphics
  processor with an extremely short runtime.
  Conclusions: The general technique proposed in this paper opens a
  new way for a fast practical solution of quantum few-body scattering
  problems both in non-relativistic and relativistic formulations in
  hadronic, nuclear and atomic physics.

To appear in the ""Annals of Probability""",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In proving large deviation estimates, the lower bound for open sets and upper
bound for compact sets are essentially local estimates. On the other hand, the
upper bound for closed sets is global and compactness of space or an
exponential tightness estimate is needed to establish it. In dealing with the
occupation measure $L_t(A)=\frac{1}{t}\int_0^t{\1}_A(W_s) \d s$ of the $d$
dimensional Brownian motion, which is not positive recurrent, there is no
possibility of exponential tightness. The space of probability distributions
$\mathcal {M}_1(\R^d)$ can be compactified by replacing the usual topology of
weak convergence by the vague toplogy, where the space is treated as the dual
of continuous functions with compact support. This is essentially the one point
compactification of $\R^d$ by adding a point at $\infty$ that results in the
compactification of $\mathcal M_1(\R^d)$ by allowing some mass to escape to the
point at $\infty$. If one were to use only test functions that are continuous
and vanish at $\infty$ then the compactification results in the space of
sub-probability distributions $\mathcal {M}_{\le 1}(\R^d)$ by ignoring the mass
at $\infty$.
  The main drawback of this compactification is that it ignores the underlying
translation invariance. More explicitly, we may be interested in the space of
equivalence classes of orbits $\widetilde{\mathcal M}_1=\widetilde{\mathcal
M}_1(\R^d)$ under the action of the translation group $\R^d$ on $\mathcal
M_1(\R^d)$. There are problems for which it is natural to compactify this space
of orbits. We will provide such a compactification, prove a large deviation
principle there and give an application to a relevant problem.

evident in the susceptibility data, clearer anomalies are present in the heat
capacity data. Our 45Sc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lineshape (first order
quadrupole split) is symmetric at room temperature but becomes progressively
asymmetric with decreasing temperatures. This is suggestive of distortions in
the structure which could arise from progressive tilt/rotation of the IrO6
octahedra with a decrease in temperature T. The 45Sc NMR spectral weight shifts
near the reference frequency with decreasing T indicating the development of
magnetic singlet regions. Around 10K, a significant change in the spectrum
takes place with a large intensity appearing near the reference frequency but
with the spectrum remaining multi-peak. It appears from our 45Sc NMR data that
in Ba3ScIr2O9 significant disorder is still present below 10K. In the case of
Ba3YIr2O9, the 89Y NMR spectral lines are asymmetric at high temperatures but
become nearly symmetric (single magnetic environment) below T~70K. Our 89Y
spectra and T1 measurements confirm the onset of long range ordering (LRO) from
a bulk of the sample at 4K in this compound. Our results suggest that Ba3YIr2O9
might be structurally distorted at room temperature (via, for example,
tilt/rotations of the IrO6 octahedra) but becomes progressively a regular
triangular lattice with decreasing T. The effective magnetic moments and
magnetic entropy changes are strongly reduced in Ba3YIr2O9 as compared to those
expected for a S=1/2 system. Similar effects have been found in other iridates

convection non-negligibly contributes to energy transfer. Indeed, instability
of modes excited at the Fe bump is likely to be suppressed with TDC compared
with the case of adopting the frozen-in convection approximation. But we make
sure that unstable strange-modes certainly appear in hot massive stars even by
taking into account TDC. We also examine properties of the strange-mode
instability, which is related to destabilization of strange-modes without
adiabatic counterparts. In this type of instability, the phase lag between
density and pressure varies from 0 to $180^{\circ}$ in an excitation zone
unlike the case of the $\kappa$-mechanism. In addition, we confirm by comparing

pre-main-sequence stars is still poorly understood. This part of the disk is
shaped by various forces that influence dust and gas dynamics, and by dust
sublimation, which creates abrupt drops in the dust density. This region also
emits strong near-infrared excess that cannot be explained by classical
accretion disk models, which suggests the existence of some unusual dust
distribution or disk shape. The most prevalent explanation to date is the
puffed-up inner disk rim model, where the disk exhibits an optically thin
cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation. The critical
parameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $z_{\rm max}$ relative to
the rim distance from the star $R_{\rm in}$. Observations often require $z_{\rm
max}/R_{\rm in}\gtrsim0.2$ to reproduce the near-infrared excess in the
spectra. We compile a comprehensive list of processes that can shape the inner
disk rim and combine them into a self-consistent model. Two of them, radiation
pressure force and the gas velocity profile, have never been applied in this
context before. The aim was to find the most plausible theoretical values of
$z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}$. The results show that this value is $\lesssim$0.13
for Herbig Ae stars, $\lesssim$0.11 for T Tau stars, and $\lesssim$0.10 for
young brown dwarfs. This is lower than the observational requirements for
Herbig Ae stars. We argue that the same problem exists in T Tau stars as well.
We conclude that the puffed-up inner rim model cannot be the sole explanation

phenomenological equilibrium thermodynamics for single-phase systems in the
absence of chemical reactions and external forces.
  The present approach is similar to that of Callen, who introduces in his
well-known thermodynamics book the basic concepts by means of a few postulates
from which everything else follows. His setting is modified to match the more
fundamental approach based on statistical mechanics. Thermodynamic stability is
derived from kinematical properties of states outside equilibrium by rigorous
mathematical arguments, superseding Callen's informal arguments that depend on
a dynamical assumption close to equilibrium.
  From the formulas provided, it is an easy step to go to various examples and
applications discussed in standard textbooks such as Callen or Reichl. A full
discussion of global equilibrium would also involve the equilibrium treatment
of multiple phases and chemical reactions. Since their discussion offers no new
aspects compared with traditional textbook treatments, they are not treated
here.

fields and applications, provided that we can efficiently assess the
performance of the control applied in candidate systems. That is, we must be
able to determine whether we have implemented a desired gate, and refine
accordingly. Randomized benchmarking reduces the difficulty of this task by
exploiting symmetries in quantum operations.
  Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with
prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy
than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on
state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with
near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data
to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in
the reported fidelities. We also show that our approach is useful for physical
devices by comparing to simulations.
  Our results thus enable the application of randomized benchmarking in new
regimes, and dramatically reduce the experimental effort required to assess
control fidelities in quantum systems. Finally, our work is based on
open-source scientific libraries, and can readily be applied in systems of
interest.

present estimates of habitable zones (HZs) around stars with stellar effective
temperatures in the range 2600 K - 7200 K, for planetary masses between 0.1 ME

scaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet,
our results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones.
Specifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense
atmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward
(~10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse
effect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O
column depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor
completely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge
moves inward (7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to
the competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New,
3-D climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue
that further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions.
Combined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined
estimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step towards a more
comprehensive analysis of HZs.

do not find obvious signatures of interaction or infalling gas at large spatial

dispersion is comparable to the rotation velocity. The rotation amplitude is
estimated to be V_c = 15 +/- 5 km/s. Within the HI radius probed by these
observations, the mass ratio of gas to stars is roughly 2:1, while the ratio of
the total mass to the baryonic mass is ~15:1. We use this information to place
Leo P on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, testing the baryonic content of
cosmic structures in a sparsely populated portion of parameter space that has
hitherto been occupied primarily by dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We detect the
signature of two temperature components in the neutral ISM of Leo P; the cold
and warm components have characteristic velocity widths of 4.2 +/- 0.9 km/s and
10.1 +/- 1.2 km/s, corresponding to kinetic temperatures of ~1100 K and ~6200
K, respectively. The cold HI component is unresolved at a physical resolution
of 200 pc. The highest HI surface densities are observed in close physical
proximity to the single HII region. A comparison of the neutral gas properties
of Leo P with other extremely metal-deficient (XMD) galaxies reveals that Leo P
has the lowest neutral gas mass of any known XMD, and that the dynamical mass
of Leo P is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than any known XMD with

their host halos' specific mass accretion rates (SMARs) strongly constrains how
the galaxies' stellar masses, specific star formation rates, and host halo
masses evolve over cosmic time. This evolutionary constraint provides a simple
way to probe z>8 galaxy populations without direct observations. Tests of the
method with galaxy properties at z=4 successfully reproduce the known evolution
of the stellar mass--halo mass (SMHM) relation, galaxy SSFRs, and the cosmic
star formation rate (CSFR) for 5<z<8. We then predict the continued evolution
of these properties for 8<z<15. In contrast to the non-evolution in the SMHM
relation at z<4, the median galaxy mass at fixed halo mass increases strongly
at z>4. We show that this result is closely linked to the flattening in galaxy
SSFRs at z>2 compared to halo specific mass accretion rates; we expect that
average galaxy SSFRs at fixed stellar mass will continue their mild evolution
to z~15. The expected CSFR shows no breaks or features at z>8.5; this
constrains both reionization and the possibility of a steep falloff in the CSFR

GALEX (UV) surveys we effectively extract about 2,000 galaxy-absorber pairs at
z~0.5 and probe relations between absorption strength and galaxy type, impact
parameter and azimuthal angle. We find that cool gas traced by MgII absorbers
exists around both star-forming and passive galaxies with a similar incidence
rate on scales greater than 100 kpc but each galaxy type exhibits a different
behavior on smaller scales: MgII equivalent width does not correlate with the
presence of passive galaxies whereas stronger MgII absorbers tend to be found
in the vicinity of star-forming galaxies. This effect is preferentially seen
along the minor axis of these galaxies, suggesting that some of the gas is
associated with outflowing material. In contrast, the distribution of cool gas
around passive galaxies is consistent with being isotropic on the same scales.
We quantify the average excess MgII equivalent width $<\delta W_{0}^{\rm
MgII}>$ as a function of galaxy properties and find $<\delta W_0^{\rm
MgII}>\propto SFR^{1.2}, sSFR^{0.5}$ and $M_\ast^{0.4}$ for star-forming
galaxies. This work demonstrates that the dichotomy between star-forming and
passive galaxies is reflected in the CGM traced by low-ionized gas. We also
measure the covering fraction of MgII absorption and find it to be about 2-10
times higher for star-forming galaxies than passive ones within 50 kpc. We
estimate the amount of neutral gas in the halo of $<\log M_\ast/{\rm
M_\odot}>$~10.8 galaxies to be a few x$10^9 \rm M_\odot$ for both types of
galaxies. Finally, we find that correlations between absorbers and sources

clusters. Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics
of the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic perturbations.
The normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is
linearly tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity
and sound waves due to stratification. For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity
waves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential
turbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing
the leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with
isotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations
are then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic
(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the
intermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence
drifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,
the variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number. This
linear relation allows to easily convert between gas motions and ICM
perturbations, which can be exploited by Chandra, XMM data and by the
forthcoming Astro-H. At intermediate and small scales (10-100 kpc), the
turbulent velocities develop a Kolmogorov cascade. The thermodynamic
perturbations act as effective tracers of the velocity field, broadly
consistent with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin advection theory. Thermal
conduction acts to damp the gas fluctuations, washing out the filamentary
structures and steepening the spectrum, while leaving unaltered the velocity
cascade. The ratio of the velocity and density spectrum thus inverts the
downtrend shown by the non-diffusive models, allowing to probe the presence of
significant conductivity in the ICM.

continuum. The perturbative corrections to these are higher Landau level
contributions that break rotational invariance and allow the perturbed states
to adopt the symmetry of the lattice. In the presence of interactions, this
approach allows for the calculation of generalised Haldane pseudopotentials,
and in turn, the many-body properties of the system. The method is sufficiently

velocity of IC1613 O-stars is clearly lower than Milky Way counterparts, but
there is no clear difference between IC1613 and SMC or LMC analogue stars. We

of the ICM using only information on the plasma density fluctuations, which can
be measured today by Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories. We argue that for
relaxed clusters there is a linear relation between the rms density and
velocity fluctuations across a range of scales, from the largest ones, where
motions are dominated by buoyancy, down to small, turbulent scales:
$(\delta\rho_k/\rho)^2 = \eta_1^2 (V_{1,k}/c_s)^2$, where $\delta\rho_k/\rho$
is the spectral amplitude of the density perturbations at wave number $k$,
$V_{1,k}^2=V_k^2/3$ is the mean square component of the velocity field, $c_s$
is the sound speed, and $\eta_1$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity.
Using cosmological simulations of relaxed galaxy clusters, we calibrate this
relation and find $\eta_1\approx 1 \pm 0.3$. We argue that this value is set at
large scales by buoyancy physics, while at small scales the density and
velocity power spectra are proportional because the former are a passive scalar
advected by the latter. This opens an interesting possibility to use gas

monotonously with temperature, whereas it initially decreases in the crossing

Following the conventional logic the source of the asymmetry would vanish in
the latter case. Using non-equilibrium quantum field theory, we analytically
demonstrate that the vanishing of the difference of the effective masses does
however neither imply a suppression nor a strong enhancement of the source for
the lepton asymmetry. In the vicinity of the crossing point the asymmetry
calculated in an (improved) Boltzmann limit develops a spurious peak, which
signals the breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation. In the exact result
this spurious enhancement is compensated by coherent transitions between the
two mass shells. Despite the breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation
off-shell contributions remain negligibly small even at the crossing point.

Doppler shifts due to bulk velocities is comparatively small, since systematic
velocity differences in the cloud are typically smaller than the sound speed.
During the initial collapse phase, the radially averaged escape fraction agrees
relatively well with the fit of Ripamonti & Abel. However, in general it is not
advisable to use a simple density-dependent fitting function, since the escape
fraction depends on many factors and does not capture the suppression of
density perturbations due to the diffusion of radiation. The Sobolev method
overestimates the escape fraction by more than an order of magnitude, since the

detecting roughly 100,000 clusters of galaxies in X-rays. For a precise
cosmological analysis the various galaxy cluster properties need to be measured
with high precision and accuracy. To predict these characteristics of eROSITA
galaxy clusters and to optimise optical follow-up observations, we estimate the
precision and the accuracy with which eROSITA will be able to determine galaxy
cluster temperatures and redshifts from X-ray spectra. Additionally, we present
the total number of clusters for which these two properties will be available

eROSITA will determine cluster temperatures with relative uncertainties of
Delta(T)/T<10% at the 68%-confidence level for clusters up to redshifts of
z~0.16 which corresponds to ~1,670 new clusters with precise properties.
Redshift information itself will become available with a precision of
Delta(z)/(1+z)<10% for clusters up to z~0.45. Additionally, we estimate how the
number of clusters with precise properties increases with a deepening of the
exposure. Furthermore, the biases in the best-fit temperatures as well as in
the estimated uncertainties are quantified and shown to be negligible in the
relevant parameter range in general. For the remaining parameter sets, we
provide correction functions and factors. The eROSITA survey will increase the

test this issue by exploring hard X-ray spectral evolution in four black-hole
X-ray binaries (XRBs) with multiple, quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray
observations. Firstly, we find that hard X-ray photon indices, $\Gamma$, are
anti- and positively correlated to X-ray fluxes when the X-ray flux, $F_{\rm

consistent with prediction of advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and
disk-corona model respectively. Secondly and most importantly, we find that the
radio-X-ray correlations are also clearly different when the X-ray fluxes are
higher and lower than the critical flux that defined by X-ray spectral
evolution. The data points with $F_{\rm 3-9keV}\gtrsim F_{\rm X,crit}$ have a
steeper radio-X-ray correlation ($F_{\rm X}\propto F_{\rm R}^{b}$ and $b\sim
1.1-1.4$), which roughly form the `outliers' track. However, the data points
with anti-correlation of $\Gamma-F_{\rm 3-9keV}$ either stay in the universal
track with $b\sim0.61$ or stay in transition track (from the universal to
`outliers' tracks or vice versa). Therefore, our results support that the

radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and find that their hard X-ray photon

that of `outliers' of XRBs, where both bright AGNs and `outliers' of XRBs have
bolometric Eddington ratios $\gtrsim1%L_{\rm Edd}$ ($L_{\rm Edd}$ is Eddington

a radiatively efficient accretion flow (e.g., disk-corona). Based on these

assumption that the order of the zero is equal to $2$: in other words the
preconditioned matrix sequence $\{{\tau}^{-1}_n(f)T_n(f) \}_n $ has
eigenvalues, which are uniformly away from zero and from infinity. Here we
prove a generalization of the above result when $\theta<2$. Furthermore, by
making use of multiple step preconditioning, we show that the matrix sequences

$m_\theta$ outliers larger than $\beta_\theta$. Such a nice property, already
known only when $\theta$ is an even positive integer greater than 2, is coupled
with the fact that the preconditioned sequence has an eigenvalue cluster at
one, so that the convergence rate of the associated preconditioned conjugate

spectral lines emitted by a hydrogen atom in an external electric field. We
examine the account of the effect in the old quantum theory, which was hailed
as a major success of that theory, from the point of view of wave mechanics.
First, we show how the new quantum mechanics solves a fundamental problem one
runs into in the old quantum theory with the Stark effect. It turns out that,
even without an external field, it depends on the coordinates in which the
quantum conditions are imposed which electron orbits are allowed in a hydrogen
atom. The allowed energy levels and hence the line splittings are independent
of the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the orbits are not. In
the new quantum theory, this worrisome non-uniqueness of orbits turns into the
perfectly innocuous non-uniqueness of bases in Hilbert space. Second, we review
how the so-called WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation method for
solving the Schr\""odinger equation reproduces the quantum conditions of the old
quantum theory amended by some additional half-integer terms. These extra terms
remove the need for some arbitrary extra restrictions on the allowed orbits

inverse Compton (IC) cooling on X-ray emission from magnetically confined wind
shocks (MCWS) in magnetic massive stars with radiatively driven stellar winds.
For the standard dependence of mass loss rate on luminosity $\Mdot \sim L^{1.7}
$, the scaling of IC cooling with $L$ and radiative cooling with $\Mdot$ means
that IC cooling become formally more important for lower luminosity stars.
However, because the sense of the trends is similar, we find the overall effect
of including IC cooling is quite modest. More significantly, for stars with
high enough mass loss to keep the shocks radiative, the MHD simulations
indicate a linear scaling of X-ray luminosity with mass loss rate; but for
lower luminosity stars with weak winds, X-ray emission is reduced and softened
by a {\em shock retreat} resulting from the larger post-shock cooling length,
which within the fixed length of a closed magnetic loop forces the shock back
to lower pre-shock wind speeds. A semi-analytic scaling analysis that accounts
both for the wind magnetic confinement and this shock retreat yields X-ray
luminosities that have a similar scaling trend, but a factor few higher values,
compared to time-averages computed from the MHD simulations. The simulation and
scaling results here thus provide a good basis for interpreting available X-ray
observations from the growing list of massive stars with confirmed large-scale
magnetic fields.

environmental characteristics and chemical reactions affect the HNC/HCN ratio

in static models the H + HNC gas-phase reaction regulates the HNC/HCN ratio

the combinations of H abundance and H + HNC reaction barrier that can explain
the observed HNC/HCN temperature dependence and discuss the implications in

Schwarzschild in 1916 was seen as a great success for the old quantum theory.
Yet, it also revealed some serious limitations of the theory. To recover the
experimentally found line splittings, one had to make some arbitrary
assumptions in addition to the basic quantum conditions to rule out certain
orbits. The calculation of intensities of lines on the basis of Bohr's
correspondence principle likewise required arbitrary additional assumptions.
Finally, the actual orbits predicted by the old quantum theory depend on the
coordinates chosen to impose the quantum conditions. Both Sommerfeld and
Epstein recognized this problem but offered no solution for it. All these
problems were solved in 1926 when Schr\""odinger and Epstein explained the Stark
effect on the basis of the new wave mechanics. The calculations in the two
theories are similar. In particular, both the Schr\""odinger equation in the new
theory and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the old theory are separated in
parabolic coordinates. The new quantum mechanics determines all allowed states
and transitions without any additional assumptions. It also replaced the
ambiguous guidelines based on the correspondence principle for calculating
intensities by the straightforward prescription that intensities are given by
the squares of the matrix elements of position, leading to results that agreed
much better with the experimental data. Finally, the embarrassing
non-uniqueness of orbits in the old quantum theory turned into the innocuous
non-uniqueness of bases of eigenfunctions in wave mechanics. To this day, the
Stark effect is remembered as one of the few qualified successes of the old
quantum theory. We suspect that this is largely because after 1926 it became
just one of the many unqualified successes of the new quantum theory.

elusive. In particular, it is not clear typically how attractors partition
among the three types of orbits: steady state, periodic and chaotic, and how
the dynamical properties change with network's topological characteristics. In
this work, we first investigated these questions in random GRNs with different
network sizes, connectivity, fraction of inhibitory links and transcription

$\mathbb{R}P^n$ of a random homogeneous polynomial $f$ of degree $d$.
Specifically, we consider ""invariant ensembles"", that is Gaussian ensembles of
polynomials that are invariant under an orthogonal change of variables.
  The classification due to E. Kostlan shows that specifying an invariant
ensemble is equivalent to assigning a weight to each eigenspace of the
spherical Laplacian. Fixing $n$, we consider a family of invariant ensembles
(choice of eigenspace weights) depending on the degree $d$. Under a rescaling
assumption on the eigenspace weights (as $d \rightarrow \infty$), we prove that
the order of growth of $\mathbb{E} b_0(X)$ satisfies: $$\mathbb{E}
b_{0}(X)=\Theta\left(\left[ \mathbb{E} b_0(X\cap \mathbb{R}P^1) \right]^{n}

classical problem of M. Kac (1943) on the number of zeros of the random
univariate polynomial $f|_{\mathbb{R}P^1}.$
  The proof requires an upper bound for $\mathbb{E} b_0(X)$, which we obtain by
counting extrema using Random Matrix Theory methods from recent work of the
first author, and it also requires a lower bound, which we obtain by a
modification of the barrier method. We also provide a quantitative upper bound
for the implied constant in the above asymptotic; for the real Fubini-Study

decrease towards more peripheral collisions in the grand canonical approach.

circumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore
restricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept
of finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would
require mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the
number and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital
parameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated
circumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar
neighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a
range of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with
the Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of
binaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic
systems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and
non-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are
compared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting
non-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational
biases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary
planets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the
distributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely
different. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with
the spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be
produced, which we find to be compatible with 9%. Searching for inclined
circumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of known objects
and will test our conclusions. Their existence, or absence, will reveal the
true occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories.

stars, hundreds of them in multi-planet systems. Most of these exoplanets have
been detected by either the transit method or the radial velocity method,
rather than by other methods such as astrometry or direct imaging. Both the
radial velocity and astrometric methods rely upon the reflex motion of the
parent star induced by the gravitational attraction of its planets. However,
this reflex motion is subject to misinterpretation when a star has two or more
planets with the same orbital period. Such co-orbital planets may effectively
""hide"" from detection by current algorithms.
  In principle, any number of planets can share the same orbit; the case where
they all have the same mass has been studied most. Salo and Yoder (A & A 205,
309--327, 1988) have shown that more than 8 planets of equal mass sharing a
circular orbit must be equally spaced for dynamical stability, while fewer than
7 equal-mass planets are stable only in a configuration where all of the
planets remain on the same side of their parent star. For 7 or 8 equal-mass
planets, both configurations are stable.
  By symmetry, it is clear that the equally-spaced systems produce no reflex
motion or radial velocity signal at all in their parent stars. This could lead
to their being overlooked entirely, unless they happen to be detected by the
transit method. It is equally clear that the lopsided systems produce a greater
radial velocity signal than a single such planet would, but a smaller signal
than if all of the planets were combined into one. This could seriously mislead
estimates of exoplanet masses and densities. Transit data and ellipsoidal
(tidal) brightness variations in such systems also are subject to
misinterpretation. This behavior is also representative of more natural
systems, with co-orbital planets of different masses.

alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for finding a solution of
medium accuracy to conic programming problems whose constraints consist of
linear equalities, linear inequalities, a non-polyhedral cone and a polyhedral
cone. For this class of problems, one may apply the directly extended ADMM to
their dual, which can be written in the form of convex programming with four
separable blocks in the objective function and a coupling linear equation
constraint. Indeed, the directly extended ADMM, though may diverge in theory,
often performs much better numerically than many of its variants with
theoretical convergence guarantee. Ideally, one should find a convergent
variant which is at least as efficient as the directly extended ADMM in
practice. We achieve this goal by designing a convergent semi-proximal ADMM
(called sPADMM3c for convenience) for convex programming problems having three
separable blocks in the objective function with the third part being linear. At
each iteration, the proposed sPADMM3c takes one special block coordinate
descent (BCD) cycle with the order $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow
3$, instead of the usual $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$ Gauss-Seidel BCD cycle
used in the non-convergent directly extended $3$-block ADMM, for updating the
variable blocks. Our extensive numerical tests on the important class of doubly
non-negative semidefinite programming (SDP) problems with linear equality
and/or inequality constraints demonstrate that our convergent method is at
least $20%$ faster than the directly extended ADMM with unit step-length for
the vast majority of about $550$ large scale problems tested.

calculated in nuclear matter from the chiral N3LO two-nucleon forces (2NF) is
close to that from the Bonn-B 2NF. Because the Melbourne group have already
developed a practical g-matrix interaction by localizing the nonlocal g-matrix

first attempt to study the 3NF effects, by modifying the local Melbourne
g-matrix according to the difference between the g-matrices of the chiral 2NF
and 2NF+3NF. For nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering, the 3NF corrections make
the folding potential less attractive and more absorptive. The latter novel
effect is due to the enhanced tensor correlations in triplet channels. These
changes reduce the differential cross section at the middle and large angles,
improving the agreement with the experimental data for 16O-16O scattering at 70

function type variation with unit number. When all the units are driven by the
weak periodic force and noise oscillatory variation of response amplitude with

from short coherence times due to interactions with their solid-state
environment. The outstanding challenge is to engineer the environment so that
it minimally affects the qubit, but still allows qubit control and scalability.
Here we demonstrate a long-lived single-electron spin qubit in a Si/SiGe
quantum dot with all-electrical two-axis control. The spin is driven by
resonant microwave electric fields in a transverse magnetic field gradient from
a local micromagnet, and the spin state is read out in single-shot mode.
Electron spin resonance occurs at two closely spaced frequencies, which we
attribute to two valley states. Thanks to the weak hyperfine coupling in
silicon, Ramsey and Hahn echo decay timescales of 1us and 40us, respectively,
are observed. This is almost two orders of magnitude longer than the intrinsic
timescales in III-V quantum dots, while gate operation times are comparable to
those achieved in GaAs. This places the single-qubit rotations in the
fault-tolerant regime and strongly raises the prospects of quantum information
processing based on quantum dots.

a cylindrical Hele-Shaw cell that is laterally periodic. This system possesses
spatial translational symmetry in the lateral direction owing to the
cylindrical shape as well as temporal translational symmetry. Oscillatory
convection in this system is described by a limit-torus solution that possesses
two phase modes; one is a spatial phase and the other is a temporal phase. The
spatial and temporal phases indicate the position and oscillation of the
convection, respectively. The theory developed in this paper can be considered
as a phase reduction method for limit-torus solutions in infinite-dimensional
dynamical systems, namely, limit-torus solutions to partial differential
equations representing oscillatory convection with a spatially translational
mode. We derive the phase sensitivity functions for spatial and temporal
phases; these functions quantify the phase responses of the oscillatory
convection to weak perturbations applied at each spatial point. Using the phase
sensitivity functions, we characterize the spatiotemporal phase responses of
oscillatory convection to weak spatial stimuli and analyze the spatiotemporal
phase synchronization between weakly coupled systems of oscillatory convection.

characterization of Bayes-Nash equilibria of such games, in this work we look
at strategic interactions from an evolutionary perspective. Starting from a
recent mean-field analysis of the evolutionary dynamics in these games, here we
present results of numerical simulations designed to find out whether Nash
equilibria are accessible by adaptation of players' strategies, and in general
to find the attractors of the evolution. Simulations allow us to go beyond a
global characterization of the cooperativeness of the equilibria and probe into
the individual behavior. We find that when players imitate each other, the
evolution does not reach Nash equilibria and, worse, leads to very unfavorable
states in terms of welfare. On the contrary, when players update their behavior
rationally, they self-organize into a rich variety of Nash equilibria, where
individual behavior and payoffs are shaped by the nature of the game, the
structure of the social network and the players' position within the topology.
Our results allow us to assess the validity of the mean-field approaches and
also show qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions for equilibria in
the context of one-shot games under incomplete information.

role of water in modifying the microscopic interactions characterizing the
optical response of butyl-ammonium nitrate (BAN) water solutions. Raman
spectra, dominated by the signal from the protic ionic liquid, were collected
as a function of the water content, and the corresponding spatial organization
of the ionic couples, as well as their local arrangement with water molecules,
was studied exploiting classical molecular dynamics calculations. High quality
spectroscopic data, combined with a careful analysis, revealed that water
affects the vibrational spectrum BAN in solution: as the water concentration is
increased, peaks assigned to stretching modes show a frequency hardening
together with a shape narrowing, whereas the opposite behavior is observed for
peaks assigned to bending modes. Calculation results clearly show a nanometric
spatial organization of the ionic couples that is not destroyed on increasing
the water content at least within an intermediate range. Our combined results
show indeed that small water concentrations even increase the local order.
Water molecules are located among ionic couples and are closer to the anion
than the cation, as confirmed by the computation of the number of H-bonds which
is greater for water-anion than for water-cation. The whole results set thus
clarifies the microscopic scenario of the BAN-water interaction and underlines
the main role of the extended hydrogen bond network among water molecules and
nitrate anions.

tasks in the given order by $k$ agents under the positional cost model. The
cost to run a task not only depends on the intrinsic cost of the task itself,
but also monotonically related to the position this task is in the working list
of the agent assigned. Such a positional effect can naturally arise from the
classic sum-of-completion-time minimization problems, and is also well
motivated by the varying efficiency when an agent works in reality (such as due
to the learning effects or deteriorating effects). Also, it can be seen as a
deterministic variant of the classic Baysian sequential decision making
problems. This paper presents a simple and practical algorithm that runs in
$O(k^2 n)$ time and minimizes the total cost of any problem instance consisting
of two task types. The algorithm works by making greedy decision for each task
sequentially based on some stopping thresholds in a ""greedy-like"" allocation
simulation -- a working style coinciding with Gittins' optimal-stopping based
algorithm for the classic Baysian multi-armed bandit problem.

precise temperatures and ionization ages of the plasma, which are an indication
of the interaction history of the remnant with the presumed cavity. We find
that the spectra are well fitted by two non-equilibrium ionization models,
which enables us to constrain the properties of the ejecta and interstellar
matter plasma. Furthermore, we performed a principal component analysis on EPIC
MOS and pn data to find regions with particular spectral properties. We present
evidence that the shocked ejecta, emitting Fe-K and Si line emission, are
confined to a shell of approximately 2 pc width with an oblate spheroidal
morphology. Using detailed hydrodynamical simulations, we show that general
dynamical and emission properties at different portions of the remnant can be
well-reproduced by a type Ia supernova that exploded in a non-spherically
symmetric wind-blown cavity. We also show that this cavity can be created using
general wind properties for a single degenerate system. Our data and
simulations provide further evidence that RCW 86 is indeed the remnant of SN
185, and is the likely result of a type Ia explosion of single degenerate
origin.

equations, as they fundamentally cannot exist in any real system and, hence,
cannot be examined experimentally in a direct fashion. One of the most
celebrated equations that allows unphysical solutions is the relativistic
Majorana equation\cite{Majorana} which might describe neutrinos and other
exotic particles beyond the Standard Model. The equation's physical solutions,
the Majorana fermions, are predicted to be their own anti-particles and as a
consequence they have to be neutrally charged; the charged version however
(called Majoranon) is, due to charge non-conservation, unphysical and cannot
exist. On the other hand, charge conservation violation has been contemplated
in alternative theories associated with higher spacetime dimensions or a
non-vanishing photon mass; theories whose exotic nature makes experimental
testing with current technology an impossible task. In our work, we present an
experimental scheme based on optics with which we simulate the dynamics of a
Majoranon, involving the implementation of unphysical charge conjugation and
complex conjugation. We show that the internal dynamics of the Majoranon is
fundamentally different from that of its close cousin, the Dirac particle, to
illustrate the nature of the unphysical operations. For this we exploit the
fact that in quantum mechanics the wave function itself is not a measurable
quantity. Therefore, wave functions of real physical particles, in our case
Dirac particles with opposite masses, can be superposed to a wave function of
an unphysical particle, the Majoranon. Our results open a new front in the
field of quantum simulations of exotic phenomena, with possible applications in
condensed matter physics, topological quantum computing, and testing theories
within and beyond the Standard Model with existing technology.

  Path",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A dynamic path network is an undirected path with evacuees situated at each
vertex. To evacuate the path, evacuees travel towards a designated sink
(doorway) to exit. Each edge has a capacity, the number of evacuees that can
enter the edge in unit time. Congestion occurs if an evacuee has to wait at a
vertex for other evacuees to leave first. The basic problem is to place k sinks
on the line, with an associated evacuation strategy, so as to minimize the
total time needed to evacuate everyone. The minmax-regret version introduces
uncertainty into the input, with the number of evacuees at vertices only being
specified to within a range. The problem is to find a universal solution whose
regret (difference from optimal for a given input) is minimized over all legal
inputs. The previously best known algorithms for the minmax regret version
problem ran in time exponential in k. In this paper, we derive new prop- erties
of solutions that yield the first polynomial time algorithms for solving the

the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) - the only

graphene sample between two other (protective) graphene sheets allows
non-invasive HRTEM imaging and reliable identification of atomic-scale defects.
Using this simple technique, we demonstrate that proton irradiation of graphene
produces reconstructed monovacancies, which explains the profound effect that
such defects have on magnetic and transport properties. This finding resolves
the existing uncertainty with regard to the effect of ion irradiation on the
electronic structure of graphene.

formed in galaxies. We investigate this problem by adopting a theoretical model
developed for understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets. Our model
is constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core
accretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly
relates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We
statistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the
orbital radius ($<R_{rapid}>$) within which gas accretion becomes efficient
enough to form Jovian planets. The three characteristic exoplanetary
populations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around
1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the
PFFs as well as $<R_{rapid}>$ for the three different populations as a function
of metallicity ($-2 \leq$[Fe/H]$\leq -0.6$). We show that the total PFFs
increase steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core
accretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the
population of the low-mass planets dominates over the Jovian planets. The
Jovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]-1. We find that the hot
Jupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the
radially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more
effective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores.
The PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around
[Fe/H]-0.7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian
planets is [Fe/H]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of
$<R_{rapid}>$ between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets. The comparison
intrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them.

protostellar outflows. Such high-mass outflows are not simply scaled-up
versions of their lower-mass counterparts, since observations suggest that the
collimation degree degrades with stellar mass. Theoretically, the origins of
massive outflows remain open to question because radiative feedback and
fragmentation of the accretion flow around the most massive stars, with M > 15
M_Sun, may impede the driving of magnetic disk winds. We here present a
three-dimensional simulation of the early stages of core fragmentation and
massive star formation that includes a subgrid-scale model for protostellar
outflows. We find that stars that form in a common accretion flow tend to have
aligned outflow axes, so that the individual jets of multiple stars can combine
to form a collective outflow. We compare our simulation to observations with
synthetic H_2 and CO observations and find that the morphology and kinematics
of such a collective outflow resembles some observed massive outflows, such as
Cepheus A and DR 21. We finally compare physical quantities derived from
simulated observations of our models to the actual values in the models to
examine the reliability of standard methods for deriving physical quantities,
demonstrating that those methods indeed recover the actual values to within a

population of post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs). Since the ensemble
properties of this population carries important information about the
characteristics of the common-envelope (CE) phase, it deserves close scrutiny.
However, most population synthesis studies do not fully take into account the
effects of the observational selection biases of the samples used to compare
with the theoretical simulations. Here we present the results of a set of
detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the population of WD+MS binaries in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. We used up-to-date stellar
evolutionary models, a complete treatment of the Roche lobe overflow episode,
and a full implementation of the orbital evolution of the binary systems.
Moreover, in our treatment we took into account the selection criteria and all
the known observational biases. Our population synthesis study allowed us to
make a meaningful comparison with the available observational data. In
particular, we examined the CE efficiency, the possible contribution of
internal energy, and the initial mass ratio distribution (IMRD) of the binary
systems. We found that our simulations correctly reproduce the properties of
the observed distribution of WD+MS PCEBs. In particular, we found that once the
observational biases are carefully taken into account, the distribution of
orbital periods and of masses of the WD and MS stars can be correctly
reproduced for several choices of the free parameters and different IMRDs,
although models in which a moderate fraction (<=10%) of the internal energy is
used to eject the CE and in which a low value of CE efficiency is used (<=0.3)
seem to fit better the observational data. We also found that systems with
He-core WDs are over-represented in the observed sample, due to selection
effects.

transformation is typically taken to achieve approximate normality and
stabilize the variance. However, often the interest is predicting individual
values or means of the variable in the original scale. Back transformation of
predicted values introduces a non-negligible bias. Moreover, assessing the
uncertainty of the actual predictor is not straightforward. In this paper, a
nested error model for the log transformation of the target variable is
considered. Nested error models are widely used for estimation of means in
subpopulations with small sample sizes (small areas), by linking all the areas
through common parameters. These common parameters are estimated using the
overall set of sample data, which leads to much more efficient small area
estimators. Analytical expressions for the best predictors of individual values
of the original variable and of small area means are obtained under the nested
error model with log transformation of the target variable. Empirical best
predictors are defined by estimating the unknown model parameters in the best
predictors. Exact mean squared errors of the best predictors and second order
approximations to the mean squared errors of the empirical best predictors are
derived. Mean squared error estimators that are second order correct are also
obtained. An example with Mexican data on living conditions illustrates the
procedures.

two-humped barrier structure. At large deformations beyond the second barrier
the occurrence of a third one was predicted by Mic-Mac model calculations in
the 1970s, but contradictory results were later reported. In this paper,
triple-humped barriers in actinide nuclei are investigated with covariant
density functional theory (CDFT). Calculations are performed using the
multidimensionally-constrained relativistic mean field (MDC-RMF) model, with
functionals PC-PK1 and DD-ME2. Pairing correlations are treated in the BCS
approximation with a separable pairing force of finite range. Two-dimensional
PES's of $^{226,228,230,232}$Th and $^{232,234,236,238}$U are mapped and the
third minima on these surfaces are located. Then one-dimensional potential
energy curves along the fission path are analyzed in detail and the energies of
the second barrier, the third minimum, and the third barrier are determined.
DD-ME2 predicts the occurrence of a third barrier in all Th nuclei and
$^{238}$U. The third minima in $^{230,232}$Th are very shallow, whereas those
in $^{226,228}$Th and $^{238}$U are quite prominent. With PC-PK1 a third
barrier is found only in $^{226,228,230}$Th. Single-nucleon levels around the
Fermi surface are analyzed in $^{226}$Th, and it is found that the formation of
the third minimum is mainly due to the $Z=90$ proton energy gap at $\beta_{20}
\approx 1.5$ and $\beta_{30} \approx 0.7$. The possible occurrence of a third
barrier in actinide nuclei depends on the effective interaction used in
multidimensional CDFT calculations. More pronounced minima are predicted by the
DD-ME2 functional, as compared to the functional PC-PK1. The depth of the third
well in Th isotopes decreases with increasing neutron number. The origin of the
third minimum is due to the proton $Z=90$ shell gap at relevant deformations.

mass media, attempt to convert ignorants and stiflers into spreaders. We show
the existence of a solution to the optimal control problem when the campaigning
incurs non-linear costs under the isoperimetric budget constraint. The solution
employs Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a modified version of forward
backward sweep technique for numerical computation to accommodate the
isoperimetric budget constraint. The techniques developed in this paper are
general and can be applied to similar optimal control problems in other areas.
  We have allowed the spreading rate of the information epidemic to vary over
the campaign duration to model practical situations when the interest level of
the population in the subject of the campaign changes with time. The shape of
the optimal control signal is studied for different model parameters and
spreading rate profiles. We have also studied the variation of the optimal
campaigning costs with respect to various model parameters. Results indicate
that, for some model parameters, significant improvements can be achieved by
the optimal strategy compared to the static control strategy. The static
strategy respects the same budget constraint as the optimal strategy and has a
constant value throughout the campaign horizon. This work finds application in
election and social awareness campaigns, product advertising, movie promotion

sensing of moving objects. However, determining the direction of motion is

interferometric setup which only provides an absolute value of the frequency
shift. Here, we put forward a novel method that addresses this issue. It uses
dynamic control of the phase in the transverse plane of the structured light
beam so that the direction of the particles' movement can be deduced. This is
done by noting the change in the magnitude of the frequency shift as the
transverse phase of the structured light is moved appropriately. We demonstrate
our method with rotating micro-particles that are illuminated by a
Laguerre-Gaussian beam with a rotating phase about its propagation axis. Our
method, which only requires a dynamically configurable optical beam generator,
can easily be used with other types of motion by appropriate engineering and
dynamic modulation of the phase of the light beam.

processes occurring within dense plasmas. Several theoretical models have been
developed to describe the IPD effect, with frequently discrepant predictions.
Only recently, first experiments on IPD in Al plasma have been performed with
an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL), where their results were found to be in

orbital angular momenta (AM) of an electromagnetic field in free space. While
the spin and orbital AM of light are not separately-meaningful physical
quantities in orthodox quantum mechanics or classical field theory, these
quantities are routinely measured and used for applications in optics. A
meaningful quantum description of the spin and orbital AM of light was recently
provided by several authors, which describes separately conserved and
measurable integral values of these quantities. However, the electromagnetic
field theory still lacks corresponding locally-conserved spin and orbital AM
currents. In this paper, we construct these missing spin and orbital AM
densities and fluxes that satisfy the proper continuity equations. We show that
these are physically measurable and conserved quantities. These are, however,
not Lorentz-covariant, so only make sense in the single laboratory reference
frame of the measurement probe. The fluxes we derive improve the canonical
(non-conserved) spin and orbital AM fluxes, and include a `spin-orbit' term
that describes the spin-orbit interaction effects observed in nonparaxial
optical fields. We also consider both standard and dual-symmetric versions of
the electromagnetic field theory. Applying the general theory to nonparaxial
optical vortex beams validates our results and allows us to discriminate
between earlier approaches to the problem. Our treatment yields the complete

of the Kitaev limit -- a gapless phase in the vicinity of spatially isotropic

$M$, which detects its Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory metric and its graded dimension.
Therefore we construct self-adjoint horizontal Dirac operators $D^H$ and show
that each horizontal Dirac operator detects the metric via Connes' formula, but
we also find that in no case these operators are hypoelliptic, which means they
fail to have a compact resolvent.
  First we consider an example on compact Carnot nilmanifolds in detail, where
we present a construction for a horizontal Dirac operator arising via pullback
from the Dirac operator on the torus. Following an approach by Christian B\""ar
to decompose the horizontal Clifford bundle, we detect that this operator has
an infinite dimensional kernel. But in spite of this, in the case of Heisenberg
nilmanifolds we will be able to discover the graded dimension from the
asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of this horizontal Dirac operator.
Afterwards we turn to the general case, showing that any horizontal Dirac
operator fails to be hypoelliptic. Doing this, we develop a criterion from
which hypoellipticity of certain graded differential operators can be excluded
by considering the situation on a Heisenberg manifold, for which a complete
characterization of hypoellipticity in known by the Rockland condition.
  Finally, we show how spectral triples can be constructed from horizontal
Laplacians via the Heisenberg pseudodifferential calculus developed by Richard
Beals and Peter Greiner. We suggest a few of these constructions, and discuss
under which assumptions it may be possible to get an equivalent metric to the
Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory metric from these operators. In addition, we mention a
formula by which the Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory metric can be detected from
arbitrary horizontal Laplacians.

and charged (Kerr--Newman) black hole is always strictly regular, a
perturbation in the gravitational or the electromagnetic field generally leads
to chaos. The transition from regular to chaotic dynamics is relatively gradual
if the system preserves axial symmetry, whereas non-axisymmetry induces chaos
more efficiently. Here we study the development of chaos in an oblique
(electro-vacuum) magnetosphere of a magnetized black hole. Besides the strong
gravity of the massive source represented by the Kerr metric we consider the
presence of a weak, ordered, large-scale magnetic field. An axially-symmetric
model consisting of a rotating black hole embedded in an aligned magnetic field
is generalized by allowing an oblique direction of the field having a general
inclination, with respect to the rotation axis of the system. The inclination
of the field acts as an additional perturbation to the motion of charged
particles as it breaks the axial symmetry of the system and cancels the related
integral of motion. The axial component of angular momentum is no longer
conserved and the resulting system thus has three degrees of freedom. Our
primary concern within this contribution is to find out how sensitive the
system of bound particles is to the inclination of the field. We employ the
method of the maximal Lyapunov exponent to distinguish between regular and
chaotic orbits and to quantify their chaoticity. We find that even a small
misalignment induces chaotic motion.

reinforced through the evolution, with the R-parity violating couplings
exhibiting infrared fixed points. Intriguingly, we also find that if holomorphy
is imposed on MFV at some scale, it is preserved by the RG evolution.
Furthermore, low-scale holomorphy is a powerful infrared attractor for a large
class of non-holomorphic scenarios. Therefore, supersymmetry with minimally
flavor violating baryon number violation at the low scale, especially in the
holomorphic case but not only, is viable and resilient under the RG evolution,
and should constitute a leading contender for the physics beyond the Standard

follows.
  Suppose that two closed convex surfaces intersect with constant angle along a

foliations of the two surfaces along the curve are either both orientable, or
both non-orientable.
  We prove this by characterizing the constant angle intersection of two

hypersurface in the space of oriented lines. The surface is Lagrangian, while
the hypersurface is null, with respect to the canonical neutral Kaehler

two surfaces along the intersection curve in Euclidean space, which yields the
result.

in order to efficiently serve a set of requests that arrive in an online
fashion. More formally, there is a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $k$ mobile
servers that are placed at some of the nodes. Each node can potentially host
several servers and the servers can be moved between the nodes. There are
requests $1,2,\ldots$ that are adversarially issued at nodes one at a time. An
issued request at time $t$ needs to be served at all times $t' \geq t$. The
cost for serving the requests is a function of the number of servers and
requests at the different nodes. The requirements on how to serve the requests
are governed by two parameters $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta\geq 0$. An algorithm
needs to guarantee at all times that the total service cost remains within a
multiplicative factor of $\alpha$ and an additive term $\beta$ of the current

the total number of server movements. We show that in this case for every $k$,
the competitive ratio of every deterministic online algorithm needs to be at

objective to also include the current service cost. We give almost tight bounds
on the competitive ratio of the online problem where one needs to minimize the

particular, we show that at the cost of an additional additive term which is
roughly linear in $k$, it is possible to achieve a multiplicative competitive

around a quarter of the entire sky. Using observations of the Si III/Si II

total mass (atomic plus ionized) of the Magellanic System is ~2.0 billion solar
masses, with the ionized gas contributing over twice as much mass as the atomic
gas. This is larger than the current-day interstellar H I mass of both
Magellanic Clouds combined, indicating that they have lost most of their
initial gas mass. If the gas in the Magellanic System survives to reach the
Galactic disk over its inflow time of ~0.5-1.5 Gyr, it will represent an
average inflow rate of ~3.7-6.7 solar masses per year, potentially raising the
Galactic star formation rate. However, multiple signs of an evaporative
interaction with the hot Galactic corona indicate that the Stream may not

solving these subsystems and thus reducing the number of states, we can combine
the solutions to obtain all fixed points of the given network. This approach
does not depend on other algorithms and it is straightforward and easy to
implement. We show that our method can handle large size Boolean networks, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by using MAPLE to compute the fixed points of
Boolean networks with hundreds of nodes and thousands of interactions.

There has been much recent work aimed at understanding the dynamics of such

is required for multisite phosphorylation. In particular, such systems admit

that in contrast with distributive systems, processive systems modeled with

attractor. Additionally, we obtain a monomial parametrization of the steady

oligopoly with strategic producers possessing private information (private

  Inelasticity of demand is a main difficulty in electricity markets which can
potentially result in market failure and high prices. We consider demand to be
inelastic.
  We propose a market mechanism that has the following features. (F1) It is
individually rational. (F2) It is budget balanced. (F3) It is price efficient,
that is, at equilibrium the price of electricity is equal to the marginal cost
of production. (F4) The energy production profile corresponding to every
non-zero Nash equilibrium of the game induced by the mechanism is a solution of
the corresponding centralized problem where the objective is the maximization
of the sum of the producers' and consumers' utilities.

the point of view that the spinors describe the state of a massive particle
carrying two qubits of information: helicity and intrinsic parity. We show that
the density matrix for a gas of free fermions, in thermal equilibrium,
correlates helicity and intrinsic parity. Our results introduce the basic
elements for discussing the spin-parity correlation for a Fermi gas: (1) at the
ultra-relativistic domains, when the temperature is quite high, $T > 10^{10}\
K$, the fermions have no definite intrinsic parity (50% : 50%), which is
maximally correlated with the helicity; (2) at very low temperature, $T \approx
3 \ K$, a unique parity dominates (conventionally chosen positive), by
$10^{20}$ to $1$, while the helicity goes into a mixed state for spin up and
down, and the quantum correlation decoheres. For the anti-fermions we get the
opposite behavior. In the framework of quantum information, our result could be
considered as a plausible explanation of why we do accept, as a fact
(consistent with the experimental observation), that fermions (and
anti-fermions), in our present epoch of a cool universe, have a unique
intrinsic parity. The framework for constructing spin-parity entangled states
is established.

parameter. The negative contributions coming from direct corrections, i.e. the
corrections associated to effects of new physics in the fermionic sector, can
be used to eliminate unwanted positive oblique contributions to $S$. By means
of such an ideal cancellation among oblique and direct corrections the
electroweak physics can be made insensitive to custodial new physics. The
Lagrangian analysis of the ideal cancellation reveals a possible sizable
redefinition of the effective electroweak energy scale with respect to models
with only oblique corrections. We then infer from general principles the full
expression for the effective custodial operator responsible in the gauge sector
for the contribution to $S$. We show that the ideal cancellation exactly
eliminates all the custodial corrections, including those in the non-abelian
and longitudinal terms. Indeed, provided redefinitions of the physical
parameters, the standard model Lagrangian can be equivalently defined modulo
custodial corrections in the gauge and fermionic sectors. Thus the ideal
cancellation can be regarded as an effective symmetry. Finally we investigate
the theoretical origin of this effective symmetry in terms of the effective
gauge structure induced by custodial new physics.

is shown that negative energy refraction is accompanied by positive
phase-velocity refraction and positive energy refraction is accompanied by
negative phase-velocity refraction, and that, this happens over a broad range
of frequencies. The composite's unit cell may consist of any number of layers
of any variable mass-density and elastic shear modulus (with large
discontinuities).
  Explicit series expressions for displacement, velocity, strain and stress
components, and energy-flux fields are given, and group-velocity vector is
calculated. The approach is based on a mixed variational principle where the
displacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to
arbitrary variation. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby
ensuring the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational
method yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode
shapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of
frequency bands.
  The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit
cell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that on their second
frequency pass-bands, only the components of the phase and group velocities
normal to the layers are antiparallel, while the components along the layers
are parallel. Therefore, both the two-phase and the three-phase composites
display negative energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction and
positive phase-velocity refraction with negative energy refraction, depending
on how the composite is interfaced with a homogeneous solid.
  The presented method is applicable and effective also when some or all of the
layers in a unit cell have spatially varying properties.

a primitive root modulo $p$. We also make related observations on quadratic
nonresidues modulo primes and primitive prime divisors of some combinatorial
sequences. For example, based on heuristic arguments we conjecture that for any
prime $p>3$ there exists a Fibonacci number $F_k<p/2$ which is a quadratic
nonresidue modulo $p$; this implies that there is a deterministic polynomial
time algorithm to find square roots of quadratic residues modulo a prime $p>3$.

non-equilibrium stochastic processes, modeled via chemical master equation, in
the weak-noise limit. Using the Poisson representation approach and applying
the large-deviation principle we first solve the master equation. Then we use
the notion of the non-equilibrium free energy to derive an integral fluctuation
relation for nonlinear non-equilibrium systems under feedback control. We point
out that the free energy as well as some functionals can serve as
non-equilibrium Lyapunov function which has an important property to decay to
its minimal value monotonously at all times. The Poisson representation
technique is illustrated via exact stochastic treatment of biophysical
processes, such as bacterial chemosensing and molecular evolution.

nanoclusters (Inn, n= 3 to 10) to explore the relative stability among their
different isomers and interaction with H2. Geometry optimizations starting from
initial candidate geometries were performed for each cluster size, so as to
determine a few low energy isomers for each size. Clusters with planar
configuration and high symmetry are found to be more stable. For n=8 there
comes transition from 2D to 3D structures, which formed by stacking of planar
rings are most stable. Energetically favorable isomers of indium nanoclusters
for each size were considered to get H2 adsorbed. In general H2 interaction
with these clusters is week but with odd index i.e. 5, 7 and 9 is significant.
Indium nanotube also indicates H2 adsorption but Eads increases many folds on
introduction of defect in the tube. On basis of these DFT studies we propose
indium nanotubes and clusters of particular size appear to be good candidate
for hydrogen storage materials.
