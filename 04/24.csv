F-thresholds) of homogeneous polynomials in two variables over a field of
characteristic p>0. Passing to a field extension, we factor such a polynomial
into a product of powers of pairwise prime linear forms, and to this collection
of linear forms we associate a special type of function called a syzygy gap
fractal. We use this syzygy gap fractal to study, at once, the collection of
all F-pure thresholds of all polynomials constructed with the same fixed linear
forms. This allows us to describe the structure of the denominator of such an
F-pure threshold, showing in particular that whenever the F-pure threshold
differs from its expected value its denominator is a multiple of p. This
answers a question of Schwede in the two-variable homogeneous case. In
addition, our methods give an algorithm to compute F-pure thresholds of
homogenous polynomials in two variables.

more closely connected to one another than to the rest of the graph. While
there are a variety of metrics that can be used to specify the quality of a
given community, one common theme is that flows tend to stay within
communities. Hence, we expect cycles to play an important role in community
detection. For undirected graphs, the importance of triangles -- an undirected
3-cycle -- has been known for a long time and can be used to improve community
detection. In directed graphs, the situation is more nuanced. The smallest
cycle is simply two nodes with a reciprocal connection, and using information
about reciprocation has proven to improve community detection. Our new idea is
based on the four types of directed triangles that contain cycles. To identify
communities in directed networks, then, we propose an undirected edge-weighting
scheme based on the type of the directed triangles in which edges are involved.
We also propose a new metric on quality of the communities that is based on the
number of 3-cycles that are split across communities. To demonstrate the impact
of our new weighting, we use the standard METIS graph partitioning tool to
determine communities and show experimentally that the resulting communities
result in fewer 3-cycles being cut. The magnitude of the effect varies between
a 10 and 50% reduction, and we also find evidence that this weighting scheme
improves a task where plausible ground-truth communities are known.

of connected graphs on $[n]$ with $m$ edges, whenever $n$ and the nullity
$m-n+1$ tend to infinity. Asymptotic formulae for the number of connected
$r$-uniform hypergraphs on $[n]$ with $m$ edges and so nullity $t=(r-1)m-n+1$
were proved by Karo\'nski and \L uczak for the case $t=o(\log n/\log\log n)$,
and Behrisch, Coja-Oghlan and Kang for $t=\Theta(n)$. Here we prove such a
formula for any $r\ge 3$ fixed, and any $t=t(n)$ satisfying $t=o(n)$ and
$t\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. This leaves open only the (much simpler) case
$t/n\to\infty$, which we will consider in future work. ( arXiv:1511.04739 )
  Our approach is probabilistic. Let $H^r_{n,p}$ denote the random $r$-uniform
hypergraph on $[n]$ in which each edge is present independently with
probability $p$. Let $L_1$ and $M_1$ be the numbers of vertices and edges in
the largest component of $H^r_{n,p}$. We prove a local limit theorem giving an
asymptotic formula for the probability that $L_1$ and $M_1$ take any given pair
of values within the `typical' range, for any $p=p(n)$ in the supercritical
regime, i.e., when $p=p(n)=(1+\epsilon(n))(r-2)!n^{-r+1}$ where
$\epsilon^3n\to\infty$ and $\epsilon\to 0$; our enumerative result then follows
easily.
  Taking as a starting point the recent joint central limit theorem for $L_1$
and $M_1$, we use smoothing techniques to show that `nearby' pairs of values
arise with about the same probability, leading to the local limit theorem.
Behrisch et al used similar ideas in a very different way, that does not seem
to work in our setting.
  Independently, Sato and Wormald have recently proved the special case $r=3$,
with an additional restriction on $t$. They use complementary, more enumerative
methods, which seem to have a more limited scope, but to give additional
information when they do work.

surface layers since 1996 and find systematic and substantial variations. In
general the meridional flow speed is fast at cycle minima and slow at cycle
maxima. We find that these systematic variations are characterized by a
weakening of the meridional flow on the poleward sides of the active (sunspot)
latitudes. This can be interpreted as a inflow toward the sunspot zones
superimposed on a more general poleward meridional flow profile. We also find
variations in the meridional flow which vary from cycle-to-cycle. The
meridional flow was slower at both the minimum and maximum of cycle 23 compared
to similar phases of cycles 21, 22, and 24. Models of the magnetic flux
transport by a variable meridional flow suggest that it can significantly
modulate the size and timing of the following sunspot cycle through its impact
on the Sun's polar magnetic fields. We suggest that the meridional flow
variations observed in cycle 23 contributed to the weak polar fields at the end
of the cycle which then produced a weak cycle 24 and the extraordinary cycle
23/24 minimum.

proposed algorithms to solve PTGs with nonnegative prices under certain

a justification for such a restriction by showing the undecidability of the

be in polynomial time, however the current best known algorithm, by Hansen,
Ibsen-Jensen, and Miltersen, is exponential. We extend this picture by studying
PTGs with both negative and positive prices. We refine the undecidability

several variants of optimal reachability cost objectives including reachability
cost, time-bounded reachability cost, and repeated reachability cost

extend existing point-based value iteration techniques to the reachability

consider classical hypotheses for the evolution of restraint. Prudent predation
and bet-hedging fail as explanations because the wasp lives as a large
well-mixed population. Also, we find no individual benefits to the parasitoid
of developing in a sparsely parasitized host nest. However an optimal foraging

make dark matter sufficiently self-interacting to have an impact on galactic

dark matter scenario. Even more importantly it leads to a strongly
self-interacting plasma of sterile neutrinos and pseudoscalars at late times

more than half a century. If it is real it could help to explain some puzzling
features of the cosmic ray flux: its small radial gradient, nearly perfect
isotropy and the low level of the fine structure in the energy spectra of the
various particles. All these features could be understood if: (a) the Halo has
a big size (b) cosmic rays in the Halo have a unform spatial distribution and
(c) the cosmic ray density in the Halo is comparable or even higher than that
in the Galactic Disk. The main topic of the paper concerns the present status
of the anisotropy and a model for its formation. In our model the extremely
small amplitude of the dipole anisotropy is due to the dilution of the
anisotropy in the Disk by the dominating isotropic cosmic rays from the Halo.
Some minor deviations from complete isotropy in the sub-PeV and PeV energy
regions point out to the possible contribution of the Single Source with the
phase of its first harmonic opposite to the phase produced by the Disk.

described by resonant scattering between half-integer spin conduction electrons

origin of hastatic order, identifying it as a fractionalization of three body
bound-states into integer spin fermions and half-integer spin bosons. After

shock waves that sweep over molecular clouds. Because these shocks will likely
contain processed elements, triggered star formation has been proposed as an
explanation for short lived radioactive isotopes (SLRI) in the Solar System.
Previous studies have tracked the triggering event to the earliest phases of
collapse and have focused on the shock properties required for both successful
star formation and mixing of SLRI's. In this paper, we use Adaptive Mesh
Refinement (AMR) simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate the
full collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere
subjected to a shock and post-shock wind. We track the flow of the cloud
material after a star (a sink particle) has formed. For non-rotating clouds we
find robust triggered collapse and little bound circumstellar material
remaining around the post-shock collapsed core. When we add initial cloud
rotation we observe the formation of disks around the collapsed core which then
interact with the post-shock flow. Our results indicate that these
circumstellar disks are massive enough to form planets and are long-lived, in
spite of the ablation driven by post-shock flow ram pressure. As a function of
the initial conditions, we also track the time evolution of the accretion rates
and particle mixing between between the ambient wind and cloud material. The
latter is maximized for cases of highest mach number.

polarized brightness (pB) measurements by coronagraphs is a classic problem in
solar physics. An inversion technique based on the spherically symmetric
geometry (Spherically Symmetric Inversion, SSI) was developed in the 1950s, and
has been widely applied to interpret various observations. However, to date
there is no study about uncertainty estimation of this method. In this study we
present the detailed assessment of this method using a three-dimensional (3D)
electron density in the corona from 1.5 to 4 Rsun as a model, which is
reconstructed by tomography method from STEREO/COR1 observations during solar
minimum in February 2008. We first show in theory and observation that the
spherically symmetric polynomial approximation (SSPA) method and the Van de
Hulst inversion technique are equivalent. Then we assess the SSPA method using
synthesized pB images from the 3D density model, and find that the SSPA density
values are close to the model inputs for the streamer core near the plane of
the sky (POS) with differences generally less than a factor of two or so; the
former has the lower peak but more spread in both longitudinal and latitudinal
directions than the latter. We estimate that the SSPA method may resolve the
coronal density structure near the POS with angular resolution in longitude of
about 50 degrees. Our results confirm the suggestion that the SSI method is
applicable to the solar minimum streamer (belt) as stated in some previous
studies. In addition, we demonstrate that the SSPA method can be used to
reconstruct the 3D coronal density, roughly in agreement with that by
tomography for a period of low solar activity. We suggest that the SSI method
is complementary to the 3D tomographic technique in some cases, given that the
development of the latter is still an ongoing research effort.

of azimuthal anisotropies by means of the two- and four-particle cumulants are

different from that of elliptic flow $v_2$. It is observed that parton cascade

little contribution to the flow fluctuations, which indicates flow fluctuations

years, there has been an increasing interest in the implementations of

physics, both EIT and ATS are quantified by the appearance of a transparency
window in the absorption or transmission spectrum, which often leads to a

Fano interference among different transition pathways, in ATS it is the result
of strong field-driven interactions leading to the splitting of energy levels.
Being able to tell objectively whether a transparency window observed in the

equilibria in asymmetric auctions with single-dimensional agents. We employ
these tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue.
Our approach separates the standard smoothness framework into two distinct
parts, isolating the analysis common to any auction from the analysis specific
to a given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare
in equilibrium to their contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using
the price the bidder faces for additional allocation. Intuitively, either an
agent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she has
to pay for additional allocation is high relative to her value. We call this
condition value covering; it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any
auction. The second part, revenue covering, relates the prices bidders face for
additional allocation to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's rules
and feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation
results to the optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal
revenue. In mechanisms with reserve prices, our welfare results show
approximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same reserves.
  As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with
individual monopoly reserves. When each distribution satisfies a regularity
condition the auction's revenue is at least a $2e/(e-1) \approx 3.16$
approximation to the revenue of the optimal auction. We also give bounds for
matroid auctions with first-price or all-pay semantics, and the generalized
first-price position auction. Finally, we give an extension theorem for
simultaneous composition, i.e., when multiple auctions are run simultaneously,
with single-valued, unit-demand agents.

during inflation can easily destabilize the electroweak vacuum if the Hubble
parameter during inflation is larger than $\Lambda_I$ (as preferred by the
recent BICEP2 measurement). We perform a careful study of the evolution of the
Higgs field during inflation, obtaining different results from those currently
in the literature. We consider both tunneling via a Coleman-de Luccia or
Hawking-Moss instanton, valid when the scale of inflation is below the
instability scale, as well as a statistical treatment via the Fokker-Planck
equation appropriate in the opposite regime. We show that a better
understanding of the post-inflation evolution of the unstable AdS vacuum
regions is crucial for determining the eventual fate of the universe. If these
AdS regions devour all of space, a universe like ours is indeed extremely
unlikely without new physics to stabilize the Higgs potential; however, if
these regions crunch, our universe survives, but inflation must last a few
e-folds longer to compensate for the lost AdS regions. Lastly, we examine the
effects of generic Planck-suppressed corrections to the Higgs potential, which
can be sufficient to stabilize the electroweak vacuum during inflation.

power spectrum at one and two loops showed a remarkable agreement with

origin and show how a Lagrangian based calculation removes this differences. We
propose a simple method to upgrade existing Eulerian calculations to

results up to $k\sim 0.6 h/$Mpc to within 1% with no oscillatory residuals. We

images in the $HST$ archive. The luminosity and size of each NSC is derived
from an iterative PSF-fitting technique, which adapts the fitting area to the
effective radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of the NSC, and uses a WFPC2-specific PSF
model tailored to the position of each NSC on the detector. The luminosities of
NSCs are $\leq\!10^8L_{\rm V,\odot}$, and their integrated optical colours
suggest a wide spread in age. We confirm that most NSCs have sizes similar to
Globular Clusters (GCs), but find that the largest and brightest NSCs occupy
the regime between Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) and the nuclei of early-type
galaxies in the size-luminosity plane. The overlap in size, mass, and colour
between the different incarnations of compact stellar systems provides a
support for the notion that at least some UCDs and the most massive Galactic
GCs, may be remnant nuclei of disrupted disk galaxies. We find tentative
evidence for the NSCs' $r_{\rm eff}$ to be smaller when measured in bluer
filters, and discuss possible implications of this result. We also highlight a
few examples of complex nuclear morphologies, including double nuclei, extended
stellar structures, and nuclear $F606W$ excess from either recent
(circum-)nuclear star formation and/or a weak AGN. Such examples may serve as
case studies for ongoing NSC evolution via the two main suggested mechanisms,
namely cluster merging and $in\ situ$ star formation.

$10^4$ and $10^6$ injects energy into the photon-baryon plasma and causes the
CMB to deviate from a perfect blackbody spectrum, producing a so-called
$\mu$-distortion. We can calculate the correlation $\langle\mu T\rangle$ of
this distortion with the temperature anisotropy $T$ of the CMB to search for a
correlation $\langle B^2\zeta\rangle$ between the magnetic field $B$ and the
curvature perturbation $\zeta$; knowing the $\langle B^2\zeta\rangle$
correlation would help us distinguish between different models of
magnetogenesis. Since the perturbations which produce the $\mu$-distortion will
be much smaller scale than the relevant density perturbations, the observation
of this correlation is sensitive to the squeezed limit of $\langle
B^2\zeta\rangle$, which is naturally parameterized by $b_{\text{NL}}$ (a
parameter defined analogously to $f_{\text{NL}}$). We find that a PIXIE-like
CMB experiments has a signal to noise $S/N\approx 1.0 \times b_{\text{NL}}
(\tilde B_\mu/10\text{ nG})^2$, where $\tilde B_\mu$ is the magnetic field's
strength on $\mu$-distortion scales normalized to today's redshift; thus, a 10
nG field would be detectable with $b_{\text{NL}}=\mathcal{O}(1)$. However, if
the field is of inflationary origin, we generically expect it to be accompanied
by a curvature bispectrum $\langle\zeta^3\rangle$ induced by the magnetic
field. For sufficiently small magnetic fields, the signal $\langle B^2
\zeta\rangle$ will dominate, but for $\tilde B_\mu\gtrsim 1$ nG, one would have
to consider the specifics of the inflationary magnetogenesis model.
  We also discuss the potential post-magnetogenesis sources of a $\langle

based on the analysis of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies from dwarf to

wide range of disk scaling relationships. We find that the best fit parameters
of a generic double power-law density profile vary in a systematic manner that
depends on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of each galaxy. Thus, the quantity
Mstar/Mhalo constrains the inner ($\gamma$) and outer ($\beta$) slopes of dark
matter density, and the sharpness of transition between the slopes($\alpha$),
reducing the number of free parameters of the model to two. Due to the tight
relation between stellar mass and halo mass, either of these quantities is
sufficient to describe the dark matter halo profile including the effects of
baryons. The concentration of the haloes in the hydrodynamical simulations is
consistent with N-body expectations up to Milky Way mass galaxies, at which
mass the haloes become twice as concentrated as compared with pure dark matter
runs. This mass dependent density profile can be directly applied to rotation
curve data of observed galaxies and to semi analytic galaxy formation models as
a significant improvement over the commonly used NFW profile.

cancellation inside the observing beam. All this evidence is fully consistent
with a kinematic scenario where the main kinematic and polarization properties

rotation of such emission regions around the jet axis when the jet is seen

couplings which are driven to tiny values by the Renormalization Group flow
towards low energies can easily be of order one at the ultraviolet cutoff
scale. Our study indicates that the inclusion of these couplings can
significantly increase the ultraviolet cutoff scale and therefore the range of

strongly indicate a sublinear Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relationship between the
star formation rate (Sigsfr) and molecular gas surface density (Sigmol). Here,
we consider the consequences of these results in the context of common
assumptions, as well as observational support for a linear relationship between
Sigsfr and the surface density of dense gas. If the CO traced gas depletion
time (tau_mol) is constant, and if CO only traces star forming giant molecular
clouds (GMCs), then the physical properties of each GMC must vary, such as the
volume densities or star formation rates. Another possibility is that the
conversion between CO luminosity and Sigmol, the XCO factor, differs from
cloud-to-cloud. A more straightforward explanation is that CO permeates the
hierarchical ISM, including the filaments and lower density regions within
which GMCs are embedded. A number of independent observational results support
this description, with the diffuse gas comprising at least 30% of the total
molecular content. The CO bright diffuse gas can explain the sublinear KS
relationship, and consequently leads to an increasing tau_mol with Sigmol. If
Sigsfr linearly correlates with the dense gas surface density, a sublinear KS
relationship indicates that the fraction of diffuse gas fdiff grows with
Sigmol. In galaxies where Sigmol falls towards the outer disk, this description
suggests that fdiff also decreases radially.

the $p$-value is just the proportion of sampled test statistics that exceed the

a Monte Carlo null model for your data, and defining some form of randomization
procedure is also, in many cases, relatively straightforward. However, there

may lead to very different $p$-values, and a very low $p$-value may thus occur
due to the inadequacy of the chosen null model. It is preferable to use
assumptions about the underlying random data generation process to guide
selection of a null model. In many cases, we may order the null models by
increasing preservation of the data characteristics, and we argue in this paper
that this ordering in most cases gives increasing $p$-values, that is, lower
significance. We denote this as the null complexity principle. The principle

"1404.5971","Shuchi Chawla","Shuchi Chawla and Jason Hartline and Denis Nekipelov","Mechanism Design for Data Science",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Good economic mechanisms depend on the preferences of participants in the
mechanism. For example, the revenue-optimal auction for selling an item is
parameterized by a reserve price, and the appropriate reserve price depends on
how much the bidders are willing to pay. A mechanism designer can potentially
learn about the participants' preferences by observing historical data from the
mechanism; the designer could then update the mechanism in response to learned
preferences to improve its performance. The challenge of such an approach is
that the data corresponds to the actions of the participants and not their
preferences. Preferences can potentially be inferred from actions but the
degree of inference possible depends on the mechanism. In the optimal auction
example, it is impossible to learn anything about preferences of bidders who
are not willing to pay the reserve price. These bidders will not cast bids in
the auction and, from historical bid data, the auctioneer could never learn
that lowering the reserve price would give a higher revenue (even if it would).
To address this impossibility, the auctioneer could sacrifice revenue
optimality in the initial auction to obtain better inference properties so that
the auction's parameters can be adapted to changing preferences in the future.
This paper develops the theory for optimal mechanism design subject to good
inferability.

$U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. The model contains three
right handed neutrinos with different quantum numbers and a rich scalar sector,
with extra doublets and singlets. In principle, these extra scalars can have
VEVs ($V_{\Phi}$ and $V_{\phi}$ for the extra doublets and singlets,
respectively) belonging to different energy scales. In the context of
$\zeta\equiv\frac{V_{\Phi}}{V_{\phi}}\ll1$, which allows to obtain naturally
light active neutrino masses and mixing compatible with neutrino experiments,
the DM candidate arises by imposing a $Z_{2}$ symmetry on a given complex
singlet, $\phi_{2}$, in order to make it stable. After doing a study of the
scalar potential and the gauge sector, we obtain all the DM dominant processes
concerning the relic abundance and direct detection. Then, for a representative
set of parameters, we found that a complex DM with mass around $200$ GeV, for
example, is compatible with the current experimental constraints without
resorting to resonances. However, additional compatible solutions with heavier
masses can be found in vicinities of resonances. Finally, we address the issue
of having a light CP-odd scalar in the model showing that it is safe concerning
the Higgs and the $Z_{\mu}$ boson invisible decay widths, and also the energy

converters of a continuous quantum random variable into a discrete classical

the conversion process demands an experimenter to fully characterize the
underlying quantum system and implement parameter estimation routines. Here we
show that conventional approaches to parameter estimation (such as e.g. {\it
Maximum Likelihood Estimation}) used on a finite QRNG data sample without
caution may introduce binning bias and lead to overestimation of the randomness
of the QRNG output. To bypass these complications, we develop an alternative
conversion approach based on the Bayesian statistical inference method. We
illustrate our approach using experimental data from a time-of-arrival QRNG and
numerically simulated data from a vacuum homodyning QRNG. Side-by-side
comparison with the conventional conversion technique shows that our method
provides an automatic on-line bias control and naturally bounds the best
achievable QRNG bit rate for a given measurement record.

Efficient Modified-Parker-Equation-Solving Tool, TEMPEST), can act as a
smaller, stand-alone code for use in forecasting pipelines. TEMPEST is written
in Python and will become a publicly available library of functions that is
easy to adapt and expand. We discuss important relations between the magnetic

independently validate prediction models. ZEPHYR provides the foundation and
calibration for TEMPEST, and ultimately we will use these models to predict
observations and explain space weather created by the bulk solar wind. We are
able to reproduce with both models the general anticorrelation seen in
comparisons of observed wind speed at 1 AU and the flux tube expansion factor.
There is significantly less spread than comparing the results of the two models

fast community detection algorithms, such as spectral clustering applied to
adjacency matrices or graph Laplacians, may fail to retrieve the major clusters
due to a small portion of outliers. We apply a slight modification of our

distributions than the others, indicating high fractions of the projected areas
filled with star formation. Nine subregions in 7 galaxies have similarly steep
number-size slopes, even when the whole galaxies have shallower slopes. The
results suggest that hierarchically structured star-forming regions several
hundred parsecs or larger represent common unit structures. Small galaxies
dominated by only a few of these units tend to be starbursts. The
self-similarity of young stellar structures down to parsec scales suggests that
star clusters form in the densest parts of a turbulent medium that also forms
loose stellar groupings on larger scales. The presence of super star clusters
in two of our starburst dwarfs would follow from the observed structure if
cloud and stellar subregions more readily coalesce when self-gravity in the

remains poorly understood. It may be due to an intrinsically asymmetric outflow
launch mechanism, or it may be caused by the effects of the ambient medium
surrounding the YSO. Answering this question is an important step in
understanding outflow launching. We have investigated the bipolar outflows
driven by the T Tauri star DG Tauri on scales of hundreds of AU, using the
Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini North. The
approaching outflow consists of a well-collimated jet, nested within a
lower-velocity disc wind. The receding outflow is composed of a
single-component bubble-like structure. We analyse the kinemat- ics of the
receding outflow using kinetic models, and determine that it is a
quasi-stationary bubble with an expanding internal velocity field. We propose
that this bubble forms because the receding counterjet from DG Tau is
obstructed by a clumpy ambient medium above the circumstellar disc surface,
based on similarities between this structure and those found in the modeling of
active galactic nuclei outflows. We find evidence of interaction between the
obscured counterjet and clumpy ambient material, which we attribute to the
large molecular envelope around the DG Tau system. An analytical model of a
momentum-driven bubble is shown to be consistent with our interpretation. We
conclude that the bipolar outflow from DG Tau is intrinsically symmetric, and
the observed asymmetries are due to environmental effects. This mechanism can
potentially be used to explain the observed bipolar asymmetries in other YSO
outflows.

information from a privacy-sensitive population: an analyst wants to compute
some aggregate statistic from the private bits held by each member of a

with a cost for privacy, \ie, they not only account for the payments they
expect to receive from the mechanism, but also their privacy costs from any
information revealed about them by the mechanism's outcome---the computed
statistic as well as the payments---to determine their utilities. How can the
analyst design payments to obtain an accurate estimate of the population
statistic when individuals strategically decide both whether to participate and
whether to truthfully report their sensitive information?
  We design a differentially private peer-prediction mechanism that supports
accurate estimation of the population statistic as a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in
settings where agents have explicit preferences for privacy. The mechanism
requires knowledge of the marginal prior distribution on bits $b_i$, but does
not need full knowledge of the marginal distribution on the costs $c_i$,
instead requiring only an approximate upper bound. Our mechanism guarantees
$\epsilon$-differential privacy to each agent $i$ against any adversary who can
observe the statistical estimate output by the mechanism, as well as the
payments made to the $n-1$ other agents $j\neq i$. Finally, we show that with
slightly more structured assumptions on the privacy cost functions of each
agent, the cost of running the survey goes to $0$ as the number of agents

downlink can strictly improve the sum DoF compared to the conventional uplink
or downlink operation, in which both cells operate as either uplink or
downlink. The DoF gain from such uplink-downlink operation is further shown to
be achievable for heterogeneous cellular networks having hotspots and with
delayed channel state information.

efficiently collect and upload sensing data, enabling numerous novel
applications. To achieve good service quality for a crowd sensing application,
incentive mechanisms are necessary for attracting more user participation. Most
of existing mechanisms apply only for the budget-constraint scenario where the
platform (the crowd sensing organizer) has a budget limit. On the contrary, we
focus on a different scenario where the platform has a service limit. Based on
the offline and online auction model, we consider a general problem: users
submit their private profiles to the platform, and the platform aims at
selecting a subset of users before a specified deadline for minimizing the
total payment while a specific service can be completed. Specially, we design
offline and online service-constraint incentive mechanisms for the case where
the value function of selected users is monotone submodular. The mechanisms are
individual rationality, task feasibility, computational efficiency,
truthfulness, consumer sovereignty, constant frugality, and also performs well
in practice. Finally, we use extensive simulations to demonstrate the
theoretical properties of our mechanisms.

superluminous supernova or a normal SNIa magnified by a hidden gravitational

a SNIa. We discuss how more lensed SNIa may be found than previously predicted.

extremely low static current Consumption as well as high current drive
capability. A new technique is used to reduce the leakage power of class-AB
CMOS buffer circuits without affecting dynamic power dissipation. The name of
applied technique is TRANSISTOR GATING TECHNIQUE, which gives the high speed
buffer with the reduced low power dissipation (1.105%), low leakage and reduced
area (3.08%) also. The proposed buffer is simulated at 45nm CMOS technology and
the circuit is operated at 3.3V supply[11]. Consumption is comparable to the
switching component. Reports indicate that 40% or even higher percentage of the
total power consumption is due to the leakage of transistors. This percentage
will increase with technology scaling unless effective techniques are
introduced to bring leakage under control. This article focuses on circuit
optimization and Design automation techniques to accomplish this goal [9].

DHN by Enokiya et al. (2014) revealed two candidate molecular counterparts of
the DHN at radial velocities of -35 km/s and 0 km/s and discussed the model in
which the DHN has its origin at the circumnuclear disk in the GC. In this
paper, new CO observations toward the DHN using the CSO and Mopra telescopes
are presented. The higher-resolution observations of ~1 pc scale reveal the
detailed distributions and kinematics of the two CO counterparts (the 0 km/s

conditions. As a result, we find that the 0 km/s feature with a mass of
3.3x10^4 Msun coincides with the infrared emission of the DHN, indicating clear
association with the DHN. The association of the -35 km/s feature, with a mass
of 0.8x10^4 Msun, is less clear compared with the 0 km/s feature, but the
complementary distribution between the molecular gas and the DHN and velocity
variation along the DHN support its association with the DHN. The two molecular
features are highly excited, as shown by the relatively high CO J=2-1/J=1-0
intensity ratios of ~1.0, and have kinetic temperatures of ~30 K, consistent
with the typical molecular clouds in the GC.

treating functional shapes (or fshapes) following the landmarks of shape spaces
and shape analysis. Functional shapes can be described as signal functions
supported on varying geometrical supports. Analysing variability of fshapes'
ensembles require the modelling and quantification of joint variations in
geometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches.
Instead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects,
we propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics
for fshape metamorphoses to model geometrico-functional transformations within
these bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based
on the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances.
Based on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation
problem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the
different models. The second part of the article examines the numerical
implementation of the models by detailing discrete expressions for the metrics
and gradients and proposing an optimization scheme for the atlas estimation
problem. We present a few results of the methodology on a synthetic dataset as
well as on a population of retinal membranes with thickness maps.

depends on who are transmitting concurrently with it. Existing MU-MIMO MAC
protocols however enable clients to use the traditional 802.11 contention to
contend for concurrent transmission opportunities on the uplink. Such a
contention-based protocol not only wastes lots of channel time on multiple
rounds of contention, but also fails to maximally deliver the gain of MU-MIMO
because users randomly join concurrent transmissions without considering their
channel characteristics. To address such inefficiency, this paper introduces
MIMOMate, a leader-contention-based MU-MIMO MAC protocol that matches clients
as concurrent transmitters according to their channel characteristics to
maximally deliver the MU-MIMO gain, while ensuring all users to fairly share
concurrent transmission opportunities. Furthermore, MIMOMate elects the leader
of the matched users to contend for transmission opportunities using
traditional 802.11 CSMA/CA. It hence requires only a single contention overhead
for concurrent streams, and can be compatible with legacy 802.11 devices. A
prototype implementation in USRP-N200 shows that MIMOMate achieves an average
throughput gain of 1.42x and 1.52x over the traditional contention-based
protocol for 2-antenna and 3-antenna AP scenarios, respectively, and also
provides fairness for clients.

hopping between neighboring cavities arises. We provide a detailed mean-field
analysis of the steady-state phase diagram as a function of the system
parameters, the leakage, and the external driving, and show the emergence of a

oscillating behavior and bistability. In some regions the crystalline ordering
may coexist with the oscillating behavior. Furthermore we study the effect of
short-range quantum fluctuations by employing a cluster mean-field analysis.
Focusing on the corrections to the photon crystal boundaries, we show that,
apart for some quantitative differences, the cluster mean field supports the
findings of the simple single-site analysis. In the last part of the paper we
concentrate on the possibility to build up the class of arrays introduced here,

LF is clearly accelerated at $z>6.6$ beyond the measurement uncertainties

UV-continuum LF or cosmic star-formation rate (SFR) is found at $z\sim 7$, but
suggested only at $z>8$ (Oesch et al. 2013, Bouwens et al. 2014), this
accelerated Lya LF evolution is explained by physical mechanisms different from
a pure SFR decrease but related to Lya production and escape in the process of
cosmic reionization. Because a simple accelerating increase of IGM neutral
hydrogen absorbing Lya would not reconcile with Thomson scattering optical
depth measurements from WMAP and Planck, our findings may support new physical
pictures suggested by recent theoretical studies, such as the existence of HI
clumpy clouds within cosmic ionized bubbles selectively absorbing Lya and the
large ionizing photon escape fraction of galaxies making weak Lya emission.

turbulence, the relationship of the gradient to the sonic Mach number of the
WIM, and changes in morphology of the gradient as a function of Galactic

Survey (S-PASS) to image the spatial gradient of the linearly polarized
synchrotron emission ($|\nabla \textbf{P}|/|\textbf{P}|$) of the entire
southern sky at $2.3$~GHz. The spatial gradient of linear polarization reveals
rapid changes of the density and magnetic fluctuations in the WIM due to
magnetic turbulence as a function of Galactic position; we make comparisons of
these data to ideal MHD numerical simulations. In order to constrain the sonic
Mach number ($M_{s}$), we apply a high order moments analysis to the
observations and to the simulated diffuse, isothermal ISM with ideal
magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. We find that polarization gradient maps reveal
elongated structures, which we associate with turbulence in the ISM. Our
analysis corroborates the view of a turbulent WIM in a transonic regime
$M_{s}\lesssim 2$. Filamentary structures with typical widths down to the
angular resolution are seen and the observed morphologies match closely with
numerical simulations and in some cases H$\alpha$ contours. The $|\nabla
\textbf{P}|/|\textbf{P}|$ intensity is found to be approximately log-normal
distributed. No systematic variations of the sonic Mach number are observed as
a function of Galactic coordinates, which is consistent with turbulence in the
WIM inferred by the analysis of H$\alpha$ data.

have run simulations in a parameter regime where these layers are expected to
form and successively increased the rate of rotation with the result that fast
rotation is found to have a similar stabilising effect on the overall
convective flux as an increase of the stability ratio $R_{\rho}$ has in a
non-rotating setup. We have also studied to what extent the regimes of
rotational constraints suggested by King, Stellmach, and Buffett (2013) for
rotation in the case of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection are influenced by
double-diffusive convection: their classification could also be applicable to
the case of double-diffusive convection in a spherical shell if it is extended
to be also a function of the stability ratio $R_{\rho}$. Furthermore, we
examined the ratio of saline and thermal Nusselt numbers and compared our
results with models of Spruit (2013), Rosenblum et al. (2011) and Wood, Garaud,

result that fast rotation further decreases the convective transport, which is
already lowered by double-diffusive convection, could play a major role for

SLEDs and L_{FIR}/L_{CO,1-0}, L_{HCN}/L_{CO} (J=1-0) ratios (proxies of star
formation efficiency and dense gas mass fraction). In Arp193, one of the three
most extreme starbursts in the local Universe, the molecular SLEDs indicate a
small amount ~(5-15)% of dense gas (n>=10^{4}cm^{-3}) unlike NGC6240 where most
of the molecular gas (~(60-70)%) is dense n~(10^4-10^5)cm^{-3}. Strong
star-formation feedback can drive this disparity in their dense gas mass

slow roll which, in turn, result in deviations from scale invariance in the
scalar power spectrum. Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum
exhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius
either immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also
finds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales
corresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow
roll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from
slow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually
of a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine
that the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a
restoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been
reestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model
described by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)
involving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,
though short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant
imprint on the bi-spectrum. The bi-spectrum in this case is found to grow
linearly with the wavenumber at small scales, a behavior which is clearly
unphysical. In this work, we study the effects of smoothening the discontinuity
in the Starobinsky model on the scalar bi-spectrum. Focusing on the equilateral
limit, we analytically show that, for smoother potentials, the bi-spectrum
indeed turns scale invariant at suitably large wavenumbers. We also confirm the
analytical results numerically using our newly developed code BINGO. We
conclude with a few comments on certain related points.

superconducting wavefunction at the surface and W/La interface, leading to a
linear decrease of the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of the inverse
film thickness. For thick, bulk-like films, $\Delta_{\rm{La}}$ and $T_c$ are
40% larger as compared to literature values of dhcp La measured by other
techniques. This finding is reconciled by examining the effects of surface
contamination as probed by modifications of the surface state, suggesting that
the large $T_c$ originates in the superior purity of the samples investigated
here.

tradeoffs in cooperative multiple access for cognitive radio systems. We focus
on the class of randomized cooperative policies, whereby the secondary user
(SU) serves either the queue of its own data or the queue of the primary user
(PU) relayed data with certain service probabilities. Moreover, admission
control is introduced at the relay queue, whereby a PU's packet is admitted to
the relay queue with an admission probability. The proposed policy introduces a
fundamental tradeoff between the delays of the PU and SU. Consequently, it
opens room for trading the PU delay for enhanced SU delay and vice versa. Thus,
the system could be tuned according to the demands of the intended application.
Towards this objective, stability conditions for the queues involved in the
system are derived. Furthermore, a moment generating function approach is
employed to derive closed-form expressions for the average delay encountered by
the packets of both users. The effect of varying the service and admission
probabilities on the system's throughput and delay is thoroughly investigated.
Results show that cooperation expands the stable throughput region. Moreover,
numerical simulation results assert the extreme accuracy of the analytically
derived delay expressions. In addition, we provide a criterion for the SU based
on which it decides whether cooperation is beneficial to the PU or not.
Furthermore, we show the impact of controlling the flow of data at the relay
queue using the admission probability.

distribution of the random one-dimensional projections of these sets to the
distributions $S_1,S_2,C_1,C_2$ studied by Biane, Pitman, Yor [Bull.\ AMS 38

\frac{\pi^{k/2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac 32 k +1 \right)}, \text{ respectively } V_k

related to the results of Gao and Vitale [Discrete Comput. Geom. 26 (2001),

with a restriction on the total variation instead of the Lipschitz constant.
Using the results of Gao and Vitale we give a new proof of the formula for the
expected volume of the convex hull of the $d$-dimensional Brownian motion which
is due to Eldan [Elect. J. Probab., to appear]. Additionally, we prove an
analogue of Eldan's result for the Brownian bridge. Similarly, we show that the
results on the intrinsic volumes of the Lipschitz balls can be translated into
formulae for the expected volumes of zonoids (Aumann integrals) generated by
the Brownian motion and the Brownian bridge. Also, these results have discrete

acquire small masses from only an anti-sextet of $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ which is in a
doublet under $S_3$. If the difference of components of the anti-sextet is
regarded as a small perturbation, S3 is equivalently broken into identity, the
corresponding neutrino mass mixing matrix acquires the most general form and
the model can fit the latest data on neutrino oscillation. This way of the
symmetry breaking helps us to reduce a content in the Higgs sector, only one an
anti-sextet instead of two as in our previous work. Our results show that the
neutrino masses are naturally small and a small deviation from the
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing form can be realized. The Higgs potential of the

the discovery of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters.
According to this model, the existence of well defined (anti)-correlations
amongst light element abundances (i.e. C, N, O, Na) in the photospheres of
stars belonging to the same cluster (and the associated helium enrichment), is
caused by accretion of the ejecta of short lived interacting massive binary
systems (and single fast rotating massive stars) on fully convective pre-main
sequence low- and very low-mass stars, during the early stages of the cluster
evolution. We investigated the constraints provided by considering
simultaneously the observed spread of lithium and oxygen (and when possible
also sodium) abundances for samples of turn-off stars in NGC6752, NGC6121 (M4),
and NGC104 (47Tuc), and the helium abundance of their multiple main sequences.
These observations provide a very powerful test for the accretion scenario,
because the observed O, Li and He abundance distributions at the turn off can
be used to constrain the composition (and mass) of the accreted matter, and the
timescales of the polluting stars. In case of NGC6752 we could not find a
physically consistent solution. In case of M4, spectroscopic errors are too
large compared to the intrinsic spread, to constrain the properties of the
accreted matter. As for 47Tuc, we could find a physically consistent solution
for the abundances of He and O (and Na) in the accreted gas, and predict the
abundances of these elements in the accreted matter only if pollution happens
with timescales of ~1 Myr, hence polluters are objects with masses of the order
of several tens of solar masses (abridged).

resonant pair of super-Earth like planets has In the present paper we present a

Neptunes and Super-Earths orbiting a sample of metal-poor FGK dwarfs. We then
present a detailed analysis of an additional 162 radial velocity measurements
of HD41248, obtained within this program, with the goal of confirming the
existence of the proposed planetary system. We analyzed the precise radial
velocities, obtained with the HARPS spectrograph, together with several stellar
activity diagnostics and line profile indicators. A careful analysis shows no
evidence for the planetary system previously announced. One of the signals,
with a period of about 25 days, is shown to be related to the rotational period

coupled to classical spin environments is reviewed. The theory is based on
generalized antisymmetric brackets and naturally predicts open-path
off-diagonal geometric phases in the evolution of the density matrix. It is
shown that such geometric phases must also be considered in the
quantum-classical Liouville equation for a classical bath with canonical phase
space coordinates; this occurs whenever the adiabatics basis is complex (as in
the case of a magnetic field coupled to the quantum subsystem). When the
quantum subsystem is weakly coupled to the spin environment, non-adiabatic
transitions can be neglected and one can construct an effective non-Markovian
computer simulation scheme for open quantum system dynamics in classical spin
environments. In order to tackle this case, integration algorithms based on the
symmetric Trotter factorization of the classical-like spin propagator are
derived. Such algorithms are applied to a model comprising a quantum two-level
system coupled to a single classical spin in an external magnetic field.
Starting from an excited state, the population difference and the coherences of
this two-state model are simulated in time while the dynamics of the classical
spin is monitored in detail. It is the author's opinion that the numerical
evidence provided in this paper is a first step toward developing the
simulation of quantum dynamics in classical spin environments into an effective
tool. In turn, the ability to simulate such a dynamics can have a positive
impact on various fields, among which, for example, nano-science.

and spatially resolved in the far-IR with the Herschel PACS and SPIRE
instruments. In a first model, Ertel et al. (2014) assumed the size and radial
distribution of the circumstellar dust to be independent power laws. There, by
exploring a very broad range of possible model parameters several scenarios
capable of explaining the observations were suggested. In this paper, we
perform a follow-up in-depth collisional modelling of these scenarios trying to
further distinguish between them. In our models we consider collisions, direct
radiation pressure, and drag forces, i.e. the actual physical processes
operating in debris discs. We find that all scenarios discussed in Ertel et al.
are physically sensible and can reproduce the observed SED along with the PACS
surface brightness profiles reasonably well. In one model, the dust is produced
beyond 120au in a narrow planetesimal belt and is transported inwards by
Poynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag. A good agreement with the observed
radial profiles would require stellar winds by about an order of magnitude
stronger than the solar value, which is not supported, although not ruled out,
by observations. Another model consists of two spatially separated planetesimal
belts, a warm inner and a cold outer one. This scenario would probably imply
the presence of planets clearing the gap between the two components. Finally,
we show qualitatively that the observations can be explained by assuming the
dust is produced in a single, but broad planetesimal disc with a surface
density of solids rising outwards, as expected for an extended disc that
experiences a natural inside-out collisional depletion. Prospects of
discriminating between the competing scenarios by future observations are
discussed.

of small-scale matter density fluctuations and for a solution of the tension
between the Planck and BICEP2 measurements of the tensor to scalar ratio of
large-scale fluctuations. Moreover, the extra relativistic degree of freedom
corresponding to a fully thermalized sterile neutrino is correlated with a
larger value of the Hubble constant, which is in agreement with local
measurements.

detailed molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures of purine
(adenine)- and preQ$_1$ sensing riboswitch aptamers, we show that water
molecules in the vicinity of RNAs undergo complex dynamics depending on the
local structures of the RNAs. The overall lifetimes of hydrogen bonds (HBs) of
surface bound waters are more than at least 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than
bulk water. Slow hydration dynamics, revealed in non-Arrhenius behavior of the
relaxation time, arises from high activation barriers to break water hydrogen
bonds with a nucleotide and by reduced diffusion of water. The relaxation
kinetics at specific locations in the two RNAs show a broad spectrum of time
scales reminiscent of glass-like behavior, suggesting that the hydration
dynamics is highly heterogeneous. Both RNAs undergo dynamic transition at $T =
T_D \gtrsim 200$ K as assessed by the mean square fluctuation of hydrogen atoms
$\langle x^2\rangle$, which undergoes an abrupt harmonic-to-anharmonic
transition at $T_D$. The near universal value of $T_D$ found for these RNAs and
previously for tRNA is strongly correlated with changes in hydration dynamics
as $T$ is altered. Hierarchical dynamics of waters associated with the RNA
surface, revealed in the motions of distinct classes of water with
well-separated time scales, reflects the heterogeneous local environment on the
molecular surface of RNA. At low temperatures slow water dynamics predominates
over structural transitions. Our study demonstrates that the complex interplay
of dynamics between water and local environment in the RNA structures could be
a key determinant of the functional activities of RNA.

irreversible thermodynamics. The second order non-equilibrium thermodynamical
prescription of Israel and Stewart has been presented with particle creation
rate, treated as the dissipative effect. In the background of a flat FRW model,
we assume the non-equilibrium thermodynamical process to be isentropic so that
the entropy per particle does not change and consequently the dissipative
pressure can be expressed linearly in terms of the particle creation rate. Here
the dissipative pressure behaves as a dynamical variable having a non-linear
inhomogeneous evolution equation and the entropy flow vector satisfies the
second law of thermodynamics. Further, using the Friedmann equations and by
proper choice of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble
parameter, it is possible to show (separately) a transition from the
inflationary phase to the radiation era and also from matter dominated era to
late time acceleration. Also, in analogy to analytic continuation, it is
possible to show a continuous cosmic evolution from inflation to late time
acceleration by adjusting the parameters. It is found that in the de Sitter
phase, the comoving entropy increases exponentially with time, keeping entropy
per particle unchanged. Subsequently, the above cosmological scenarios has been
described from field theoretic point of view by introducing a scalar field
having self interacting potential. Finally, we make an attempt to show the
cosmological phenomenon of particle creation as Hawking radiation, particularly
during the inflationary era.

foundations of Set Theory. The first counterexample forces Cantor's Diagonal
Method (DM) to yield one of the numbers in the target list. To study this
anomaly, and given that for the DM to work the list of numbers have to be
written down, the set of numbers that can be represented using positional
fractional notation, $\mathbb{W}$, is properly characterized. It is then shown
that $\mathbb{W}$ is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$, meaning that results
obtained from the application of the DM to $\mathbb{W}$ in order to derive
properties of $\mathbb{R}$ are not valid. It is then shown that Cantor's DM for
a generic list of reals can be forced to yield one of the numbers of the list,
thus invalidating Cantor's result that infers the non-denumerability of
$\mathbb{R}$ from the application of the DM to $\mathbb{W}$. Cantor's Theorem
about the different cardinalities of a set and its power set is then
questioned, and by means of another counterexample we show that the theorem
does not actually hold for infinite sets. After analyzing all these results, it
is shown that the current notion of cardinality for infinite sets does not
depend on the size of the sets, but rather on the representation chosen for
them. Following this line of thought, the concept of model as a framework for
the construction of the representation of a set is introduced, and a theorem
showing that an infinite set can be well-ordered if there is a proper model for
it is proven. To reiterate that the cardinality of a set does not determine
whether the set can be well-ordered, a set of cardinality
$\aleph_{0}^{\aleph_{0}}$ is proven to be equipollent to the set of natural
numbers $\mathbb{N}$. The paper concludes with an analysis of the cardinality
of the ordinal numbers, for which a representation of cardinality
$\aleph_{0}^{\aleph_{0}}$ is proposed.

Second, variability in appearance and pose of the objects constitute a major

path integral can be explicitly computed and receives its main contributions
from regions of the functional space that are far from the classical and
semiclassical configurations near the stationary point of the action. The
functional average $\langle q_m^2 \rangle$ of the square of the coordinate at a
time $t_m$ which is intermediate between the initial and final time gives a
measure of the amplitude of quantum fluctuations with respect to the classical
path. This average, or ""transition element"", is divergent in the massless
limit, signaling a quantum runaway. We show that the divergence is not due to
the continuum limit and formulate the conjecture that the divergent
contributions come from regions where the action $S$ is constant and therefore
the interference factor $e^{-iS/\hbar}$ does not oscillate. For most systems
these regions have zero functional measure and thus give a null contribution to
the path integral, but this is not the case for the massless oscillator. We
study the simplest functional subspace with constant action, namely the one
with $S=0$, which is connected to the classical solutions but extends to
infinity, like an hyperplane through the origin; this subspace turns out to be
infinite-dimensional. Some possible applications and developments are
