used to choose which of the conflicting rules are applied. Many interesting
semantics have been proposed. Brewka and Eiter's Principle I expresses the
basic intuition behind the preferences. All the approaches that satisfy
Principle I introduce a rather imperative feature into otherwise declarative
language. They understand preferences as the order, in which the rules of a
program have to be applied. In this paper we present two purely declarative
approaches for preference handling that satisfy Principle I, and work for
general conflicts, including direct and indirect conflicts between rules. The
first approach is based on the idea that a rule cannot be defeated by a less
preferred conflicting rule. This approach is able to ignore preferences between
non-conflicting rules, and, for instance, is equivalent with the answer set
semantics for the subclass of stratified programs. It is suitable for the
scenarios, when developers do not have full control over preferences. The
second approach relaxes the requirement for ignoring conflicting rules, which
ensures that it stays in the NP complexity class. It is based on the idea that
a rule cannot be defeated by a rule that is less preferred or depends on a less
preferred rule. The second approach can be also characterized by a
transformation to logic programs without preferences. It turns out that the
approaches form a hierarchy, a branch in the hierarchy of the approaches by
Delgrande et. al., Wang et. al., and Brewka and Eiter. Finally, we show an
application for which the existing approaches are not usable, and the
approaches of this paper produce expected results.

advantage of using windows is that each window creates a virtual screen space.
Hence, although the physical screen space is limited to a few inches, use of
windows can create unlimited screen space to display innumerable items.
  The use of windows facilitates the user to open and interact with multiple
programs or documents simultaneously in different windows. Sometimes a single
program may also open multiple windows to display various items. The user can
resize the windows and move their location time to time as desired.
  However, there are several concerns of a window relating to its size,
appearance, positioning, color, visibility, resizability etc. For example, the
window should have a minimum and a maximum size, dragging and resizing the
window should be easy, one window should not be obscured by another window,
windows should adjust their size and location in order to match with the
changes in the resolution and display environment etc.
  This article illustrates six patents from US Patent database solving problems
relating to displaying and resizing of windows. The inventions include
automatic resizing and relocating of windows, alternative modes of displaying
windows to accommodate within the limited display area, combining both spatial
and temporal methods to resize the window, locking and minimizing windows and

extracted from a single heat bath using measurement-based control protocols,
i.e., using ""information engines"". However, to the best of our knowledge, no
relation between gambling and information engines has been presented before. In
this paper, we briefly review the two concepts and then demonstrate an analogy
between gambling, where bits are converted into wealth, and information
engines, where bits representing measurements are converted into energy. From
this analogy follows an extension of gambling to the continuous-valued case,
which is shown to be useful for investments in currency exchange rates or in
the stock market using options. Moreover, the analogy enables us to use
well-known methods and results from one field to solve problems in the other.
We present three such cases: maximum work extraction when the probability
distributions governing the system and measurements are unknown, work
extraction when some energy is lost in each cycle, e.g., due to friction, and
an analysis of systems with memory. In all three cases, the analogy enables us
to use known results in order to obtain new ones.

that if the system with the average coupling and pinning gains can be

spectrum with optical and UV spectra from the literature, we show that the
unusual reddening noted by \citet{veilleux13} is explained by a reddening curve
like those previously used to explain low values of total-to-selective
extinction in SNe Ia. The nuclear starburst may be the origin and location of
the dust. Spatially-resolved emission in the broad absorption line trough
suggests nearly full coverage of the continuum emission region. The broad
absorption lines reveal higher velocities in the \ion{He}{1}* lines (produced
in the quasar-photoionized \ion{H}{2} region) compared with the \ion{Na}{1} and
\ion{Ca}{2} lines (produced in the corresponding partially-ionized zone). {\it
Cloudy} simulations show that a density increase is required between the
\ion{H}{2} and partially-ionized zones to produce ionic column densities
consistent with the optical and IR absorption line measurements and limits, and
that the absorber lies $\sim 100\rm \, pc$ from the central engine. These
results suggest that the \ion{He}{1}* lines are produced in an ordinary quasar
BAL wind that impacts upon, compresses, and accelerates the nuclear starburst's
dusty effluent (feedback in action), and the \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Na}{1} lines
are produced in this dusty accelerated gas. This unusual circumstance explains
the rarity of \ion{Na}{1} absorption lines; without the compression along our

observe a blue-shift of the equilibrium Josephson plasma resonance, detected by

achieved when the near-infrared pump light is polarized perpendicular to the

condensate when compared to in-plane excitation.

of standard QFT methods in quantum gravity (QG). The incompatibility of QG with
the use of classical continuous space-time required conceptually new approach.
We present briefly three proposals: loop quantum gravity (LQG), the
field-theoretic framework on noncommutative space-time and QG models formulated
on discretized (triangularized) space-time. We evaluate these models as
realizing expected important properties of QG: background independence,
consistent quantum diffeomorphisms, noncommutative or discrete structure of
space-time at very short distances, finite/renormalizable QG corrections. We
only briefly outline an important issue of embedding QG into larger geometric
and dynamical frameworks (e.g. supergravity, (super)strings, p-branes,
M-theory), with the aim to achieve full unification of all fundamental
interactions.

neighbors and thus cannot flow. This sluggishness is often ascribed to the free
energy landscape containing multiple minima (basins) separated by high
barriers. Here we show, using theory and numerical simulation, that the
landscape is much rougher than is classically assumed. Deep in the glass, it
undergoes a ""roughness transition"" to fractal basins. This brings about
isostaticity at jamming and marginality of glassy states near jamming. Critical
exponents for the basin width, the weak force distribution, and the spatial
spread of quasi-contacts at jamming can be analytically determined. Their value
is found to be compatible with numerical observations. This advance therefore
incorporates the jamming transition of granular materials into the framework of
glass theory. Because temperature and pressure control which features of the
landscape are experienced, glass mechanics and transport are expected to
reflect the features of the topology we discuss here. Hitherto mysterious
properties of low-temperature glasses could be explained by this approach.

This efficient strategy allows to address distributed optimization problems
over networks in the case where nodes have to collaboratively estimate a single
parameter vector. Problems of this type are referred to as single-task
problems. Nevertheless, there are several problems in practice that are
multitask-oriented in the sense that the optimum parameter vector may not be
the same for every node. This brings up the issue of studying the performance
of the diffusion LMS algorithm when it is run, either intentionally or
unintentionally, in a multitask environment. In this paper, we conduct a
theoretical analysis on the stochastic behavior of diffusion LMS in the case
where the so-called single-task hypothesis is violated. We explain under what
conditions diffusion LMS continues to deliver performance superior to
non-cooperative strategies in the multitask environment. When the conditions
are violated, we explain how to endow the nodes with the ability to cluster
with other similar nodes to remove bias. We propose an unsupervised clustering
strategy that allows each node to select, via adaptive adjustments of
combination weights, the neighboring nodes with which it can collaborate to
estimate a common parameter vector. Simulations are presented to illustrate the
theoretical results, and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
clustering strategy. The framework is applied to a useful problem involving a

high-dimensional data points into a union of low-dimensional linear subspaces,

observations of the data only, resulting, e.g., from ""undersampling"" due to
complexity and speed constraints on the acquisition device. More pertinently,
even if one has access to the high-dimensional data set it is often desirable
to first project the data points into a lower-dimensional space and to perform
the clustering task there; this reduces storage requirements and computational
cost. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the impact of
dimensionality-reduction through random projection on the performance of the
sparse subspace clustering (SSC) and the thresholding based subspace clustering
(TSC) algorithms. We find that for both algorithms dimensionality reduction
down to the order of the subspace dimensions is possible without incurring
significant performance degradation. The mathematical engine behind our

$b$-tuple $L$-colouring of $G$. An $(a,1)$-choosable graph is also called
$a$-choosable. In the pioneering paper on list colouring of graphs by
Erd\H{o}s, Rubin and Taylor, $2$-choosable graphs are characterized. Confirming
a special case of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s--Rubin--Taylor, Tuza and Voigt
proved that $2$-choosable graphs are $(2m,m)$-choosable for any positive
integer $m$. On the other hand, Voigt proved that if $m$ is an odd integer,
then these are the only $(2m,m)$-choosable graphs; however, when $m$ is even,
there are $(2m,m)$-choosable graphs that are not $2$-choosable. A graph is
called $3$-choosable-critical if it is not $2$-choosable, but all its proper
subgraphs are $2$-choosable. Voigt conjectured that for every positive integer
$m$, all bipartite $3$-choosable-critical graphs are $(4m,2m)$-choosable. In
this paper, we determine which $3$-choosable-critical graphs are
$(4,2)$-choosable, refuting Voigt's conjecture in the process. Nevertheless, a
weaker version of the conjecture is true: we prove that there is an even
integer $k$ such that for any positive integer $m$, every bipartite
$3$-choosable-critical graph is $(2km,km)$-choosable. Moving beyond
$3$-choosable-critical graphs, we present an infinite family of

which, the value of the wells depth is carefully calculated after adjusting the
number of atoms that composed each sphere, so that the energies and dipole

Moreover, we extend the calculation of this dielectric function for obtaining
the optical constants needed to find the plasmon frequency, throught a
numerical method of finite elements that solves the Maxwells equations, in
order to obtain the enhancement of the near electric field. We show an
interesting behavior for particles sizes less than 10 nm, finding that the
variation induced in the eigen-energies, through slight size changes in the

measured relations of halo mass with group luminosity, virial volume and
central galaxy stellar mass, $M_\star$, agree very well with predictions from
mock group catalogues constructed from a GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy
formation model implemented in the Millennium $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation;
2) the measured relations of halo mass with velocity dispersion and projected
half-abundance radius show weak tension with mock predictions, hinting at
problems in the mock galaxy dynamics and their small scale distribution; 3) the
median $M_h|M_\star$ measured from weak lensing depends more sensitively on the
lognormal dispersion in $M_\star$ at fixed $M_h$ than it does on the median
$M_\star|M_h$. Our measurements suggest an intrinsic dispersion of
$\sigma_{\log(M_\star)}\sim 0.15$; 4) Comparing our mass estimates with those
in the catalogue, we find that the G$^3$Cv5 mass can give biased results when
used to select subsets of the group sample. Of the various new halo mass
estimators that we calibrate using our weak lensing measurements, group
luminosity is the best single-proxy estimator of group mass.

every integer $k \geq 1$, every graph $G$ has a polynomially constructible
$(2k-1,0)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k})$. This size-stretch bound is
essentially optimal by the girth conjecture. It is therefore intriguing to ask
if one can ""bypass"" the conjecture by settling for a multiplicative stretch of
$2k-1$ only for \emph{neighboring} vertex pairs, while maintaining a strictly
\emph{better} multiplicative stretch for the rest of the pairs. We answer this
question in the affirmative and introduce the notion of \emph{$k$-hybrid

regarding their function or malfunction can be inferred by analyzing the
statistical dependencies between the activity of each unit. Whilst correlations
and mutual information are commonly used to characterize these dependencies,
our objective here is to extend interactions to triplets of variables to better
detect and characterize dynamic information transfer. Our approach relies on
the measure of interaction information (II). The sign of II provides
information as to the extent to which the interaction of variables in triplets
is redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Here, based on this approach, we calculated
the R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from
drug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study
the spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic
zone (the area responsible for seizure propagation). In terms of spatial
organization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S
was distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made
the largest contribution to high frequency bands (14-100Hz), whilst S was
expressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1-7Hz). Thus, applying
interaction information to such clinical data reveals new aspects of
epileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy vs. synergy) and
dynamics (fast vs. slow rhythms) of the interactions. We expect this
methodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions
in networks of interacting units in other setups with multi-recording data sets

have recently received renewed attention in the regularization of
high-dimensional correlation matrices. In this paper, we study powers of
positive semidefinite block matrices $(H_{st})_{s,t=1}^n$ with complex entries.
We first characterize the powers $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ such that the blockwise
power map $(H_{st}) \mapsto (H_{st}^\alpha)$ preserves Loewner positivity. The
characterization is obtained by exploiting connections with the theory of
matrix monotone functions developed by Loewner. Second, we revisit previous
work by Choudhury [Proc. AMS 108] who had provided a lower bound on $\alpha$
for preserving positivity when the blocks $H_{st}$ pairwise commute. We
completely settle this problem by characterizing the full set of powers
preserving positivity in this setting. Our characterizations generalize
previous work by FitzGerald-Horn, Bhatia-Elsner, and Hiai from scalars to
arbitrary block size, and in particular, generalize the Schur Product Theorem.
Finally, a natural and unifying framework for studying the case of
diagonalizable blocks consists of replacing real powers by general characters
of the complex plane. We thus classify such characters, and generalize our
results to this more general setting. In the course of our work, given
$\beta\in\mathbb{Z}$, we provide lower and upper bounds for the threshold power
$\alpha >0$ above which the complex characters $re^{i\theta}\mapsto r^\alpha
e^{i\beta\theta}$ preserve positivity when applied entrywise to positive
semidefinite matrices. In particular, we completely resolve the $n=3$ case of a
question raised in 2001 by Xingzhi Zhan. As an application, we extend previous

  Boundary Value Problems","23 pp. ESAIM: Math. Model. Numer. Anal., to appear",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a two-point boundary value problem involving a Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivative of order $\al\in (1,2)$ in the leading term on the unit
interval $(0,1)$. Generally the standard Galerkin finite element method can
only give a low-order convergence even if the source term is very smooth due to
the presence of the singularity term $x^{\al-1}$ in the solution
representation. In order to enhance the convergence, we develop a simple
singularity reconstruction strategy by splitting the solution into a singular
part and a regular part, where the former captures explicitly the singularity.
We derive a new variational formulation for the regular part, and establish
that the Galerkin approximation of the regular part can achieve a better
convergence order in the $L^2(0,1)$, $H^{\al/2}(0,1)$ and $L^\infty(0,1)$-norms
than the standard Galerkin approach, with a convergence rate for the recovered
singularity strength identical with the $L^2(0,1)$ error estimate. The
reconstruction approach is very flexible in handling explicit singularity, and
it is further extended to the case of a Neumann type boundary condition on the
left end point, which involves a strong singularity $x^{\al-2}$. Extensive
numerical results confirm the theoretical study and efficiency of the proposed
approach.

Filippov systems and can have attracting periodic orbits involving segments
that are contained on a discontinuity surface of the vector field. In this
paper we consider the addition of small noise to a general Filippov system and
study the resulting stochastic dynamics near such a periodic orbit. Since a
straight-forward asymptotic expansion in terms of the noise amplitude is not
possible due to the presence of discontinuity surfaces, in order to
quantitatively determine the basic statistical properties of the dynamics, we
treat different parts of the periodic orbit separately. Dynamics distant from
discontinuity surfaces is analyzed by the use of a series expansion of the
transitional probability density function. Stochastically perturbed sliding
motion is analyzed through stochastic averaging methods. The influence of noise
on points at which the periodic orbit escapes a discontinuity surface is
determined by zooming into the transition point. We combine the results to
quantitatively determine the effect of noise on the oscillation time for a
three-dimensional canonical model of relay control. For some parameter values
of this model, small noise induces a significantly large reduction in the
average oscillation time. By interpreting our results geometrically, we are
able to identify four features of the relay control system that contribute to
this phenomenon.

between ferromagnetism and Kondo effect in this effective model is studied
within a generalized mean-field approximation. Several regimes are obtained,

Kondo temperature is smaller than the Curie temperature ($T_K<T_C$). We propose
that some aspects of uranium and neptunium compounds that present coexistence

is a set of derivative-free additive directional terms obtainable through a
change of measures en route to the imposition of any stipulated conditions
aimed at driving the realized design variables (particles) to the global
optimum. The generalized setting offered by the new approach also enables
several basic ideas, used with other global search methods such as the particle
swarm or the differential evolution, to be rationally incorporated in the
proposed setup via a change of measures. The global search may be further aided
by imparting to the directional update terms additional layers of random
perturbations such as scrambling and selection. Depending on the precise choice
of the optimality conditions and the extent of random perturbation, the search
can be readily rendered either greedy or more exploratory. As numerically
demonstrated, the new proposal appears to provide for a more rational, more
accurate and faster alternative to most available evolutionary optimization
schemes, prominent amongst which are the differential evolution and the
particle swarm methods.

the decay of the hyperons $\Lambda(1115)$ and $\Lambda(1405)$. In addition to
the $pp$ final state interaction (FSI) parametrized using the Jost function, we
have also considered the $K^+K^-$ FSI with the techniques of the chiral unitary
approach, where the scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ were dynamically
generated. Hence, the contributions from scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and
$a_0(980)$ occur through the $K^+ K^-$ FSI. It is shown that the available
experimental data are well reproduced, especially the total cross sections and
the invariant mass distributions of $pp$ and $K^+K^-$. Furthermore, different
forms of the couplings (pseudoscalar and pseudovector) for the $\pi NN$
interaction and different strengths for the proton-proton FSI are also
investigated. It is found that the contributions from hyperon $\Lambda(1115)$
and $\Lambda(1405)$ are different between these two kinds of couplings. On the
other hand, the effects of the proton-proton FSI can be adjusted by the cut off
parameters used in the form factors.

small and can be treated using perturbation theory. The major obstacle on this
route comes from the fact that the SO interaction can also polarize the
electron system and produce additional contributions to the perturbation
theory, arising from the electron-electron interactions. In electronic
structure calculations, it may even lead to necessity to abandon the
perturbation theory and return to the self-consistently solution of
Kohn-Sham-like equations with the effective potential $\hat{v}$, incorporating
the effects of the electron-electron interactions and the SO coupling, even
though the latter is small. In this work, we present the theory of
self-consistent linear response (SCLR), which allows us to get rid of numerical
self-consistency and formulate it analytically in the first order of the SO
coupling. This strategy is applied to the Hartree-Fock solution of the
effective Hubbard model, derived from electronic structure calculations in the
Wannier basis. By using $\hat{v}$, obtained from SCLR, one can successfully
reproduce results of ordinary calculations for the orbital magnetization and
other properties in the first order of the SO coupling. Particularly, SCLR
appears to be extremely useful for calculations of antisymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions based on the magnetic force theorem.
Furthermore, due to the powerful 2n+1 theorem, the SCLR theory allows us to
calculate the magnetic anisotropy energy up to the third order of the SO
coupling. The fruitfulness of this approach is illustrated on a number of
example, including the spin canting in YTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$, formation of
spiral magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, and the magnetic inversion symmetry
breaking in BiMnO$_3$, which gives rise to both ferroelectric activity and DM
interactions, responsible for the ferromagnetism.

However, regression is not informative enough if the conditional density is
multimodal, heteroscedastic, and asymmetric. In such a case, estimating the
conditional density itself is preferable, but conditional density estimation
(CDE) is challenging in high-dimensional space. A naive approach to coping with
high-dimensionality is to first perform dimensionality reduction (DR) and then
execute CDE. However, such a two-step process does not perform well in practice
because the error incurred in the first DR step can be magnified in the second
CDE step. In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot procedure that performs
CDE and DR simultaneously in an integrated way. Our key idea is to formulate DR
as the problem of minimizing a squared-loss variant of conditional entropy, and
this is solved via CDE. Thus, an additional CDE step is not needed after DR. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method through extensive experiments
on various datasets including humanoid robot transition and computer art.

support for these while preserving high query performance. Hive using the

ensembles of nuclear spins, or cold atoms in an optical lattice. When applied
to spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized spins, which enhance the
signal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). According to this cooling
approach, spin-half nuclei in a constant magnetic field are considered as bits,
or more precisely, quantum bits, in a known probability distribution.
Algorithmic steps on these bits are then translated into specially designed NMR
pulse sequences using common NMR quantum computation tools. The $algorithmic$
cooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible,
entropy-preserving manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms)
with $selective$ $reset$, the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the
environment. In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently large spin
systems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to conservation of
Shannon entropy.
  Here, only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call this
process ""heat-bath"" cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally
implement here two consecutive steps of selective reset that transfer entropy
from two selected spins to the environment. We performed such cooling
experiments with commercially-available labeled molecules, on standard
liquid-state NMR spectrometers. Our experiments yielded polarizations that
$bypass$ $Shannon's$ $entropy$-$conservation$ $bound$, so that the entire
spin-system was cooled. This paper was initially submitted in 2005, first to
Science and then to PNAS, and includes additional results from subsequent years
(e.g. for resubmission in 2007). The Postscriptum includes more details.

discovery of giant radio source J2345-0449 (z=0.0755), a clear and extremely
rare counter example where relativistic jets are ejected from a luminous and
massive spiral galaxy on scale of ~1.6 Mpc, the largest known so far. Extreme
physical properties observed for this bulgeless spiral host, such as its high
optical and infra-red luminosity, large dynamical mass, rapid disk rotation,
and episodic jet activity are possibly the results of its unusual formation
history, which has also assembled, via gas accretion from a disk, its central
black hole of mass >2 x 10^8 M_sun. The very high mid-IR luminosity of the
galaxy suggests that it is actively forming stars and still building a massive
disk. We argue that the launch of these powerful jets is facilitated by an
advection dominated, magnetized accretion flow at low Eddington rate onto this
unusually massive (for a bulgeless disk galaxy) and possibly fast-spinning
central black hole. Therefore, J2345-0449 is an extremely rare, unusual
galactic system whose properties challenge the standard paradigms for black
hole growth and formation of relativistic jets in disk galaxies. Thus, it
provides fundamental insight into accretion disk -- relativistic jet coupling
processes.

galaxy of the Perseus Cluster), detected by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, in the
framework of the ""spine-layer"" scenario, in which the jet is assumed to be
characterized by a velocity structure, with a fast spine surrounded by a slower
layer. The existence of such a structure in the parsec scale jet of NGC 1275
has been recently proved through VLBI observations. We discuss the constraints
that the observed spectral energy distribution imposes to the parameters and we
present three alternative models, corresponding to three different choices of
the angles between the jet and the line of sight ($\theta_{\rm v}=6^{\circ},
18^{\circ}$ and 25$^{\circ}$). While for the the case with $\theta_{\rm
v}=6^{\circ}$ we obtain an excellent fit, we consider this solution unlikely,
since such small angles seems to be excluded by radio observations of the
large-scale jet. For $\theta_{\rm v}=25^{\circ}$ the required large intrinsic
luminosity of the soft (IR--optical) component of the spine determines a large
optical depth for $\gamma$-rays through the pair production scattering $\gamma
\gamma\rightarrow e^+ e^-$, implying a narrow cut--off at $\sim50$~GeV. We
conclude that intermediate angles are required. In this case the low frequency
and the high--energy emissions are produced by two separate regions and, in
principle, a full variety of correlations is expected. The correlation observed
between the optical and the $\gamma$-ray flux, close to linearity, is likely
linked to variations of the emissivity of the spine.

model for the nucleon-nucleus scattering. In nuclear matter, chiral 3NF at NNLO
level (mainly the 2$\pi$-exchange diagram) makes the single particle potential
less attractive for the singlet-even channel and more absorptive for the
triplet channels. The single-particle potential calculated from chiral
two-nucleon force (2NF) at N$^{3}$LO level is found to be close to that from
Bonn-B 2NF. The Melbourne $g$-matrix interaction is a practical effective
interaction constructed by localizing the $g$-matrices calculated from Bonn-B
2NF. We then introduce the chiral-3NF effects to the local Melbourne $g$-matrix
interaction. For nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering on various targets at 65
MeV, chiral 3NF makes the folding potential less attractive and more
absorptive. The novel property for the imaginary part is originated in the
enhancement of tensor correlations due to chiral 3NF. The two effects are small
for differential cross sections and vector analyzing powers at the forward and
middle angles where the experimental data are available. If backward
measurements are done, the data will reveal the effects of chiral 3NF.

region $G\subset\mathbb R^2$ are considered. The domain of these operators
consists of functions from the Sobolev space $W_2^m(G)$ being generalized
solutions of the corresponding $2m$-order elliptic equation with right-hand
side from $L_2(G)$ and satisfying homogeneous nonlocal boundary conditions. It
is known that such unbounded operators have the Fredholm property. It is proved
in the paper that low-order terms in the differential equation do not affect
the index of the operator. Conditions under which nonlocal perturbations on the
boundary do not change the index are also formulated.

also visible in balloon soundings of distal volcanic plumes. Near the vent,
some proposed charging mechanisms are fractoemission, triboelectrification, and
the so-called ""dirty thunderstorm"" mechanism, which is where ash and convective
clouds interact electrically to enhance charging. Distant from the vent, a
self-charging mechanism, probably triboelectrification, has been suggested to
explain the sustained low levels of charge observed on a distal plume. Recent
research by Houghton et al. (2013) linked the self-charging of volcanic ash to
the properties of the particle size distribution, observing that a highly
polydisperse ash distribution would charge more effectively than a monodisperse
one. Natural radioactivity in some volcanic ash could also contribute to
self-charging of volcanic plumes. Here we present laboratory measurements of

in handling problems with any crystal structure or topology of the Fermi

mass-transfer in binary systems (MT-BSSs).Depleted surface abundances of C and
O are expected for MT-BSSs,whereas no chemical anomalies are predicted for
COL-BSSs. Both MT and COL-BSSs should rotate fast,but braking mechanisms may
intervene with efficiencies and time-scales unknown,thus preventing a clear
prediction of the expected rotational velocities. In this context,an extensive
survey is ongoing by using FLAMES@VLT, with the aim to obtain abundance
patterns and rotational velocities for representative samples of BSSs in
Galactic GCs.A sub-population of CO-depleted BSSs has been identified in 47
Tuc,with only one fast rotating star detected (Ferraro et al.2006). For this
PhD Thesis work I analyzed FLAMES spectra of more than 130 BSSs in 4 GCs:M4,NGC
6397,M30 and {\omega}Centauri.This is the largest BSS sample spectroscopically
investigated so far.Hints of CO-depletion have been observed in only 4-5 cases
(in M30 and {\omega}Centauri),suggesting either that the majority of BSSs have
a collisional origin, or that CO- depletion is a transient
phenomenon.Unfortunately,no conclusions in terms of formation mechanism could
be drawn in a large number of cases,because of the effects of radiative
levitation.Remarkably,this is the first time that evidence of radiative
levitation is found in BSSs hotter than 8200 K.Finally,we also discovered the
largest fractions of fast rotating BSSs ever observed in any GCs:40% in M4 and
30% in {\omega}Centauri. While not solving the problem of BSS formation,these

general emerging class of sampling algorithms. One of the main ideas behind
exact approximations consists of replacing intractable quantities required to
run standard MCMC algorithms, such as the target probability density in a
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with estimators. Perhaps surprisingly, such
approximations lead to powerful algorithms which are exact in the sense that
they are guaranteed to have correct limiting distributions. In this paper we
discover a general framework which allows one to compare, or order, performance
measures of two implementations of such algorithms. In particular, we establish
an order with respect to the mean acceptance probability, the first
autocorrelation coefficient, the asymptotic variance and the right spectral
gap. The key notion to guarantee the ordering is that of the convex order
between estimators used to implement the algorithms. We believe that our convex
order condition is close to optimal, and this is supported by a counter-example
which shows that a weaker variance order is not sufficient. The convex order
plays a central role by allowing us to construct a martingale coupling which
enables the comparison of performance measures of Markov chain with differing
invariant distributions, contrary to existing results. We detail applications
of our result by identifying extremal distributions within given classes of
approximations, by showing that averaging replicas improves performance in a
monotonic fashion and that stratification is guaranteed to improve performance
for the standard implementation of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
MCMC method.

particle hydrodynamics zoom-in resimulations. We construct mock three-colour
images and show that the models reproduce observed trends in the evolution of
galaxy colours and morphologies. However, only a small fraction of galaxies
contains bars. Many galaxies go through phases of central mass growth by
in-situ star formation driven by gas-rich mergers or misaligned gas infall.
These events lead to accretion of low-angular momentum gas to the centres and
leave imprints on the distributions of z=0 stellar circularities, radii and
metallicities as functions of age. Observations of the evolution of structural
properties of samples of disc galaxies at z=2.5-0.0 infer continuous mass
assembly at all radii. Our simulations can only explain this if there is a
significant contribution from mergers or misaligned infall, as expected in a
LambdaCDM universe. Quiescent merger histories lead to high kinematic disc
fractions and inside-out growth, but show little central growth after the last
`destructive' merger at z>1.5. For sufficiently strong feedback, as assumed in
our models, a moderate amount of merging does not seem to be a problem for the
z=0 disc galaxy population, but may rather be a requirement. The average
profiles of simulated disc galaxies agree with observations at z>=1.5. At z<=1,
there is too much growth in size and too little growth in central mass,
possibly due to the under-abundance of bars. The discrepancies may partly be
caused by differences between the star formation histories of the simulations
and those assumed for observations.

Virasoro algebra and Cardy formula. Using the fact that the conformal spacetime
admits conformal Killing vector and the horizon is determined by the vanishing

difference in this case is that the area is modified by the conformal factor

the aggregate link throughput through properly setting the occurrence

from prior work in which CSMA protocol parameters are adaptively adjusted to
achieve better performance, in this paper we propose to achieve maximal link
throughputs by adjusting the rates of the traffic pumped into the source nodes
of links, which runs in a software manner and is more practical to implement in

increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known about what affects
the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to
identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that
predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and
recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We
studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits
(geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that
homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar
traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for
acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and
recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did
not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits
had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than
males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and
older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first
heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased
in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media).
These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike
other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings
suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for
increased speed.

their surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets
have been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is
still unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary
rotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive
multiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as
originally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this
deep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines
mechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a
compressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \Omega \langle H_\rho^{-1} \rangle
v_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\langle
H_\rho^{-1} \rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is
the typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the
anelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of
the predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems
deeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form
spontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy
staircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding
those typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in
spherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines
scaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak
vertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a
large number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than
predicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context.

(D2D) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. D2D enables efficient reuse
of the licensed spectrum to support localized transmissions, while M2M
connections are often characterized by fixed and low transmission rates. D2D
connections can be instrumental in localized aggregation of uplink M2M traffic
to a more capable cellular device, before being finally delivered to the Base
Station (BS). In this paper we show that a fixed M2M rate is an enabler of
efficient Machine-Type D2D underlay operation taking place simultaneously with
another \emph{downlink} cellular transmission. In the considered scenario, a BS
$B$ transmits to a user $U$, while there are $N_M$ Machine-Type Devices (MTDs)
attached to $U$, all sending simultaneously to $U$ and each using the same rate
$R_M$. While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering
channels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate
that can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink
signal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple
access channel and the fixed rate $R_M$. We also consider the case of a
simpler, single-user decoder at $U$ with successive interference cancellation.
However, with single-user decoder, a positive zero-outage rate exists only when
$N_M=1$ and is zero when $N_M>1$. This implies that joint decoding is
instrumental in enabling fixed-rate underlay operation.

we found that this maser feature is not the best to represent the annual
parallax to S269 IRS 2w because the morphology is remarkably elongated in the
east-west direction. For this study we have selected another maser feature
showing simpler morphology. This makes the new annual parallax estimate more
credible. Our newly obtained annual parallax is 0.247+/-0.034 mas,
corresponding to 4.05+0.65-0.49 kpc. This value is well consistent with the
3.7-3.8 kpc obtained using the kinematic distance estimates and photometric
distance modulus. We considered two hypotheses for the water maser spatial
distribution, a bipolar outflow and an expanding ring, in a kinematic model
fitting analysis with a radially expanding flow. At this stage, any conclusions
about the systemic proper motion could not be drawn from the kinematic
analysis. Alternatively, we evaluated the mean proper motion to be
(0.39+/-0.92, -1.27+/-0.90) mas/yr eastward and northward, respectively, from

indicators from DIA of well-sampled optical data and under-sampled
near-infrared data from the OGLE and VVV surveys, respectively. We search for a
figure-of-merit (FoM) which could be used to select reference images for each
survey. While we do not find a universally applicable FoM, survey-specific
measures indicate that the effect of spatial under-sampling may require a
change in strategy from the standard DIA approach, even though seeing remains
the primary criterion. We find that background is not an important criterion
for reference selection, at least for the dynamic range in the images we test.
For our analysis of VVV data in particular, we find that spatial under-sampling
is best handled by reversing the standard DIA procedure and convolving target
images to a better-sampled (poor seeing) reference image.

tend to be correlated with the regional dynamics (i.e., community core changes
between community members). In particular, the Asia-Oceania community
disappeared and reemerged over time along with a switch in leadership from
Japan to China. Moreover, simulation results show that the global dynamics can

diagrams of coeval stellar populations. We study, from a theoretical point of
view, the impact of axial rotation of stars on various observed properties of
single-aged stellar populations: magnitude at the turnoff, photometric
properties of evolved stars, surface velocities, surface abundances, and the
impact of rotation on the age determination of clusters by an isochrone
fitting. Stellar models for different initial masses, metallicities, and
zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) rotational velocities are used for building
interpolated stellar tracks, isochrones, and synthetic clusters for various
ages and metallicities. The synthetic populations account for the effects of
the initial distribution of the rotational velocities on the ZAMS, the impact
of the inclination angle and the effects of gravity and limb darkening,
unresolved binaries and photometric errors. Interpolated tracks, isochrones,
and synthetic clusters can be computed through a public web interface. For
clusters with a metallicity in the range [0.002, 0.014] and an age between 30
Myr and 1 Gyr, the fraction of fast rotators on the main sequence (MS) band is
the largest just below the turnoff. This is a natural consequence of the
increase in the MS lifetime due to rotation. The fraction of fast rotators one
magnitude below the turnoff also increases with the age of the cluster between
30 Myr and 1 Gyr. There is an increase in the fraction of enriched stars when
the metallicity decreases. We show that the use of isochrones computed from
rotating stellar models with an initial rotation that is representative of the
average initial rotation of the stars in clusters provides a reasonable
estimate of the age, even though stars in a real cluster did not start their
evolution with an identical initial rotation.

cooling law prescription via two-dimensional simulations in the shearing sheet
approximation. It is well known that structures arising in the gaseous
component of the disc due to a gravitational instability can have a significant
effect on the evolution of dust particles. Previous results have shown that
spiral density waves can be highly efficient at collecting dust particles,
creating significant local over-densities of particles. The degree of such
concentrations has been shown to be dependent on two parameters: the size of
the dust particles and the rate of gas cooling. We expand on these findings,
including the self-gravity of dust particles, to see how these particle
over-densities evolve. We use the PENCIL CODE to solve the local shearing sheet
equations for gas on a fixed grid together with the equations of motion for
solids coupled to the gas through an aerodynamic drag force. We find that the
enhancements in the surface density of particles in spiral density wave crests
can reach levels high enough to allow the solid component of the disc to
collapse under its own self-gravity. This produces many gravitationally bound
collections of particles within the spiral structure. The total mass contained
in bound structures appears nearly independent of the cooling time, suggesting
that the formation of planetesimals through dust particle trapping by
self-gravitating density waves may be possible at a larger range of radii
within a disc than previously thought. So, density waves due to gravitational
instabilities in the early stages of star formation may provide excellent sites
for the rapid formation of many large, planetesimal-sized objects.

added at the tip of the tether to assist with the deployment. During E-sail
experiment the tether shall be charged to 500~V potential. Both positive and
negative voltages shall be experimented with. The voltage is provided by a
dedicated high voltage source and delivered to the tether through a slip ring
contact. When the negative voltage is applied to the tether, the satellite body
is expected to attract electron flow capable of compensating for the ion flow,

turbulence, either with helical or non-helical forcing, we show that the ratio
of kinetic-to-magnetic energy dissipation always increases with the magnetic
Prandtl number, i.e., the ratio of kinematic viscosity to magnetic diffusivity.
This dependence can always be approximated by a power law, but the exponent is
not the same in all cases. For non-helical turbulence, the exponent is around
1/3, while for helical turbulence it is between 0.6 and 2/3. In the
statistically steady state, the rate of the energy conversion from kinetic into
magnetic by the dynamo must be equal to the Joule dissipation rate. We
emphasize that for both small-scale and large-scale dynamos, the efficiency of
energy conversion depends sensitively on the magnetic Prandtl number, and thus
on the microphysical dissipation process. To understand this behavior, we also
study shell models of turbulence and one-dimensional passive and active scalar
models. We conclude that the magnetic Prandtl number dependence is

studied real time logics. It exhibits considerable diversity in expressiveness
and decidability properties based on the permitted set of modalities and the
nature of time interval constraints $I$. Henzinger et al., in their seminal
paper showed that the non-punctual fragment of $\mathsf{MTL}$ called
$\mathsf{MITL}$ is decidable. In this paper, we sharpen this decidability
result by showing that the partially punctual fragment of $\mathsf{MTL}$
(denoted $\mathsf{PMTL}$) is decidable over strictly monotonic finite point
wise time. In this fragment, we allow either punctual future modalities, or
punctual past modalities, but never both together. We give two satisfiability
preserving reductions from $\mathsf{PMTL}$ to the decidable logic
$\mathsf{MTL}[\until_I]$. The first reduction uses simple projections, while
the second reduction uses a novel technique of temporal projections with
oversampling. We study the trade-off between the two reductions: while the
second reduction allows the introduction of extra action points in the
underlying model, the equisatisfiable $\mathsf{MTL}[\until_I]$ formula obtained
is exponentially succinct than the one obtained via the first reduction, where
no oversampling of the underlying model is needed. We also show that
$\mathsf{PMTL}$ is strictly more expressive than the fragments
$\mathsf{MTL}[\until_I,\since]$ and $\mathsf{MTL}[\until,\since_I]$.

has a neutron star or white dwarf companion with a spin period of 19.2 s. After
HD 49798, which has a massive white dwarf companion spinning at 13.2 s in an
1.55 day orbit, this is only the second O-type subdwarf from which X-ray
emission has been detected. We report preliminary results of our ongoing
campaign to obtain time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy using the CAFE
instrument at Calar Alto observatory and SARG at the Telescopio Nationale
Galileo. Atmospheric parameters were derived via a quantitative NLTE spectral
analysis. The line fits hint at an unusually large projected rotation velocity.
Therefore it seemed likely that BD+37 442 is a binary similar to HD 49798 and
that the orbital period is also similar. The level of X-ray emission from BD+37
442 could be explained by accretion from the sdO wind by a neutron star
orbiting at a period of less than ten days. Hence, we embarked on radial
velocity monitoring in order to derive the binary parameters of the BD+37 442
system and obtained 41 spectra spread out over several month in 2012. Unlike
for HD\,49798, no radial velocity variations were found and, hence, there is no
dynamical evidence for the existence of a compact companion yet. The origin of
the pulsed X-ray emission remains as a mystery.

Surprisingly, excitable behavior in the whole system sets in only if the

decisions analysis based on the use of pairwise comparisons. It allows that the
ranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) are
initially known, whilst the ranks for the other concepts have yet to be
estimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of
every single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of
priorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has
admissible solution if the inconsistency of pairwise comparisons is not too
high. The proposed approach adopts the heuristics according to which to
determine the missing priorities a weighted geometric mean is used. In this
approach, despite an increased complexity, the solution always exists and their
existence does not depend on the inconsistency of the input matrix. Thus, the
presented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than
the previous method. The formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics
is accompanied by two numerical examples.

representation. The Schroedinger picture is interesting because it is well
suited to explore properties of the vacuum state in the non-perturbative
regime. Yet, not much analytical work has been done on this subject, and even
the topic of perturbation theory in the Schroedinger representation is not well
developed, especially in the case of gauge theories. In a paper by Hatfield
[Phys.Lett.B 147, 435 (1984)] the vacuum wave functional for SU(2) theory was
computed to O(e). In the non-perturbative regime, the most sophisticated
analytical approach has been developed by Karabali et al. in a series of papers
(see [Nucl.Phys.B 824, 387 (2010)] and references therein). This thesis aims to
put perturbation theory in the Schroedinger representation on more solid ground
by computing the vacuum wave functional for a general gauge group SU$(N_c)$ up
to O$(e^2)$, utilizing modifications of these two methods. This is important
since it provides us with a tool for testing non-perturbative approaches, which
should reproduce the perturbative result in an appropriate limit.
  Furthermore, regularization and renormalization are also not well understood
in the Schroedinger picture. The regularization method proposed by Karabali et
al. leads to conflicting results when applied to the computation of the vacuum
wave functional with the two different methods mentioned above. We aim to
clarify how regularization should be implemented and develop a new
regularization approach, which brings these two expressions into agreement,
providing a strong check of the regularization employed. We argue that this
regularization procedure is not specific to the cases studied here. It should
be applied in the same way to any quantum field theory in any dimension in the
Schroedinger picture.

  fixed-parameter tractability for parameter k+t using the technique of
  randomized contractions",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Steiner Multicut problem asks, given an undirected graph G, terminals
sets T1,...,Tt $\subseteq$ V(G) of size at most p, and an integer k, whether
there is a set S of at most k edges or nodes s.t. of each set Ti at least one
pair of terminals is in different connected components of G \ S. This problem
generalizes several graph cut problems, in particular the Multicut problem (the
case p = 2), which is fixed-parameter tractable for the parameter k [Marx and
Razgon, Bousquet et al., STOC 2011].
  We provide a dichotomy of the parameterized complexity of Steiner Multicut.
That is, for any combination of k, t, p, and the treewidth tw(G) as constant,
parameter, or unbounded, and for all versions of the problem (edge deletion and
node deletion with and without deletable terminals), we prove either that the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable or that the problem is hard (W[1]-hard or
even (para-)NP-complete). We highlight that:
  - The edge deletion version of Steiner Multicut is fixed-parameter tractable
for the parameter k+t on general graphs (but has no polynomial kernel, even on
trees). We present two proofs: one using the randomized contractions technique
of Chitnis et al, and one relying on new structural lemmas that decompose the
Steiner cut into important separators and minimal s-t cuts.
  - In contrast, both node deletion versions of Steiner Multicut are W[1]-hard
for the parameter k+t on general graphs.
  - All versions of Steiner Multicut are W[1]-hard for the parameter k, even
when p=3 and the graph is a tree plus one node. Hence, the results of Marx and
Razgon, and Bousquet et al. do not generalize to Steiner Multicut.
  Since we allow k, t, p, and tw(G) to be any constants, our characterization
includes a dichotomy for Steiner Multicut on trees (for tw(G) = 1), and a
polynomial time versus NP-hardness dichotomy (by restricting k,t,p,tw(G) to
constant or unbounded).

finite-time thermodynamics, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition
for the universality of efficiency at maximum power, which states that a
tight-coupling heat engine takes the universal efficiency at maximum power up
to the quadratic order if and only if either the engine symmetrically interacts
with two heat reservoirs or the elementary thermal energy flowing through the
engine matches the characteristic energy of the engine. As a result, we solve
the following paradox: On the one hand, the universal quadratic term in the

concept is the surjectivity of the adjoint of the geodesic ray transform, or
equivalently the existence of certain distributions that are invariant under
geodesic flow. We prove that on any Anosov manifold, one can find invariant
distributions with controlled first Fourier coefficients. The proof is based on
subelliptic type estimates and a Pestov identity. We present an alternative
construction valid on manifolds with nonpositive curvature, based on the fact
that a natural Beurling transform on such manifolds turns out to be essentially
a contraction. Finally, we obtain uniqueness results in tensor tomography both
on simple and Anosov manifolds that improve earlier results by assuming a

In particular, taken at face value, the model significantly overestimates the
number of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way. Attempts to solve this
problem remain open to debate and have even led some to abandon CDM altogether.
However, current simulations are limited by the assumption that dark matter
feels only gravity. Here, we show that including interactions between CDM and
radiation (photons or neutrinos) leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of
satellite galaxies, alleviating the Milky Way satellite problem and indicating
that physics beyond gravity may be essential to make accurate predictions of
structure formation on small scales. The methodology introduced here gives
constraints on dark matter interactions that are significantly improved over
those from the cosmic microwave background.

Far Infrared (FIR) properties of radio-selected AGN. To this purpose, from
VLA-COSMOS we considered the 1537, F[1.4 GHz]>0.06 mJy sources with a reliable
redshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming galaxies and AGN
solely on the basis of their radio luminosity. The AGN sample is complete with
respect to radio selection at all z<~3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpart
in the PEP catalogue. 175 are AGN. Their redshift distribution closely
resembles that of the total radio-selected AGN population, and exhibits two
marked peaks at z~0.9 and z~2.5. We find that the probability for a
radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR wavelengths is both a function of
radio power and redshift, whereby powerful sources are more likely to be FIR
emitters at earlier epochs. This is due to two distinct effects: 1) at all
radio luminosities, FIR activity monotonically increases with look-back time
and 2) radio activity of AGN origin is increasingly less effective at
inhibiting FIR emission. Radio-selected AGN with FIR emission are
preferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hosting
FIR-inactive sources. Furthermore, at all z<~2, there seems to be a
preferential (stellar) mass scale M ~[10^{10}-10^{11}] Msun which maximizes the
chances for FIR emission. We find such FIR (and MIR) emission to be due to
processes indistinguishable from those which power star-forming galaxies. It
follows that radio emission in at least 35% of the entire AGN population is the
sum of two contributions: AGN accretion and star-forming processes within the
host galaxy.

of Baire category, shows a simple, but highly non-intuitive curvature
behaviour: at almost all of its boundary points, in the sense of measure, all
curvatures are zero, but there is also a dense and uncountable set of boundary
points at which all curvatures are infinite. The purpose of this paper is to
find a counterpart to this phenomenon for typical convex bodies of given

that for a typical $n$-dimensional convex body of constant width $1$ (without
loss of generality), at almost all boundary points, in the sense of measure,
all curvatures are equal to $1$. (In contrast, note that a ball of width $1$
has radius $1/2$, hence all its curvatures are equal to $2$.) Since the
property of constant width is linear with respect to Minkowski addition, the
proof requires recourse to a linear curvature notion, which is provided by the
tangential radii of curvature.

Multi-Hop (IMH) architectures. It is shown that, for both cases, there exist
\emph{critical bandwidth scalings} above which increasing the bandwidth no
longer increases the feasible rate per node. These critical thresholds coincide
exactly with the bandwidths where, for each architecture, the network
transitions from being degrees-of-freedom-limited to power-limited. For ISH,
this critical bandwidth threshold is lower than IMH when the number of users
per base station grows with network size. This result suggests that multi-hop
transmissions may be necessary to fully exploit large bandwidth degrees of

which are likely of extragalactic origin, allows one to severely constrain
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in the neutrino sector, allowing for the
possible existence of superluminal neutrinos. The subsequent neutrino energy
loss by vacuum $e^+e^-$ pair emission (VPE) is strongly dependent on the
strength of LIV. In this paper we explore the physics and cosmology of
superluminal neutrino propagation. We consider a conservative scenario for the
redshift distribution of neutrino sources. Then by propagating a generic
neutrino spectrum, using Monte Carlo techniques to take account of energy
losses from both VPE and redshifting, we obtain the best present constraints on
LIV parameters involving neutrinos. We find that $\delta_{\nu e} = \delta_{\nu}
- \delta_e \le 5.2 \times 10^{-21}$. Taking $\delta_e \le 5 \times 10^{-21}$,
we then obtain an upper limit on the superluminal velocity fraction for
neutrinos alone of $1.0 \times 10^{-20}$. Interestingly, by taking $\delta_{\nu
e} = 5.2 \times 10^{-21}$, we obtain a cutoff in the predicted neutrino
spectrum above 2 PeV that is consistent with the lack of observed neutrinos at
those energies, and particularly at the Glashow resonance energy of 6.3 PeV.
Thus, such a cutoff could be the result of neutrinos being slightly
superluminal, with $\delta_{\nu}$ being $(0.5 \ {\rm to} \ 1.0) \times
10^{-20}$.

difference between the two 1D component models ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$),
and the relative surface area covered. Synthetic observable quantities from the
1.5D stars are fitted with quantities from NLTE and local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) 1D models to assess the errors in inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$
values from assuming horizontal homogeneity and LTE. Five different quantities
are fit to determine the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ of the 1.5D stars: UBVRI
photometric colors, absolute surface flux SEDs, relative SEDs, continuum
normalized spectra, and TiO band profiles. In all cases except the TiO band
profiles, the inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ value increases with increasing
$\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$. In all cases, the inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ value
from fitting 1D LTE quantities is higher than from fitting 1D NLTE quantities
and is approximately constant as a function of $\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$

caused indirectly by the NLTE temperature structure of the upper atmosphere, as
the bands are computed in LTE. We conclude that the difference between
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values derived from NLTE and LTE modelling is relatively
insensitive to the degree of the horizontal inhomogeneity of the star being

static and spherically symmetric black hole in the presence of quintessence
matter and external magnetic field. We explore the conditions under which the
particle moving around the black hole could escape to infinity after colliding
with another particle. The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for the
particles are studied in detail. Mainly the dependence of ISCO on dark energy
and on the presence of external magnetic field in the vicinity of black hole is
discussed. By using the Lyapunov exponent, we compare the stabilities of the
orbits of the particles in the presence and absence of dark energy and magnetic
field. The expressions for the center of mass energies of the colliding
particles near the horizon of the black hole are derived. The effective force
on the particles due to dark energy and magnetic field in the vicinity of black
hole is also discussed.

energy (NADE) model and $f(G)$ theory of gravity with $G$ representing the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant in the flat FRW spacetime. In this context, we assume a
solution of the scale factor in power-law form and study the correspondence
scenario. A new agegraphic $f(G)$ model is constructed and discussed
graphically for the evolution of the universe. Using this model, we investigate
the different eras of the expanding universe and stability with the help of the
equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{eff}$ and squared speed of sound
$v_s^2$, respectively. It is mentioned here that the reconstructed model
represents the quintessence era of the accelerated expansion of the universe
with instability. Moreover, the statefinder trajectories are studied and we
find out that the model is not capable of reaching the $\Lambda$CDM phase of
the universe.

These data are exhausted by results for d=4,5 from scaling in

All these data are compatible with the theoretical scaling dependencies
obtained from self-consistent theory of localization by Vollhardt and Woelfle.

Households debt ""rapid increase and abrupt retrenchment"" among the causes of
macroeconomic instability in the European Union after 2008. In our research: i)
we accessed the Bank of Italy Online Statistical Database on Customers and Risk
for Producer Households and Non-Financial Corporations with R Sweave open
access statistical software, which makes our analysis freely reproducible by
other researchers; ii) we subset the European System of Accounts sector
Households into the Bank of Italy sub-sectors Households and Producer
Households, which are market producing entities limited to informal
partnerships, de facto companies and sole proprietorships with up to five
employees and iii) we tested the hypothesis of ""rapid increase and abrupt
retrenchment"" of debt for this subset in Italy for the period 1996-2013. We
found that PH debt (bad debt) has been more stable with a lower Variation
Coefficient of 10.3% (14.2%) versus 13.2% (20.1%) in NFC. We also found that
the time series of the ratio of debt granted to NFC (numerator) versus PH
(denominator) is best described (Multiple Squared 0.95) by the concavity of the
5th degree coefficient (slope -1.22; 95% CI -1.52 - -0.91) of a 5th order
polynomial linear regression and by the convexity of the 2nd degree coefficient
(slope 4.26; 95% CI 2.53 - 5.99) for bad debt (Multiple R Squared 0.47), with
this concavity of debt and convexity of bad debt beginning with the Italian
crisis in the second trimester of 2008. We reject the hypothesis (p < 0.01) of
""rapid increase and abrupt retrenchment"" of debt for the subset Producer
Households during the Italian Crisis. We generate the hypothesis that this
subset could represent a prospective source of stability relative to
Non-Financial Corporation.

  Theory and Copulas",,,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we use risk management techniques to evaluate the potential
effects of those operational risks that affect the energy production of a wind
farm. We concentrate our attention on three major risk factors: wind speed
uncertainty, wind turbine reliability and interactions of wind turbines due
mainly to their placement.
  As a first contribution, we show that the Weibull distribution, commonly used
to fit recorded wind speed data, underestimates rare events. Therefore, in
order to achieve a better estimation of the tail of the wind speed
distribution, we advance a Generalized Pareto distribution. The wind turbines
reliability is considered by modeling the failures events as a compound Poisson
process. Finally, the use of Copula able us to consider the correlation between
wind turbines that compose the wind farm. Once this procedure is set up, we
show a sensitivity analysis and we also compare the results from the proposed
procedure with those obtained by ignoring the aforementioned risk factors.
