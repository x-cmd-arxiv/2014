systems. Although they represent the simplest generalization of equilibrium
states, they exhibit a variety of new phenomena. Within a statistical mechanics
approach, these states have been the subject of several theoretical
investigations, both analytic and numerical. The macroscopic fluctuation
theory, based on a formula for the probability of joint space-time fluctuations
of thermodynamic variables and currents, provides a unified macroscopic
treatment of such states for driven diffusive systems. We give a detailed
review of this theory including its main predictions and most relevant
applications.

ionization of He by intense XUV laser radiation. We combine a detailed
B-spline-based wavefunction description in a extended inner region with a
single-electron outer region containing channels representing both single
ionization and double ionization. A comparison of wavefunction densities for
different box sizes demonstrates that the flow between the two regions is
described with excellent accuracy. The obtained two-photon double ionization
cross sections are in excellent agreement with other cross sections available.
Compared to calculations fully contained within a finite inner region, the
present calculations can be propagated over the time it takes the slowest
electron to reach the boundary.

SLEDs, we used new Herschel/SPIRE FTS data (from J=4-3 to J=13-12) and
ground-based observations for the lower-J CO transitions. The H2 SLEDs were
constructed using archival mid-IR Spitzer/IRS and near-IR VLT/SINFONI data for
the rotational and ro-vibrational H2 transitions, respectively. In total, the
SLEDs contain 26 transitions with upper level energies between 5 and 15000 K. A
single, constant density, model (n$_{H_2}$ ~ 10$^{4.5-6}$ cm$^{-3}$) with a
broken power-law temperature distribution reproduces well both the CO and H2
SLEDs. The power-law indices are $\beta_1$ ~ 1-3 for warm molecular gas (20 K <
T < 100 K) and $\beta_2$ ~ 4-5 for hot molecular gas (T > 100 K). We show that
the steeper temperature distribution (higher $\beta$) for hot molecular gas can
be explained by shocks and photodissociation region (PDR) models, however, the
exact $\beta$ values are not reproduced by PDR or shock models alone and a
combination of both is needed. We find that the three major mergers among our
targets have shallower temperature distributions for warm molecular gas than
the other three spiral galaxies. This can be explained by a higher relative
contribution of shock excitation, with respect to PDR excitation, for the warm
molecular gas in these mergers. For only one of the mergers, IRASF 05189-2524,
the shallower H2 temperature distribution differs from that of the spiral
galaxies. The presence of a bright active galactic nucleus in this source might
explain the warmer molecular gas observed.

receivers to cancel state interference. Furthermore, the helper also has its
own message to be sent simultaneously to its corresponding receiver. Since the
state information is known only to the helper, but not to the corresponding
transmitters $1,\dots,K$, transmitter-side state cognition and receiver-side

i.e., the state power goes to infinity. Three (sub)models are studied. Model I
serves as a basic model, which consists of only one transmitter-receiver (with
state corruption) pair in addition to a helper that assists the receiver to
cancel state in addition to transmitting its own message. Model II consists of
two transmitter-receiver pairs in addition to a helper, and only one receiver
is interfered by a state sequence. Model III generalizes model I include
multiple transmitter-receiver pairs with each receiver corrupted by independent

sharing problem, in which a dealer distributes one or multiple secrets among a
set of participants that for each secret only qualified sets of users can
recover it by pooling their shares together while non-qualified sets of users
obtain no information about the secret even if they pool their shares together.
While existing secret sharing systems (implicitly) assume that communications
between the dealer and participants are noiseless, this paper takes a more
practical assumption that the dealer delivers shares to the participants via a
noisy broadcast channel. An information theoretic approach is proposed, which
exploits the channel as additional resources to achieve secret sharing
requirements. In this way, secret sharing problems can be reformulated as
equivalent secure communication problems via wiretap channels, and can be
solved by employing powerful information theoretic security techniques. This
approach is first developed for the classic secret sharing problem, in which
only one secret is to be shared. This classic problem is shown to be equivalent
to a communication problem over a compound wiretap channel. The lower and upper
bounds on the secrecy capacity of the compound channel provide the
corresponding bounds on the secret sharing rate. The power of the approach is
further demonstrated by a more general layered multi-secret sharing problem,
which is shown to be equivalent to the degraded broadcast multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) channel with layered decoding and secrecy constraints.
The secrecy capacity region for the degraded MIMO broadcast channel is
characterized, which provides the secret sharing capacity region. Furthermore,
these secure encoding schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity region provide
an information theoretic scheme for sharing the secrets.

photoacoustic spectroscopy and thermal relaxation, the thermal diffusivity,

measured. The volume fraction of inclusions was systematically varied in order
to study the changes in the effective thermal conductivity of the composites.
In some samples, a static magnetic field was applied during the polymerization
process resulting in anisotropic inclusion distributions. Our results show a
decrease in the thermal conductivity of some of the anisotropic samples
compared to the isotropic randomly distributed ones. Our analysis indicates
that the development of elongated inclusion structures leads to the formation
of magnetite and resin domains causing this effect. We correlate the complexity

  Although the dynamics are linear, one can apply this framework to nonlinear
systems by encoding nonlinearity into the edge labels. We answer open question
from our previous work concerning the non-positiveness of the elements in the
inverse of a perturbed Laplacian matrix. Moreover, we provide a graph
theoretical framework for the computation of the inverse of a such matrix. This
also completes our previous framework and makes it purely graph theoretical.

evidence for competition between these phases and superconductivity as the
magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment are suppressed in the
superconducting state. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on
detwinned underdoped $Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$, we observe a coexistence of both
the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure.
Furthermore, our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity, the
SDW gap decreases in magnitude and shifts in a direction consistent with a
reduction of the orbital anisotropy. This observation provides direct
spectroscopic evidence for the dynamic competition between superconductivity
and both SDW and electronic nematic orders in these materials.

monoid congruence is perfect. We show that any such semigroup is isomorphic to
a `$W$-product' $W(T,Y)$, where $T$ is a monoid, $Y$ is a semilattice and there
is a homomorphism from $T$ into the inverse semigroup $TI_Y$ of isomorphisms
between ideals of $Y$. Conversely, all such $W$-products are almost perfect.
Since we also show that every restriction semigroup has an easily computed
cover of this type, the combination yields a `McAlister-type' theorem for all
restriction semigroups. It is one of the theses of this work that almost
perfection and perfection, the analogue of this definition for restriction
monoids, are the appropriate settings for such a theorem. That these theorems
do not reduce to a general theorem for inverse semigroups illustrates a second
thesis of this work: that restriction (and, by extension, Ehresmann) semigroups
have a rich theory that does not consist merely of generalizations of inverse
semigroup theory. It is then with some ambivalence that we show that all the
main results of this work easily generalize to encompass all proper restriction
semigroups.
  The notation $W(T,Y)$ recognizes that it is a far-reaching generalization of
a long-known similarly titled construction. As a result, our work generalizes
Szendrei's description of almost factorizable semigroups while at the same time
including certain classes of free restriction semigroups in its realm.

similar formula between the Wilson loop and Dirac modes on arbitrary square

Starting with the collinear expansion for the six-gluon amplitude in the

the so-called Mandelstam region. We find that the result coincides with the
collinear expansion of the analytically continued amplitude. We then take the
multi-Regge limit, and conjecture that the final result precisely reproduces
the one from the BFKL approach. Combining this procedure with the OPE for null
polygonal Wilson loops, we explicitly compute the leading contribution in the
""collinear-Regge"" limit up to five loops. Our results agree with all the known
results up to four loops. At five-loop, our results up to the

known results, and for the N^3LLA and the N^4LLA give non-trivial predictions.
We further present an all-loop prediction for the imaginary part of the

degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the $K$-user Gaussian interference channel, its
direct application comes at the prohibitive cost of precoding over
exponentially-many signaling dimensions. On the other hand, it is known that
practical ""one-shot"" IA precoding (i.e., linear schemes without symbol
expansion) provides a vanishing DoFs gain in large fully-connected networks
with generic channel coefficients. In our previous work, we introduced the
concept of ""Cellular IA"" for a network topology induced by hexagonal cells with
sectors and nearest-neighbor interference. Assuming that neighboring sectors
can exchange decoded messages (and not received signal samples) in the uplink,
we showed that linear one-shot IA precoding over $M$ transmit/receive antennas
can achieve the optimal $M/2$ DoFs per user. In this paper we extend this
framework to networks with omni-directional (non-sectorized) cells and consider
the practical scenario where users have $2$ antennas, and base-stations have
$2$, $3$ or $4$ antennas. In particular, we provide linear one-shot IA schemes

achievability of $3/4$, $1$ and $7/6$ DoFs per user, respectively. DoFs
converses for one-shot schemes require the solution of a discrete optimization
problem over a number of variables that grows with the network size. We develop
a new approach to transform such challenging optimization problem into a
tractable linear program (LP) with significantly fewer variables. This approach
is used to show that the achievable $3/4$ DoFs per user are indeed optimal for

Making use of recent advances, we create vortex knots and links in viscous
fluids and simulated superfluids and track their geometry through topology
changing reconnections. We find that the reassociation of vortex lines through
a reconnection enables the transfer of helicity from links and knots to helical
coils. This process is remarkably efficient, owing to the anti-parallel
orientation spontaneously adopted by the reconnecting vortices. Using a new
method for quantifying the spatial helicity spectrum, we find that the
reconnection process can be viewed as transferring helicity between scales,
rather than dissipating it. We also infer the presence of geometric
deformations which convert helical coils into even smaller scale twist, where
it may ultimately be dissipated. Our results suggest that helicity conservation
plays an important role in fluids and related fields, even in the presence of
dissipation.

non-commutative setting where the role of locales is taken over by \'etale

theory, specifically Ehresmann semigroups, restriction semigroups and inverse
semigroups. We establish a duality between the category of complete restriction
monoids and the category of \'etale localic categories. The relationship
between monoids and categories is mediated by a class of quantales called
restriction quantal frames. This result builds on the work of Pedro Resende on
the connection between pseudogroups and \'etale localic groupoids but in the
process we both generalize and simplify: for example, we do not require
involutions and, in addition, we render his result functorial. We also project
down to topological spaces and, as a result, extend the classical adjunction
between locales and topological spaces to an adjunction between \'etale localic
categories and \'etale topological categories. In fact, varying morphisms, we
obtain several adjunctions. Just as in the commutative case, we restrict these
adjunctions to spatial-sober and coherent-spectral equivalences. The classical
equivalence between coherent frames and distributive lattices is extended to an
equivalence between coherent complete restriction monoids and distributive
restriction semigroups. Consequently, we deduce several dualities between
distributive restriction semigroups and spectral \'etale topological
categories. We also specialize these dualities for the setting where the
topological categories are cancellative or are groupoids. Our approach thus

used vary across disciplines. Despite their common use and broad utility, no
unified framework has emerged for measuring, comparing and partitioning
diversity. The introduction of information theory into diversity measurement
has laid the foundations, but the framework is incomplete without the ability
to partition diversity, which is central to fundamental questions across the
life sciences: How do we prioritise communities for conservation? How do we
identify reservoirs and sources of pathogenic organisms? How do we measure
ecological disturbance arising from climate change?
  The lack of a common framework means that diversity measures from different
fields have conflicting fundamental properties, allowing conclusions reached to
depend on the measure chosen. This conflict is unnecessary and unhelpful. A
mathematically consistent framework would transform disparate fields by
delivering scientific insights in a common language. It would also allow the
transfer of theoretical and practical developments between fields.
  We meet this need, providing a versatile unified framework for partitioning
biological diversity. It encompasses any kind of similarity between
individuals, from functional to genetic, allowing comparisons between
qualitatively different kinds of diversity. Where existing partitioning
measures aggregate information across the whole population, our approach
permits the direct comparison of subcommunities, allowing us to pinpoint
distinct, diverse or representative subcommunities and investigate population
substructure. The framework is provided as a ready-to-use R package to easily
test our approach.

been argued that in binary black hole (BBH) evolutions adopting this gauge,
noise generated near adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) boundaries does not
converge away cleanly with increasing resolution, severely limiting
gravitational waveform accuracy at computationally feasible resolutions. We
link this noise to a sharp (short-wavelength), initial outgoing gauge wave
crossing into progressively lower resolution AMR grids, and present
improvements to the standard MP gauge conditions that focus on stretching,
smoothing, and more rapidly settling this outgoing wave. Our best gauge choice
greatly reduces gravitational waveform noise during inspiral, yielding less
fluctuation in convergence order and $\sim 40%$ lower waveform phase and
amplitude errors at typical resolutions. Noise in other physical quantities of
interest is also reduced, and constraint violations drop by more than an order
of magnitude. We expect these improvements will carry over to simulations of
all types of compact binary systems, as well as other $N$+1 formulations of
gravity for which MP-like gauge conditions can be chosen.

large-scale environment, a phenomenon that has been dubbed galactic conformity.
Remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virial
radius of the halo hosting the central. Therefore, conformity manifestly
violates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir
exclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a
series studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the
galaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity
on scales R ~1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be
correctly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that
ejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then
invoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of
galaxies and halos. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that
central galaxies are solely responsible. We conclude that large-scale `2-halo'
conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, and
indicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematically
over-estimated the influence of post-infall processes.

observations from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey, and applied several tools,
such as filament tracing, power-spectra, \Delta-variance, and probability
distribution functions of column density (PDFs), to derive physical properties.
The column density maps reveal a different morphological appearance for the
three clouds, with a ridge-like structure for Cha I, a clump-dominated regime
for Cha II, and an intricate filamentary network for Cha III. The filament
width is measured to be around 0.12\pm0.04 pc in the three clouds, and the
filaments found to be gravitationally unstable in Cha I and II, but mostly
subcritical in Cha III. Faint filaments (striations) are prominent in Cha I
showing a preferred alignment with the large-scale magnetic field. The PDFs of
all regions show a lognormal distribution at low column densities. For higher
densities, the PDF of Cha I shows a turnover indicative of an extended higher
density component, culminating with a power-law tail. Cha II shows a power-law
tail with a slope characteristic of gravity. The PDF of Cha III can be best fit
by a single lognormal. The turbulence properties of the three regions are found
to be similar, pointing towards a scenario where the clouds are impacted by
large-scale processes. The magnetic field could possibly play an important role
for the star-formation efficiency in the Chamaeleon clouds if proven that it
can effectively channel material on Cha I, and possibly Cha II, but probably
less efficiently on the quiescent Cha III cloud.

triaxial halo shapes. The simulations have different scales, mass limits and
cosmological parameters, which allows us to ensure a good resolution and
statistics in a wide mass range, and to investigate the dependence of halo
properties on the cosmological model. We confirm the tendency of haloes to be
prolate at all times, even if they become more triaxial going to higher
redshifts. Regarding the dependence on mass, more massive haloes are also less
spherical at all redshifts, since they are the most recent forming systems and
so still retain memory of their original shape at the moment of collapse. We
then propose a rescaling of the shape-mass relations, using the variable $\nu =
\delta_{c}/\sigma$ to represent the mass, which absorbs the dependence on both
cosmology and time, allowing to find universal relations between halo masses
and shape parameters (ellipticity, prolateness and the axial ratios) which hold
at any redshift. This may be very useful to determine prior distributions of

mass-metallicity (MZ) relation with metallicities of damped Lyman-alpha systems
(DLAs) in quasar spectra. Based on this relation the stellar masses of the
absorbing galaxies can be predicted. We test this prediction by measuring the
stellar masses of 12 galaxies in confirmed DLA absorber - galaxy pairs in the
redshift range 0.1<z<3.2. We find an excellent agreement between the predicted
and measured stellar masses over three orders of magnitude, and we determine
the average offset $\langle C_{[M/H]} \rangle$ = 0.44+/-0.10 between absorption
and emission metallicities. We further test if $C_{[M/H]}$ could depend on the
impact parameter and find a correlation at the 5.5sigma level. The impact
parameter dependence of the metallicity corresponds to an average metallicity
difference of -0.022+/-0.004 dex/kpc. By including this metallicity vs. impact
parameter correlation in the prescription instead of $C_{[M/H]}$, the scatter
reduces to 0.39 dex in log M*. We provide a prescription how to calculate the
stellar mass (M*,DLA) of the galaxy when both the DLA metallicity and DLA
galaxy impact parameter is known. We demonstrate that DLA galaxies follow the
MZ relation for luminosity-selected galaxies at z=0.7 and z=2.2 when we include
a correction for the correlation between impact parameter and metallicity.

simultaneously measures the auto- and cross-power spectra of four redshift
samples, and provides minimum-variance, unbiased estimates even at the largest
angular scales. Since photometric quasars are known to be strongly affected by
systematics such as spatially-varying depth and stellar contamination, we
introduce a new framework of extended mode projection to robustly mitigate the
impact of systematics on the power spectrum measurements. This technique
involves constructing template maps of potential systematics, decorrelating
them on the sky, and projecting out modes which are significantly correlated
with the data. Our method is able to simultaneously process several thousands
of nonlinearly-correlated systematics, and mode projection is performed in a
blind fashion. Using our final power spectrum measurements, we find a good
agreement with theoretical predictions, and no evidence for further
contamination by systematics. Extended mode projection not only obviates the
need for aggressive sky and quality cuts, but also provides control over the
level of systematics in the measurements, enabling the search for small signals
of new physics while avoiding confirmation bias.

low-mass stars in high-{\sigma} galaxies. This trend has been derived so far
from integrated spectra, and remains unexplained at present. To test whether

new, extremely deep, spectroscopic data, for three nearby ETGs, two galaxies

km/s. From the analysis of IMF-sensitive spectral features, we find that the
IMF depends significantly on galactocentric distance in the massive ETGs, with
the enhanced fraction of low-mass stars f mostly confined to their central
regions. In contrast, the low-{\sigma} galaxy does not show any significant
radial gradient in the IMF, well described by a shallower distribution,
relative to the innermost regions of massive galaxies, at all radii. Such a
result indicates that the IMF should be regarded as a local (rather than

potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. This method
requires full three-dimensional positions and velocities for all stars to be
fit, but does not require identification of any specific stream or
determination of stream membership for any star. We exploit the principle that
the action distribution of stream stars is most clustered when the potential
used to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. Clustering is
quantified with the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), which also provides
conditional uncertainties for our parameter estimates. We show, for toy
Gaia-like data in a spherical isochrone potential, that maximizing the KLD of
the action distribution relative to a smoother distribution recovers the true
values of the potential parameters. The precision depends on the observational
errors and the number of streams in the sample; using KIII giants as tracers,
we measure the enclosed mass at the average radius of the sample stars accurate
to 3% and precise to 20-40%. Recovery of the scale radius is precise to 25%,
and is biased 50% high by the small galactocentric distance range of stars in
our mock sample (1-25 kpc, or about three scale radii, with mean 6.5 kpc).
About 15 streams, with at least 100 stars per stream, are needed to obtain
upper and lower bounds on the enclosed mass and scale radius when observational
errors are taken into account; 20-25 streams are required to stabilize the size
of the confidence interval. If radial velocities are provided for stars out to
100 kpc (10 scale radii), all parameters can be determined with 10% accuracy
and 20% precision (1.3% accuracy in the case of the enclosed mass), underlining
the need for ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to complete the radial
velocity catalog for faint halo stars observed by Gaia.

reduced to minimization (over its extended set of variables) of the quadratic

quadratic functions has been thoroughly studied for the last few decades, and
much progress has been made in solving such problems exactly or heuristically.
A related paper \cite{ABCG} initiated a systematic study of the minimum number
of auxiliary $y$-variables required in a quadratization of an arbitrary
function $f$ (a natural question, since the complexity of minimizing the
quadratic function $g(x,y)$ depends, among other factors, on the number of
binary variables). In this paper, we determine more precisely the number of
auxiliary variables required by quadratizations of symmetric pseudo-Boolean
functions $f(x)$, those functions whose value depends only on the Hamming
weight of the input $x$ (the number of variables equal to $1$).

2x10^6 Msun and gas mass of >3x10^9(Zsun/Z) Msun within 0.2 Rvir, and possibly

beamwidth of a smaller dish have imposed an overloaded scenario at the

number of receiving elements at the dish antenna. To ensure successful
operation in this practical scenario, we propose a satellite receiver that
enhances signal detection from the desired satellite by mitigating the
interference from neighboring satellites. Towards this objective, we propose a
reduced complexity list-based group-wise search detection (RC-LGSD) receiver
under the assumption of spatially correlated additive noise. To further enhance
detection performance, the proposed satellite receiver utilizes a newly
designed whitening filter to remove the spatial correlation amongst the noise
parameters, while also applying a preprocessor that maximizes the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Extensive simulations under
practical scenarios show that the proposed receiver enhances the performance of

the futures opening auction problem.
  Futures contracts are an important tool to mitigate market risk and
counterparty credit risk. In futures markets these contracts can be traded with
varying expiration dates and underlyings. A common hedging strategy is to roll
positions forward into the next expiration date, however this strategy comes
with significant operational risk. To address this risk, exchanges started to
offer so-called futures contract combinations, which allow the traders for
swapping two futures contracts with different expiration dates or for swapping
two futures contracts with different underlyings. In theory, the price is in
both cases the difference of the two involved futures contracts. However, in
particular in the opening auctions price inefficiencies often occur due to
suboptimal clearing, leading to potential arbitrage opportunities.
  We present a minimum cost flow formulation of the futures opening auction
problem that guarantees consistent prices. The core ideas are to model orders
as arcs in a network, to enforce the equilibrium conditions with the help of
two hierarchical objectives, and to combine these objectives into a single
weighted objective while preserving the price information of dual optimal
solutions. The resulting optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time
and computational tests establish an empirical performance suitable for
production environments.

highlights include enhancing performance when used inside high-throughput
build-systems, via incorporating a native ZIP archive workflow, as well as a
simplified installation procedure that now allows to deploy LaTeXML as a cloud

scintillator radiation detectors can be crucially improved by co-doping with
Sr, Ca, or Ba. Here we outline a mechanism for this enhancement on the basis of
electronic structure calculations. We show that (i) Br vacancies are the
primary electron traps during the initial stage of thermalization of hot
carriers, prior to hole capture by Ce dopants; (ii) isolated Br vacancies are
associated with deep levels; (iii) Sr doping increases the Br vacancy
concentration by several orders of magnitude; (iv) $\text{Sr}_\text{La}$ binds
to $V_\text{Br}$ resulting in a stable neutral complex; and (v) association
with Sr causes the deep vacancy level to move toward the conduction band edge.
The latter is essential for reducing the effective carrier density available
for Auger quenching during thermalization of hot carriers. Subsequent
de-trapping of electrons from $\text{Sr}_\text{La}-V_\text{La}$ complexes then
can activate Ce dopants that have previously captured a hole leading to
luminescence. This mechanism implies an overall reduction of Auger quenching of
free carriers, which is expected to improve the linearity of the photon light
yield with respect to the energy of incident electron or photon.

tracing, a one-zone model, and X-ray background modeling --- to investigate the
X-ray propagation, intensity distribution, and long term effects on the IGM
thermal and ionization state. The efficiency and morphology of photo-heating
and photo-ionization are dependent on the photon energies. The sub-keV X-rays
only impact the IGM near the sources while the keV photons contribute
significantly to the X-ray background and heat and ionize the IGM smoothly. The
X-rays just below 1 keV are most efficient in heating and ionizing the IGM. We
find that the IGM might be heated to over 100 K by $z=10$ and the high density
source region might reach 10$^4$ K, limited by atomic hydrogen cooling. This
may be important for predicting the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signals. But, on the

contribute significantly to the optical depth of CMB to the Thomson scattering.

lattice or a Poisson point process (PPP). In reality, however, they are
deployed neither fully regularly nor completely randomly. Accordingly, in this
paper, we consider the very general class of motion-invariant models and
analyze the behavior of the outage probability (the probability that the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is smaller than a threshold) as
the threshold goes to zero. We show that, remarkably, the slope of the outage
probability (in dB) as a function of the threshold (also in dB) is the same for
essentially all motion-invariant point processes. The slope merely depends on
the fading statistics. Using this result, we introduce the notion of the
asymptotic deployment gain (ADG), which characterizes the horizontal gap
between the success probabilities of the PPP and another point process in the
high-reliability regime (where the success probability is near 1). To
demonstrate the usefulness of the ADG for the characterization of the SINR
distribution, we investigate the outage probabilities and the ADGs for
different point processes and fading statistics by simulations.

that the stellar continuum peaks in the optical and NIR in the same position,
indicating that there is no covering of the center by a nuclear dust lane. A
strong velocity gradient is detected in all emission lines at that position.
The position angle of this gradient is at 155\deg whereas the galactic rotation
is at a position angle of 201\deg. Our measures of the molecular hydrogen
lines, hydrogen recombination lines, and [Feii] indicate that the excitation at
the nucleus is caused by thermal excitation, i.e. shocks which can be
associated with active galactic nuclei emission, supernovae or outflows. The
line ratios [Feii]/Pa{\beta} and H2/Br{\gamma} show a Seyfert to LINER
identification of the nucleus. The stellar continuum is dominated by spectral
signatures of red-giant M stars. The stellar line-of-sight velocity follows the
galactic field whereas the light continuum follows the nuclear bar. The
dynamical center of NGC 1433 coincides with the optical and NIR center of the
galaxy and the black hole position. Within the central arcsecond, the molecular
hydrogen and the 12CO(3-2) emissions - observed in the NIR and in the
sub-millimeter with SINFONI and ALMA, respectively - are indicative for a
nuclear outflow originating from the galaxy's SMBH. A small circum nuclear disk
cannot be fully excluded. Derived gravitational torques show that the nuclear
bar is able to drive gas inwards to scales where viscosity torques and
dynamical friction become important. The black hole mass derived using stellar

caching is emerging as a potential solution. It has been recently established
that joint design of content delivery and storage (coded caching) can
significantly improve performance over conventional caching. Coded caching is
well suited to emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures which consist of a
dense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points (APs) with high data
rates, along with sparsely-distributed, large-coverage macro-cell base stations
(BS). This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs
with storage, and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast
opportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even
with different demands. Such coded-caching schemes have been shown to be
order-optimal with respect to the BS transmission rate, for a system with
single-level content, i.e., one where all content is uniformly popular. In this
work, we consider a system with non-uniform popularity content which is divided
into multiple levels, based on varying degrees of popularity. The main
contribution of this work is the derivation of an order-optimal scheme which
judiciously shares cache memory among files with different popularities. To
show order-optimality we derive new information-theoretic lower bounds, which
use a sliding-window entropy inequality, effectively creating a non-cutset
bound. We also extend the ideas to when users can access multiple caches along
with the broadcast. Finally we consider two extreme cases of user distribution
across caches for the multi-level popularity model: a single user per cache
(single-user setup) versus a large number of users per cache (multi-user
setup), and demonstrate a dichotomy in the order-optimal strategies for these
two extreme cases.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the Cu and Au
interface layers are fully continuous when their thickness exceeds ~3 nm,
implying that spin-polarized carriers penetrate the interface noble metal to
dis- tances exceeding this value. A power law model based on exchange
scattering is found to fit the data better than a phenomenological exponential
decay. The discrepancy between these length scales and the much shorter ones
reported from x-ray magnetic circular dichroism studies of magnetic
proximitization is ascribed to the fact that our tunnelling transport
measurements selectively probe s-like electrons close to the Fermi level. When
a 0.1 nm thick Cu or Au layer is inserted within the Co, we find that the
suppression of TMR and TSP is restored on a length scale of <=1 nm, indicating
that this is a sufficient quantity of Co to form a fully spin-polarized band

spontaneous breaking of symmetry, where charged bosons and fermions are subject
to the effects of a constant external magnetic field. The problem is studied in
terms of the relative intensity of the magnetic field with respect to the mass
and the temperature. When the former is the smallest of the scales, we present
a suitable method to obtain magnetic and thermal corrections up to ring order
at high temperature. By these means, we solve the problem of the instability in
the boson sector for these theories, where the squared masses, taken as
functions of the order parameter, can vanish and even become negative. The
solution is found by considering the screening properties of the plasma,
encoded in the resummation of the ring diagrams at high temperature. We also
study the case where the magnetic field is the intermediate of the three scales
and explore the nature of the chiral transition as we vary the field strength,
the coupling constants and the number of fermions. We show that the critical
temperature for the restoration of chiral symmetry monotonically increases from
small to intermediate values of the magnetic fields and that this temperature
is always above the critical temperature for the case when the magnetic field
is absent.

instability requires favorable inequalities between the associated linear
timescales and timescales for nonlinear (e.g., turbulence) evolution. In the
solar wind these two types of timescales may be directly compared using
standard Kolmogorov-style analysis and observational data. The estimated local
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic cascade times, evaluated as relevant kinetic
scales are approached, remain slower than the cyclotron period, but comparable
to, or faster than, the typical timescales of instabilities, anisotropic waves,
and wave damping. The variation with length scale of the turbulence timescales
is supported by observations and simulations. On this basis the use of linear
theory - which assumes constant parameters to calculate the associated kinetic
rates - may be questioned. It is suggested that the product of proton
gyrofrequency and nonlinear time at the ion gyroscales provides a simple
measure of turbulence influence on proton kinetic behavior.

continuous neighborhood-based (""ego-centric"") aggregate queries over large,
highly dynamic, and rapidly evolving graphs. Examples of such queries include
computation of personalized, tailored trends in social networks, anomaly/event
detection in financial transaction networks, local search and alerts in
spatio-temporal networks, to name a few. Key challenges in supporting such
continuous queries include high update rates typically seen in these
situations, large numbers of queries that need to be executed simultaneously,
and stringent low latency requirements. We propose a flexible, general, and
extensible in-memory framework for executing different types of ego-centric
aggregate queries over large dynamic graphs with low latencies. Our framework
is built around the notion of an aggregation overlay graph, a pre-compiled data
structure that encodes the computations to be performed when an update/query is
received. The overlay graph enables sharing of partial aggregates across
multiple ego-centric queries (corresponding to the nodes in the graph), and
also allows partial pre-computation of the aggregates to minimize the query
latencies. We present several highly scalable techniques for constructing an
overlay graph given an aggregation function, and also design incremental
algorithms for handling structural changes to the underlying graph. We also
present an optimal, polynomial-time algorithm for making the pre-computation
decisions given an overlay graph, and evaluate an approach to incrementally
adapt those decisions as the workload changes. Although our approach is
naturally parallelizable, we focus on a single-machine deployment and show that
our techniques can easily handle graphs of size up to 320 million nodes and
edges, and achieve update/query throughputs of over 500K/s using a single,
powerful machine.

September, active region NOAA 11283 produced a pair of homologous flares on the
6th and 7th, respectively. Both of them were white-light (WL) flares, as
captured by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory in visible continuum at 617.3 nm which is believed to
originate from the deep solar atmosphere.We investigate the WL emission of
these X-class flares with HMIs seeing-free imaging spectroscopy. The durations
of impulsive peaks in the continuum are about 4 minutes. We compare the WL with
hard X-ray (HXR) observations for the September 6 flare and find a good
correlation between the continuum and HXR both spatially and temporally. In
absence of RHESSI data during the second flare on September 7, the derivative
of the GOES soft X-ray is used and also found to be well correlated temporally
with the continuum. We measure the contrast enhancements, characteristic sizes,
and HXR fluxes of the twin flares, which are similar for both flares,
indicating analogous triggering and heating processes. However, the September 7
flare was associated with conspicuous sunquake signals whereas no seismic wave
was detected during the flare on September 6. Therefore, this comparison
suggests that the particle bombardment may not play a dominant role in
producing the sunquake events studied in this paper.

obtain the potential energy curves and dipole moments for the lowest-lying
energy states of this complex. Calculations for the radiative decay processes
cross sections and rate coefficients are presented for the total decay
processes. Comparing the semi-classical Langevin approximation with the quantum
approach, we find it provides a very good estimate of the background at higher
energies. The results demonstrate that radiative decay mechanisms are important
over the energy and temperature region considered. In fact, the Langevin
process of ion-atom collisions dominates cold ion-atom collisions. For spin
dependent processes \cite{kohl13} the anisotropic magnetic dipole-dipole
interaction and the second-order spin-orbit coupling can play important roles,
inducing couplingbetween the spin and the orbital motion. They measured the
spin-relaxing collision rate to be approximately 5 orders of magnitude higher
than the charge-exchange collision rate \cite{kohl13}. Regarding the measured
radiative charge transfer collision rate, we find that our calculation is in
very good agreement with experiment and with previous calculations.
Nonetheless, we find no broad resonances features that might underly a strong
isotope effect. In conclusion, we find, in agreement with previous theory that
the isotope anomaly observed in experiment remains an open question.

allotropes ($\sim$1 %). Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allows for artificial
synthesis of graphene solely from a $^{13}$C precursor, potentially amplifying
the influence of the nuclear magnetic moments. In this work we study the effect
of hyperfine interactions in pure $^{13}$C-graphene on its spin transport
properties. Using Hanle precession measurements we determine the spin
relaxation time and observe a weak increase of $\tau_{s}$ with doping and a
weak change of $\tau_{s}$ with temperature, as in natural graphene. For
comparison we study spin transport in pure $^{12}$C-graphene, also synthesized
by CVD, and observe similar spin relaxation properties. As the signatures of
hyperfine effects can be better resolved in oblique spin-valve and Hanle
configurations, we use finite-element modeling to emulate oblique signals in
the presence of a hyperfine magnetic field for typical graphene properties.
Unlike in the case of GaAs, hyperfine interactions with $^{13}$C nuclei
influence electron spin transport only very weakly, even for a fully polarized
nuclear system. Also, in the measurements of the oblique spin-valve and Hanle
effects no hyperfine features could be resolved. This work experimentally

eigenstate. A previous study set exclusion limits on the heavy $s$ scalar,
using the stability of the scalar potential, unitarity, electroweak precision
tests, LHC searches for the 125 GeV Higgs; it also briefly discussed the
$\sqrt{s} = 7,8$ TeV LHC searches for a heavy Higgs. In this work, we show how
the projected LHC sensitivity at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV to the presence of a heavy
Higgs and to the detailed properties of the 125 GeV Higgs will further
constrain the properties of the new heavy $s$ scalar. Since the renormalizable
coloron model may contain spectator fermions to remove anomalies, we examine
several representative scenarios with different numbers of spectator fermions.
Our results are summarized in plots that overlay the current exclusion limits
on the $s$ boson with the projected sensitivity of the $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV LHC
to the new state. We find that the upcoming LHC searches should be sensitive to
an $s$ scalar of mass less than 1 TeV for essentially all of the model
parameter space in which the $h$ state differs from the Higgs boson of the SM.
More precisely, unless the mixing between the weak doublet and weak singlet
gauge-eigenstate scalars is zero, the 14 TeV LHC will be sensitive to the
presence of the non-standard heavy $s$ state that is characteristic of the
renormalizable coloron model.

solutions. Under typical load conditions only one solution is stable and
corresponds to a normal operating point, whereas the second solution is not
stable and is never realized in practice. However, in future distribution grids
with high penetration of distributed generators more stable solutions may
appear because of active or reactive power reversal. The systems can operate at
different states, and additional control measures may be required to ensure
that it remains at the appropriate point. This paper focuses on the analysis of
several cases where multiple solution phenomena is observed. A non-iterative
approach for solving load flow equations based on the Gr\""{o}bner basis is
introduced to overcome the convergence and computational efficiency associated
with standard iterative approaches. All the solutions of load flow problems
with their existence boundaries are analyzed for a simple 3-bus model.
Furthermore, the stability of the solutions is analyzed using a derived
aggregated load dynamics model, and suggestions for preventive control are
proposed and discussed. The failure of na\""{i}ve voltage stability criteria is
demonstrated and new voltage stability criteria is proposed. Some of the new
solutions of load flow equations are proved to be stable and/or acceptable to
the EN 50610 voltage fluctuation standard.

spherical triangle to the classical area formulas of Euler and of Cagnoli. The
derivation also yields a variant of the Cagnoli formula in terms of the medial
triangle.
  We introduce the three barycentric coordinates of a point within the
spherical triangle as area ratios which sum to unity. The barycentric
coordinates are the Whitney 0-forms, scalar functions over the domain of the
triangle associated with each vertex. We then construct, by exterior
differentiation of the barycentric coordinates, succinct expressions for the
Whitney 1-forms associated with each geodesic side, or great circle arc.
  The Euler formula, in conjunction with that of Tuynman, facilitates the
differentiation of a triangular area with respect to the position of a vertex.
As both the Euler and Tuynman formulas may be expressed naturally in terms of
the position vectors of the vertices on an embedded sphere, the Whitney
constructions may be done in terms of vector-valued forms and without recourse
to a particular projection or coordinate chart.
  Finally, we exhibit the Whitney 2-form of the triangle, which must be the
product of a scalar function and the area 2-form of the sphere. We find an
expression for this scalar function in terms of determinants of $3 \times 3$
matrices built from the vertex position vectors. It is a rational function in
the Cartesian coordinates of a point. By construction it must be invariant
under cyclic permutations of the three vertices, though it is not manifestly
so. Also by construction the Whitney 2-form must integrate to one over the
triangle. Thus the rational function is exactly integrable over its triangle
when restricted to the sphere.

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes Fulcrum network codes, a network coding framework that
achieves three seemingly conflicting objectives: (i) to reduce the coding
coefficient overhead to almost n bits per packet in a generation of n packets;
(ii) to operate the network using only GF(2) operations at intermediate nodes
if necessary, dramatically reducing complexity in the network; (iii) to deliver
an end-to-end performance that is close to that of a high-field network coding
system for high-end receivers while simultaneously catering to low-end
receivers that decode in GF(2). As a consequence of (ii) and (iii), Fulcrum
codes have a unique trait missing so far in the network coding literature: they
provide the network with the flexibility to spread computational complexity
over different devices depending on their current load, network conditions, or
even energy targets in a decentralized way. At the core of our framework lies
the idea of precoding at the sources using an expansion field GF(2h) to
increase the number of dimensions seen by the network using a linear mapping.
Fulcrum codes can use any high-field linear code for precoding, e.g.,
Reed-Solomon, with the structure of the precode determining some of the key
features of the resulting code. For example, a systematic structure provides
the ability to manage heterogeneous receivers while using the same data stream.
Our analysis shows that the number of additional dimensions created during
precoding controls the trade-off between delay, overhead, and complexity. Our
implementation and measurements show that Fulcrum achieves similar decoding
probability as high field Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) approaches but
with encoders/decoders that are an order of magnitude faster.

using a bound-to-bound molecular transition driven by spatially modulated laser
light. Due to the spatially periodic coupling between the ground and excited
molecular states, there exists a band structure of bound states, which can
uniquely be characterized by some extra bumps in radio-frequency spectroscopy.
With the increasing of coupling strength, the series of bound states will cross
zero energy and directly result in a number of scattering resonances, whose
position and width can be conveniently tuned by the coupling strength of the
laser light and the applied magnetic field (i.e., the detuning of the ground
molecular state). In the presence of the modulated laser light, universal
two-body bound states near zero-energy threshold still exist. However, compared
with the case without modulation, the regime for such universal states is
usually small. An unified formula which embodies the influence of the modulated
coupling on the resonance width is given. The spatially modulated coupling also
implies a local spatially varying interaction between atoms. Our work proposes
a practical way of optically controlling interatomic interactions with high
spatial resolution and negligible atomic loss.

Laurent polynomials, also called subdivision symbols, which describe the linear
rules determining successive refinements of coarse initial meshes. One
important property of subdivision schemes is their capability of exactly
reproducing in the limit specific types of functions from which the data is
sampled. Indeed, this property is linked to the approximation order of the
scheme and to its regularity. When the capability of reproducing polynomials is
required, it is possible to define a family of subdivision schemes that allows
to meet various demands for balancing approximation order, regularity and
support size. The members of this family are known in the literature with the
name of pseudo-splines. In case reproduction of exponential polynomials instead
of polynomials is requested, the resulting family turns out to be the
non-stationary counterpart of the one of pseudo-splines, that we here call the

analysis. The central limit theorems (CLT's) for linear spectral statistics of
high-dimensional non-centered sample covariance matrices have received
considerable attention in random matrix theory and have been applied to many
high-dimensional statistical problems. However, known population mean vectors
are assumed for non-centered sample covariance matrices, some of which even
assume Gaussian-like moment conditions. In fact, there are still another two
most frequently used sample covariance matrices: the MLE (by subtracting the
sample mean vector from each sample vector) and the unbiased sample covariance
matrix (by changing the denominator $n$ as $N=n-1$ in the MLE) without
depending on unknown population mean vectors. In this paper, we not only
establish new CLT's for non-centered sample covariance matrices without
Gaussian-like moment conditions but also characterize the non-negligible
differences among the CLT's for the three classes of high-dimensional sample
covariance matrices by establishing a {\em substitution principle}: substitute
the {\em adjusted} sample size $N=n-1$ for the actual sample size $n$ in the
major centering term of the new CLT's so as to obtain the CLT of the unbiased
sample covariance matrices. Moreover, it is found that the difference between
the CLT's for the MLE and unbiased sample covariance matrix is non-negligible
in the major centering term although the two sample covariance matrices only
have differences $n$ and $n-1$ on the dominator. The new results are applied to
two testing problems for high-dimensional data.

Unless computational resources that match up to these datasets are available,
solving such problems using classical UQP methods is very difficult. This paper
discusses alternatives. We first define high dimensional compliant (HDC)
methods for UQPs---methods that can solve high dimensional UQPs by adapting to
available computational resources. We then show that the class of block
Kaczmarz and block coordinate descent (BCD) are the only existing methods that
can be made HDC. As a possible answer to the question of the `best' amongst BCD
methods for UQP, we propose a novel greedy BCD (GBCD) method with serial,
parallel and distributed variants. Convergence rates and numerical tests
confirm that the GBCD is indeed an effective method to solve high dimensional
UQPs. In fact, it sometimes beats even the conjugate gradient.

and geometrical aspects of stock market. The present paper continues to uncover
new mathematical structures residing from crossings of stocks diagram by
introducing topological properties stock market is endowed with. The crossings
of stocks are categorized as overcrossings and undercrossings and interpreted
as generators of braid that stocks form in the process of prices quotations in
the market. Topological structure of the stock market is even richer if the
closure of stocks braid is considered, such that it forms a knot. To
distinguish the kind of knot that stock market forms, Alexander-Conway
polynomial and the Jones polynomials are calculated for some knotted stocks.
These invariants of knots are important for the future practical applications
topological stock market might have. Such application may account of the
relation between Jones polynomial and phase transition statistical models to
provide a clear way to anticipate the transition of financial markets to the
phase that leads to crisis. The resemblance between braided stocks and logic
gates of topological quantum computers could quantum encode the stock market

energy-conserving, time-reversible part, plus a non-time reversible part,
including forcing and dissipation. We construct a modified version of the model
where viscosity varies with time, in such a way that energy is conserved, and
the resulting dynamics is fully time-reversible. For each value of the forcing,
the statistical properties of the irreversible and reversible model are in
excellent agreement, if in the latter the energy is kept constant at a value
equal to the time-average realized with the irreversible model. In particular,
the average contraction rate of the phase space of the time-reversible model
agrees with that of the irreversible model, where instead it is constant by
construction. We also show that the phase space contraction rate obeys the
fluctuation relation, and we relate its finite time corrections to the
characteristic time scales of the system. A local version of the fluctuation
relation is explored and successfully checked. The equivalence between the two
non-equilibrium ensembles extends to dynamical properties such as the Lyapunov
exponents, which are shown to obey to a good degree of approximation a pairing
rule. These results have relevance in motivating the importance of the chaotic
hypothesis. in explaining that we have the freedom to model non-equilibrium
systems using different but equivalent approaches, and, in particular, that
using a model of a fluid where viscosity is kept constant is just one option,

thanks to their robustness and scalability compared to single-device storage.
Majority of the related research has exclusively concerned the network layer.
At the same time, the number of users of, e.g., peer-to-peer (p2p) and
device-to-device (d2d) networks as well as proximity based services is growing
rapidly, and the mobility of users is considered more and more important. This
motivates, in contrast to the existing literature, the study of the physical
layer functionality of wireless distributed storage systems.
  In this paper, we take the first step towards protecting the storage repair
transmissions from physical layer errors when the transmission takes place over
a fading channel. To this end, we introduce the notion of a space-time storage
code, drawing together the aspects of network layer and physical layer
functionality and resulting in cross-layer robustness. It is also pointed out
that existing space-time codes are too complex to be utilized in storage
networks when the number of helpers involved is larger than the number of
receive antennas at the newcomer or data collector, hence creating a call for
less complex transmission protocols.

spectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type Ic SN2013cq.
Spectroscopic analysis suggests that SN2013cq resembles two previous GRB-SNe,
SN1998bw and SN2010bh associated with GRB980425 and XRF100316D, respectively.
The bolometric light curve of SN2013cq, which is significantly affected by the
host galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of SN2010bh
($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with SN1998bw. The comparison with
the light curve model of another GRB-connected SN2003dh, indicates that
SN2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. This suggests a
synthesised radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim 0.4 M_\odot$.
GRB130427A/SN2013cq is the first case of low-z GRB-SN connection where the GRB
energetics are extreme ($E_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). We show that
the maximum luminosities attained by SNe associated with GRBs span a very
narrow range, but those associated with XRFs are significantly less luminous.
On the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying GRBs span 6 orders
of magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $< E_{\rm \gamma, iso} <$ 10$^{54}$ erg), although
this range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. The GRB total
radiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the SN energy budget.

phononic crystals composed of orthogonally stacked slender cylinders. We focus
on investigating the effect of the cylinders local vibrations on the dispersion
of elastic waves along the stacking direction of the woodpile phononic
crystals. We experimentally verify that their frequency band structures depend
significantly on the bending resonant behavior of unit cells. We propose a
simple theoretical model based on a discrete element method to associate the
behavior of locally resonant cylindrical rods with the band gap formation
mechanism in woodpile phononic crystals. The findings in this work imply that
we can achieve versatile control of frequency band structures in phononic
crystals by using woodpile architectures. The woodpile phononic crystals can
form a new type of vibration filtering devices that offer an enhanced degree of
freedom in manipulating stress wave propagation.

pointy tip. While this phenomenon clearly finds its origin in the expansion of
water upon freezing, a quantitative description of the tip singularity has
remained elusive. Here we demonstrate how the geometry of the freezing front,
determined by heat transfer considerations, is crucial for the tip formation.
We perform systematic measurements of the angles of the conical tip, and reveal
the dynamics of the solidification front in a Hele-Shaw geometry. It is found
that the cone angle is independent of substrate temperature and wetting angle,
suggesting a universal, self-similar mechanism that does not depend on the rate
of solidification. We propose a model for the freezing front and derive
resulting tip angles analytically, in good agreement with observations.

conventionally cast specimens of the superalloy RENE 80 in total strain
controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests at 850{\deg}C. The grains at the
location of crack initiation are investigated using electron backscatter
diffraction (EBSD) measurements with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This
results in determination of maximal Schmid factors for the slip system that
lead to the initiation of the LCF surface crack. It is shown using stress -
life and strain - life models, that taking into account the Schmid factor
considerable reduces the scatter in LCF life prediction. This is used to
propose a probabilistic model for LCF life based on random grain orientations.
Using Mote Carlo simulation, we determine the probability distribution for the
maximal Schmid factor in an uniaxial stress state under isotropic random
orientations of the grain. This is used to calculate failure probabilities
under the above mentioned model and to compare them with experimental data.
Based on extreme value statistics, it is discussed whether a high maximal
Schmid factor can be considered as causally related to an early initiation of
an LCF crack and we present some rather surprising experimental evidence. In
the last section conclusions are formulated and future directions of research
are outlined.
