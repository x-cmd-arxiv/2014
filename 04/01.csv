state, namely the ideal-fluid $\Gamma=2.75$ ones, on the dynamical bar-mode
instability in rapidly rotating polytropic models of neutron stars in full
General Relativity. We determine the change on the critical value of the
instability parameter $\beta$ for the emergence of the instability when the
adiabatic index $\Gamma$ is changed from 2 to 2.75 in order to mimic the
behavior of a realistic equation of state. In particular, we show that the
threshold for the onset of the bar-mode instability is reduced by this change
in the stiffness and give a precise quantification of the change in value of
the critical parameter $\beta_c$. We also extend the analysis to lower values
of $\beta$ and show that low-beta shear instabilities are present also in the
case of matter described by a simple polytropic equation of state.

particle settled life (PSL) time, it becomes possible to formulate a model for
viscous fluids in a form of first order hyperbolic partial differential
equations. Moreover, the concept of PSL time allows the use of the same model
for flows of viscous fluids (Newtonian or non-Newtonian) as well as
irreversible deformation of solids. In the theory presented, a continuum is
interpreted as a system of material particles connected by bonds; the internal
resistance to flow is interpreted as elastic stretching of the particle bonds;
and a flow is a result of bond destructions and rearrangements of particles.
Finally, we examine the model for simple shear flows, arbitrary incompressible

viscous law can be obtained in the framework of the developed hyperbolic theory

PSL time, and the shear sound velocity is also obtained.

years we now have large samples of metal-poor stars for which measurements of
detailed abundances exist. [...] These data hold important clues on the nature
of the contribution of the first stellar generations to the enrichment of our
Galaxy. Aims. We aim to explain the scatter in Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu abundance
ratio diagrams unveiled by the metal-poor halo stars. Methods. We computed
inhomogeneous chemical evolution models for the Galactic halo assuming
different scenarios for the r-process site: the electron-capture supernovae
(EC) and the magnetorotationally driven (MRD) supernovae scenario. We also
considered models with and without the contribution of fast-rotating massive
stars (spinstars) to an early enrichment by the s-process. A detailed
comparison with the now large sample of stars with measured abundances of Sr,
Ba, Y, Eu, and Fe is provided (both in terms of scatter plots and number
distributions for several abundance ratios). Results. The scatter observed in
these abundance ratios of the very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2.5) can be
explained by combining the s-process production in spinstars, and the r-process
contribution coming from massive stars. For the r-process we have developed
models for both the EC and the MRD scenario that match the observations.
Conclusions. With the present observational and theoretical constraints we
cannot distinguish between the EC and the MRD scenario in the Galactic halo.
Independently of the r-process scenarios adopted, the production of elements by
an s-process in spinstars is needed to reproduce the spread in abundances of
the light neutron capture elements (Sr and Y) over heavy neutron capture
elements (Ba and Eu). We provide a way to test our suggestions by means of the
distribution of the Ba isotopic ratios in a [Ba/Fe] or [Sr/Ba] vs. [Fe/H]
diagram.

compound libraries as a part of the rational approach to drug design. Although
the method has proved its competence in predicting binding modes correctly, its
inherent complexity puts high demands on computational resources. Moreover the
chemical space to be screened is prohibitively large. Therefore the application
of filtering prior to docking is a promising concept. We implemented a
pre-docking filter based on the tangent distance algorithm originally conceived
for optical character recognition. The challenging transfer of the method from
two-dimensional to three-dimensional data was achieved by representing the
molecular structure by a set of density maps extracted from different views of
the compound. Additionally, our program applies a binary classification using
principal component analysis. Ligand and binding pocket are aligned according
to their centroidal axes, enabling a size-based filtering for the purpose of
enriching the dataset regarding ligands before docking. The evaluation of our
program via redocking produced RMSD values between 8{\AA} and 25{\AA},
indicating that the tangent distance approach is not suited for optimizing the
orientation of a ligand and binding pocket. Investigating probable explanations
lead to the conclusion that a likely cause for these results is the method's
known inability to approximate large transformations. A validation of the
principal component analysis alone performed better: Tests on a dataset of 170

equations (ODEs and discretized time-dependent PDEs) in the Tensor Train (TT)
decomposition, assuming that the solution and the right-hand side of the ODE
admit such a decomposition with a low storage. A linear ODE, discretized via
one-step or Chebyshev differentiation schemes, turns into a large linear
system. The tensor decomposition allows to solve this system for several time
points simultaneously using an extension of the Alternating Least Squares
algorithm. This method computes the TT approximation of the solution directly,
without ever solving the original large problem, and encapsulates the Galerkin
model reduction of the ODE. This allows an efficient estimation of the time
discretization error, and hence provides a way to adapt the time steps.
Besides, conservation laws can be preserved exactly in the reduced model by
expanding the approximation subspace with the generating vectors of the linear
invariants and correction of the euclidean norm. In numerical experiments with
the transport and the chemical master equations, we demonstrate that the new

matrix-factorization construction of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) polynomials for
arbitrary knots and links in the fundamental representation of arbitrary SL(N).
Construction consists of 2 steps: first, with every link diagram with m
vertices one associates an m-dimensional hypercube with certain q-graded vector
spaces, associated to its 2^m vertices. A generating function for q-dimensions
of these spaces is what we suggest to call the primary T-deformation of HOMFLY
polynomial -- because, as we demonstrate, it can be explicitly reduced to
calculations of ordinary HOMFLY polynomials, i.e. to manipulations with quantum
R-matrices. The second step is a certain minimization of residues of this new
polynomial with respect to T+1. Minimization is ambiguous and is actually
specified by the choice of commuting cut-and-join morphisms, acting along the
edges of the hypercube -- this promotes it to Abelian quiver, and KR polynomial
is a Poincare polynomial of associated complex, just in the original Khovanov's
construction at N=2. This second step is still somewhat sophisticated -- though
incomparably simpler than its conventional matrix-factorization counterpart. In
this paper we concentrate on the first step, and provide just a mnemonic
treatment of the second step. Still, this is enough to demonstrate that all the
currently known examples of KR polynomials in the fundamental representation
can be easily reproduced in this new approach. As additional bonus we get a
simple description of the DGR relation between KR polynomials and
superpolynomials and demonstrate that the difference between reduced and
unreduced cases, which looks essential at KR level, practically disappears
after transition to superpolynomials. However, a careful derivation of all
these results from cohomologies of cut-and-join morphisms remains for further
studies.

and Gacs-Korner and both the notions can be stated as two different
characteristic points in the lossless Gray-Wyner region. Although the
information theoretic characterizations for these two CI quantities can be
easily evaluated for random variables with infinite entropy (eg., continuous
random variables), their operational significance is applicable only to the
lossless framework. The primary objective of this paper is to generalize these
two CI notions to the lossy Gray-Wyner network, which hence extends the
theoretical foundation to general sources and distortion measures. We begin by
deriving a single letter characterization for the lossy generalization of
Wyner's CI, defined as the minimum rate on the shared branch of the Gray-Wyner
network, maintaining minimum sum transmit rate when the two decoders
reconstruct the sources subject to individual distortion constraints. To
demonstrate its use, we compute the CI of bivariate Gaussian random variables
for the entire regime of distortions. We then similarly generalize Gacs and
Korner's definition to the lossy framework. The latter half of the paper
focuses on studying the tradeoff between the total transmit rate and receive
rate in the Gray-Wyner network. We show that this tradeoff yields a contour of
points on the surface of the Gray-Wyner region, which passes through both the
Wyner and Gacs-Korner operating points, and thereby provides a unified
framework to understand the different notions of CI. We further show that this
tradeoff generalizes the two notions of CI to the excess sum transmit rate and
receive rate regimes, respectively.

that chemical potential of substance, $\mu$, plays role of ruling parameter in
basic GCC-dependence of internal energy under compression, $U = U(\mu)$, in
contrast to the standard form $U = U(\rho)$. This substitution changes
radically low-density (""gaseous"") part of GCC. Namely: ($i$) - physically
meaningless part of standard cold curve $(U(\rho)$ at $T \rightarrow 0)$
disappears totally from new version of GCC. This deleted part corresponded to
absolutely thermodynamically unstable states in standard representation
$U(\rho)$; ($ii$) - new gaseous branch of cold curve, $U = U(\mu)$, comes in
GCC. It describes in simple, schematic way thermodynamics of whole gas-like
plasma in low-temperature limit (Iosilevskiy: arXiv:0902.3708) as combination
of all ionization and dissociation processes available for equilibrium plasma
at finite temperature. This gaseous branch corresponds to thermodynamically
stable and metastable states only. The only quantities that display themselves
as meaningful details of new gaseous zero-temperature isotherm are combination
of binding energies for all complexes (atomic, molecular and ionic) in their
ground states, together with sublimation energy of gas-crystal phase transition
(""energy scale"" of material). Gaseous branch of GCC conjugate naturally with
corresponding branch (cold curve) of condensed phase. New GCC form, $U =
U(\mu)$, no more contains meaningless part of traditional form $U(\rho)$
between gaseous and crystalline spinodals. The simple schematic structure

regions of the LISM. We detected one to six individual absorption components
along any given sight line, and the number of absorbers roughly correlates with
the pathlength. This high-resolution near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectroscopic
survey was specifically designed for sight lines with existing far-UV (FUV)
observations. The FUV spectra include many intrinsically broad absorption lines
(i.e., of low atomic mass ions) and often observed at medium resolution. The
LISM NUV narrow-line absorption component structure presented here can be used
to more accurately interpret the archival FUV observations. As an example of
this synergy, we present a new analysis of the temperature and turbulence along
the line of sight toward epsilon Ind. The new observations of LISM velocity
structure are also critical in the interpretation of astrospheric absorption
derived from fitting the saturated HI Lyman-alpha profile. As an example, we
reanalyze the spectrum of lambda And and find that this star likely does have
an astrosphere. Two stars in the sample that have circumstellar disks (49 Cet
and HD141569) show evidence for absorption due to disk gas. Finally, the
substantially increased number of sight lines is used to test and refine the
three-dimensional kinematic model of the LISM, and search for previously
unidentified clouds within the Local Bubble. We find that every prediction made
by the Redfield & Linsky (2008) kinematic model of the LISM is confirmed by an

complementary characteristics have stimulated active research in the inference
of images with high spatial and spectral resolutions from HSI-MSI pairs.
  In this paper, we formulate this data fusion problem as the minimization of a
convex objective function containing two data-fitting terms and an
edge-preserving regularizer. The data-fitting terms are quadratic and account
for blur, different spatial resolutions, and additive noise; the regularizer, a
form of vector Total Variation, promotes aligned discontinuities across the
reconstructed hyperspectral bands.
  The optimization described above is rather hard, owing to its
non-diagonalizable linear operators, to the non-quadratic and non-smooth nature
of the regularizer, and to the very large size of the image to be inferred. We
tackle these difficulties by tailoring the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage
Algorithm (SALSA)---an instance of the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM)---to this optimization problem. By using a convenient
variable splitting and by exploiting the fact that HSIs generally ""live"" in a
low-dimensional subspace, we obtain an effective algorithm that yields
state-of-the-art results, as illustrated by experiments.

association. These young stars are initially surrounded by protoplanetary
discs. In these cluster environments tidal interactions with other cluster
members can alter the disc properties. Besides the disc frequency, its mass,
angular momentum, and energy, in particular the disc's size is prone to being
changed by a passing star. So far the change in disc size was only investigated
for a small number of very specific encounters. Several studies investigated
the effect of the cluster environment on the sizes of planetary systems, like
our own solar system, based on a generalisation of information from this
limited sample. We performed numerical simulations covering the wide parameter
space typical for young star clusters, to test the validity of this approach.
Here the sizes of discs after encounters are presented, based on a size
definition which is comparable to that one used in observational studies. We
find that, except for encounters between equal-mass stars, the usually applied
estimates are insufficient. They tend to severely overestimate the remaining
disc size. We show that the disc size after an encounter can be described by a
relatively simple dependence on the periastron distance and the mass ratio of
the encounter partners. This knowledge allows, for example, to pin down the
types of encounter possibly responsible for the structure of today's solar
system.

methods based on the diffusion approximation are an extremely efficient
alternative to Monte Carlo path tracing. However, in sufficiently transparent
regions, classical diffusion approximation suffers from non-physical radiative
fluxes which leads to a poor match to correct light transport. In particular,
this prevents the application of classical diffusion approximation to
heterogeneous media, where opaque material is embedded within transparent
regions. To address this limitation, we introduce flux-limited diffusion, a
technique from the astrophysics domain. This method provides a better
approximation to light transport than classical diffusion approximation,
particularly when applied to heterogeneous media, and hence broadens the
applicability of diffusion-based techniques. We provide an algorithm for
flux-limited diffusion, which is validated using the transport theory for a
point light source in an infinite homogeneous medium. We further demonstrate
that our implementation of flux-limited diffusion produces more accurate
renderings of multiple scattering in various heterogeneous datasets than
classical diffusion approximation, by comparing both methods to ground truth
renderings obtained via volumetric path tracing.

study the ignition properties. When a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle WIMP
from the Galactic Halo elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector,
the small amount of energy deposited can trigger an explosion. For specificity,
this paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a
nanothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the
two components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- an
explosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm
radius embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million
nanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector
mass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositing
enough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.
When one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the
cell. A number of possible thermite materials are studied. Excellent background
rejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector:
whereas a WIMP will cause a single cell to explode, backgrounds will instead
set off multiple cells.
  If the detector operates at room temperature, we find that WIMPs with masses
above 100 GeV (or for some materials above 1 TeV) could be detected; they
deposit enough energy ($>$10 keV) to cause an explosion. When operating
cryogenically at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures, the nano
explosive WIMP detector can detect energy deposits as low as 0.5 keV, making
the nano explosive detector more sensitive to very light $<$10 GeV WIMPs,
better than other dark matter detectors.

(Dominated Coupling From The Past), which is a well known protocol for
simulation without bias from steady-state distributions. Our algorithm
terminates in finite time assuming only finite mean of the inter-arrival and
service times. In order to simulate the single-server queue in stationarity
until the first idle period in finite expected termination time we require the
existence of finite variance. This requirement is also necessary for such idle
time (which is a natural coalescence time in DCFTP applications) to have finite
mean. Thus, in this sense, our algorithm is applicable under minimal
assumptions.

Starting with a group G of so-called rigid symmetries of a functional defined
over space-time Sigma, the original functional is extended appropriately by
additional Lie(G)-valued 1-form gauge fields so as to lift the symmetry to
Maps(Sigma,G). Physically relevant quantities are then to be obtained as the
quotient of the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations by these gauge
symmetries.
  In this article we show that one can construct a gauge theory for a standard
sigma model in arbitrary space-time dimensions where the target metric is not
invariant with respect to any rigid symmetry group, but satisfies a much weaker
condition: It is sufficient to find a collection of vector fields v_a on the
target M satisfying the extended Killing equation v_{a(i;j)}=0 for some
connection acting on the index a. For regular foliations this is equivalent to
requiring the conormal bundle to the leaves with its induced metric to be
invariant under leaf-preserving diffeomorphisms of M, which in turn generalizes
Riemannian submersions to which the notion reduces for smooth leaf spaces M/~.
  The resulting gauge theory has the usual quotient effect with respect to the
original ungauged theory: in this way, much more general orbits can be factored
out than usually considered. In some cases these are orbits that do not
correspond to an initial symmetry, but still can be generated by a finite
dimensional Lie group G. Then the presented gauging procedure leads to an
ordinary gauge theory with Lie algebra valued 1-form gauge fields, but showing
an unconventional transformation law. In general, however, one finds that the
notion of an ordinary structural Lie group is too restrictive and should be
replaced by the much more general notion of a structural Lie groupoid.

  Classification: 62M10, 62F05, 62G10",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the literature on change-point analysis by means of hypothesis
testing considers hypotheses of the form H0 : \theta_1 = \theta_2 vs. H1 :
\theta_1 != \theta_2, where \theta_1 and \theta_2 denote parameters of the
process before and after a change point. This paper takes a different
perspective and investigates the null hypotheses of no relevant changes, i.e.
H0 : ||\theta_1 - \theta_2|| ? \leq \Delta?, where || \cdot || is an
appropriate norm. This formulation of the testing problem is motivated by the
fact that in many applications a modification of the statistical analysis might
not be necessary, if the difference between the parameters before and after the
change-point is small. A general approach to problems of this type is developed
which is based on the CUSUM principle. For the asymptotic analysis weak
convergence of the sequential empirical process has to be established under the
alternative of non-stationarity, and it is shown that the resulting test
statistic is asymptotically normal distributed. Several applications of the
methodology are given including tests for relevant changes in the mean,
variance, parameter in a linear regression model and distribution function
among others. The finite sample properties of the new tests are investigated by
means of a simulation study and illustrated by analyzing a data example from
economics.

recently reported but only for the case of slow-fading channels. This paper
provides an exact average bit-error-rate (BER) of the SC scheme over a general

used together with the non-coherent detection at the destination. The presented
analysis is thoroughly verified with simulation results in various fading

auto-correlation values of the channels. It is also shown that the performance
of the SC method is very close to that of the semi-MRC method and the existence
of an error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio region is inevitable in both
methods. The obtained BER analysis for the SC method can also be used to
approximate the BER performance of the MRC method, whose exact analytical
evaluation in time-varying channels appears to be difficult.

AU of a disk around a typical classical T~Tauri star. OH is found primarily at
the top of a warm region where the gas temperature is $T_g \approx 650 - 1000$
K and water below it where the temperature is lower, $T_g \approx 250 - 650$ K.
The amounts of water and OH and the temperatures of the regions in which they
formed are in agreement with recent Spitzer measurements and support the notion
of it in situ production of water in the inner regions of protoplanetary disks.
We find that the synthesized water is effective in shielding the disk midplane
from stellar FUV radiation.

of elements in [n] to k-tuples in [n] that was first considered by Petersen,
Pylyavskyy, Speyer (2010). We give an alternative approach to their result that
the flag simplicial complex on $\binom{[n]}{k}$ induced by this relation is a
regular, unimodular and flag triangulation of the order polytope of the poset
given by the product $[k]\times[n-k]$ of two chains (also called
Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope), and that it is the join of a simplex and a sphere
(that is, it is a Gorenstein triangulation). We then observe that this already
implies the existence of a flag simplicial polytope generalizing the dual
associahedron, whose Stanley-Reisner ideal is an initial ideal of the
Gra{\ss}mann-Pl\""ucker ideal, while previous constructions of such a polytope
did not guarantee flagness nor reduced to the dual associahedron for k=2. On
our way we provide general results about order polytopes and their
triangulations. We call the simplicial complex the noncrossing complex, and the
polytope derived from it the dual Gra{\ss}mann associahedron. We extend results
of Petersen, Pylyavskyy, Speyer (2010) showing that the non-crossing complex
and the Gra{\ss}mann associahedron naturally reflect the relations between
Gra{\ss}mannians with different parameters, in particular the isomorphism
$G_{k,n} \cong G_{n-k,n}$. Moreover, our approach allows us to show that the
adjacency graph of the noncrossing complex admits a natural acyclic orientation
that allows us to define a Gra{\ss}mann-Tamari order on maximal noncrossing
families. Finally, we look at the precise relation of the noncrossing complex

the weak separability complex is the cyclically invariant part of the

fragility that characterizes dynamic systems. Cybernetics defines the general
regulatory mechanisms that a system can use to prevent or repair the damage
produced by disturbances. According to the law of requisite variety,
disturbances can be held in check by maximizing buffering capacity, range of
compensatory actions, and knowledge about which action to apply to which
disturbance. This suggests a general strategy for rejuvenating the organism by
increasing its capabilities of adaptation. Buffering can be optimized by
providing sufficient rest together with plenty of nutrients: amino acids,
antioxidants, methyl donors, vitamins, minerals, etc. Knowledge and the range
of action can be extended by subjecting the organism to an as large as possible
variety of challenges. These challenges are ideally brief so as not to deplete
resources and produce irreversible damage. However, they should be sufficiently
intense and unpredictable to induce an overshoot in the mobilization of
resources for damage repair, and to stimulate the organism to build stronger
capabilities for tackling future challenges. This allows them to override the
trade-offs and limitations that evolution has built into the organism's repair
processes in order to conserve potentially scarce resources. Such acute,
""hormetic"" stressors strengthen the organism in part via the ""order from noise""
mechanism that destroys dysfunctional structures by subjecting them to strong,
random variations. They include heat and cold, physical exertion, exposure,
stretching, vibration, fasting, food toxins, micro-organisms, environmental

n$, such that $\mathbf{p}$ belongs to all {\em rainbow} $d$-simplices
determined by $Y_1,..., Y_{d+1}$, that is, simplices with one vertex in each
$Y_i$.
  We show a super-exponentially decreasing upper bound $c_d\leq
e^{-(1/2-o(1))(d \ln d)}$. The ideas used in the proof of the upper bound also
help us prove Pach's theorem with $c_d \geq 2^{-2^{d^2 + O(d)}}$, which is a
lower bound doubly exponentially decreasing in $d$ (up to some polynomial in
the exponent). For comparison, Pach's original approach yields a triply
exponentially decreasing lower bound. On the other hand, Fox, Pach, and Suk
recently obtained a hypergraph density result implying a proof of Pach's
theorem with $c_d \geq2^{-O(d^2\log d)}$.
  In our construction for the upper bound, we use the fact that the minimum
solid angle of every $d$-simplex is super-exponentially small. This fact was
previously unknown and might be of independent interest. For the lower bound,
we improve the ""separation"" part of the argument by showing that in one of the
key steps only $d+1$ separations are necessary, compared to $2^d$ separations

Pb_{1-x}Sn_{x}(Te,Se), crystal symmetry and electronic topology intertwine to
create topological surface states with many interesting features including
Lifshitz transition, Van-Hove singularity and fermion mass generation. These
surface states are protected by mirror symmetry with respect to the (110)
plane. In this work we present a comprehensive study of the effects of
different mirror-symmetry-breaking perturbations on the (001) surface band
structure. Pristine (001) surface states have four branches of Dirac fermions
at low-energy. We show that ferroelectric-type structural distortion generates
a mass and gaps out some or all of these Dirac points, while strain shifts
Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. An in-plane magnetic field leaves surface
state gapless, but introduces asymmetry between Dirac points. Finally, an
out-of-plane magnetic field leads to discrete Landau levels. We show that the
Landau level spectrum has an unusual pattern of degeneracy and interesting
features due to the unique underlying band structure. This suggests that Landau
level spectroscopy can detect and distinguish between different mechanisms of
symmetry breaking in topological crystalline insulators.

In the case of ER detectors, there are four crucial phases of the detection

amplification due to the release of energy derived from the action of an enzyme
on its substrate; c) sustainable but non-explosive enzymatic reaction; d)
self-termination due to the denaturation of the enzyme, when the temperature is

intrinsic disc properties. In this paper we analyse the conditions for the
stability of a thin accretion disc in which $\alpha$ is a function of the
magnetic Prandtl number, the ratio of collisional viscosity to resistivity. In
the inner disc, where the free electron opacity and radiation viscosity
dominate, the disc is unstable if $\alpha$ is proportional to the magnetic
Prandtl number with an exponent, $n$, and $6/13<n<10/3$. This is within the
range of values for the power-law index found in MHD simulations with simple
energetics. We calculate the evolution of the unstable disc within the $\alpha$

analogous to the behaviour seen in recurrent dwarf novae. It is noteworthy that
the time-dependent global behaviour of the instability results in cyclic
heating of the inner section of the disc, when parameters appropriate for an
X-ray binary system are used. We calculate a model spectrum of the disc in the

average flat, while the jet spectrum is in general steep with a mean index of
-1.04. A simple power-law fit is often inadequate for the core regions, as
expected if the cores are partially self-absorbed. The overall jet spectrum
steepens at a rate of about -0.001 to -0.004 per deprojected parsec when moving
further out from the core with flat spectrum radio quasars having significantly
steeper spectra than the BL Lac objects. The spectrum in both types of objects
flattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particle
acceleration or density enhancements along the jet. The mean spectral index at
the component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 for
the electron energy distribution. We find a significant trend that jet
components with linear polarization parallel to the jet (magnetic field
perpendicular to the jet) have flatter spectra, as expected for transverse
shocks. Compared to quasars, BL Lacs have more jet components with
perpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generally
flatter spectra. The overall steepening of the spectra with distance can be
explained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with the
evolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets are
conical. This interpretation is supported by a significant correlation with the
age of the component and the spectral index, with older components having
steeper spectra. (abridged)

7:21 track-to-shower ratio is naively favored for the canonical (1:1:1) at

properly accounted for. We find that, for an astrophysical neutrino E^(-2)

does not change, 6 more years of data would be needed to exclude (1:1:1) at

flavor composition is excluded at 92% C.L. The best-fit is obtained for (1:0:0)

the dual black holes are small and round and they are well-described by the
asymptotically flat Schwarzschild solution. On the other hand, as the

authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them

authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive
assistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information

schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges
$C_i\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping
$\sigma:[n]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses
$f(\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where
$f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the
human to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample
$m=\tilde{\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\sigma$, for
a security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To
obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower
bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response
pairs induced by $f$ and $\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary
functions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate),
and generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a
family of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user
needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or
remembering $\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \min\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\}$.
For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering
the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain
strong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login
to many different accounts.

$2N$ null-state equations and three conformal Ward identities which govern CFT
correlation functions of $2N$ one-leg boundary operators. In the first article

$\dim\mathcal{S}_N\leq C_N$, with $C_N$ the $N$th Catalan number. The analysis
of that article is complete except for the proof of a lemma that it invokes.
This article provides the proof.
  The lemma states that if every interval among $(x_2,x_3),$ $(x_3,x_4), ...
,(x_{2N-1},x_{2N})$ is a two-leg interval of $F\in\mathcal{S}_N$, then $F$
vanishes. Proving this lemma by contradiction, we show that the existence of
such a nonzero function implies the existence of a non-vanishing CFT two-point
function involving primary operators with different conformal weights, an
impossibility. This proof (which is rigorous in spite of our occasional
reference to CFT) involves two different types of estimates, those that give
the asymptotic behavior of F as the length of one interval vanishes, and those
that give this behavior as the lengths of two intervals vanish simultaneously.
We derive these estimates by using Green functions to rewrite certain
null-state PDEs as integral equations, combining other null-state PDEs to
obtain Schauder interior estimates, and then repeatedly integrating the
integral equations with these estimates until we obtain optimal bounds. In the
case where two adjacent interval lengths vanish, we use a Green function that
contains the Jacobi heat kernel as its essential ingredient.

of the TBA technique is significantly better than that of the traditional

Structure of Symmetric N-Player Games when Influence and Independence Collide.
These games include n causes, which are dichotomous random variables whose

denote the probability spaces that exhibit independence and influence among n
players as Ind_n and Inf_n respectively. We define the solution space of the
""generalized symmetric tequila problem,"" GST_n, as the set of probabilities for
a set of given effects such that the causes and effects are independent and

hadron-hadron collisions and $e^+$-$e^-$ annihilations indicate that they are
consistently produced in excess of what are predicted by electromagnetic
bremsstrahlung when hadrons (mostly mesons) are produced, but they agree with
electromagnetic bremsstrahlung predictions in the absence of hadron production.
These excess soft photons are called anomalous soft photons. The occurrence of
anomalous soft photons in association with hadron production reveals the
presence of additional QED soft photon sources in QCD hadron production. Many
different models have been proposed to explain the anomalous soft production.
We shall examine specifically a quantum field theory of simultaneous meson and
soft photon production in QCDxQED in which the meson production arises from the
oscillation of color charge densities of the quarks of the underlying vacuum in
a flux tube. As a quark carries both a color charge and an electric charge, the
oscillation of the color charge densities will be accompanied by the
oscillation of electric charge densities, which will in turn lead to the
simultaneous production of anomalous soft photons during the meson production
process.

regression. However, it is well-known that when the goal is to estimate a risk
ratio, the logistic regression is inappropriate if the outcome is common. In
these cases, a log-binomial regression model is preferable. On the other hand,
the estimation of the regression coefficients of the log-binomial model is
difficult due to the constraints that must be imposed on these coefficients.
Bayesian methods allow a straightforward approach for log-binomial regression
models, produce smaller mean squared errors and the posterior inferences can be
obtained using the software WinBUGS. However, the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods implemented in WinBUGS can lead to a high Monte Carlo error. To
avoid this drawback we propose an MCMC algorithm that uses a reparameterization

approximation by taking into account the Dirac-sea contributions of the quarks.
Compared with the case where the Dirac sea is neglected, we find that the
inhomogeneous phase shrinks, but in general does not disappear. It is shown
within a Ginzburg-Landau analysis that the Lifshitz point of the inhomogeneous
phase coincides with the tricritical point if the ratio between sigma-meson and

separate the two points. This is confirmed by our numerical calculations, which
demonstrate a strong sensitivity of the size of the inhomogeneous phase on

improvements beyond the present approximation.

entropy, assuming knowledge of the underlying statistics On the other hand,
universal compression supposes that the distribution of the random variable,
while unknown, belongs to a known set $\cal P$ of distributions. Such universal
descriptions for the random variable are agnostic to the identity of the
distribution in $\cal P$. But because they are not matched exactly to the
underlying distribution of the random variable, the average number of bits they
use is higher, and the excess over the entropy used is the ""redundancy"". This
formulation is fundamental to problems not just in compression, but also
estimation and prediction and has a wide variety of applications from language
modeling to insurance.
  In this paper, we study the redundancy of universal encodings of strings
generated by independent identically distributed (iid) sampling from a set
$\cal P$ of distributions over a countable support. We first show that if
describing a single sample from $\cal P$ incurs finite redundancy, then $\cal
P$ is tight but that the converse does not always hold. If a single sample can
be described with finite worst-case-regret (a more stringent formulation than
redundancy above), then it is known that length-$n$ iid samples only incurs a
diminishing (in $n$) redundancy per symbol as $n$ increases. However, we show
it is possible that a collection $\cal P$ incurs finite redundancy, yet
description of length-$n$ iid samples incurs a constant redundancy per symbol
encoded. We then show a sufficient condition on $\cal P$ such that length-$n$
iid samples will incur diminishing redundancy per symbol encoded.

approach to calculus has three distinct features: (i) it defines derivative and
(definite) integral without using limits, (ii) it defines derivative and
antiderivative simultaneously via a derivative-antiderivative (DA) pair, and
(iii) it posits the fundamental theorem of calculus as a natural corollary of
the definitions of derivative and integral. The first D in DD calculus
attributes to Descartes for his method of tangents and the second D to DA-pair.
The DD calculus, or simply direct calculus, makes many traditional notations

dispel the mystery of calculus as perceived by the general public. The

We prove that the minCIS problem is NP-hard, which addresses a recent open

the associated decision problem, to be referred to as the CIS, of determining
whether a subset (of a given collection of inputs) with a prescribed
cardinality exists that ensures structural controllability, is NP-complete.
Further, we explore in detail practically important subclasses of the minCIS
obtained by introducing more specific assumptions either on the system dynamics
or the input set instances for which systematic solution methods are provided
by constructing explicit reductions to well known computational problems. The
analytical findings are illustrated through examples in multi-agent

Proof theoretical studies discovered exponential gaps between normal or cut

study how to reduce the weight of propositional deductions. We present the
formalism of proof-graphs for purely implicational logic, which are graphs of a
specific shape that are intended to capture the logical structure of a

the reduced proof.
  In the present paper we give a precise definition of proof-graphs for the

proof-graphs. In contrast to standard tree-like formalisms, our normalization
does not increase the number of nodes, when applied to the corresponding

A novel aspect of
BioScapeL is that entities have programmable locations. The programmer can
specify a particular location where to place an entity, or a location relative
to the current location of the entity. The motivation for the extension comes
from the need to describe the evolution of populations of biochemical species
in space, while keeping a sufficiently high level description, so that
phenomena like diffusion, collision, and confinement can remain part of the
semantics of the calculus. Combined with the random diffusion movement
inherited from BioScape, programmable locations allow us to capture the
assemblies of configurations of polymers, oligomers, and complexes such as
microtubules or actin filaments.
  Further new aspects of BioScapeL include random translation and scaling.
Random translation is instrumental in describing the location of new entities
relative to the old ones. For example, when a cell secretes a hydronium ion,
the ion should be placed at a given distance from the originating cell, but in
a random direction. Additionally, scaling allows us to capture at a high level
events such as division and growth; for example, daughter cells after mitosis
have half the size of the mother cell.

represented as a finite collection of synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs, each

state machine (FSM) specifies the possible orders of scenario occurrences. The
SADF model renders the tightest possible performance guarantees, but is limited
by its finiteness. This means that from a practical point of view, it can only
handle dynamic dataflow applications that are characterized by a reasonably
sized set of possible behaviours or scenarios. In this paper we remove this
limitation for a class of SADF graphs by means of SADF model parametrization in
terms of graph port rates and actor execution times. First, we formally define

non-negligible eccentricity may be large enough to motivate searches with
ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Such events could be exceptional
laboratories to test General Relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime,
as a larger fraction of the energy is emitted at high-velocities, compared to
quasi-circular inspirals. A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of
computing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite
accuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are
more a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a
continuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess
power over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was
recently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy.
The leading-order ""observable"" that would be inferred from such a detection
would be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of
each time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence
of numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the
binary at formation. In this work, following the spirit of the parameterized
post-Einsteinian framework developed for quasi-circular inspiral, we propose a
simple, parameterized deformation of the baseline general relativistic burst
algorithm for eccentric inspiral events that would allow for model-independent
tests of Einstein's theory in this high-velocity, strong-field regime.

1962]-one of the more general formulations of strain gradient elasticity. Our
framework has three crucial ingredients: The first is iso-geometric analysis
[Hughes et al., Comp. Meth. App. Mech. Engrg., 194(39-41), 4135-4195, 2005],
which we have adopted for its straightforward and robust representation of
C1-continuity. The second is a weak treatment of the higher-order Dirichlet
boundary conditions in the formulation, which control the development of strain
gradients in the solution. The third ingredient is algorithmic (automatic)
differentiation, which eliminates the need for linearization ""by hand"" of the
rather complicated geometric and material nonlinearities in gradient elasticity
at finite strains. We present a number of numerical solutions to demonstrate
that the framework is applicable to arbitrary boundary value problems in three
dimensions. We discuss size effects, the role of higher-order boundary
conditions, and perhaps most importantly, the relevance of the framework to
problems with elastic free energy density functions that are non-convex in

the bases in the corresponding positions on the other chromosome in a
homologous pair. Information about the order of bases in a genome is readily
inferred using short reads provided by high-throughput DNA sequencing
technologies. In this paper, the recovery of the target pair of haplotype
sequences using short reads is rephrased as a joint source-channel coding
problem. Two messages, representing haplotypes and chromosome memberships of
reads, are encoded and transmitted over a channel with erasures and errors,
where the channel model reflects salient features of high-throughput
sequencing. The focus of this paper is on the required number of reads for
reliable haplotype reconstruction, and both the necessary and sufficient
conditions are presented with order-wise optimal bounds.

programming that aims to be sufficiently expressive, extensible, and efficient
for general-purpose use. Like Church, probabilistic models and inference
problems in Venture are specified via a Turing-complete, higher-order
probabilistic language descended from Lisp. Unlike Church, Venture also
provides a compositional language for custom inference strategies built out of
scalable exact and approximate techniques. We also describe four key aspects of
Venture's implementation that build on ideas from probabilistic graphical
models. First, we describe the stochastic procedure interface (SPI) that
specifies and encapsulates primitive random variables. The SPI supports custom
control flow, higher-order probabilistic procedures, partially exchangeable
sequences and ``likelihood-free'' stochastic simulators. It also supports
external models that do inference over latent variables hidden from Venture.
Second, we describe probabilistic execution traces (PETs), which represent
execution histories of Venture programs. PETs capture conditional dependencies,
existential dependencies and exchangeable coupling. Third, we describe
partitions of execution histories called scaffolds that factor global inference
problems into coherent sub-problems. Finally, we describe a family of
stochastic regeneration algorithms for efficiently modifying PET fragments
contained within scaffolds. Stochastic regeneration linear runtime scaling in
cases where many previous approaches scaled quadratically. We show how to use
stochastic regeneration and the SPI to implement general-purpose inference
strategies such as Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling, and blocked proposals
based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean-field variational inference
techniques.

the face of targeted node attacks for arbitrary degree networks, and
subsequently comparing the resilience of different scale-free network models
with the proposed measure. We strongly motivate our resilience measure termed
\emph{vertex attack tolerance} (VAT), which is denoted mathematically as
$\tau(G) = \min_{S \subset V} \frac{|S|}{|V-S-C_{max}(V-S)|+1}$, where
$C_{max}(V-S)$ is the largest connected component in $V-S$. We attempt a
thorough comparison of VAT with several existing resilience notions:
conductance, vertex expansion, integrity, toughness, tenacity and scattering
number. Our comparisons indicate that for artbitrary degree distributions VAT
is the only measure that fully captures both the major \emph{bottlenecks} of a
network and the resulting \emph{component size distribution} upon targeted node
attacks (both captured in a manner proportional to the size of the attack set).
For the case of $d$-regular graphs, we prove that $\tau(G) \le d\Phi(G)$, where
$\Phi(G)$ is the conductance of the graph $G$. Conductance and expansion are
well-studied measures of robustness and bottlenecks in the case of regular
graphs but fail to capture resilience in the case of highly heterogeneous
degree graphs. Regarding comparison of different scale-free graph models, our
experimental results indicate that PLOD graphs with degree distributions
identical to BA graphs of the same size exhibit consistently better vertex
attack tolerance than the BA type graphs, although both graph types appear
asymptotically resilient for BA generative parameter $m = 2$. BA graphs with $m
= 1$ also appear to lack resilience, not only exhibiting very low VAT values,
but also great transparency in the identification of the vulnerable node sets,
namely the hubs, consistent with well known previous work.

the Monte Carlo Markov chain method consists in constructing an ergodic Markov
process whose invariant measure is the target distribution. By sampling the
Markov process one can then compute, approximately, expectations of observables
with respect to the target distribution. Often the Markov processes used in
practice are time-reversible (i.e., they satisfy detailed balance), but our
main goal here is to assess and quantify how the addition of a non-reversible
part to the process can be used to improve the sampling properties. We focus on
the diffusion setting (overdamped Langevin equations) where the drift consists
of a gradient vector field as well as another drift which breaks the
reversibility of the process but is chosen to preserve the Gibbs measure. In
this paper we use the large deviation rate function for the empirical measure
as a tool to analyze the speed of convergence to the invariant measure. We show
that the addition of an irreversible drift leads to a larger rate function and
it strictly improves the speed of convergence of ergodic average for (generic
smooth) observables. We also deduce from this result that the asymptotic
variance decreases under the addition of the irreversible drift and we give an
explicit characterization of the observables whose variance is not reduced

The asymmetric Hawking radiation of primordial black holes can thus be used to
generate a B-L asymmetry. If dark matter is produced by the same mechanism, the
coincidence between the mass density of visible and dark matter can be

strong polynomial tractability for the weighted star discrepancy. We also show

features are not associated with the background high-mass star-forming region
and probe the diffuse matter along the line of sight. We present here the
detection of an additional narrow absorption feature at ~70 km/s in the
observed spectra of HDO, NH3 and C3. The 70 km/s feature is not uniquely
identifiable with the dynamic components (the main cloud and the large-scale
foreground filament) so-far identified toward this region. The narrow
absorption feature is similar to the one found toward low-mass protostars,
which is characteristic of the presence of a cold external envelope. The
far-infrared spectroscopic data were combined with existing ground-based
observations of 12CO, 13CO, CCH, CN, and C3H2 to characterize the 70 km/s
component. Using a non-LTE analysis of multiple transitions of NH3 and CN, we
estimated the density (n(H2) (1-5)x10^5 cm^-3) and temperature (10-30 K) for
this narrow feature. We used a gas-grain warm-up based chemical model with
physical parameters derived from the NH3 data to explain the observed
abundances of the different chemical species. We propose that the 70 km/s
narrow feature arises in a dense and cold clump that probably is undergoing
collapse to form a low-mass protostar, formed on the trailing side of the
high-velocity filament, which is thought to be interacting with the W51 main
cloud. While the fortuitous coincidence of the dense clump along the line of
sight with the continuum-bright W51e2 compact HII region has contributed to its
non-detection in the continuum images, this same attribute makes it an
appropriate source for absorption studies and in particular for ice studies of
star-forming regions.

that these conditions are practically computable and yield small sample sizes.

of Lyman continuum (LyC) flux that escapes from high redshift galaxies.
However, z ~ 3-4 LBGs are identified using the Lyman break technique which
preferentially selects galaxies with little or no LyC. We re-examine the
standard LBG selection criteria by performing spectrophotometry on composite
spectra constructed from 794 U_nGR-selected z ~ 3 LBGs from the literature
while adding LyC flux of varying strengths. The modified composite spectra
accurately predict the range of redshifts, properties, and LyC flux of LBGs in
the literature that have spectroscopic LyC measurements while predicting the
existence of a significant fraction of galaxies outside the standard selection
region. These galaxies, termed Lyman continuum galaxies (LCGs), are expected to
have high levels of LyC flux and are estimated to have a number density ~30-50
percent that of the LBG population. We define R_obs(U_n) as the relative
fraction of observed LyC flux, integrated from 912A to the shortest restframe
wavelength probed by the U_n filter, to the observed non-ionising flux (here
measured at 1500A). We use the 794 spectra as a statistical sample for the full
z ~ 3 LBG population, and find R_obs(U_n) = 5.0 +1.0/-0.4 (4.1 +0.5/-0.3)
percent, which corresponds to an intrinsic LyC escape fraction of f_esc = 10.5
+2.0/-0.8 (8.6 +1.0/-0.6) percent (contamination corrected). From the composite
spectral distributions we estimate R_obs(U_n) ~16 +/-3, f_esc ~33 +/-7 percent
for LCGs and R_obs(U_n) ~8 +/-3, f_esc ~16 +/-4 percent for the combined LBG +
LCG z ~ 3 sample. All values are measured in apertures defined by the UV
continuum and do not include extended and/or offset LyC flux. A complete high

explore the composition dependent crystallization behaviour by varying the
relative block length with weak and strong segregation strength between the
blocks. In weak segregation limit, we observe that with increasing the
composition of B-block, its crystallization temperature increases accompanying
with higher crystallinity. In contrast, A-block crystallizes at a relatively
low temperature along with the formation of thicker and larger crystallites
with the increase in B-block composition. We attribute this non-intuitive
crystallization trend to the dilution effect imposed by B-block. When the
composition of the B-block is high enough, it acts like a 'solvent' during the
crystallization of A-block. A-block segments are more mobile and hence less
facile to crystallize, resulting depression in crystallization temperature with
the formation of thicker crystals. At strong segregation limit, crystallization
and morphological development are governed by the confinement effect, rather
than block asymmetry. Isothermal crystallization reveals that the
crystallization follows a homogeneous nucleation mechanism with the formation
of two dimensional crystals. Two-step, compared to one-step isothermal
crystallization leads to the formation of thicker crystals of A-block due to
the dilution effect of the B-block.

crystal lattice will experience strain. This induced strain will alter the
electronic properties of the material. In particular, strain in graphene
generates an artificial vector potential which, if spatially varying, admits a
pseudo-magnetic field. Current theories for spatially varying strain use linear
or finite strain theory whose derivation is based on small displacements of
infinitesimal length vectors. Here we apply a differential geometry method to
derive a strain theory for large displacements of finite length vectors. This
method gives a finite displacement term whose contribution is comparable to
that of the linear strain term. Further to this, we show that a 'domain
wall'-like pseudo-magnetic field profile can be generated when a wide graphene
ribbon is subjected to a pair of opposing point forces (point stretch). The
resulting field is a function of the new finite displacement term only and
displays a maximum strength of over three times that which is predicted by the
linear strain theory. These results extend the current theories of strain,
which are based on the transformation of infinitesimal length vectors, to
finite length vectors, thus providing an accurate description of
pseudo-magnetic field structures in strained materials.

simultaneously fit by atmosphere models incorporating several micron-sized dust

better reproduce the $K$-band spectral shape. ROXs 42Bb's best-estimated

in photospheric magnetic bright points using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations and radiative diagnostics of solar granulation. Methods: simulated
time-dependent radiation parameters and plasma properties were investigated
throughout the evolution of a bright point. Synthetic Stokes profiles for the
FeI 630.25 nm line were calculated, which allowed the evolution of the Stokes-I
line strength and Stokes-V area and amplitude asymmetries to also be
investigated. Results: our results are consistent with theoretical predictions
and published observations describing convective collapse, and confirm this as
the bright point formation process. Through degradation of the simulated data
to match the spatial resolution of SOT, we show that high spatial resolution is
crucial for the detection of changing spectro-polarimetric signatures
throughout a magnetic bright point's lifetime. We also show that the signature
downflow associated with the convective collapse process is reduced towards
zero as the radiation intensity in the bright point peaks, due to the magnetic
forces present restricting the flow of material in the flux tube.

neutron star (NS) and an M-type optical companion. Its ~5.4h NS spin period is
the longest among all known accretion-powered pulsars and exhibited large (~7%)
fluctuations over 8 years. A spin trend transition was detected with Swift/BAT
around an X-ray brightening in 2012. The source was in quiescent and bright
states before and after this outburst based on 60 ks Suzaku observations in
2011 and 2012. The observed continuum is well described by a Comptonized model
with the addition of a narrow 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha line during the outburst.
Spectral similarities to slowly rotating pulsars in high-mass X-ray binaries,
its high pulsed fraction (~60-80%), and the location in the Corbet diagram
favor high B-field (>~1e+12 G) over a weak field as in low-mass X-ray binaries.
The observed low X-ray luminosity (1e+33-1e+35 erg/s), probable wide orbit, and
a slow stellar wind of this SyXB make quasi-spherical accretion in the subsonic
settling regime a plausible model. Assuming a ~1e+13 G NS, this scheme can
explain the ~5.4 h equilibrium rotation without employing the magnetar-like
field (~1e+16 G) required in the disk accretion case. The time-scales of
multiple irregular flares (~50 s) can also be attributed to the free-fall time
from the Alfven shell for a ~1e+13 G field. A physical interpretation of SyXBs
beyond the canonical binary classifications is discussed.

adopting a two-channel model, we take into account of the closed channel

scattering in the open channel can lead to two branches of solution for both
the two-body and the many-body ground states. The branching of the two-body
bound state solution originates from the avoided crossing between bound states
in the open and the closed channels, respectively. For the many-body states, we
identify a quantum phase transition in the upper branch regardless of the sign
of the background scattering length, which is in clear contrast to the case
without spin-orbit coupling. For systems with negative background scattering
length in particular, we show that the bound state in the open channel, and

conjecture, this dg operad produces a chain model of the free loop space which

and users of social media, we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a
consistent male bias, which does not appear when analyzing MySpace.
Furthermore, the narrative of Twitter is closer to the movies that do not pass
the Bechdel test than to those that pass it.
  We link the properties of movies and the users that share trailers of those
movies. Our analysis reveals some particularities of movies that pass the
Bechdel test: Their trailers are less popular, female users are more likely to
share them than male users, and users that share them tend to interact less
with male users. Based on our datasets, we define gender independence
measurements to analyze the gender biases of a society, as manifested through
digital traces of online behavior. Using the profile information of Twitter
users, we find larger gender independence for urban users in comparison to
rural ones. Additionally, the asymmetry between genders is larger for parents
and lower for students. Gender asymmetry varies across US states, increasing
with higher average income and latitude. This points to the relation between
gender inequality and social, economical, and cultural factors of a society,

friction can substantially slow down the translocation process. Moreover, the
translocation exponent $\alpha$ in the translocation time - vs. - chain length

fluid flows on ultrastatic manifolds is equivalent to classifying the
isometries of the spatial sections. For a flow on R x S$^2$ this leaves only
one possibility, since on the 2-sphere all Killing fields are conjugate to each
other, and it is well-known that the gravity dual of such a (conformal) fluid
is the spherical KNAdS$_4$ black hole. On the other hand, in R x H$^2$ the
situation is more complicated, since the isometry group of H$^2$ admits
elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic elements. One might thus ask what the
gravity duals of the flows corresponding to these three different cases are.
Answering this question is one of the scopes of this paper. In particular we
identify the black hole dual to a fluid that is purely translating on the
hyperbolic plane. Although this lies within the Carter-Plebanski (CP) class, it
has never been studied in the literature before, and represents thus in
principle a new black hole solution in AdS$_4$. For a rigidly rotating fluid in
R x H$^2$ (holographically dual to the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ solution), there is
a certain radius where the velocity reaches the speed of light, and thus the
fluid can cover only the region within this radius. Quite remarkably, it turns
out that the boundary of the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ black hole is conformal to
exactly that part of R x H$^2$ in which the fluid velocity does not exceed the
speed of light. We extend these results to establish a precise mapping between
possible flows on ultrastatic spacetimes (with constant curvature spatial
sections) and the parameter space of the CP solution. Finally, we show that the
alternative description of the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ black hole in terms of
fluid mechanics on R x S$^2$ or on flat space is dynamical and consists of a
contracting or expanding vortex.

the Higgs boson of the Standard Model as well as the light CP-even Higgs boson

measured mass value, having already reached the level of a precision observable
with an experimental accuracy of about 500 MeV, plays an important role. This
precision can be improved substantially below the level of about 50 MeV at the
future International Linear Collider (ILC). Within the MSSM the mass of the
light CP-even Higgs boson, M_h, can directly be predicted from the other
parameters of the model. The accuracy of this prediction should match the one
of the experimental measurements. The relatively high experimentally observed
value of the mass of about 125.6 GeV has led to many investigations where the
supersymmetric (SUSY) partners of the top quark have masses in the multi-TeV
range. We review the recent improvements for the prediction for M_h in the MSSM
for large scalar top masses. They were obtained by combining the existing
fixed-order result, comprising the full one-loop and leading and subleading
two-loop corrections, with a resummation of the leading and subleading
logarithmic contributions from the scalar top sector to all orders. In this way
for the first time a high-precision prediction for the mass of the light
CP-even Higgs boson in the MSSM is possible all the way up to the multi-TeV
region of the relevant supersymmetric particles. However, substantial further
improvements will be needed to reach the ILC precision. The newly obtained

solar photovoltaic and wind power generation, calls for Smart Grids that
effectively manage flexible loads and energy storage. The ability to forecast
consumption at different locations in distribution systems will be a key
capability of Smart Grids. The goal of this paper is to benchmark
state-of-the-art methods for forecasting electricity demand on the household
level across different granularities and time scales in an explorative way,
thereby revealing potential shortcomings and find promising directions for
future research in this area. We apply a number of forecasting methods
including ARIMA, neural networks, and exponential smoothening using several
strategies for training data selection, in particular day type and sliding
window based strategies. We consider forecasting horizons ranging between 15
minutes and 24 hours. Our evaluation is based on two data sets containing the
power usage of individual appliances at second time granularity collected over
the course of several months. The results indicate that forecasting accuracy
varies significantly depending on the choice of forecasting methods/strategy
and the parameter configuration. Measured by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE), the considered state-of-the-art forecasting methods rarely beat
corresponding persistence forecasts. Overall, we observed MAPEs in the range
between 5 and >100%. The average MAPE for the first data set was ~30%, while it
was ~85% for the other data set. These results show big room for improvement.
Based on the identified trends and experiences from our experiments, we
contribute a detailed discussion of promising future research.

contact with other civilizations and the expectation that technological
civilizations are assumed likely to evolve in many locations in the Milky Way
galaxy, given the large number of planetary systems within this galaxy. Work by
Landis and others has modeled this question in terms of percolation theory and
cellular automata, using this method to parametrize our ignorance about
possible other civilizations as a function of the probability of one system to
colonize another, and the maximum number of systems reachable from each
starting location (i.e. the degree in the network used for percolation). These
models used a fixed lattice of sites to represent a stellar region, so the
degree of all sites were identical. In this paper, the question is examined
again, but instead of using a pre-determined lattice, the actual physical
positions of all known star systems within 40 parsecs of the Solar System are
used as percolation sites; in addition, the number of sites accessible for
further colonization from a given system is determined by a choice of maximum
distance such efforts can travel across. The resulting simulations show that
extraterrestrial colonization efforts may reach the Solar System, but only for
certain values of the maximum travel distance and probability of an occupied
system further colonizing other systems. Indeed, large numbers of systems may
be colonized with either vessels that lack insufficient travel distance to
reach the Solar System or else have a colonization probability where they are
statistically unlikely to reach us.

with nearest neighbor interactions that is appropriate to illustrate different

transition between a disordered (high temperature) and ordered (low

regions that have spectral types of M6-L0 (0.01-0.1 Msun). An additional
late-type member of Taurus, FU Tau (M7.25+M9.25), was also observed with
adaptive optics at Keck Observatory. We have applied PSF subtraction to the
primaries and have searched the resulting images for objects that have colors
and magnitudes that are indicative of young low-mass objects. Through this
process, we have identified promising candidate companions to 2MASS
J04414489+2301513 (rho=0.105""/15 AU), 2MASS J04221332+1934392 (rho=0.05""/7 AU),
and ISO 217 (rho=0.03""/5 AU). We reported the discovery of the first candidate
in a previous study, showing that it has a similar proper motion as the primary
through a comparison of astrometry measured with WFPC2 and Gemini adaptive
optics. We have collected an additional epoch of data with Gemini that further
supports that result. By combining our survey with previous high-resolution
imaging in Taurus, Chamaeleon, and Upper Sco (10 Myr), we measure binary
fractions of 14/93 = 0.15+0.05/-0.03 for M4-M6 (0.1-0.3 Msun) and 4/108 =
0.04+0.03/-0.01 for >M6 (<0.1 Msun) at separations of >10 AU. Given the youth
and low density of these three regions, the lower binary fraction at later
types is probably primordial rather than due to dynamical interactions among
association members. The widest low-mass binaries (>100 AU) also appear to be
more common in Taurus and Chamaeleon than in the field, which suggests that the
widest low-mass binaries are disrupted by dynamical interactions at >10 Myr, or
that field brown dwarfs have been born predominantly in denser clusters where
wide systems are disrupted or inhibited from forming.

consequence of the complexity of the medium, each trajectory is supposed to

timescales is computed. In particular, when a stationary distribution is
considered, the timescale distribution is uniquely determined as a function
related to the fundamental solution of the space-time fractional diffusion
equation. In contrast, when the non-stationary case is considered, the
timescale distribution is no longer unique. Two distributions are here

reduction in sampling and storage complexity can be achieved in certain linear
and non-adaptive estimation problems. It is therefore an advisable strategy for
noncoherent information retrieval in, for example, sporadic blind and
semi-blind communication and sampling problems. But, the conventional model is
not practical here since the compressible signals have to be estimated from
samples taken solely on the output of an un-calibrated system which is unknown
during measurement but often compressible. Conventionally, one has either to
operate at suboptimal sampling rates or the recovery performance substantially
suffers from the dominance of model mismatch. In this work we discuss such type
of estimation problems and we focus on bilinear inverse problems. We link this
problem to the recovery of low-rank and sparse matrices and establish stable
low-dimensional embeddings of the uncalibrated receive signals whereby
addressing also efficient communication-oriented methods like universal random
demodulation. Exemplary, we investigate in more detail sparse convolutions
serving as a basic communication channel model. In using some recent results
from additive combinatorics we show that such type of signals can be
efficiently low-rate sampled by semi-blind methods. Finally, we present a

neutron stars in Be/X-ray binaries (BeXBs) and their orbital periods . Recently
Knigge et al. (2011) showed that the distribution of the spin periods contains
two distinct subpopulations peaked at $\sim 10$ s and $\sim 200$ s
respectively, and suggested that they may be related to two types of supernovae
for the formation of the neutron stars, i.e., core-collapse and
electron-capture supernovae. Here we propose that the bimodal spin period
distribution is likely to be ascribed to different accretion modes of the
neutron stars in BeXBs. When the neutron star tends to capture material from
the warped, outer part of the Be star disk and experiences giant outbursts, a
radiatively-cooling dominated disk is formed around the neutron star, which
spins up the neutron star, and is responsible for the short period
subpopulation. In BeXBs that are dominated by normal outbursts or persistent,
the accretion flow is advection-dominated or quasi-spherical. The spin-up
process is accordingly inefficient, leading to longer periods of the neuron
stars. The potential relation between the subpopulations and the supernova
mechanisms is also discussed.

formed. Typically, it is believed that links are formed in a structured manner,
which may be due to, for example, political or material incentives, and which
often may not be directly observable. The stochastic blockmodel represents this
structure using latent groups which exhibit different connective properties, so
that conditional on the group membership of two actors, the probability of a
link being formed between them is represented by a connectivity matrix. The
mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSBM) extends this model to allow
actors membership to different groups, depending on the interaction in
question, providing further flexibility.
  Attribute information can also play an important role in explaining network
formation. Network models which do not explicitly incorporate covariate
information require the analyst to compare fitted network models to additional
attributes in a post-hoc manner. We introduce the mixed membership of experts
stochastic blockmodel, an extension to the MMSBM which incorporates covariate
actor information into the existing model. The method is illustrated with
application to the Lazega Lawyers dataset. Model and variable selection methods

the global existence and future stability for small perturbations of class

the presence of cosmological horizons. The proof is based on the vector field

usual $T^{3/2}$ dependence appears to be valid in some nanostructures, while
large deviations are a general rule. We demonstrate that combination of

structural and functional properties of large-scale networks that extends into
adulthood. However, it is not clearly understood which features change and
which remain stable over time. Here, we examined structural connectivity based
on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 121 participants between 4 and 40 years of
age. DTI data were analyzed for small-world parameters, modularity, and the
number of fiber tracts at the level of streamlines. First, our findings showed
that the number of fiber tracts, small-world topology, and modular organization
remained largely stable despite a substantial overall decrease in the number of
streamlines with age. Second, this decrease mainly affected fiber tracts that
had a large number of streamlines, were short, within modules and within
hemispheres; such connections were affected significantly more often than would
be expected given their number of occurrences in the network. Third, streamline
loss occurred earlier in females than in males. In summary, our findings
suggest that core properties of structural brain connectivity, such as the
small-world and modular organization, remain stable during brain maturation by
focusing streamline loss to specific types of fiber tracts.

The fundamentally different perspectives embraced in theories developed in

the volatility smile and of the excess volatility puzzle. The role of the Ising
model of phase transitions to model social and financial systems is reviewed,
with the concepts of random utilities and the logit model as the analog of the
Boltzmann factor in statistic physics. Recent extensions in term of quantum
decision theory are also covered. A wealth of models are discussed briefly that
build on the Ising model and generalize it to account for the many stylized

its extensions is provided to account for financial bubbles and crashes. The

even Kakutani equivalence is a purely measurable relation, while systems such

  Recently del Junco, Rudolph and Weiss studied a new relation called nearly

even Kakutani equivalence where also $X_0$ and $Y_0$ are invariant $G_\delta$

continuous Kakutani equivalence is the natural strengthening of even Kakutani
equivalence to the nearly continuous category---the category where maps are
continuous after sets of measure zero are removed. In this paper we show that

pressure in the heliosphere (magnetic + plasma) is reduced by ~40%, which leads
to the anomalous expansion of CMEs explaining the increased slope. The excess
CME expansion contributes to the diminished effectiveness of CMEs in producing

solving a generalized Debye-H\""uckel (DH) equation. We develop numerical
methods for the system composed of the PNP and DH equations. Particularly,
towards the numerical challenge of solving the high-dimensional DH equation, we
developed an analytical WKB approximation and a numerical approach based on the
selective inversion of sparse matrices. The model and numerical methods are
validated by simulating the charge diffusion in electrolytes between two
electrodes, for which effects of dielectrics and correlation are investigated
by comparing the results with the prediction by the classical PNP theory. We
find that, at the length scale of the interface separation comparable to the
Bjerrum length, the results of the modified equations are significantly
different from the classical PNP predictions mostly due to the dielectric
effect. It is also shown that when the ion self energy is in weak or mediate
strength, the WKB approximation presents a high accuracy, compared to precise

  Decodable Network Coding",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the maximum broadcast
decoding delay experienced by all the receivers of generalized instantly
decodable network coding (IDNC). Unlike the sum decoding delay, the maximum
decoding delay as a definition of delay for IDNC allows a more equitable
distribution of the delays between the different receivers and thus a better
Quality of Service (QoS). In order to solve this problem, we first derive the
expressions for the probability distributions of maximum decoding delay
increments. Given these expressions, we formulate the problem as a maximum
weight clique problem in the IDNC graph. Although this problem is known to be
NP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to perform effective packet selection.
Through extensive simulations, we compare the sum decoding delay and the max
decoding delay experienced when applying the policies to minimize the sum
decoding delay [1] and our policy to reduce the max decoding delay. Simulations
results show that our policy gives a good agreement among all the delay aspects
in all situations and outperforms the sum decoding delay policy to effectively
minimize the sum decoding delay when the channel conditions become harsher.
They also show that our definition of delay significantly improve the number of
served receivers when they are subject to strict delay constraints.

according to the number ($J$) of joint publications which the authors have
together. In this paper, the Zipf-Mandelbrot-Pareto law, i.e. $ J \propto
1/(\nu+r)^{\zeta}$ is shown to reproduce the empirical relationship between $J$
and $r$ and shown to be preferable to a mere power law, $ J \propto
1/r^{\alpha} $. The CA core value, i.e. the core number of CAs, is unaffected,
of course. The demonstration is made on data for two authors, with a high
number of joint publications, recently considered by Bougrine (2014) and for 7
authors, distinguishing between their ""journal"" and ""proceedings"" publications
as suggested by Miskiewicz (2013).
  The rank-size statistics is discussed and the $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ exponents
are compared. The correlation coefficient is much improved ($\sim$ 0.99,
instead of 0.92). There are marked deviations of such a co-authorship
popularity law depending on sub-fields. On one hand, this suggests an
interpretation of the parameter $\nu$. On the other hand, it suggests a novel
model on the (likely time dependent) structural and publishing properties of
research teams. Thus, one can propose a scenario for how a research team is
formed and grows. This is based on a hierarchy utility concept, justifying the
empirical Zipf-Mandelbrot-Pareto law, assuming a simple form for the CA
publication/cost ratio, $c_r = c_0\: log_2 (\nu+r)$. In conclusion, such a law
and model can suggest practical applications on measures of research teams.

the seesaw type I mechanism with similarity of the Dirac lepton and quarks mass
matrices $m_D$. For this, we elaborate on the standard parametrization
conditions which allow to simultaneously obtain the Dirac and Majorana phases.
If the only origin of CP violation is the left-handed (LH) transformation which
diagonalizes $m_D$ (similar to quarks), the leptonic CP violation is suppressed
and the Dirac phase is close to $\pi$ or to $0$ with $\sin \delta_{CP} \approx
(\sin \theta_{13}^q /\sin \theta_{13}) \cos \theta_{23} \sin \delta_q \sim
\lambda^2 \sin \delta_q$. Here $\lambda \sim \theta_C$, is the Cabibbo mixing
angle, and $\theta_{13}^q$ and $\theta_{13}$ are the 1-3 mixing angles of
quarks and leptons respectively. The Majorana phases $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are suppressed as $\lambda^3\sin\delta_q$. For Majorana neutrinos implied by
seesaw, the right-handed (RH) transformations are important. We explore the
simplest extension inspired by Left-Right (L-R) symmetry with small CKM-type CP
violation. In this case, seesaw enhancement of the CP violation occurs due to
strong hierarchy of the eigenvalues of $m_D$ leading to $\delta_{CP} \sim 1$.
The enhancement is absent under the phase factorization conditions which
require certain relations between parameters of the Majorana mass matrix of RH
neutrinos.

sums of codewords, our scheme improves considerably upon the conventional
coding schemes which treat interference as noise or decode messages
simultaneously. Our strategy also extends directly to the usual many-to-one
interference channels without cognitive messages. Comparing to the usual
compute-and-forward scheme where a fixed lattice is used for the code
construction, the novel scheme employs scaled lattices and also encompasses key
ingredients of the existing schemes for the cognitive interference channel.

$B^+\rightarrow X(3872)K^+$ decays is found with a significance of 4.4 standard
deviations. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb
detector, at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8TeV. The ratio of the branching
fraction of the $X(3872)\to\psi(2S)\gamma$ decay to that of the
$X(3872)\rightarrow J/\psi \gamma$ decay is measured to be $$
\frac{Br(X(3872)\rightarrow\psi(2S)\gamma)}{Br(X(3872)\rightarrow
J/\psi\gamma)} = 2.46\pm0.64\pm0.29, %\pm0.06,$$ where the first uncertainty is
statistical and the second is systematic. The measured value agrees with
expectations for a pure charmonium interpretation of the $X(3872)$ state and a
mixture of charmonium and molecular interpretations. However, it does not
support a pure $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular interpretation of the $X(3872)$state.

the weak and strong gravitational fields caused by inhomogeneities of matter in
the static world of galaxies and clusters. We show that the dark energy in the
weak gravitational fields of matter density perturbations can condense or
dilute, but amplitudes of its perturbations remain very small on all scales. We
illustrate also how the ""accretion"" of the phantom dark energy onto the matter
overdensity forms the dark energy underdensity. We analyze the behavior of dark
energy in the gravitational fields of stars and black holes with the
Schwarzschild metric. It is shown that, in the case of stars, the static
solution of the differential equations for energy-momentum conservation exists
and describes the distribution of density of dark energy inside and outside of
a star. We have found that for stars and galaxies its value differs slightly
from the average and is a bit higher for the quintessential scalar field as
dark energy and a bit lower for the phantom one. The difference grows with the
decrease of the effective sound speed of dark energy and is large in the
neighborhood of neutron stars. We obtain and analyze also the solutions of
equations that describe the stationary accretion of the dark energy as a test
component onto the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that the rate of
change of mass of the dark energy is positive in the case of quintessential
dark energy and is negative in the case of the phantom one.

inside electronic devices, has a huge potential for quantum computation and
dissipationless interconnects. Ideally, spin currents in spintronic devices
should be powered by a spin voltage generator able to drive spins out of
equilibrium and produce two spatially well-separated populations with opposite
spin orientation. Such a generator should work at room temperature, be highly
integrable with existing semiconductor technology, and work with neither
ferromagnetic materials nor externally applied magnetic fields. We have matched
these requirements by realizing the spintronic equivalent of a photovoltaic
cell. While the latter spatially separates photoexcited electron and hole
charges, our device exploits circularly polarized light to produce two
spatially well-defined electron populations with opposite spin. This is
achieved by modulating the phase and amplitude of the light wavefronts entering
a semiconductor (germanium) with a patterned metal overlayer (platinum). This
allows creating a light diffraction pattern with spatially-modulated chirality
inside the semiconductor, which locally excites spin-polarized electrons thanks
to electric dipole selection rules.

shell models for GRB afterglows. In the thick shell model, the time evolution
of the underlying relativistic blast wave is still influenced by the original
ejecta, while in the thin shell model most energy in the explosion has been
transferred to the external medium. It is shown here that the observed

electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We use this technique to
measure the electric field distribution inside a glass cylinder with applied RF
fields at 17.04 GHz and 104.77 GHz. We achieve a spatial resolution of
$\bf{\approx}$100 $\bf{\mu}$m, limited by the widths of the laser beams
utilized for the EIT spectroscopy. We numerically simulate the fields in the
glass cylinder and find good agreement with the measured fields. Our results
suggest that this technique could be applied to image fields on a small spatial

consider Milgrom's papers of 1983 introducing the idea and its consequences for
galaxies and galaxy groups, as well as the initial reactions, both negative and
positive. The early criticisms were primarily on matters of principle, such as
the absence of conservation laws and perceived cosmological problems; an
important step in addressing these issues was the development of the
Lagrangian-based non-relativistic theory of Bekenstein and Milgrom. This theory
led to the development of a tentative relativistic theory that formed the basis
for later multi-field theories of gravity. On an empirical level the predictive
success of the idea with respect to the phenomenology of galaxies presents
considerable challenges for cold dark matter. For MOND the essential challenge
remains the absence of a generally accepted theoretical underpinning of the
idea and, thus, cosmological predictions. I briefly review recent progress in
this direction. Finally I discuss the role and sociology of unconventional
ideas in astronomy in the presence of a strongly entrenched standard paradigm.
