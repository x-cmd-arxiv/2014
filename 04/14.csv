heritability in high dimensional sparse linear mixed models. The heritability
determines how the variance is shared between the different random components
of a linear mixed model. The main novelty of our approach is to consider that
the random effects can be sparse, that is may contain null components, but we
do not know neither their proportion nor their positions. The estimator that we
consider is strongly inspired by the one proposed by Pirinen et al. (2013), and
is based on a maximum likelihood approach. We also study the theoretical
properties of our estimator, namely we establish that our estimator of the
heritability is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent when both the number of observations $n$
and the number of random effects $N$ tend to infinity under mild assumptions.
We also prove that our estimator of the heritability satisfies a central limit
theorem which gives as a byproduct a confidence interval for the heritability.
Some Monte-Carlo experiments are also conducted in order to show the finite
sample performances of our estimator.

investigate and quantify the nonlinear rheology of amorphous solids, complex
fluids and biological materials. Quite a few recent experimental and atomistic
simulation studies demonstrated that at low shear amplitudes, an amorphous
solid settles into an amplitude- and initial conditions-dependent dissipative
limit cycle, in which back-and-forth localized particle rearrangements
periodically bring the system to the same state. At sufficiently large shear
amplitudes, the amorphous system loses memory of the initial conditions,
exhibits chaotic particle motions accompanied by diffusive behavior and settles
into a stochastic steady-state. The two regimes are separated by a transition
amplitude, possibly characterized by some critical-like features. Here we argue
that these observations support some of the physical assumptions embodied in
the nonequilibrium thermodynamic, internal-variables based,
Shear-Transformation-Zone model of amorphous visco-plasticity; most notably
that ""flow defects"" in amorphous solids are characterized by internal states
between which they can make transitions, and that structural evolution is
driven by dissipation associated with plastic deformation. We present a rather
extensive theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic Shear-Transformation-Zone
model for a variable-amplitude oscillatory shear protocol, highlighting its
success in accounting for various experimental and simulational observations,
as well as its limitations. Our results offer a continuum-level theoretical
framework for interpreting the variable-amplitude oscillatory shear response of
amorphous solids and may promote additional developments.

Graphene flakes are deposited uniformly on the taper waist with light pressure

polarization switching in two orthogonal polarization directions, and the
temporal and spectral characteristics are investigated. The results suggest

a client is going to use, in addition to the site distances, other site
attributes are also considered (for example, prices or weights). A cell in this
diagram is then the locus of all clients that consider the same set of sites to
be relevant. In particular, the precise site a client might use from this
candidate set depends on parameters that might change between usages, and the
candidate set lists all of the relevant sites. The resulting diagram is
significantly more expressive than Voronoi diagrams, but naturally has the
drawback that its complexity, even in the plane, might be quite high.
Nevertheless, we show that if the attributes of the sites are drawn from the
same distribution (note that the locations are fixed), then the expected
complexity of the candidate diagram is near linear.
  To this end, we derive several new technical results, which are of
independent interest. In particular, we provide a high-probability,
asymptotically optimal bound on the number of Pareto optima points in a point
set uniformly sampled from the $d$-dimensional hypercube. To do so we revisit
the classical backward analysis technique, both simplifying and improving

these processes, a natural observed quantity arises: the ratio between the
reflected and incident intensities, known as the reflection coefficient. This
dissertation is concerned with the phenomenon known as superradiance, that is,
when this coefficient is larger than unity.
  We shall explore many examples of such systems, and, more importantly, we
shall also see how, apart from the interest in its own right, superradiance is
related to a number of important current research physical issues. We begin
with a small survey of important results on chapter one. On chapter two, we
establish a general criteria to decide whether or not superradiant scattering
is observed based on the linear, second order, homogeneous ordinary
differential equation (ODE) or linear, first order homogeneous systems of ODEs
which describes the process and we shall give an example of system in which
superradiance is observed. On chapter three, we focus on spinning black hole
superradiance, we shall describe how one can compute explicitly the reflection
coefficient for different spin waves. Chapter four is dedicated to the
relations with thermodynamics. We develop what is meant by black hole
thermodynamics, particularly the so-called first and second law of black hole
thermodynamics, and apply them in the context of superradiance, so we can
generalise some of the results from chapter three to more general black holes.
Finally, on chapter five, we explore many of the quantum aspects of
superradiance, including the relation with the Klein paradox, and the quantum
version of black hole superradiance, for the later we will explain briefly how
one usually quantise fields in curved space-time. A further connection with

overpredict the satellite abundance around the Milky Way (MW) and it disagrees
with observations of the central densities of dwarf galaxies which prefer
constant density (core) profiles.One alternative explanation known as the
scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model, assumes that the dark matter is a scalar
field of mass($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$); this model can reduce the
overabundance issue due to the lack of halo formation below a mass scale of
$\sim 10^8$M$_{\odot}$ and successfully fits the density distribution in
dwarfs. One of the attractive features of the model is predicting core profiles
in halos, although the determination of the core sizes is set by fitting the
observational data. We perform \textit{N}-body simulations to explore the
influence of tidal forces over a stellar distribution embedded in a SFDM halo
orbiting a MW-like SFDM host halo with a disk. Our simulations intend to test
the viability of SFDM as an alternative model by comparing the tidal effects
that result in this paradigm with those obtained in CDM for similar mass halos.
We found that galaxies in subhalos with core profiles and high central
densities survive for 10 Gyr. The same occurs for galaxies in low density
subhalos located far from the host disk influence, whereas satellites in low
density DM halos and in tight orbits can eventually be stripped of stars. We
conclude that SFDM shows consistency with results from CDM for dwarf galaxies,
but naturally offer a possibility to solve the missing satellite problem.

Moving Window Network Coding with Anonymous Feedback (MWNC-AF) that
successfully addresses this challenge. In particular, we show that our scheme
simultaneously achieves both a constant decoding delay and a constant feedback
overhead, irrespective of the number of receivers $n$, without sacrificing
either throughput or reliability. We explicitly characterize the asymptotic
decay rate of the tail of the delay distribution, and prove that transmitting a
fixed amount of information bits into the MWNC-AF encoder buffer in each
time-slot (called ""constant data injection process"") achieves the fastest decay
rate, thus showing how to obtain delay optimality in a large deviation sense.
We then investigate the average decoding delay of MWNC-AF, and show that when
the traffic load approaches the capacity, the average decoding delay under the
constant injection process is at most one half of that under a Bernoulli
injection process. In addition, we prove that the per-packet encoding and
decoding complexity of MWNC-AF both scale as $O(\log n)$, with the number of
receivers $n$. Our simulations further underscore the performance of our scheme
through comparisons with other schemes and show that the delay, encoding and

web caches and peer-to-peer systems, we consider and study a class of resource
allocation problems over a network of agents (nodes). In this model, nodes can
store only a limited number of resources while accessing the remaining ones
through their closest neighbors. We consider this problem under both
optimization and game-theoretic frameworks. In the case of optimal resource
allocation we will first show that when there are only k=2 resources, the
optimal allocation can be found efficiently in O(n^2\log n) steps, where n
denotes the total number of nodes. However, for k>2 this problem becomes
NP-hard with no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a performance
guarantee better than 1+1/102k^2, even under metric access costs. We then
provide a 3-approximation algorithm for the optimal resource allocation which
runs only in linear time O(n). Subsequently, we look at this problem under a
selfish setting formulated as a noncooperative game and provide a
3-approximation algorithm for obtaining its pure Nash equilibria under metric
access costs. We then establish an equivalence between the set of pure Nash
equilibria and flip-optimal solutions of the Max-k-Cut problem over a specific
weighted complete graph. Using this reduction, we show that finding the
lexicographically smallest Nash equilibrium for k> 2 is NP-hard, and provide an
algorithm to find it in O(n^3 2^n) steps. While the reduction to weighted
Max-k-Cut suggests that finding a pure Nash equilibrium using best response
dynamics might be PLS-hard, it allows us to use tools from quadratic
programming to devise more systematic algorithms towards obtaining Nash
equilibrium points.

wave state featuring anomalous quantum Hall effect and the d+id superconductor

Using a combination of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization
group, the variational Monte Carlo method and quantum field theories, we study
the quantum phase diagrams of both the Hubbard model and t-J model on the
honeycomb lattice at 1/4-doping. The main advantage of our approach is the use
of symmetry quantum numbers of ground state wavefunctions on finite size
systems (up to 32 sites) to sharply distinguish different quantum phases. Our
results show that for $1\lesssim U/t< 40$ in the Hubbard model and for $0.1<
J/t<0.80(2)$ in the t-J model, the quantum ground state is either a chiral spin
density wave state or a spin-charge-Chern liquid, but not a d+id
superconductor. However, in the t-J model, upon increasing $J$ the system goes
through a first-order phase transition at $J/t=0.80(2)$ into the d+id
superconductor. Here the spin-charge-Chern liquid state is a new type of
topologically ordered quantum phase with Abelian anyons and fractionalized
excitations. Experimental signatures of these quantum phases, such as tunneling
conductance, are calculated. These results are discussed in the context of

limitation of nonadaptive measurements and motivate the study of more
sophisticated measurement schemes. In the course of our study, we introduce the
best linear unbiased estimator and show that it is equally efficient as the
maximum likelihood estimator in the large-sample limit. This estimator may
significantly outperform the canonical linear estimator for states with high

adaptive quantum state tomography besides its significance to the current

allocations for traffic engineering, but at the same time the scalability

Those crucial issues in SDN have been studied for unicast but have not been
explored for multicast traffic, and addressing those issues for multicast is
more challenging since the identities and the number of members in a multicast
group can be arbitrary. In this paper, therefore, we propose a new multicast
tree for SDN, named Branch-aware Steiner Tree (BST). The BST problem is
difficult since it needs to jointly minimize the numbers of the edges and the
branch nodes in a tree, and we prove that it is NP-Hard and inapproximable
within $k$, which denotes the number of group members. We further design an
approximation algorithm, called Branch Aware Edge Reduction Algorithm (BAERA),
to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the trees obtained by
BAERA are more bandwidth-efficient and scalable than the shortest-path trees
and traditional Steiner trees. Most importantly, BAERA is computation-efficient
to be deployed in SDN since it can generate a tree on massive networks in small

rowmotion (like birational rowmotion) admits an alternative definition related
to Stanley's transfer map for the order polytope; piecewise-linear promotion
relates to Sch\""utzenberger promotion for semistandard Young tableaux. The
three settings for these dynamical systems (combinatorial, piecewise-linear,

as tropicalizations of the birational operations, and the combinatorial
operations arise as restrictions of the piecewise-linear operations to the
vertex-set of the order polytope. In the case where the poset is of the form
$[a] \times [b]$, we exploit a reciprocal symmetry property recently proved by
Grinberg and Roby to show that birational rowmotion (and consequently
piecewise-linear rowmotion) is of order $a+b$. This yields a new proof of a
theorem of Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass. Our proofs make use of the
correspondence between rowmotion and promotion orbits discovered by Striker and

separated from each other at the gravitational contraction in primordial
magnetic field (PMF). A gradient in the PMF in a direction perpendicular to the
field direction leads to the Lorentz force on the charged species. Resultantly,
an ambipolar diffusion occurs, and charged species can move differently from
neutral species, which collapses gravitationally during the structure
formation. We assume a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a
spherically symmetric structure, and calculate fluid motions of charged and
neutral species. It is shown that the charged fluid, i.e., proton, electron and
$^7$Li$^+$, can significantly decouple from the neutral fluid depending on the
field amplitude. The charged species can, therefore, escape from the
gravitational collapse. We take the structure mass, the epoch of the
gravitational collapse, and the comoving Lorenz force as parameters. We then
identify a parameter region for an effective chemical separation. This type of
chemical separation can reduce the abundance ratio of Li/H in early structures
because of inefficient contraction of $^7$Li$^+$ ion. Therefore, it may explain
Li abundances of Galactic metal-poor stars which are smaller than the
prediction in standard big bang nucleosynthesis model. Amplitudes of the PMFs
are controlled by a magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. The upper limit on the
field amplitude derived from the turbulence effect is close to the value
required for the chemical separation.

rise to new communication strategies, partially inspired by the private/public

observing strategy of current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. It
aims to reduce the stellar speckles that prevent the detection of cool planets
by using in/out methane-band images. It attenuates the signature of off-axis
companions to the star, such as angular differential imaging (ADI). However,
this attenuation depends on the spectral properties of the low-mass companions
we are searching for. The implications of this particularity on estimating the
detection limits have been poorly explored so far. Aims. We perform an imaging
survey to search for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations as
close as 5-10 AU. We also aim to assess the sensitivity limits in SDI data
taking the photometric bias into account. This will lead to a better view of
the SDI performance. Methods. We observed a selected sample of 16 stars (age <
200 Myr, d < 25 pc) with the phase-mask coronagraph, SDI, and ADI modes of
VLT/NaCo. Results. We do not detect any companions. As for the sensitivity
limits, we argue that the SDI residual noise cannot be converted into mass
limits because it represents a differential flux, unlike the case of
single-band images. This results in degeneracies for the mass limits, which may
be removed with the use of single-band constraints. We instead employ a method
of directly determining the mass limits. The survey is sensitive to cool giant
planets beyond 10 AU for 65% and 30 AU for 100% of the sample. Conclusions. For
close-in separations, the optimal regime for SDI corresponds to SDI flux ratios
>2. According to the BT-Settl model, this translates into Teff<800 K. The
methods described here can be applied to the data interpretation of SPHERE. We
expect better performance with the dual-band imager IRDIS, thanks to more
suitable filter characteristics and better image quality.

understanding of many processes in the soil-air-water system and for
applications in civil, agricultural, and environmental engineering. The
background of this work is an available chain of interconnected physical
shrinkage curve models for clay, intra-aggregate matrix, aggregated soil
without cracks, and soil with cracks. The objective of the work is to
generalize these models to the case of swelling, and to construct the
physical-swelling-model chain with a step-by-step transition from clay to
aggregated soil with cracks. The generalization is based on thorough accounting
for the analogies and differences between shrinkage and swelling and the
corresponding use, modification, or replacement of the soil shrinkage features.
Two specific soil swelling features to be used are: (i) air entrapping in pores
of the contributing clay; and (ii) aggregate destruction with the formation of
new aggregate surfaces. The input for the prediction of the swelling curve of
an aggregated soil coincides with that of the available model of the shrinkage
curve. The analysis of available data on the maximum shrink-swell cycle of two
soils with different texture and structure, accounting for sample size is
conducted as applied to swelling curves and to the residual crack volume and
maximum-swelling-volume decrease after the shrink-swell cycle. Results of the
analysis show evidence in favor of the swelling model chain.

particular, the eruptive filament encountered a topological discontinuity
located near the solar disk center at a height of about 100 Mm, bifurcated, and
transformed into a large cloud, which did not leave the Sun. Concurrently, an
additional CME presumably erupted close to the bifurcation region. The
conjectures about the responsibility of this compact CME for the superstorm and
its disconnection from the Sun are confirmed in Paper IV (Grechnev et al.,
Solar Phys., submitted), which concludes about its probable spheromak-like
structure. The present paper confirms the presence of a magnetic null point
near the bifurcation region and addresses the origin of the magnetic helicity
of the interplanetary magnetic clouds and their connection to the Sun. We find
that the orientation of a magnetic dipole constituted by dimmed regions with
the opposite magnetic polarities away from the parent active region
corresponded to the direction of the axial field in the magnetic cloud, while
the pre-eruptive filament mismatched it. To combine all of the listed findings,
we come to an intrinsically three-dimensional scheme, in which a spheromak-like
eruption originates via the interaction of the initially unconnected magnetic
fluxes of the eruptive filament and pre-existing ones in the corona. Through a
chain of magnetic reconnections their positive mutual helicity was transformed
into the self-helicity of the spheromak-like magnetic cloud.

they are stochastic and correlated: the quality of inference from such dynamics
fundamentally depends on how fast the neural circuit generates new samples from
its stationary distribution. Indeed, behavioral decisions can occur on fast
time scales (~100 ms), but it is unclear what neural circuit dynamics afford
sampling at such high rates.
  We analyzed a stochastic form of rate-based linear neuronal network dynamics
with synaptic weight matrix $W$, and the dependence on $W$ of the covariance of
the stationary distribution of joint firing rates. This covariance $\Sigma$ can
be actively used to represent posterior uncertainty via sampling under a
linear-Gaussian latent variable model. The key insight is that the mapping
between $W$ and $\Sigma$ is degenerate: there are infinitely many $W$'s that
lead to sampling from the same $\Sigma$ but differ greatly in the speed at
which they sample. We were able to explicitly separate these extra degrees of
freedom in a parametric form and thus study their effects on sampling speed.
  We show that previous proposals for probabilistic sampling in neural circuits
correspond to using a symmetric $W$ which violates Dale's law and results in
critically slow sampling, even for moderate stationary correlations. In
contrast, optimizing network dynamics for speed consistently yielded asymmetric
$W$'s and dynamics characterized by fast transients, such that samples of
network activity became fully decorrelated over ~10 ms. Importantly, networks
with separate excitatory/inhibitory populations proved to be particularly
efficient samplers, and were in the balanced regime. Thus, plausible neural
circuit dynamics can perform fast sampling for efficient decoding and
inference.

quantum particles in disorder. In three spatial dimensions it becomes
particularly interesting to study because of the presence of a quantum phase
transition from localized to extended states, predicted by P.W. Anderson in his
seminal work, taking place at a critical energy, the so-called mobility edge.
The possible relation of the Anderson transition to the metal-insulator
transitions observed in materials has originated a flurry of theoretical
studies during the past 50 years, and it is now possible to predict very
accurately the mobility edge starting from models of the microscopic disorder.
However, the experiments performed so far with photons, ultrasound and
ultracold atoms, while giving evidence of the transition, could not provide a
precise measurement of the mobility edge. In this work we are able to obtain
such a measurement using an ultracold atomic system in a disordered speckle
potential, thanks to a precise control of the system energy. We find that the
mobility edge is close to the mean disorder energy at small disorder strengths,
while a clear effect of the spatial correlation of the disorder appears at
larger strengths. The precise knowledge of the disorder properties in our
system offers now the opportunity for an unprecedented experiment-theory
comparison for 3D Anderson localization, which is also a necessary step to
start the exploration of novel regimes for many-body disordered systems.

fermions, where the interactions are described by the extended Hubbard model,
is investigated. By using an accurate real-time propagation scheme based on the
Chebyshev expansion of the evolution operator, we uncover various non-linear
regimes for a range of interaction parameters that allows modeling of metallic
and insulating (either charge density wave or spin density wave insulators)
rings. The metallic regime appears at the phase boundary between the two
insulating phases and provides the opportunity to describe either weakly or
strongly correlated metals. We find that the {\it fidelity susceptibility} of
the ground state as a function of magnetic flux piercing the ring provides a
very good measure of the short-time response. Even completely different
interacting regimes behave in a similar manner at short time-scales as long as
the fidelity susceptibility is the same. Depending on the strength of the
electric field we find various types of responses: persistent currents in the
insulating regime, dissipative regime or damped Bloch-like oscillations with
varying frequencies or even irregular in nature. Furthermore, we also consider
the dimerization of the ring and describe the response of a correlated band

considered. The time-dependent domain is handled by the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach, whereas the SUPG finite element method is
used for the spatial discretization. Further, the first order backward Euler
and the second order Crank-Nicolson methods are used for the temporal
discretization. It is shown that the stability of the semidiscrete (continuous
in time) conservative ALE-SUPG equation is independent of the mesh velocity,
whereas the stability of the fully discrete problem is unconditionally stable
for implicit Euler method and is only conditionally stable for Crank-Nicolson
time discretization. Numerical results are presented to show the influence of
the SUPG stabilization parameter in a time-dependent domain. Further, the
proposed numerical scheme is applied to a boundary/layer problem in a
time-dependent domain.

can lead to new light mater hybrid states where light propagation is strongly
influenced by molecular photon absorption. Their application range from lasing
LEDs to controlling chemical reactions and are relevant in light harvesting.
The coupling between the electromagnetic field and molecular excitations may
also lead to macroscopic extended coherent states characterized by an increase
in temporal and spatial coherency. In this respect, it is intriguing to explore
the coherency of the hybrid system for molecules that possess highly efficient
exciton energy transfer. Such a molecule, is the photosynthetic light
harvesting complex photosystem I which has an extended antenna system dedicated
for efficient light harvesting. In this work, we demonstrate space quantization
of light transmission through a single slit in free standing Au film coated
with several layers of PS I. A self assembly technique for multilayer
fabrication is used, enabling fabrication of multilayers which leaves most of
the hole vacant with only the surface and slit walls coated with molecules.
When a broad band, non coherent white light source excites the cavity, a strong
SQOL is observed which is attributed to molecular photon absorption that
induces coherency in the plasmon cavity modes. The SQOL is accompanied by a 13
fold enhancement in the extraordinary optical transmission through the cavity.
This work demonstrate the emergence of spatial coherency in a cavity strongly
coupled to one of the most efficient energy transfer photosynthetic protein in
nature and provides the path for engineering quantum electrodynamics by the
vast diversity of electronic properties of biological macromolecules.

68. This system has a nebular oxygen abundance of only 3% Z$_{\odot}$, making
it one of the most metal-deficient galaxies known in the local volume.
Surprisingly, DDO 68 is a relatively massive and luminous galaxy for its metal
content, making it a significant outlier in the mass-metallicity and
luminosity-metallicity relationships. The origin of such a low oxygen abundance
in DDO 68 presents a challenge for models of the chemical evolution of
galaxies. One possible solution to this problem is the infall of pristine
neutral gas, potentially initiated during a gravitational interaction. Using
archival HI spectral-line imaging obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array, we have discovered a previously unknown companion of DDO 68. This
low-mass (M$_{\rm HI}$ $=$ 2.8$\times$10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$), recently

maps obtained with the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope provide

beam induced deposition have been developed over the last years. Following work
on highly miniaturized Hall sensors for magnetic sensing with soft magnetic Co,
strain and force sensing based on nano-granular platinum-carbon structures
(Pt(C)) was introduced. Very recently the capability of nano-granular Pt(C)
structures to detect the presence of adsorbate water layers by conductance
modulations was demonstrated. For magnetic and strain sensing the underlying
physical mechanisms of the sensing effect have been analyzed in detail and are
now quite well understood. This is not the case for the adsorbate layer induced
conductance modulation effect. Here we provide a theoretical framework that
allows for a semi-quantitative understanding of the observed water-sensing
effect. We show how the near-interface renormalization of the Coulomb charging
energy in the nano-granular metal caused by the dielectric screening of the
polarizable adsorbate layer leads to a conductance modulation. The model can
account for the conductance modulation observed in the water adsorbate
experiments and can also be applied to understand similar effects caused by
near-interface dielectric anomalies of ferroelectric thin films on top of
nano-granular Pt(C). Our findings provide a pathway towards optimized
nano-granular layer structures suitable for a wide range of dielectric or local
potential sensing applications.

poses, illuminations, occlusions, and low resolutions, which cause great
challenges to face-related applications. This paper addresses this challenge by
proposing a new deep learning framework that can recover the canonical view of
face images. It dramatically reduces the intra-person variances, while
maintaining the inter-person discriminativeness. Unlike the existing face
reconstruction methods that were either evaluated in controlled 2D environment
or employed 3D information, our approach directly learns the transformation
from the face images with a complex set of variations to their canonical views.
At the training stage, to avoid the costly process of labeling canonical-view
images from the training set by hand, we have devised a new measurement to
automatically select or synthesize a canonical-view image for each identity. As
an application, this face recovery approach is used for face verification.
Facial features are learned from the recovered canonical-view face images by
using a facial component-based convolutional neural network. Our approach
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the LFW dataset.

quadrature approach for handling near-singular integrals. Such integrals
typically arise when drop boundaries come close to one another, and are
difficult to compute accurately using standard quadrature rules. Adapting the
interpolatory quadrature method introduced by Helsing and Ojala in 2008 to the
current application, very general drop configurations can be handled while
still maintaining stability and high accuracy. The performance of the new
method is demonstrated by some challenging numerical examples.

studied the distributions of these parameters and relations between them. Our
main results are as follows. (i) After excluding beaming effect and redshift
effect, intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity with broad line luminosity, black
hole mass and Eddington ratio have significant correlations. Our results
confirm the physical distinction between BL Lacs and FSRQs. (ii) The
correlation between broad line luminosity and jet power is significant which
supports that jet power has a close link with accretion. Jet power depends on
both the Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We also obtain $LogL_{\rm
BLR}\sim(0.98\pm0.07)Log P_{\rm jet}$ for all blazars, which is consistent with
the theoretical predicted coefficient. These results support that jets are
powered by energy extraction from both accretion and black hole spin (i.e., not
by accretion only). (iii) For almost all BL Lacs, $P_{\rm jet}>L_{\rm disk}$;
for most of FSRQs, $P_{\rm jet}<L_{\rm disk}$. The ""jet-dominance""
(parameterized as $\frac{P_{\rm jet}}{L_{\rm disk}}$) is mainly controlled by

The strong variability of the source is best explained in terms of intrinsic
X-ray flux variations and in the context of the light bending model: the
primary, variable emission is reprocessed by the accretion disk, which produces
secondary, less variable, reflected emission. The broad Fe K$\alpha$ profile
is, as usual for this source, well explained by relativistic effects occurring
in the innermost regions of the accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black
hole. We also discuss the alternative model in which the broadening of the Fe
K$\alpha$ is due to the complex nature of the circumnuclear absorbing
structure. Even if this model cannot be ruled out, it is disfavored on
statistical grounds. We also detected an occultation event likely caused by BLR
clouds crossing the line of sight.

analyze the instability of a dipole-parity toroidal background field, in the
presence of density stratification, differential rotation, and realistically
small Prandtl numbers. The physical parameters are the normalized latitudinal
shear $a$ and the normalized field amplitude $b$. Only the solutions for the
wavelengths with the maximal growth rates are considered. If these scales are
combined to the radial values of velocity, one finds that the (very small)
radial velocity only depends slightly on $a$ and $b$, so that it can be used as
the free parameter of the eigenvalue system.
  The resulting instability-generated tensors of magnetic diffusivity and eddy
viscosity are highly anisotropic. The eddy diffusivity in latitudinal direction
exceeds the eddy diffusivity in radial direction by orders of magnitude. Its
latitudinal profile shows a strong concentration toward the poles which is also
true for the effective viscosity which has been calculated via the angular
momentum transport of the instability pattern. The resulting effective magnetic
Prandtl number reaches values of $O(10^2)$, so that the differential rotation
decays much faster than the toroidal background field, which is {the} necessary
condition to explain the observed slow rotation of the early red-giant and

non-Gaussian displacement distribution (DisD), with roughly exponential tails
at short times, a situation they termed ""anomalous yet Brownian"" diffusion. The
diversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We
present such a model where there is ""diffusivity memory"" but no ""direction
memory"" in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear
MSD and a non-Gaussian DisD at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is
undergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression ""diffusing
diffusivity"". The DisD is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if
the distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential
remains a good fit to the DisD for a variety of diffusivity distributions.
Moreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.

(HI) instrument, imaging the solar wind density from the Sun to 1 AU, for

observatories (STEREO PLASTIC/IMPACT, Wind SWE/MFI). The list consists of
front- and backsided, slow and fast CMEs (up to $2700 \: km \: s^{-1}$). We
track the CMEs to $34.9 \pm 7.1$ degrees elongation from the Sun with J-maps
constructed using the SATPLOT tool, resulting in prediction lead times of
$-26.4 \pm 15.3$ hours. The geometrical models we use assume different CME
front shapes (Fixed-$\Phi$, Harmonic Mean, Self-Similar Expansion), and
constant CME speed and direction. We find no significant superiority in the
predictive capability of any of the three methods. The absolute difference
between predicted and observed ICME arrival times is $8.1 \pm 6.3$ hours ($rms$
value of 10.9h). Speeds are consistent to within $284 \pm 288 \: km \: s^{-1}$.
Empirical corrections to the predictions enhance their performance for the
arrival times to $6.1 \pm 5.0$ hours ($rms$ value of 7.9h), and for the speeds
to $53 \pm 50 \: km \: s^{-1}$. These results are important for Solar Orbiter

events within 0.1 degrees of RBS 0970, with a subsequent unbinned likelihood
analysis finding RBS 0970 to be a source of VHE photons at the 6.5 sigma level
of confidence. The E>1 GeV flux, binned in monthly periods, did not indicate
any flux brightening of RBS 0970 accompanying the emission of the VHE photons.
However, a likelihood analysis of the 0.1-100 GeV flux, binned in 28 day
periods centered on detection of the VHE photons, revealed that the emission of
the lowest energy VHE photons coincided with a hardening of the gamma-ray
spectrum. Interestingly, the same analysis did not find any significant
gamma-ray emission from RBS 0970 during the emission of the highest energy VHE
event. The discovery of RBS 0970 as a VHE emitter, combined with the spectral

cardinality matching developed here first selects the maximum number of units

reduce sensitivity to unmeasured biases, so one might hope that cardinality
matching would succeed at both tasks, balancing $\mathbf{x}$, stabilizing $Y$.

characterisation of a spatially unresolved background signal. This background
includes sky and instrumental components, each of which are characterised by
its proper spatial and spectral behaviour. While the X-ray sky background has
been extensively studied in previous work, here we analyse and model the
instrumental background of the ACIS-I detector on-board the Chandra X-ray
observatory in very faint mode.
  Methods: Caused by interaction of highly energetic particles with the
detector, the ACIS-I instrumental background is spectrally characterised by the
superposition of several fluorescence emission lines onto a continuum. To
isolate its flux from any sky component, we fitted an analytical model of the
continuum to observations performed in very faint mode with the detector in the
stowed position shielded from the sky, and gathered over the eight year period
starting in 2001. The remaining emission lines were fitted to blank-sky
observations of the same period. We found 11 emission lines. Analysing the
spatial variation of the amplitude, energy and width of these lines has further
allowed us to infer that three lines of these are presumably due to an energy
correction artefact produced in the frame store.
  Results: We provide an analytical model that predicts the instrumental
background with a precision of 2% in the continuum and 5% in the lines. We use
this model to measure the flux of the unresolved cosmic X-ray background in the
Chandra deep field south. We obtain a flux of $10.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times

included non-perturbatively. Based on Nf=2 gauge field ensembles, covering
three lattice spacings a (0.08-0.05)fm and pion masses down to 190MeV, a
variational method for extracting hadronic matrix elements is used to keep
systematic errors under control. In addition we perform a careful
autocorrelation analysis in the extrapolation to the continuum and to the
physical pion mass limits. Our final results read fB=186(13)MeV, fBs=224(14)MeV

not reveal a dependence on the number of dynamical quarks, and effects from

methods to cases with multiple nonsmooth terms, in which standard conditional

techniques from smoothing proximal methods and requires first-order

HCGS benefits from the advantages of conditional gradient methods, which render
it more efficient on certain large scale optimization problems. We demonstrate
these advantages with simulations on two matrix optimization problems:
regularization of matrices with combined $\ell_1$ and trace norm penalties; and
a convex relaxation of sparse PCA.

${\mathbb K}=\mathbb C$ if general complex matrices are considered and
${\mathbb K} ={\mathbb R}$ if only real matrices are allowed) of the matrix $A$
from the set of defective matrices, that is the set of those matrices with at
least a multiple eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity larger than its
geometric multiplicity. For $0 < \varepsilon \le w_{\mathbb K}(A)$, this
problem is closely related to the computation of the most ill-conditioned
$\varepsilon$-pseudoeigenvalues of $A$, that is points in the
$\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of $A$ characterized by the highest condition
number. The method we propose couples a system of differential equations on a
low rank (possibly structured) manifold which computes the
$\varepsilon$-pseudoeigenvalue of $A$ which is closest to coalesce, with a fast
Newton-like iteration aiming to determine the minimal value $\varepsilon$ such
that such an $\varepsilon$-pseudoeigenvalue becomes defective. The method has a
local behaviour; this means that in general we find upper bounds for
$w_{\mathbb K}(A)$. However, they usually provide good approximations, in those
(simple) cases where we can check this. The methodology can be extended to a
structured matrix where it is required that the distance is computed within
some manifold defining the structure of the matrix. In this paper we
extensively examine the case of real matrices but we also consider pattern
structures. As far as we know there do not exist methods in the literature able
to compute such distance.

(MFs) have lacked a credible mechanism of interaction between MFs and living
material. Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells.
Methods: Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of
0.025-5 microTesla, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6
days. Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a
mostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising
return to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF
increases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions
(KCs). Our data suggest that the KCs are caused by MF interference with
mitochondria's adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPS), compensated by the
action of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The effects
of MFs are similar to those of the ATPS inhibitor, oligomycin. They are
amplified by metformin, an AMPK stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK
inhibitor. Over environmental MFs, KCs of various cancer cell lines show
exceptionally wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythroleukemia
cells, which display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microTesla.
Conclusions: The biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in
the structure of water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These
results may be environment ally important, in view of the central roles played
in human physiology by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes,
cancer and longevity.

comparison and better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple
variations to the PCANet, namely the RandNet and LDANet. They share the same

learned from LDA. We have tested these basic networks extensively on many

verification, MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets for face
recognition, as well as MNIST for hand-written digits recognition.

periodic cell problem, are calculated in a scalar elliptic setting. Our
approach builds on the recent variational reformulation of the Moulinec-Suquet
(1994) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization scheme by Vond\v{r}ejc et
al. (2014), which is based on the conforming Galerkin approximation with
trigonometric polynomials. Upper-lower bounds are obtained by adjusting the
primal-dual finite element framework developed independently by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k
(1993) and Wieckowski (1995) to the FFT-based Galerkin setting. We show that
the discretization procedure differs for odd and non-odd number of grid points.
Thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition inherited from the continuous
formulation, the duality structure is fully preserved for the odd
discretizations. In the latter case, a more complex primal-dual structure is
observed due to presence of the trigonometric polynomials associated with the
Nyquist frequencies. These theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical
examples. To conclude, the main advantage of the FFT-based approach over
conventional finite-element schemes is that the primal and the dual problems
are treated on the same basis, and this property can be extended beyond the
scalar elliptic setting.

unfolding the Berry curvature from the small Brillouin zone of a large

searches, objects with detailed observations are decreasing as a fraction of
the overall known SN population, and this strategy sacrifices the majority of
the information contained in the data about the underlying population of
transients. A population level modeling approach, simultaneously fitting all
available observations of objects in a transient sub-class of interest, fully
mines the data to infer the properties of the population and avoids certain
systematic biases. We present a novel hierarchical Bayesian statistical model
for population level modeling of transient light curves, and discuss its
implementation using an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique. As a test
case, we apply this model to the Type IIP SN sample from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium
Deep Survey, consisting of 18,837 photometric observations of 76 SNe,
corresponding to a joint posterior distribution with 9,176 parameters under our
model. Our hierarchical model fits provide improved constraints on light curve
parameters relevant to the physical properties of their progenitor stars
relative to modeling individual light curves alone. Moreover, we directly
evaluate the probability for occurrence rates of unseen light curve
characteristics from the model hyperparameters, addressing observational biases
in survey methodology. We view this modeling framework as an unsupervised
machine learning technique with the ability to maximize scientific returns from
data to be collected by future wide field transient searches like LSST.

high-redshift star formation history and important sources of UV photons that
ionized the intergalactic medium in the early universe. In order to better
constrain the extinction and intrinsic star formation rate (SFR) of
high-redshift LBGs, we combine the latest ultradeep Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array 1.5 GHz radio image and the Hubble Space Telescope Advance Camera for
Surveys (ACS) optical images in the Great Observatories Origins Deep
Survey-North. We select a large sample of 1771 z~4 LBGs from the ACS catalogue
using $\bband$-dropout color criteria. Our LBG samples have $\iband$~25-28
(AB), ~0-3 magnitudes fainter than M*_UV at z~4. In our stacked radio images,
we find the LBGs to be point-like under our 2"" angular resolution. We measure
their mean 1.5 GHz flux by stacking the measurements on the individual objects.
We achieve a statistical detection of $S_{1.5GHz}$=0.210+-0.075 uJy at ~3
sigma, first time on such a faint LBG population at z~4. The measurement takes
into account the effects of source size and blending of multiple objects. The
detection is visually confirmed by stacking the radio images of the LBGs, and
the uncertainty is quantified with Monte Carlo simulations on the radio image.
The stacked radio flux corresponds to an intrinsic SFR of 16.0+-5.7 M/yr, which
is 2.8X the SFR derived from the rest-frame UV continuum luminosity. This
factor of 2.8 is in excellent agreement with the extinction correction derived
from the observed UV continuum spectral slope, using the local calibration of
meurer99. This result supports the use of the local calibration on
high-redshift LBGs for deriving the extinction correction and SFR, and also
disfavors a steep reddening curve such as that of the Small Magellanic Cloud.

spectrum at GeV-TeV energies. Although the origin of the anomaly is not clearly
understood, suggested explanations include effect of cosmic-ray source
spectrum, propagation effects, and the effect of nearby sources. In this paper,
we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of re-acceleration of
cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration by strong
supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive propagation
through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again encounter
expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As the
probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger
than the younger ones due to their bigger sizes, re-acceleration is expected to
be mainly due to weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer particle
spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum steeper
than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks. For a
reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated
component can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated
component dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV
spectral anomaly.

implementation in different experimental setups using present technology: NMR,
ion traps and ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

noted for their increasing participation in science and technology. The
governments of these countries have been boosting their investments in research
and development to become part of the group of nations doing research at a
world-class level. This study investigates the development of the BRICS
countries in the domain of top-cited papers (top 10% and 1% most frequently
cited papers) between 1990 and 2010. To assess the extent to which these
countries have become important players on the top level, we compare the BRICS
countries with the top-performing countries worldwide. As the analyses of the
(annual) growth rates show, with the exception of Russia, the BRICS countries
have increased their output in terms of most frequently-cited papers at a
higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide. In a further step of
analysis for this study, we generate co-authorship networks among authors of
highly cited papers for four time points to view changes in BRICS participation
(1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010). Here, the results show that all BRICS countries
succeeded in becoming part of this network, whereby the Chinese collaboration
activities focus on the USA.

new challenge is to develop Virtual Reality Exposure Training for social
skills. Virtual actors in such systems have to show appropriate social behavior
including emotions, gaze, and keeping distance. The behavior must be realistic
and real-time. Current approaches consist of four steps: 1) trainee social
signal detection, 2) cognitive-affective interpretation, 3) determination of
the appropriate bodily responses, and 4) actuation. The ""cognitive"" detour of
such approaches does not match the directness of human bodily reflexes and
causes unrealistic responses and delay. Instead, we propose virtual reflexes as
concurrent sensory-motor processes to control virtual actors. Here we present a
virtual reflexes architecture, explain how emotion and cognitive modulation are
embedded, detail its workings, and give an example description of an aggression
training application.

modified solvent casting/particulate leaching method with different
crystallinity. Since in typical method the porogens are solved in the solution
and flow with the polymers during the casting and the crystallinity behavior of
PLA chains in the limited space cannot be tracked, in this work the processing
is modified by diffusing the PLA solution into a steady salt stack. With a
thermal treatment before leaching while maintaining the stable structure of the
porogens stack, the crystallinity of porous foams is made possible to control.
The characterizations indicate the crystallization of porous foams is in a
manner of lower crystallibility than the bulk materials. Pores and caves of
around 250{\mu}m size are obtained in samples with different crystallinity. The
macro-structures are not much impaired by the crystallization nevertheless the
morphological effect of the heating process is still obvious.

problem of minimizing the completion time of instantly decodable network coding
(IDNC) for cooperative data exchange (CDE) in decentralized wireless network.
In this configuration, clients cooperate with each other to recover the erased
packets without a central controller. Game theory is employed herein as a tool
for improving the distributed solution by overcoming the need for a central
controller or additional signaling in the system. We model the session by
self-interested players in a non-cooperative potential game. The utility
function is designed such that increasing individual payoff results in a
collective behavior achieving both a desirable system performance in a shared
network environment and the Pareto optimal solution. Through extensive
simulations, our approach is compared to the best performance that could be
found in the conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) recovery process. Numerical
results show that our formulation largely outperforms the conventional PMP
scheme in most practical situations and achieves a lower delay.

Naghdi shell, and present an analysis for its accuracy. The error estimate
shows that when components of the curvature tensor and Christoffel symbols are
piecewise linear functions, the finite element method has the optimal order of
accuracy, which is uniform with respect to the shell thickness. Generally, the
error estimate shows how the accuracy is affected by the shell geometry and
thickness. It suggests that to achieve optimal rate of convergence, the
triangulation should be properly refined in regions where the shell geometry
changes dramatically. These are the results for a balanced method in which the
primary displacement components and rotation components are approximated by
discontinuous piecewise quadratic polynomials, while components of the scaled
membrane stress tensor and shear stress vector are approximated by continuous
piecewise linear functions. On elements that have edges on the free boundary of
the shell, finite element space for displacement components needs to be
enriched slightly, for stability purpose. Results on higher order finite
elements are also included.

experimentally well-established, but theoretically poorly understood
phenomenon. This paper presents several related investigations into the
physical process of both spontaneous biophoton emission and delayed
luminescence. Since light intensities depend upon the modulus squared of their
corresponding electric fields we first make some general estimates about the
inherent electric fields within various biological systems. Since photon
emission from living matter following an initial excitation (""delayed
luminescence"") typically does not follow a simple exponential decay law after
excitation we discuss such non-exponential decays from a general theoretical
perspective and argue that they are often to be expected and why. We then
discuss the dynamics behind some nonlinear rate equations, connecting them both
to biological growth rates and biophoton emission rates, noting a possible
connection with cancer. We then return to non-exponential decay laws seen for
delayed luminescence in an experimental context and again note a possible
connection with cancer.
