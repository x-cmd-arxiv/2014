two-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories with center-invariant matter into
disjoint sums of theories with rotating discrete theta angles; for example,
schematically, SU(2) = SO(3)_+ + SO(3)_-. We verify that decomposition directly
in pure nonsupersymmetric two-dimensional Yang-Mills as well as in
supersymmetric theories. In four dimensions, by contrast, these notions do not
coincide. To clarify the relationship, we discuss theories obtained by
restricting nonperturbative sectors. These theories violate cluster
decomposition, but we illustrate how they may at least in special cases be
understood as disjoint sums of well-behaved quantum field theories, and how
dyon spectra can be used to distinguish, for example, an SO(3) theory with a
restriction on instantons from an SU(2) theory. We also briefly discuss how

poses many difficult challenges. Assessing which genetic markers are involved
in determining trait status is a computationally demanding task, especially in
the presence of gene-gene interactions. A non-parametric Bayesian approach in
the form of a Bayesian neural network is proposed for use in analyzing genetic
association studies. Demonstrations on synthetic and real data reveal they are
able to efficiently and accurately determine which variants are involved in
determining case-control status. Using graphics processing units (GPUs) the
time needed to build these models is decreased by several orders of magnitude.
In comparison with commonly used approaches for detecting genetic interactions,
Bayesian neural networks perform very well across a broad spectrum of possible
genetic relationships while having the computational efficiency needed to
handle large datasets.

this problem, items that are presented one by one are to be packed into bins of
size 1. Each item i has a size s_i \in [0,1] and a color c_i \in C, where C is
a set of colors (that is not necessarily known in advance). The total size of
items packed into a bin cannot exceed its size, thus an item i can always be
packed into a new bin, but an item cannot be packed into a non-empty bin if the
previous item packed into that bin has the same color, or if the occupied space
in it is larger than 1-s_i. This problem generalizes standard online bin
packing and online black and white bin packing (where |C|=2). We prove that
colorful bin packing is harder than black and white bin packing in the sense
that an online algorithm for zero size items that packs the input into the
smallest possible number of bins cannot exist for C \geq 3, while it is known
that such an algorithm exists for |C|=2. We show that natural generalizations
of classic algorithms for bin packing fail to work for the case |C| \geq 3 and
moreover, algorithms that perform well for black and white bin packing do not
perform well either, already for the case |C|=3. Our main results are a new
algorithm for colorful bin packing that we design and analyze, whose absolute
competitive ratio is 4, and a new lower bound of 2 on the asymptotic
competitive ratio of any algorithm, that is valid even for black and white bin
packing.

This paper describes the prototype of the Smart Diabetic Socks that has been
developed in the context of the French ANR TecSan project. The objective is to
prevent pressure foot ulcers for diabetic persons. 2) Material and methods A
fully wireless, customizable and washable ""smart sock"" has been designed. It is
made of a textile which fibers are knitted in a way they provide measurements
of the pressure exerted under and all around the foot in real-life conditions.
This device is coupled with a subject-specific Finite Element foot model that
simulates the internal strains within the soft tissues of the foot. 3) Results
A number of derived stress indicators can be computed based on that analysis,
such as the accumulated stress dose, high internal strains or peak pressures
near bony prominences during gait. In case of risks for pressure ulcer, an
alert is sent to the person and/or to the clinician. A watch, a smart-phone or

the aerodynamical properties of the dust while evaporating the volatiles. This
causes the dust to settle, abandoning those volatiles. The success of this

  In particular, two cases where transmission occurs over a rate-limited link

proved to be optimal, even though this is not a classical multicast problem.

one-dimensional in the sense that quantification is limited to applications of
blocks of existential (universal) quantifiers such that at most one variable

operations, but additional restrictions (called uniformity conditions) apply to
combinations of atomic formulae with two or more variables. We argue that the
notions of one-dimensionality and uniformity together offer a novel perspective

alleles at other sites, a phenomenon known as epistasis. Epistasis can
profoundly influence the process of evolution in populations under selection,
and can shape the course of protein evolution across divergent species. Whereas
epistasis between adaptive substitutions has been the subject of extensive
study, relatively little is known about epistasis under purifying selection.
Here we use mechanistic models of thermodynamic stability in a ligand-binding
protein to explore the structure of epistatic interactions between
substitutions that fix in protein sequences under purifying selection. We find
that the selection coefficients of mutations that are nearly-neutral when they
fix are highly contingent on the presence of preceding mutations. Conversely,
mutations that are nearly-neutral when they fix are subsequently entrenched due
to epistasis with later substitutions. Our evolutionary model includes
insertions and deletions, as well as point mutations, and so it allows us to
quantify epistasis within each of these classes of mutations, and also to study
the evolution of protein length. We find that protein length remains largely
constant over time, because indels are more deleterious than point mutations.
Our results imply that, even under purifying selection, protein sequence
evolution is highly contingent on history and so it cannot be predicted by the
phenotypic effects of mutations assayed in the wild-type sequence.

sensing throughput tradeoff for cognitive radio (CR) networks under noise
variance uncertainty. It is assumed that there are one white sub-band, and one
target sub-band which is either white or non-white. Under this assumption,
first we propose a novel generalized energy detector (GED) for examining the
target sub-band by exploiting the noise information of the white sub-band,
then, we study the tradeoff between the sensing time and achievable throughput
of the CR network. To study this tradeoff, we consider the sensing time
optimization for maximizing the throughput of the CR network while
appropriately protecting the primary network. The sensing time is optimized by
utilizing the derived detection and false alarm probabilities of the GED. The
proposed GED does not suffer from signal to noise ratio (SNR) wall (i.e.,
robust against noise variance uncertainty) and outperforms the existing signal
detectors. Moreover, the relationship between the proposed GED and conventional
energy detector (CED) is quantified analytically. We show that the optimal
sensing times with perfect and imperfect noise variances are not the same. In
particular, when the frame duration is 2s, and SNR is -20dB, and each of the
bandwidths of the white and target sub-bands is 6MHz, the optimal sensing times
are 28.5ms and 50.6ms with perfect and imperfect noise variances, respectively.

the energy density of the mimetic dust remains positive under time evolution.
For certain type of configurations the theory can become unstable. Both
alternative modified theories of gravity, which are based on a vector field

hidden populations, such as drug injectors and sex workers, using sampled
social network data. The basic scale-up estimator offers advantages over other
size estimation techniques, but it depends on problematic modeling assumptions.
We propose a new generalized scale-up estimator that can be used in settings
with non-random social mixing and imperfect awareness about membership in the
hidden population. Further, the new estimator can be used when data are
collected via complex sample designs and from incomplete sampling frames.
However, the generalized scale-up estimator also requires data from two
samples: one from the frame population and one from the hidden population. In
some situations these data from the hidden population can be collected by
adding a small number of questions to already planned studies. For other
situations, we develop interpretable adjustment factors that can be applied to
the basic scale-up estimator. We conclude with practical recommendations for
the design and analysis of future studies.

ingredients in a complexity classification of some Holant problems. These
Holant problems, denoted by Holant(f), are defined by a symmetric ternary
function f that is invariant under any permutation of the k >= 3 domain
elements. We prove that Holant(f) exhibits a complexity dichotomy. This
dichotomy holds even when restricted to planar graphs. A special case of this
result is that counting edge k-colorings is #P-hard over planar 3-regular
graphs for k >= 3. In fact, we prove that counting edge k-colorings is #P-hard
over planar r-regular graphs for all k >= r >= 3. The problem is
polynomial-time computable in all other parameter settings. The proof of the
dichotomy theorem for Holant(f) depends on the fact that a specific polynomial
p(x,y) has an explicitly listed finite set of integer solutions, and the
determination of the Galois groups of some specific polynomials. In the

the number of in-band Galactic neutron stars $N_\text{tot}$. For the plausible
case of $N_\text{tot}\approx 53000$, and assuming one year of observation time
with colocated initial LIGO detectors, we find it to be
$\sigma_\epsilon=2.1\times10^{-7}$, which is comparable to current bounds on
some nearby neutron stars. (The current best $95\%$ upper limits are
$\epsilon\lesssim7\times10^{-8}.$) It is unclear if Advanced LIGO can
significantly improve on this sensitivity using spatially separated detectors.
For the proposed Einstein Telescope, we estimate that
$\sigma\epsilon=5.6\times10^{-10}$. Finally, we show that stochastic

field and Doppler measurements, can be used to estimate the flux of magnetic
energy (the Poynting flux) into the corona and as time-dependent boundary
conditions for dynamic models of the coronal magnetic field. We have modified
and extended an existing method to estimate photospheric electric fields that
combines a poloidal-toroidal (PTD) decomposition of the evolving magnetic field
vector with Doppler and horizontal plasma velocities. Our current, more
comprehensive method, which we dub the ""{\bf P}TD-{\bf D}oppler-{\bf F}LCT {\bf
I}deal"" (PDFI) technique, can now incorporate Doppler velocities from
non-normal viewing angles. It uses the \texttt{FISHPACK} software package to
solve several two-dimensional Poisson equations, a faster and more robust
approach than our previous implementations. Here, we describe systematic,
quantitative tests of the accuracy and robustness of the PDFI technique using
synthetic data from anelastic MHD (\texttt{ANMHD}) simulations, which have been
used in similar tests in the past. We find that the PDFI method has less than
$1%$ error in the total Poynting flux and a $10%$ error in the helicity flux
rate at a normal viewing angle $(\theta=0$) and less than $25%$ and $10%$
errors respectively at large viewing angles ($\theta<60^\circ$). We compare our
results with other inversion methods at zero viewing angle, and find that our
method's estimates of the fluxes of magnetic energy and helicity are comparable
to or more accurate than other methods. We also discuss the limitations of the
PDFI method and its uncertainties.

anomalies at moderate pressures (viscosity and density (TMD) behavior, etc.),
are not explained by H-bond breaking, according to common bond-breaking
criteria. A comparison of data on the TMD, at both positive and negative
pressures, with the predictions of popular pair potential models, shows
dramatic discrepancies appearing in the stretched liquid domain. This prompts
questions on the second critical point (TC2) hypothesis that has been guiding
much current thinking. We turn to related systems for guidance, reviewing a

low-rank matrices from grossly corrupted observations. While elegant in theory
and powerful in reality, RPCA may be not an ultimate solution to the low-rank
matrix recovery problem. Indeed, its performance may not be perfect even when
data are strictly low-rank. This is because conventional RPCA ignores the
clustering structures of the data which are ubiquitous in modern applications.
As the number of cluster grows, the coherence of data keeps increasing, and
accordingly, the recovery performance of RPCA degrades. We show that the
challenges raised by coherent data (i.e., the data with high coherence) could
be alleviated by Low-Rank Representation (LRR), provided that the dictionary in
LRR is configured appropriately. More precisely, we mathematically prove that
if the dictionary itself is low-rank then LRR is immune to the coherence
parameter which increases with the underlying cluster number. This provides an
elementary principle for dealing with coherent data. Subsequently, we devise a
practical algorithm to obtain proper dictionaries in unsupervised environments.
Our extensive experiments on randomly generated matrices verify our claims.

one of the most outstanding challenges in the physics of correlated quantum

cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Like distinctions based on the
symmetry of a locally defined order-parameter, global, topological invariants
allow for a sharp discrimination between states of matter that cannot be
transformed into each other adiabatically. Here we propose an unconventional
pairing state for the electron fluid in two-dimensional oxide interfaces and
establish a direct link to the emergence of nontrivial topological invariants.
Topological superconductivity and Majorana edge states can then be used to
detect the microscopic origin for superconductivity. In addition, we show that
also the density wave states that compete with superconductivity sensitively
depend on the nature of the pairing interaction. Our conclusion is based on the

generalize such flux limiter to high order finite volume methods solving
convection-dominated problems, which is easy to implement and introduces little
computational overhead. More importantly, for the first time in the finite

Carina, and Fornax in the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We use for
the first time a Poisson solver with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in order to
account simultaneously for the gravitational influence of the Milky Way and its
satellites. This allows to rigorously model the important external field effect
(EFE) of Milgromian dynamics, which can reduce the effective acceleration
significantly. We make predictions on the dynamical mass-to-light ratio
(Mdyn/L) expected to be measured by an observer who assumes Newtonian dynamics
to be valid. We show that Milgromian dynamics predicts typical Mdyn/L ~ 10-50
Msun/Lsun. The results for the most luminous ones, Fornax and Sculptor, agree
well with available velocity dispersion data. Moreover, the central power-law
slopes of the dynamical masses agree exceedingly well with values inferred
observationally from velocity dispersion measurements. The results for Sextans,
Carina and Draco are low compared to usually quoted observational estimates, as
already pointed out by Angus (2008). For Milgromian dynamics to survive further
observational tests in these objects, one would thus need that either (a)
previous observational findings based on velocity dispersion measurements have
overestimated the dynamical mass due to, e.g., binaries and contaminant
outliers, (b) the satellites are not in virial equilibrium due to the Milky Way
tidal field, or (c) the specific theory used here does not describe the EFE
correctly (e.g., the EFE could be practically negligible in some other
theories), or a combination of (a)-(c).

description of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena,
such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin- and charge-density-wave
order. A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin
configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be
destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero. Examples
of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either
pointing inwards or outwards) or vortices. A central question concerns the
nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct
spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at
the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of
magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices. When long-range
magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the
skyrmion lattice - that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent
magnetic flux associated with their topological winding - is unaffected in sign
or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The
regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic
field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced
non-Fermi-liquid resistivity. The observation of this topological Hall signal
in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin
correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of
Fermi liquid theory in pure metals.

to search for an intrinsic linear polarisation component in the system emitted
radiation that might be due, e.g., to synchrotron emission from a compact jet,
or to Thomson scattering with free electrons in an accretion disc. Multiband
(BVRI) optical polarimetric observations were obtained during two nights in
2008 at the ESO La Silla 3.6 m telescope (EFOSC2) in polarimetric mode. These
observations cover about the 30% of the 15.1 hours orbital period. J-band
observations were obtained in 2007 with the NICS (TNG) instrument at La Palma,
for a totality of 1 hour observation. We obtained 3-sigma upper limits to the
polarisation degree in all the optical bands, with the most constraining one
being in the I-band (P<0.5%). No phase-correlated variability has been noticed
in all the filters. The J-band observations provided a 6% upper limit on the
polarisation level. The constraining upper limits to the polarisation in the
optical allowed us to evaluate the contribution of the possible emission of a
relativistic particles jet to the total system radiation to be less then the
10%. This is in agreement with the observation of a spectral energy
distribution typical of a single black body of a K-spectral type main sequence
star irradiated from the compact object. Due to the low S/N ratio it was not
possible to investigate the possible dependency of the polarisation degree from
the wavelength, that could be suggestive of polarisation induced by Thomson
scattering of radiation with free electrons in the outer part of the accretion
disc. Observations with higher S/N ratio are required to examine in depth this
hypothesis, searching for significant phase-correlated variability.

various aperture definitions of where galaxies end. We perform techniques
popular in the literature and present a new technique of our own, where the
aperture radius is based on the baryonic mass profiles of simulated
(sub)haloes. For the average Milky-Way-mass system, we find the two most
popular techniques in the literature return differences of order 30 per cent
for stellar mass, a factor of 3 for gas mass, 40 per cent for star formation
rate, and factors of several for gas accretion and ejection rates. Individual
cases can show variations greater than this, with the severity dependent on the
concentration of a given system. The average difference in integrated
properties for a more general galaxy population are not as striking, but are
still significant for stellar and gas mass, especially for optical-limit
apertures. The large differences that can occur are problematic for comparing
results from various publications. We stress the importance of both defining
and justifying a technique choice and discourage using popular apertures that
use an exact fraction of the virial radius, due to the unignorable variation in
galaxy-to-(sub)halo size. Finally, we note that technique choice does not
greatly affect simulated galaxies from lying within the scatter of observed
scaling relations, but it can alter the derived best-fit slope for the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.

non-Abelian quasiparticles to demonstrate this remarkable property. The
simplest non-Abelian quasiparticles -- the Majorana bound states (MBS) -- can
occur in one-dimensional (1D) electronic nano-structures proximity-coupled to a
bulk superconductor -- a platform that is being currently explored in great
depth both theoretically and experimentally. When tuned appropriately, such
nano-wires can localize MBS at their ends, a pair of which forms a two-level
system that is robust to local perturbations. This constitutes a topologically
protected qubit that can serve as the building block for a topological quantum
computer. To implement braiding operations among the MBS, schemes that allow to
move MBS across wire networks have been explored theoretically. Here, we
propose a simpler alternative setup, based on chains of magnetic adatoms on the
surface of a thin-film superconductor, in which the control over an externally
applied magnetic field suffices to create and manipulate MBS. We consider
specific 1D patterns of adatoms, which can be engineered with
scanning-tunneling-microscope based lateral atomic manipulation techniques, and
show that they allow for the creation, annihilation, adiabatic motion, and

detection of non-thermal radio emission from the bow shock of BD+43$^\deg$ 3654

perform the first systematic search for MeV and GeV emission from 27 bow shocks
of runaway stars using data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). Methods. We analysed 57 months of
Fermi-LAT data at the positions of 27 bow shocks of runaway stars extracted
from the Extensive stellar BOw Shock Survey catalogue (E-BOSS). A likelihood
analysis was performed to search for gamma-ray emission that is not compatible
with diffuse background or emission from neighbouring sources and that could be
associated with the bow shocks. Results. None of the bow shock candidates is
detected significantly in the Fermi-LAT energy range. We therefore present
upper limits on the high-energy emission in the energy range from 100 MeV to
300 GeV for 27 bow shocks of runaway stars in four energy bands. For the three

Sun. A satellite can transfer a fraction of its orbital energy to the disk
stars as it plunges through the Galactic midplane thereby heating and
thickening the disk. Bulk motions arise during the early stages of such an
event when the disk is still in an unrelaxed state. We present simple toy-model
calculations and simulations of disk-satellite interactions, which show that
the response of the disk depends on the relative velocity of the satellite.
When the component of the satellite's velocity perpendicular to the disk is
small compared with that of the stars, the perturbation is predominantly a
bending mode. Conversely, breathing and higher order modes are excited when the
vertical velocity of the satellite is larger than that of the stars. We argue
that the compression and rarefaction motions seen in three different surveys
are in fact breathing mode perturbations of the Galactic disk.

evolves only for a bounded number of rounds and the final set of infected

richer dynamics. Here we propose a new experimentally corroborated paradigm in
which the truth tables of the brain's logic-gates are time dependent, i.e.
dynamic logicgates (DLGs). The truth tables of the DLGs depend on the history
of their activity and the stimulation frequencies of their input neurons. Our
experimental results are based on a procedure where conditioned stimulations
were enforced on circuits of neurons embedded within a large-scale network of
cortical cells in-vitro. We demonstrate that the underlying biological
mechanism is the unavoidable increase of neuronal response latencies to ongoing
stimulations, which imposes a nonuniform gradual stretching of network delays.
The limited experimental results are confirmed and extended by simulations and
theoretical arguments based on identical neurons with a fixed increase of the
neuronal response latency per evoked spike. We anticipate our results to lead
to better understanding of the suitability of this computational paradigm to
account for the brain's functionalities and will require the development of new
systematic mathematical methods beyond the methods developed for traditional

obtain a range of exotic shapes for the clusters, and ii) the explicit choice
of marginal distributions for the clusters allows the modelling of multivariate

performed using standard EM, and, depending on the mode of the data, more
efficient procedures are provided that can fully exploit the copula structure.

be cooled to a temperature of $0.36 K$. Candidates to overcome this difficulty

the effects of external magnetic fields, illustrating how to generate

that the asymmetry in tensor power spectrum is a very sensitive probe of the

spectrum can be small and satisfy the observational bounds, the interactions
from the gauge coupling can induce large directional dependence in tensor
modes. This will leave interesting anisotropic fingerprints in various
correlations involving the B-mode polarization such as the TB cross-correlation
which may be detected in upcoming Planck polarization data. In addition, the TT
correlation receives an anisotropic contribution from the tensor sector which
naturally decays after $l \gtrsim 100$. We expect that the mechanism of using

medium (CSM) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shock
breakout event. Candidates for such SNe include Type IIn and superluminous SNe.
If some of these SNe are powered by interaction, then there should be a
relation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, and
shock-breakout velocity. Given that the shock velocity during shock breakout is
not measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between the
rise time and the peak luminosity of these SNe. Here, we present a sample of 15
SNe IIn for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peak
luminosity from observations obtained using the Palomar Transient Factory. We
report on a possible correlation between the R-band rise time and peak
luminosity of these SNe, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. Assuming that
these SNe are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theory
allows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. The lower
limits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected for
SNe (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). This supports the suggestion that the early-time light
curves of SNe IIn are caused by shock breakout in a dense CSM. We note that
such a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. Performing such a
test on other classes of SNe (e.g., superluminous SNe) can be used to rule out
the interaction model for a class of events.

coupling to ferromagnetically aligned Nd$^{3+}$ moments, indicating an
additional indirect RKKY-like transferred hyperfine mechanism. For 0.45 $\le x
\le$ 0.75, $\mu^+$ spin relaxation rates in zero and weak longitudinal applied
fields indicate that static fields at $\mu^+$ sites below $T_C$ are reduced and
strongly disordered. We argue this is unlikely to be due to reduction of
Nd$^{3+}$ moments, and speculate that the Nd$^{3+}$-$\mu^+$ interaction is
suppressed and disordered by Pr doping. In an $x$ = 0.25 sample, which is
superconducting below $T_c$ = 1.3 K, there is no sign of ""spin freezing""
(static Nd$^{3+}$ magnetism), ordered or disordered, down to 25 mK. Dynamic
$\mu^+$ spin relaxation is strong, indicating significant Nd-moment
fluctuations. The $\mu^+$ diamagnetic frequency shift and spin relaxation in
the superconducting vortex-lattice phase decrease slowly below $T_c$,
suggesting pair breaking and/or possible modification of Fermi-liquid
renormalization by Nd spin fluctuations. For 0.25 $\le x \le$ 0.75, the $\mu$SR
data provide evidence against phase separation; superconductivity and Nd$^{3+}$
magnetism coexist on the atomic scale.

of ultrastable glasses that are obtained by depositing the vapor of a
glass-forming liquid onto the surface of a cold substrate has sparked renewed
interest in the effects of confinements on physicochemical properties of
liquids and glasses. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the
effect of substrate on thin films of a model glass-forming liquid, the
Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system, and compute profiles of several
thermodynamic and kinetic properties across the film. We observe that the
substrate can induce large oscillations in profiles of thermodynamic properties
such as density, composition and stress, and we establish a correlation between
the oscillations in total density and the oscillations in normal stress. We
also demonstrate that the kinetic properties of an atomic film can be readily
tuned by changing the strength of interactions between the substrate and the
liquid. Most notably, we show that a weakly attractive substrate can induce the
emergence of a highly mobile region in its vicinity. In this highly mobile
region, structural relaxation is several times faster than in the bulk, and the
exploration of the potential energy landscape is also more efficient. In the
subsurface region near a strongly attractive substrate, however, the dynamics
is decelerated and the sampling of the potential energy landscape becomes less
efficient than the bulk. We explain these two distinct behaviors by
establishing a correlation between the oscillations in kinetic properties and
the oscillations in lateral stress. Our findings offer interesting
opportunities for designing better substrates for the vapor deposition process
or developing alternative procedures for situations where vapor deposition is
not feasible.

melanoma in a way that is still unclear from the biochemical and genetic point
of view. Diagnostic and prognostic tools are then mostly based on dermoscopic
examination and morphological analysis of histological tissues. To investigate
the role of mechanics and geometry in the morpholgical dynamics of melanocytic
nevi, we study a computation model for cell proliferation in a layered
non-linear elastic tissue. Numerical simulations suggest that the morphology of
the nevus is correlated to the initial location of the proliferating cell
starting the growth process and to the mechanical properties of the tissue. Our
results also support that melanocytes are subject to compressive stresses that
fluctuate widely in the nevus and depend on the growth stage. Numerical
simulations of cells in the epidermis releasing matrix metalloproteinases
display an accelerated invasion of the dermis by destroying the basal membrane.
Moreover, we suggest experimentally that osmotic stress and collagen inhibit
growth in primary melanoma cells while the effect is much weaker in metastatic
cells. Knowing that morphological features of nevi might also reflect geometry
and mechanics rather than malignancy could be relevant for diagnostic purposes

  Fields",,,,"math.PR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by applications, the last few years have witnessed tremendous
interest in understanding the structure as well as the behavior of dynamics for
inhomogeneous random graph models. In this study we analyze the maximal
components at criticality of one famous class of such models, the rank-one
inhomogeneous random graph model. Viewing these components as measured random
metric spaces, under finite moment assumptions for the weight distribution, we
show that the components in the critical scaling window with distances scaled
by $n^{-1/3}$ converge in the Gromov-Haussdorf-Prokhorov metric to rescaled
versions of the limit objects identified for the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph
components at criticality Addario-Berry, Broutin and Goldschmidt (2012). A key
step is the construction of connected components of the random graph through an
appropriate tilt of a famous class of random trees called $\mathbf{p}$-trees
(studied previously by Aldous, Miermont and Pitman (2004) and by Camarri and
Pitman (2000)). This is the first step in rigorously understanding the scaling
limits of objects such as the Minimal spanning tree and other strong disorder
models from statistical physics (see Braunstein et al., 2003) for such graph
models. By asymptotic equivalence (Janson, 2010), the same results are true for
the Chung-Lu model and the Britton-Deijfen-Lof model. A crucial ingredient of
the proof of independent interest is tail bounds for the height of
$\mathbf{p}$-trees. The techniques developed in this paper form the main
technical bedrock for proving continuum scaling limits in the critical regime
for a wide array of other random graph models (Bhamidi, Broutin, Sen and Wang,
2014) including the configuration model and inhomogeneous random graphs with
general kernels which were introduced by Bollobas, Janson and Riordan (2007).

In contrast to conventional cooperative networks, the source and relay in the

energy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the AP for their cooperative
information transmission. Based on this three-node reference model, we propose
a harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocol, in which the source and relay harvest
energy from the AP in the downlink and work cooperatively in the uplink for the
source's information transmission. Considering a delay-limited transmission
mode, the approximate closed-form expression for the average throughput of the
proposed protocol is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Subsequently, this
analysis is extended to the multi-relay scenario, where the approximate
throughput of the HTC protocol with two popular relay selection schemes is
derived. The asymptotic analyses for the throughput performance of the
considered schemes at high signal-to-noise radio are also provided. All
theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The impacts of the
system parameters, such as time allocation, relay number, and relay position,

emission line at 0.92 keV with a large equivalent width of
$0.32^{+0.21}_{-0.11}$ keV and the absence of Ne X line at 1.02 keV. In this
paper, we calculate the radiative transfer using a Monte Carlo code, taking
into account the line blanketing effect due to transitions of N, O, Ne, Mg and
Al ions in an accelerating wind emanating from a white dwarf with a structure
based on a spherically symmetric stationary model. We found that the strong Ne
IX line can be reproduced if the mass fraction of Ne is enhanced to $10^{-3}$
or more and that of O is reduced to $\sim5\times10^{-9}$ or less and that the
absence of other lines including Ne X ions at higher energies can be also
reproduced by the line blanketing effect. This enhancement of the Ne mass
fraction indicates that the ejecta are enriched by Ne dredged up from the
surface of the white dwarf composed of O, Ne, and Mg rather than C and O, as
already pointed out in the previous work. We argue that the CNO cycle driving
this nova explosion converted most of C and O into N and thus reduced the O
mass fraction.

carried out, and the current and mass flows are directly obtained. The two
methods exhibit good agreement even for large external field strengths, and
Onsager's reciprocal relation ($M^{jm} = M^{mj}$) is numerically confirmed in
both approaches. The influence of the surface charge density on the flow is
also considered. The values of the transport coefficients are found to be
smaller for larger surface charge density, because the counter-ions strongly
bound near the channel surface interfere with the charge and mass flows. A
reversal of the streaming current and of the reciprocal electro-osmotic flow,
with a change of sign of $M^{mj}$ due to the excess co-ions, takes places for
very high surface charge density.

downward diamagnetic pumping included and field advection by the equatorward

membrane stability by connecting lipid molecules and acting as a water bridge.
Although the number of water molecules near the membrane fluctuates
dynamically, the hydration dynamics has been veiled. Here we investigate
residence statistics of water molecules on the surface of a lipid membrane
using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We show that hydration dynamics
on the lipid membrane exhibit $1/f^\beta$ noise with two different power-law
exponents, $\beta_l < 1$ and $\beta_h > 1$. By constructing a dichotomous
process for the hydration dynamics, we find that the process can be regarded as
a non-Markov renewal process. The result implies that the origin of the $1/f$
noise transition in hydration dynamics on the membrane surface is a combination
of a power-law distribution with cutoff of interoccurrence times of switching
events and a long-term correlation between the interoccurrence times.

supplemented with on-site Coulomb interaction. The effect of carrier doping,
chemical modification at the edge, and finite temperature on the edge magnetism
has been studied. The magnetic phase diagram with varied carrier doping, and
on-site Coulomb interaction is found to be complex. In addition to the
intrinsic antiferromag- netic solution, as predicted for charge neutral
hexagonal nanoflake, fully polarized ferromagnetic, and mixed phase solutions
are obtained depending on the doped carrier concentration, and on-site Coulomb
interaction. The complexity arises due to the competing nature of local Coulomb
in- teraction and carrier doping, favoring antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
coupling, respectively. Chemical modification of the edge atoms by hydrogen
leads to partial quenching of local moments, giving rise to a richer phase
diagram consisting of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, mixed, and nonmagnetic

magnetic ordering at the edge using ab initio molecular dynamics. In agreement
with the recent experimental observations, we find that temperature can also
alter the magnetic state of neutral nanoflake, which is otherwise
antiferromagnetic at zero temperature. These findings will have important

theory, one can bypass the large Nash equilibrium, by introducing the concept
of representative agent, whose action is influenced by a distribution of
similar agents, and obtains directly the system of HJB-FP equations of
interest, see for instance [1]. Apparently, there is no such approach for the
Master equation. We show here that it is possible. We first do it for the Mean

cannot satisfactory explain the data above the resonance region, in particular
the transverse cross section. Although no high-energy L-T-separated
cross-section data is available to date, a similar scenario can be inferred for
$K^+\Lambda$ electroproduction.
  Purpose: Develop a phenomenological model for the $p(\gamma^*,K^+)\Lambda$
reaction at forward angles and high-energies. Propose a universal framework for
interpreting charged-kaon and charged-pion electroproduction above the
resonance region.
  Method: Guided by the recent model for charged-pion electroproduction,
developed by the authors, a framework for $K^+\Lambda$ electroproduction at
high energies and forward angles is constructed. To this end, a Reggeized
background model for $K^+\Lambda$ photoproduction is first developed. This
model is used as a starting base to set up an electroproduction framework.
  Results: The few available data of the unseparated $p(\gamma^*,K^+)\Lambda$
cross section are well explained by the model. Predictions for the
L-T-separation experiment planned with the 12 GeV upgrade at Jefferson Lab are
given. The newly-proposed framework predicts an increased magnitude for the
transverse structure function, similar to the situation in charged-pion
electroproduction.
  Conclusions: Within a hadronic framework featuring Reggeized background
amplitudes, $s$-channel resonance-parton effects can explain the observed
magnitude of the unseparated $p(\gamma^*,K^+)\Lambda$ cross section at high
energies and forward angles. Thereby, no hardening of the kaon electromagnetic
form factor is required.

flexible backbones under poor solvent conditions is studied via
molecular-dynamics simulations, using a coarse-grained bead-spring model and
side chains of up to $N=40$ effective monomers. We consider a symmetric model
where side chains of type A and B are grafted alternately onto a flexible
backbone. The aim of this study to explore the phase behaviour of two-component
bottle-brushes depending on parameters, such as as the grafting density
$\sigma$, the backbone length $N_b$, the side-chain length $N$, and the
temperature $T$. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify for our range of
parameters the regimes of fully phase separated systems, i.e., A-type side
chains form one cluster and B-type chains another, while the interface that
separates these two clusters contains the backbone monomers. We find that
pearl-necklace or Janus-like structures, which normally occur for bottle-brush
polymers with rigid backbones under poor solvent conditions, are fully
attributed to the backbone rigidity, and, therefore, such structures are
unlikely in the case of bottle brushes with fully flexible backbones. Also, a
comparative discussion with earlier work on the phase behaviour of
single-component bottle-brush polymers with flexible backbones is performed.

convenient reaction theory for solving many-coupled channel systems. The theory
provides solutions to bound states, scattering states, and resonances for
microscopic models in one formalism.
  Purpose: The first purpose is to extend this formalism to the relativistic
case so that the many-coupled channels problem may be solved for systems in
which binary breakup channels satisfy a relative Dirac equation. The second
purpose is to employ this formalism in a relativistic continuum shell model.
  Methods: Expressions for the collision matrix and the scattering amplitude,
from which observables may be calculated, are derived. The formalism is applied
to the 1p-1h relativistic continuum shell model with an interaction extracted
from relativistic mean-field theory.
  Results: The simplest of the $\sigma +\omega +\rho$ exchange interactions
produces a good description of the single-particle energies in $^{16}$O and
$^{90}$Zr and a reasonable description of proton scattering from $^{15}$N.
  Conclusions: The development of a calculable, relativistic $R$ matrix and its
implementation in a $1p-1h$ relativistic continuum shell model provide a simple
relatively self-consist, physically justifiable model for use in knockout
reactions.

presents dropout training for linear SVMs. To deal with the intractable

treated as an effective 1D system with a renormalized localization length,

more particularly by means of inpainting. The first part of our approach has
been to develop the inpainting of DCT coefficients in an image. This has shown
good results for image compression without overpassing todays compression
standards like JPEG. We then looked at integrating the same approach in a video
coder, and in particular in the widely used H264 AVC standard coder, but the
same approach can be used in the framework of HEVC. The originality of this
work consists in cancelling at the coder, then automatically restoring, at the
decoder, some well chosen DCT residual coefficients. For this purpose, we have
developed a restoration model of transformed coefficients. By using a total
variation based model, we derive conditions for the reconstruction of
transformed coefficients that have been suppressed or altered. The main purpose
here, in a video coding context, is to improve the ratedistortion performance
of existing coders. To this end DCT restoration is used as an additional
prediction step to the spatial prediction of the transformed coefficients,
based on an image regularization process. The method has been successfully
tested with the H.264 AVC video codec standard.

Those of the v=1, v=2 J=1-0 masers are similar, but the spots are rarely
coincident, while the v=1 J=2-1 maser arises from a well separated region
farther out. These relative locations can be explained by models tools that
include the overlap of two IR lines of SiO and H2O. The v=3 J=1-0 line is not
directly affected by any line overlap and its spot structure and position,
relative to the other lines, is a good test to the standard pumping models. We
present single-dish and simultaneous VLBI observations of the v=1, v=2, and v=3
J=1-0 maser transitions of 28SiO in several AGB stars. The spatial distribution
of the SiO maser emission in the v=3 J=1-0 transition from AGB stars is
systematically composed of a series of spots that occupy a ring-like structure.
The overall ring structure is extremely similar to that found in the other 43
GHz transitions and is very different from the structure of the v=1 J=2-1
maser. The positions of the individual spots of the different 43 GHz lines are,
however, very rarely coincident, which in general is separated by about 0.3 AU
(between 1 and 5 mas). These results are very difficult to reconcile with
standard pumping models, which predict that the masers of rotational
transitions within a given vibrational state require very similar excitation
conditions, while the transitions of different vibrational states should appear
in different positions. However, models including line overlap tend to predict
v=1, v=2, v=3 J=1-0 population inversion to occur under very similar

the influence of all the involved parameters of the dynamical system, by
computing both the percentage of chaotic orbits and the percentages of orbits
of the main regular resonant families in each case. To distinguish between
ordered and chaotic motion, we use the smaller alignment index (SALI) method to
extensive samples of orbits by numerically integrating the equations of motion
as well as the variational equations. Moreover, a method based on the concept
of spectral dynamics that utilizes the Fourier transform of the time series of
each coordinate is used to identify the various families of regular orbits and
also to recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate from them. Two cases
are studied for every parameter: (i) the case where the halo component is
prolate and (ii) the case where an oblate dark halo is present. Our numerical
investigation indicates that all the dynamical quantities affect, more or less,
the overall orbital structure. It was observed that the mass of the nucleus,
the halo flattening parameter, the scale length of the halo, the angular
momentum, and the orbital energy are the most influential quantities, while the
effect of all the other parameters is much weaker. It was also found that all
the parameters corresponding to the disk only have a minor influence on the
nature of orbits. Furthermore, some other quantities, such as the minimum
distance to the origin, the horizontal, and the vertical force, were tested as

reproduce the dust impact rates onto the dust detector onboard the New Horizons
spacecraft measured so far and to predict the rates during the Neptune orbit
traverse. To this end, we take a realistic distribution of transneptunian
objects to launch a sufficient number of dust grains of different sizes and
follow their orbits by including radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and
stellar wind drag, as well as the perturbations of four giant planets. In a
subsequent statistical analysis, we calculate number densities and lifetimes of
the dust grains in order to simulate a collisional cascade. In contrast to the
previous work, our model not only considers collisional elimination of
particles, but also includes production of finer debris. We find that particles
captured in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune build clumps that are not removed by
collisions, because the depleting effect of collisions is counteracted by
production of smaller fragments. Our model successfully reproduces the dust
impact rates measured by New Horizons out to ~23AU and predicts an increase of
the impact rate of about a factor of two or three around the Neptune orbit
crossing. This result is robust with respect to the variation of the vaguely

smoothing and thus the signal can be used as a firn paleothermometer. We use a
water isotope diffusion model coupled to a steady-state densification model in
order to infer the temperature signal from the site, assuming the accumulation
and strain rate history as estimated using the GICC05 layer counted chronology
and a Dansgaard--Johnsen ice flow model. The temperature reconstruction
accurately captures the timing and magnitude of the B{\o}lling--Aller{\o}d and
Younger Dryas transitions. A Holocene climatic optimum is seen between 7 and 9
ky b2k with an apparent cooling trend thereafter. Our temperature estimate for
the Holocene climatic optimum, points to a necessary adjustment of the ice
thinning function indicating that the ice flow model overestimates past
accumulation rates by about 10\% at 8 ky b2k. Finally, the record presents a
climatic variability over the Holocene spanning millennial and centennial
scales with a profound cooling occurring at approximately 4000 years b2k. The
new reconstruction technique is able to provide past temperature estimates by
overcoming the issues apparent in the use of the classical
$\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ slope method. It can in the same time resolve
temperature signals at low and high frequencies.

is an essentially nonperturbative process and can be described, partially at
least, by the vector meson dominance (VMD) model. We showed by the
straightforward calculation that VMD model alone can successfully explain data
on structure functions of DIS in a broad interval of x (5e-2 - 1e-4) for the
region Q squared < 1 GeV squared. For a description of data at larger Q squared
we used the two-component (VMD + perturbative QCD) approach. We showed that
these two components can be separated if VMD is used in the aligned jet
version. We took into account, in calculations of VMD component of structure
functions, the excited states of the rho-meson and nondiagonal transitions
between different members of the rho-meson family. Amplitudes of these
transitions were obtained using a formalism of the light-front Bethe-Salpeter
equation and the method of diffraction-scattering eigenstates. The perturbative
QCD component was calculated using a framework of the colour dipole model with
the dipole cross section having a Regge-type energy dependence. We presented
results of the detailed comparison of our predictions with experimental data
for structure functions of the nucleon. We obtained also approximate
predictions for the structure functions in the region of very small x, up to
1e-9, and showed that nonperturbative component at such values of x is still
relatively large and must be taken into account if Q squared is about few GeV
squared or less.

recently revised upwardly and, moreover, found to increase with depth. Values
of the heat flow across the core mantle boundary (CMB) sufficient to maintain
convection in the whole outer core are not sufficient to make the temperature
in the inner core super-isentropic and therefore prone to thermal instability.
An unreasonably high CMB heat flow is necessary to this end. The compositional
stratification results from a competition of the increase of the concentration
of light elements in the outer core with inner core growth, which makes the
inner core concentration also increase, and of the decrease of the liquidus,
which makes the partition coefficient decrease as well as the concentration of
light elements in the solid. While the latter (destabilizing) effect dominates
at small inner core sizes, the former takes over for a large inner core. The
turnover point is encountered for an inner core about half its current size in
the case of S, but much larger for the case of O. The combined thermal and
compositional buoyancy is stabilizing and solid-state convection in the inner
core appears unlikely, unless an early double-diffusive instability can set in.

CaTalogues de Sources"" in French) is a Fortran 95 code for the
cross-identification of astrophysical sources. Its source files are freely
available.
  Given the coordinates and positional uncertainties of all the sources in two
catalogs K and K', Aspects computes the probability that an object in K and one
in K' are the same or that they have no counterpart. Three exclusive
assumptions are considered: (1) Several-to-one associations: a K-source has at
most one counterpart in K', but a K'-source may have several counterparts in K;
(2) One-to-several associations: the same with K and K' swapped; (3) One-to-one
associations: a K-source has at most one counterpart in K' and vice versa.
  To compute the probabilities of association, Aspects needs the a priori (i.e.
ignoring positions) probability that an object has a counterpart. The code
obtains estimates of this quantity by maximizing the likelihood to observe all
the sources at their effective positions under each assumption. The likelihood
may also be used to determine the most appropriate model, given the data, or to
estimate the typical positional uncertainty if unknown.

depends on the availability of the water from this network. Water is stored
during intense wet-season rainfall events and evaporates from the reservoir
surface during the dry season. These seasonal changes are the driving forces
behind the water dynamics in the network. The reservoir network and its
connectivity properties during flood avalanches are investigated with a model
called ResNetM, which simulates each reservoir explicitly. It runs on the basis
of daily calculated water balances for each reservoir. A spilling reservoir
contributes with water to the reservoir downstream, which can trigger
avalanches affecting, in some cases, large fractions of the network. The main
focus is on the study of the relation between the total amount of water stored
and the largest observable cluster of connected reservoirs that overspill in
the same day. It is shown that the thousands of small and middle-sized
reservoirs are eminent for the retention of water upstream the large ones.
Therefore, they prevent large clusters at a low level of water. Concerning
connectivity measures, the actual reservoir network, which evolved without an
integrated plan, performed better (i.e., generated smaller avalanches for
similar amount of stored water) than numerous stochastically generated
artificial reservoir networks on the same river network.

undulations observed in Saturn's inner B-ring and in its C-ring. We present
semi-analytic results demonstrating how the instability sustains steadily
travelling nonlinear wavetrains. At low optical depths, the instability
produces approximately sinusoidal waves of low amplitude, which we identify
with those observed between radii 77,000 and 86,000 km in the C-ring. On the
other hand, optical depths of 1 or more exhibit hysteresis, whereby the ring
falls into multiple stable states: the homogeneous background equilibrium or
large-amplitude wave states. Possibly the `flat zones' and `wave zones' between
radii 93,000 and 98,000 km in the B-ring correspond to the stable homogeneous
and wave states, respectively. In addition, we test the linear stability of the
wavetrains and show that only a small subset are stable. In particular, stable
solutions all possess wavelengths greater than the lengthscale of fastest
linear growth. We supplement our calculations with a weakly nonlinear analysis
that suggests the C-ring reproduces some of the dynamics of the complex
Ginzburg--Landau equation. In the third paper in the series, these results will
be tested and extended with numerical simulations.

a forest of plateaus, narrow ringlets, and gaps. In both regions the waves are
probably generated by a large-scale linear instability whose origin lies in the
meteoritic bombardment of the rings: the ballistic transport instability. In
this paper, the third in a series, we numerically simulate the long-term

simulations confirm that the unstable system forms low-amplitude wavetrains
possessing a preferred band of wavelengths. B-ring simulations, on the other

flat zones. Wave packets travel slowly while spreading in time, a result that
suggests the observed flat regions in Saturn's B-ring are shrinking. Finally,
we present exploratory runs of the inner B-ring edge which reproduce earlier

limit, the Riemann zeros. H is derived from the action of a massless Dirac
fermion living in a domain of Rindler spacetime, in 1+1 dimensions, that has a
boundary given by the world line of a uniformly accelerated observer.
  The action contains a sum of delta function potentials that can be viewed as
partially reflecting moving mirrors. An appropriate choice of the accelerations
of the mirrors, provide primitive periodic orbits associated to the prime
numbers $p$, whose periods, measured by the observer's clock, are log p. Acting
on the chiral components of the fermion, H becomes the Berry-Keating
Hamiltonian (x p + p x)/2, where x is identified with the Rindler spatial
coordinate and p with the conjugate momentum.
  The delta function potentials give the matching conditions of the fermion
wave functions on both sides of the mirrors. There is also a phase shift for
the reflection of the fermions at the boundary where the observer sits. The
eigenvalue problem is solved by transfer matrix methods in the limit where the
reflection amplitudes become infinitesimally small. We find that for generic
values of the phase shift the spectrum is a continuum, where the Riemann zeros
are missing, as in the adelic Connes model. However, for some values of phase
shift, related to the phase of the zeta function, the Riemann zeros appear as
discrete eigenvalues immersed in the continuum.
  We generalize this result to the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions, associated
to primitive characters, that are encoded in the reflection coefficients of the
mirrors. Finally, we show that the Hamiltonian associated to the Riemann zeros
belongs to class AIII, or chiral GUE, of Random Matrix Theory.

massive fermion is coupled to the kink of the $\lambda\phi^4$ model as a
prescribed background field. We solve this massive J-R model exactly and
analytically and obtain the whole spectrum of the fermion, including the bound
and continuum states. The mass term of the fermion makes the potential of the
decoupled second order Schrodinger-like equations asymmetric in a way that
their asymptotic values at two spatial infinities are different. Therefore, we
encounter the unusual problem in which two kinds of continuum states are
possible for the fermion: reflecting and scattering states. We then show the
energies of all the states as a function of the parameters of the kink, i.e.
its value at spatial infinity ($\theta_0$) and its slope at $x=0$ ($\mu$). The
graph of the energies as a function of $\theta_0$, where the bound state
energies and the two kinds of continuum states are depicted, shows peculiar
features including an energy gap in the form of a triangle where no bound
states exist. That is the zero mode exists only for $\theta_0$ larger than a
critical value $(\theta_0^{\textrm{c}})$. This is in sharp contrast to the
usual (massless) J-R model where the zero mode and hence the fermion number
$\pm1/2$ for the ground state is ever present. This also makes the origin of
the zero mode very clear: It is formed from the union of the two threshold
bound states at $\theta_0^{\textrm{c}}$, which is zero in the massless J-R
model.

different nondeterministic protocols. These schemes either require
single-photon sources, or operate by noise addition and photon subtraction.
Here we present an experimental demonstration of a protocol that allows
nondeterministic amplification of known sets of coherent states with high gain
and high fidelity. The experimental system employs the two mature quantum
optical technologies of state comparison and photon subtraction and does not
rely on elaborate quantum resources such as single-photon sources. The use of
coherent states rather than single photons allows for an increased rate of
amplification and a less complex photon source. Furthermore it means that the
amplification is not restricted to low amplitude states. With respect to the
two key parameters, fidelity and amplified state production rate, we
demonstrate, without the use of quantum resources, significant improvements
over previous experimental implementations.

couple strongly to thermal (Standard Model) particles. It is also shown that
parametric resonance during preheating is not effective enough to induce
non-thermal PQ symmetry restoration. As a consequence, axion models with the
QCD anomaly $N_{DW}>1$ can be made free from the domain wall problem while the

widely studied in epidemiology and in metapopulation theory. Contacts are
usually assumed to be possible only through a network of connected patches.
This network accounts for a spatial landscape or a social organisation of
interactions. Thanks to social network literature, heterogeneous networks of
contacts can be considered. A major issue is to assess the influence of the
network in the dynamic model. Most work with this common purpose uses
deterministic models or an approximation of a stochastic
Extinction-Colonisation model (sEC) which are relevant only for large networks.
When working with a limited size network, the induced stochasticity is
essential and has to be taken into account in the conclusions. Here, a rigorous
framework is proposed for limited size networks and the limitations of the
deterministic approximation are exhibited. This framework allows exact
computations when the number of patches is small. Otherwise, simulations are
used and enhanced by adapted simulation techniques when necessary. A
sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare four main topologies of networks
in contrasting settings to determine the role of the network. A challenging
case was studied in this context: seed exchange of crop species in the R\'eseau
Semences Paysannes (RSP), an emergent French farmers' organisation. A
stochastic Extinction-Colonisation model was used to characterize the
consequences of substantial changes in terms of RSP's social organisation on
the ability of the system to maintain crop varieties.

transported due to the magnetic instability of toroidal fields under the
influence of differential rotation, and that the resulting effective viscosity
may be high enough to explain the almost rigid-body rotation observed in
radiative stellar cores. Only stationary current-free fields and only those
combinations of rotation rates and magnetic field amplitudes which provide
maximal numerical values of the viscosity are considered. We find that the
dimensionless ratio of the effective over molecular viscosity, $\nu_T/\nu$;,
linearly grows with the Reynolds number of the rotating fluid multiplied with
the square-root of the magnetic Prandtl number - which is of order unity for
the considered red sub-giant KIC 7341231.
  For the considered interval of magnetic Reynolds numbers - which is
restricted by numerical constraints of the nonlinear MHD code - there is a
remarkable influence of the magnetic Prandtl number on the relative importance
of the contributions of the Reynolds stress and the Maxwell stress to the total
viscosity, which is magnetically dominated only for Pm $\gtrsim$ 0.5. We also
find that the magnetized plasma behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid, i.e. the
resulting effective viscosity depends on the shear in the rotation law. The
decay time of the differential rotation thus depends on its shear and becomes
longer and longer during the spin-down of a stellar core.

acceleration, deceleration, suppression, or generation of pulses, multiple
pulses, and blinking pulse trains. It is shown that one can observe these
effects for various choices of the integral kernel and the coupling scheme,

is appropriate. In addition, an analytical procedure is developed to describe
the stability borders of the spatially homogeneous steady state in control
parameter space in dependence on the parameters of the nonlocal coupling.
