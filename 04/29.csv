processes. As an illustration, we consider hard exclusive transition process
$\gamma^* \gamma \to \pi^0$ at the handbag level. Our starting point is
coordinate representation for matrix elements of operators (in the simplest
case, bilocal ${\cal O}(0,z)$) describing a hadron with momentum $p$. Treated
as functions of $(pz)$ and $z^2$, they are parametrized through virtuality
distribution amplitudes (VDA) $\Phi (x, \sigma)$, with $x$ being
Fourier-conjugate to $(pz)$ and $\sigma$ Laplace-conjugate to $z^2$. For
intervals with $z^+=0$, we introduce the transverse momentum distribution
amplitude (TMDA) $\Psi (x, k_\perp)$, and write it in terms of VDA $\Phi (x,
\sigma)$. The results of covariant calculations, written in terms of $\Phi (x,
\sigma)$ are converted into expressions involving $\Psi (x, k_\perp)$. Starting
with scalar toy models, we extend the analysis onto the case of spin-1/2 quarks
and QCD. We propose simple models for soft VDAs/TMDAs, and use them for
comparison of handbag results with experimental (BaBar and BELLE) data on the
pion transition form factor. We also discuss how one can generate
high-$k_\perp$ tails from primordial soft distributions.

demonstrated that the regularization parameters for a point particle in
geodesic motion in a Schwarzschild spacetime can be described solely by the
leading and subleading terms in the mode-sum (commonly known as the $A$ and $B$

(later they showed the same behavior for geodesic motion in Kerr [2], [3]). We
demonstrate that these properties are universal to point particles moving
through any smooth spacetime along arbitrary (accelerated) trajectories. Our
renormalization scheme is based on, but not identical to, the Quinn-Wald
axioms. As we develop our approach, we review and extend work showing that that
different definitions of the singular field used in the literature are
equivalent to our approach. Because our approach does not assume geodesic
motion of the perturbing particle, we are able use our mode-sum formalism to
explicitly recover a well-known result: The self-force on static scalar charges
near a Schwarzschild black hole vanishes.

properties of ultra-thin topological insulator slabs for which the coupling
between Dirac fermions on opposite surfaces results in two degenerated gapped

translates in a peak in the imaginary part of the optical conductivity. An
exchange field applied perpendicular to the slab splits the degenerated
hyperbolic bands and a double step structure come out in the optical
absorption, whereas a double peak structure appears in the imaginary part of
the longitudinal optical conductivity. The exchange field breaks time-reversal
symmetry and for exchange fields larger than the surfaces coupling gap, the
zero frequency Hall conductivity is quantized to $e^2/h$. This result implies
large values of the Kerr and Faraday rotation angles. In ultra-thin slabs, the
absence of light multiple scattering and bulk conductivity, makes the Kerr and

simulations from the Stagger-grid and synthetic images computed with the
radiative transfer code Optim3D to provide interferometric observables to
extract the signature of stellar granulation and transiting planets. Methods.
We computed intensity maps from RHD simulations for twelve interferometric
instruments covering wavelengths ranging from optical to infrared. The stellar
surface asymmetries in the brightness distribution mostly affect closure
phases. We compared the closure phases of the system star with a transiting
planet and the star alone and considered the impact of magnetic spots
constructing a hypothetical starspots image. Results. All the simulations show
departure from the axisymmetric case at all wavelengths. We presented two
possible targets (Beta Com and Procyon) and found that departures up to 16 deg
can be detected on the 3rd lobe and higher. In particular, MIRC is the most
appropriate instrument because it combines good UV coverage and long baselines.
Moreover, we explored the impact of convection on interferometric planet
signature for three prototypes of planets. It is possible to disentangle the
signature of the planet at particular wavelengths (either in the infrared or in
the optical) by comparing the closure phases of the star at difference phases
of the planetary transit. Conclusions. The detection and characterisation of
planets must be based on a comprehensive knowledge of the host star; this
includes the detailed study of the stellar surface convection with
interferometric techniques. In this context, RHD simulations are crucial to
reach this aim. We emphasize that interferometric observations should be pushed
at high spatial frequencies by accumulating observations on closure phases at
short and long baselines.

Underlaid D2D users communicate directly by utilizing the cellular spectrum but

users that compete for access to the resources construct a distributed system,
where the transmission performance depends on channel availability and quality.
This information, however, is difficult to acquire. Moreover, the adverse
effects of D2D users on cellular transmissions should be minimized. In order to
overcome these limitations, we propose a network-assisted distributed channel
selection approach in which D2D users are only allowed to use vacant cellular
channels. This scenario is modeled as a multi-player multi-armed bandit game
with side information, for which a distributed algorithmic solution is
proposed. The solution is a combination of no-regret learning and calibrated
forecasting, and can be applied to a broad class of multi-player stochastic
learning problems, in addition to the formulated channel selection problem.
Analytically, it is established that this approach not only yields vanishing
regret (in comparison to the global optimal solution), but also guarantees that
the empirical joint frequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated
equilibria.

loss of information. Here we propose a simple-to-implement, fully nonparametric
density ratio estimator that expands the ratio in terms of the eigenfunctions
of a kernel-based operator; these functions reflect the underlying geometry of
the data (e.g., submanifold structure), often leading to better estimates
without an explicit dimension reduction step. We show how our general framework
can be extended to address another important problem, the estimation of a
likelihood function in situations where that function cannot be
well-approximated by an analytical form. One is often faced with this situation
when performing statistical inference with data from the sciences, due the
complexity of the data and of the processes that generated those data. We
emphasize applications where using existing likelihood-free methods of
inference would be challenging due to the high dimensionality of the sample

likelihood function. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the

on-shell/DRbar renormalization that can directly be matched onto the

of human behaviour. Here we shed light on the motivations behind this behaviour
by experimentally exploring cooperation in a one-shot continuous-strategy
Prisoner's Dilemma (i.e. one-shot two-player Public Goods Game). We examine the
distribution of cooperation amounts, and how that distribution varies based on
the benefit-to-cost ratio of cooperation (b/c). Interestingly, we find a
trimodal distribution at all b/c values investigated. Increasing b/c decreases
the fraction of participants engaging in zero cooperation and increases the
fraction engaging in maximal cooperation, suggesting a role for efficiency
concerns. However, a substantial fraction of participants consistently engage
in 50% cooperation regardless of b/c. The presence of these persistent 50%
cooperators is surprising, and not easily explained by standard models of
social preferences. We present evidence that this behaviour is a result of
social preferences guided by simple decision heuristics, rather than the
rational examination of payoffs assumed by most social preference models. We
also find a strong correlation between play in the Prisoner's Dilemma and in a
subsequent Dictator Game, confirming previous findings suggesting a common
prosocial motivation underlying altruism and cooperation.

the ordering and atomicity of memory accesses.
  Due to these weaknesses, some programs that are correct under sequential
consistency (SC) show undesirable effects when run under Power. We call these
programs not robust against the Power memory model. Formally, a program is
robust if every computation under Power has the same data and control
dependencies as some SC computation.
  Our contribution is a decision procedure for robustness of concurrent
programs against the Power memory model. It is based on three ideas. First, we
reformulate robustness in terms of the acyclicity of a happens-before relation.
Second, we prove that among the computations with cyclic happens-before
relation there is one in a certain normal form. Finally, we reduce the
existence of such a normal-form computation to a language emptiness problem.
Altogether, this yields a PSPACE algorithm for checking robustness against

between 50 K and 17.5 K, and a coherent Drude peak emerges which mirrors the
changes in the dc resistivity. The Drude weight indicates that there is little
change in the effective mass of these carriers in this temperature range. In
addition, there is a flat background conductivity that develops a partial
hybridization gap at 10 meV as the temperature is lowered, shifting spectral
weight to higher frequencies above 300 meV. Below 30 K the carriers become
increasingly coherent and Fermi-liquid-like as the hidden order transition is
approached. The hidden order state in URu$_2$Si$_2$ is characterized by
multiple anisotropic gaps. The gap parameter $\Delta_a=3.2$ meV in the {\it
ab}-plane. In the {\it c}-direction, there are two distinct gaps with
magnitudes of $\Delta_{c1}=2.7$ meV and $\Delta_{c2}=1.8$ meV. These

Overall, the spectrum can be fit by a Dynes-type density of states model to

Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network of mm wavelength dishes that can resolve
strong field General Relativistic signatures near a supermassive black hole. As
planned, the EHT will include enough dishes to enable imaging of the predicted
black hole ""shadow"", a feature caused by severe light bending at the black hole
boundary. The center of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, presents one of the
most interesting EHT targets as it exhibits a relativistic jet, offering the
additional possibility of studying jet genesis on Schwarzschild radius scales.
Fully relativistic models of the M87 jet that fit all existing observational
constraints now allow horizon-scale images to be generated. We perform
realistic VLBI simulations of M87 model images to examine detectability of the
black shadow with the EHT, focusing on a sequence of model images with a
changing jet mass load radius. When the jet is launched close to the black
hole, the shadow is clearly visible both at 230 and 345 GHz. The EHT array with
a resolution of 20-30$\mu$as resolution ($\sim$2-4 Schwarzschild radii) is able
to image this feature independent of any theoretical models and we show that
imaging methods used to process data from optical interferometers are
applicable and effective for EHT data sets. We demonstrate that the EHT is also
capable of tracing real-time structural changes on a few Schwarzschild radii
scales, such as those implicated by VHE flaring activity of M87. While
inclusion of ALMA in the EHT is critical for shadow imaging, generally the
array is robust against loss of a station.

of matrices $\{T_n^{-1}(g)T_n(f)\}_{n\in\mathbb N^k}$ has a global (asymptotic)
spectral distribution described by the function $g^{-1}f$, provided $g$
possesses certain properties (which ensure in particular the invertibility of

the essential range of $g^{-1}f$, defined as the union of the essential ranges

uniform X-ray analysis in the literature. We observe that differences between
these X-ray analyses introduce significant variability into the measured

evolution dominated by gravitational effects. Comparing to predictions from

objects from single-shot graph-based measurements, particularly those taken
over the edges of some measurement graph $\mathcal{G}$. This paper concerns the
situation where each object takes value over a group of $M$ different values,
and where one is interested to recover all these values based on observations
of certain pairwise relations over $\mathcal{G}$. The imperfection of
measurements presents two major challenges for information recovery: 1)
$\textit{inaccuracy}$: a (dominant) portion $1-p$ of measurements are
corrupted; 2) $\textit{incompleteness}$: a significant fraction of pairs are
unobservable, i.e. $\mathcal{G}$ can be highly sparse.
  Under a natural random outlier model, we characterize the $\textit{minimax
recovery rate}$, that is, the critical threshold of non-corruption rate $p$
below which exact information recovery is infeasible. This accommodates a very
general class of pairwise relations. For various homogeneous random graph
models (e.g. Erdos Renyi random graphs, random geometric graphs, small world
graphs), the minimax recovery rate depends almost exclusively on the edge
sparsity of the measurement graph $\mathcal{G}$ irrespective of other graphical
metrics. This fundamental limit decays with the group size $M$ at a square root
rate before entering a connectivity-limited regime. Under the Erdos Renyi
random graph, a tractable combinatorial algorithm is proposed to approach the
limit for large $M$ ($M=n^{\Omega(1)}$), while order-optimal recovery is
enabled by semidefinite programs in the small $M$ regime.

role of heterogeneity in cancer progression by using neural networks to
characterise different aspects of the mapping from a cancer cells genotype and
environment to its phenotype. Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving
system subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these
processes to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple
biological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the
microenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the
cell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways
that are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a
massive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e.
genotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the
surface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as
a means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to
easily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this
heterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More
specifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different
aspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the
impact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from
genotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway
activity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental

based on the modified Friedmann function resulting form dynamical
investigations of Brans-Dicke cosmology in the vicinity of a de Sitter state.
The qualitative theory of dynamical systems enables us to obtain three
different behaviors in the vicinity of this state. We find for a linear
approach to the de Sitter state
$\omega_{\textrm{BD}}=-0.8606^{+0.8281}_{-0.1341}$, for an oscillatory approach
to the de Sitter state $\omega_{\textrm{BD}}=-1.1103^{+0.1872}_{-0.1729}$, and
for the transient de Sitter state represented by a saddle-type critical point
$\omega_{\textrm{BD}}=-2.3837^{+0.4588}_{-4.5459}$. We obtain the mass of the
Brans-Dicke scalar field at the present epoch as $m_{\phi}\sim H_{0}$. The
Bayesian methods of model comparison are used to discriminate between obtained
models. We show that observational data point toward vales of the
$\omega_{\textrm{BD}}$ parameter close to the value suggested by the low-energy

physically-motivated model, our analysis also reveals the presence of a broad
Iron K alpha line (EW=124 eV), most likely produced in the inner part of the
accretion disk and blurred by general relativistic effects. This component is
not immediately evident from the individual spectra, but is clearly present in
the stacked residuals of all five observations, and has high statistical
significance. This highlights the difficulty in identifying broad iron lines in
AGN, even in data with very high signal-to-noise ratio, as they are difficult
to disentangle from the continuum. The data are consistent with the narrow and
broad iron line components tracking the Compton Hump, but do not provide clear
evidence that this is the case. An additional narrow FeXXVI emission line at
6.94 keV is also seen, suggesting the presence of ionized material relatively
distant from the central region. There is also a hint of variability, so the
precise origin of this line remains unclear.

the light of the tension between the Planck results of the primary temperature
anisotropies of the CMB and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich plus X-ray cluster counts

clusters by the IACHEC. Performing spectral fitting in the full energy band we
find that best-fit temperatures determined with XMM-Newton/EPIC are
significantly lower than Chandra/ACIS temperatures. We demonstrate that effects
like multitemperature structure and different relative sensitivities of the
instruments at certain energy bands cannot explain the observed differences. We
conclude that using XMM-Newton/EPIC, instead of Chandra/ACIS to derive full
energy band temperature profiles for cluster mass determination results in an
8% shift towards lower OmegaM values and <1% shift towards higher sigma8 values
in a cosmological analysis of a complete sample of galaxy clusters. Such a
shift is insufficient to significantly alleviate the tension between Planck CMB

different estimators of the environment. We find that galaxies tend to be
larger in the field than in high density regions. This effect is more
pronounced for late-type morphologies (~7.5% larger) and especially at low
masses ($M < 2\times10^{10}M_{\odot}$), although early-type galaxies also show
differences (~3.5%). The environment also leaves a subtle imprint in the
scatter of the stellar mass-size relation. This scatter is larger in low
density regions than in high density regions for both morphologies, on average
~3.5% larger for early-type and ~0.8% for late-type galaxies. Late-type
galaxies with low masses ($M<2\times10^{10}M_{\odot}$) show the largest
differences in the scatter among environments. The scatter is ~20% larger in
the field than in clusters for these objects. Our analysis suggest that
galaxies in clusters form earlier than those in the field. In addition, cluster
galaxies seem to be originated from a more homogeneous family of progenitors.

Such widely separated binaries are thought to form during cluster dissolution,
but that process is unlikely to form such a triple system. We explore an
alternative scenario, where A and C form as a tighter binary from a single
molecular cloud core (with semimajor axis ~1E4 au), and B is captured during
cluster dispersal. We use N-body simulations augmented with the Galactic tidal
forces to show that such a system naturally evolves into a Fomalhaut-like
system in about half of cases, on a timescale compatible with the age of
Fomalhaut. From initial non-interacting orbits, Galactic tides drive cycles in
B's eccentricity that lead to a close encounter with C. After several close
encounters, typically lasting tens of millions of years, one of the stars is
ejected. The Fomalhaut-like case with both components at large separations is
almost invariably a precursor to the ejection of one component, most commonly
Fomalhaut C. By including circumstellar debris in a subset of the simulations,
we also show that such an evolution usually does not disrupt the coherently
eccentric debris disk around Fomalhaut A, and in some cases can even produce
such a disk. We also find that the final eccentricity of the disk around A and
the disk around C are correlated, which may indicate that the dynamics of the
three stars stirred C's disk, explaining its unusual brightness.

five hyperfermions in the anti-symmetric representation and three in the

SU(5)/SO(5), with top partners in the fundamental of SO(5), giving rise to one
composite fermion of electric charge 5/3, three of charge 2/3 and one of charge
-1/3. Electro-Weak symmetry breaking occurs via top-quark-driven vacuum
misalignment. The top quark mass is generated via the mechanism of partial
compositeness, while the remaining fermions acquire a mass via a standard

and galaxy parameters including stellar mass, specific star formation rate
(sSFR), stellar mass surface density and concentration index. The analysis is
based on the COLD GASS survey, which includes galaxies with stellar mass in the
range 10^10 - 10^11.5 Msun with molecular gas mass estimates derived from
CO(1-0) line measurements. We improve on previous work by Saintonge et al.
(2011b) by estimating SFRs using the combination of GALEX FUV and WISE 22
micron data and by deriving Tdep within a fixed aperture set by the IRAM beam
size. In our new study we find correlations with much smaller scatter.
Dependences of the Tdep on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass
surface density and concentration index are now weak or absent. Differences
with previous work arise because dust extinction correlates strongly with
galaxy structural parameters. We further demonstrate that the 'primary' global
parameter correlation is between Tdep and sSFR; all other remaining
correlations can be shown to be induced by this primary dependence. This
implies that galaxies with high current-to-past-averaged star formation
activity, will drain their molecular gas reservoir sooner. We then analyze
molecular gas depletion times on 1-kpc scales in galactic disks using data from
the HERACLES survey. There is remarkably good agreement between the global Tdep
versus sSFR relation for the COLD GASS galaxies and that derived for 1 kpc
scale grid regions in disks. The strong correlation between Tdep and sSFR
extends continuously over a factor of 10 in Tdep from log(SFR/M*) = -11.5 to
-9, i.e. from nearly quiescent patches of the disk to disk regions with very
strong star formation. This leads to the conclusion that the local molecular
gas depletion time in galactic disks is dependent on the local fraction of
young-to-old stars.

require that astrophysical environmental pollution of gravitational-wave

consider the main sources for space-based detectors -- the inspiral, merger and
ringdown of massive black-hole binaries and extreme mass-ratio inspirals -- and
account for various effects on their gravitational waveforms, including
electromagnetic fields, cosmological evolution, accretion disks, dark matter,

the black-hole quasinormal modes are sharply different in the presence of

unaffected. The effect of accretion disks and dark matter depends critically on
their geometry and density profile, but is negligible for most sources, except
for few special extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Electromagnetic fields and
cosmological effects are always negligible. We finally explore the implications

gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will
eventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the
corrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW
astronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two
compact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric
charges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from
General Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion
disks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances
dictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time
behavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically
differ from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is
unchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although
the vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the
system, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results
strongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at
least two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that
environmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the
exception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in
particular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over
self-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely
neglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most
relevant for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter
surrounding compact objects implies intrinsic limits on the ability to
constrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity.

generates two-body correlated interference from the incident and reflected
particle substates and their associated mirror substates. The microscopic
momentum exchanged generates two mirror substates which interfere to produce
fringes which do not vanish as the mirror mass increases. The small
displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible environmental
decoherence times. Mirror coherence lengths impose constraints on the extent of
this interference, which are mitigated using interference of the two-body
states associated with the particle reflecting from both of the two surfaces of
a slab of matter in a manner analogous to the classical interference of a pulse
of light reflecting from a `thin film'. This two-body correlated interference
is modeled as a particle traversing a finite well with both the particle and
well treated quantum mechanically. Such a treatment predicts the expected
`thin-film' interference but only as a special case of a more general result.
It is also shown that measurements on only the reflected particle (yielding a
marginal probability density function) can act as a probe to reveal the quantum
state of the macroscopic reflector. For equal masses, coherence of the particle
substate is transferred to the mirror substate, a quantum manifestation of a
familiar classical result.

systems, to study the time evolution of the expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor of a scalar field in the presence of real materials. We
analyze quantum fluctuations in a fully non-equilibrium scenario, when the
scalar field is interacting with the polarization degrees of freedom of matter,
described as quantum Brownian particles. A generalized analysis was done for
two types of couplings between the field and the material. On the one hand, we
considered a bilinear coupling, and on the other hand, a (more realistic)
current-type coupling as in the case of the electromagnetic field interacting
with matter. We considered the high temperature limit for the field, keeping
arbitrary temperatures for each part of the volume elements of the material. We
obtained a closed form for the Hadamard propagator, which let us study the
dynamical evolution of the expectations values of the energy-momentum tensor
components from the initial time. We showed that two contributions always take
place in the transient evolution: one of these is associated to the material
and the other one is only associated to the field. Transient features were
studied and the long-time limit was derived in several cases. We proved that in
the steady situation of a field in n + 1 dimensions, the material always
contribute unless is non-dissipative. Conversely, the proper field contribution
vanishes unless the material is non-dissipative or, moreover, at least for the
1 + 1 case, if there are regions without material. We conclude that any steady
quantization scheme in 1 + 1 dimensions must consider both contributions and we
argue why these results are physically expected from a dynamical point of view,
and also could be valid for higher dimensions based on the expected continuity
between the non-dissipative and real material cases.

formal logical system that explicitly portrays reasoning as a temporal

incorporates some well-defined logic together with a controller that serves to
guide the reasoning process in response to user inputs. Logics are generic,
whereas controllers are application-specific. Every controller does,
nonetheless, provide an algorithm for nonmonotonic belief revision. The general
notion of a DRS comprises a framework within which one can formulate the logic
and algorithms for a given application and prove that the algorithms are
correct, i.e., that they serve to (i) derive all salient information and (ii)
preserve the consistency of the belief set. This paper illustrates the idea
with ordinary first-order predicate calculus, suitably modified for the present
purpose, and an example. The example revisits some classic nonmonotonic
reasoning puzzles (Opus the Penguin, Nixon Diamond) and shows how these can be
resolved in the context of a DRS, using an expanded version of first-order
logic that incorporates typed predicate symbols. All concepts are rigorously
defined and effectively computable, thereby providing the foundation for a

transparent containers is perhaps the most commonly used evaluation method when
dealing with fluids. Such recognition is essential in determining the liquid
volume, fill level, phase boundaries and phase separation in various fluid
systems. The recognition of liquid surfaces is particularly important in
solution chemistry, where it is essential to many laboratory techniques (e.g.,
extraction, distillation, titration). A general method for the recognition of
interfaces between liquid and air or between phase-separating liquids could
have a wide range of applications and contribute to the understanding of the
visual properties of such interfaces. This work examines a computer vision
method for the recognition of liquid surfaces and liquid levels in various
transparent containers. The method can be applied to recognition of both
liquid-air and liquid-liquid surfaces. No prior knowledge of the number of
phases is required. The method receives the image of the liquid container and
the boundaries of the container in the image and scans all possible curves that
could correspond to the outlines of liquid surfaces in the image. The method
then compares each curve to the image to rate its correspondence with the
outline of the real liquid surface by examining various image properties in the
area surrounding each point of the curve. The image properties that were found
to give the best indication of the liquid surface are the relative intensity
change, the edge density change and the gradient direction relative to the
curve normal.

sensitivity of conclusions to unmeasured confounding. The classical Cornfield
condition allows us to assess whether an unmeasured binary confounder can
explain away the observed relative risk of the exposure on the outcome. It
states that for an unmeasured confounder to explain away an observed relative
risk, the association between the unmeasured confounder and the exposure, and
also that between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome, must both be
larger than the observed relative risk. In this paper, we extend the classical
Cornfield condition in three directions. First, we consider analogous
conditions for the risk difference, and allow for a categorical, not just a
binary, unmeasured confounder. Second, we provide more stringent thresholds
which the maximum of the above-mentioned associations must satisfy, rather than
simply weaker conditions that both must satisfy. Third, we show that all
previous results on Cornfield conditions hold under weaker assumptions than
previously used. We illustrate their potential applications by real examples,

Reissner-Nordstr\""om exterior, and study some features of these star spheres

display the pressure profile. For star spheres made of a perfect fluid there is
the Buchdahl bound, $R/M\geq 9/4$, a compactness bound found from generic
principles. For the Schwarzschild interior solution there is also the known
compactness limit, the interior Schwarzschild limit where the configurations
attain infinite central pressure, given by $R/M=9/4$, yielding an instance
where the Buchdahl bound is saturated. We study this limit of infinite central
pressure for the electrically charged stars and compare it with the
Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound, a limit that, like the Buchdahl bound for the
uncharged case, is obtained by imposing some generic physical conditions on
charged configurations. We show that the electrical interior Schwarzschild
limit of all but two configurations is always below the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson

generically saturate the Buchdahl-Andr\'easson bound. We also find that the
quasiblack hole limit, i.e., the extremal most compact limit for charged
incompressible stars, is reached when the matter is highly charged and the

how alignment, turning responses, and changes of speed mediate flocking and
schooling interactions in different animal species. Here, we address
specifically the problem of what interaction responses support different
nearest neighbour configurations in terms of mutual position and distance.
Results: We find that the different interaction rules observed in different
animal species may be a simple consequence of the relative positions that
individuals assume when they move together, and of the noise inherent with the
movement of animals, or associated with tracking inaccuracy. Conclusions: The
anisotropic positioning of individuals with respect to their neighbours, in
combination with noise, can explain several aspects of the movement responses
observed in real animal groups, and should be considered explicitly in future
models of flocking and schooling. By making a distinction between interaction
responses involved in maintaining a preferred flock configuration, and
interaction responses directed at changing it, we provide a frame to
discriminate movement interactions that signal directional conflict from those
underlying consensual group motion.

non-idealities, that this scheme achieves a secret key rate that surpasses the
TGW bound---a recently-found fundamental limit to the rate-vs.-loss scaling
achievable by any QKD protocol over a direct optical link---thereby providing
one of the first rigorous proofs of the efficacy of a repeater protocol. We
explicitly calculate the end-to-end shared noisy quantum state generated by the

non-QKD quantum protocols that require establishing long-distance entanglement.
We evaluate that shared state's fidelity and the achievable entanglement
distillation rate, as a function of the number of repeater nodes, total range,
and various loss and noise parameters of the system. We extend our theoretical
analysis to encompass sources with non-zero two-pair-emission probability,
using an efficient exact numerical evaluation of the quantum state propagation

increase the injection efficiency appreciably, as the shock parameters were
chosen to be optimal for injection even in the absence of rotation. For a shock
wave from a core-collapse supernova, the dilution factors for supernova
material are in the range of $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-4}$, in
agreement with recent laboratory estimates of the required amount of dilution
for $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al. We conclude that a type II supernova remains as a
promising candidate for synthesizing the solar system's short-lived
radioisotopes shortly before their injection into the presolar cloud core by
the supernova's remnant shock wave.

agent-based problems exhibit smooth behavior in space and time on a macroscopic
scale, suggesting that a useful coarse-grained continuum model could be
obtained. For such problems, the equation-free framework [16-18] can
significantly reduce the computational cost. Patch dynamics is an essential
component of this framework. This scheme is designed to perform numerical
simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on macroscopic time and
length scales; it uses appropriately initialized simulations of the fine-scale
agent-based model in a number of small ""patches"", which cover only a fraction
of the spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we construct a

then apply the scheme to the agent-based model itself. Our computational

stars at small angular separations requires fine control of tip, tilt and other
low order aberrations. When such errors occur upstream of a coronagraph, they
results in starlight leakage which reduces the dynamic range of the instrument.
This issue has been previously addressed for occulting coronagraphs by sensing
the starlight before or at the coronagraphic focal plane. One such solution,
the coronagraphic low order wave-front sensor (CLOWFS) uses a partially
reflective focal plane mask to measure pointing errors for Lyot-type
coronagraphs.
  To deal with pointing errors in low inner working angle phase mask
coronagraphs which do not have a reflective focal plane mask, we have adapted
the CLOWFS technique. This new concept relies on starlight diffracted by the
focal plane phase mask being reflected by the Lyot stop towards a sensor which
reliably measures low order aberrations such as tip and tilt. This reflective
Lyot-based wavefront sensor is a linear reconstructor which provides high
sensitivity tip-tilt error measurements with phase mask coronagraphs.
  Simulations show that the measurement accuracy of pointing errors with
realistic post adaptive optics residuals are approx. 10^-2 lambda/D per mode at
lambda = 1.6 micron for a four quadrant phase mask. In addition, we demonstrate
the open loop measurement pointing accuracy of 10^-2 lambda/D at 638 nm for a
four quadrant phase mask in the laboratory.

computation-limited settings, since the complexity of general convex
programming can be quite high (e.g., cubic for quadratic programs, and
substantially higher for semidefinite programs). In addition to computational
savings, random projection is also useful for reducing memory usage, and has
useful properties for privacy-sensitive optimization. We prove that the

of constraint set. For a broad class of random projections, including those
based on various sub-Gaussian distributions as well as randomized Hadamard and
Fourier transforms, the data matrix defining the cost function can be projected

utilizes the $\delta$-complete decision procedure to solve reachability

potential or to be captured on an unstable bound orbit at the wormhole's
throat. These causal geodesics are visualized by embedding plots in Euclidean
space in cylindrical coordinates. For massless test scalar fields, we compute
transmission coefficients and quasi-normal modes for arbitrary coupling of the
field to the background geometry in the WKB approximation. We show that
solutions of the scalar wave equation on this class of wormholes are stable
only for certain values of the coupling constant. This analysis is interesting
since recent computations of self-interactions of a static scalar field in
wormhole space-times reveal some anomalous dependence on the coupling constant
such as the existence of an infinite discrete set of poles. We show that this
pathological behavior of the self-field is an artifact of computing the
interaction for values of the coupling constant that do not lie in the domain
of stability.

fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, when the

however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet, contourlet and
gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the
nonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of
sparsity, thus resulting in poor rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we
propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery via structural
group sparse representation (SGSR) modeling, which enforces image sparsity and
self-similarity simultaneously under a unified framework in an adaptive group
domain, thus greatly confining the CS solution space. In addition, an efficient
iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm based technique is developed to
solve the above optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the
novel CS recovery strategy achieves significant performance improvements over
the current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits nice convergence.

phases, short- and long-term recoveries. The main goal of the short-term
recovery is to bounce the damaged system back to the operating standards
enabling residents in damaged cities to survive, and fast supply with vital
resources to them is one of its important elements. We propose a general
principle by which the required redistribution of vital resources between the
affected and neighbouring cities can be efficiently implemented. The short-term
recovery is a rescuer operation where uncertainty in evaluating the state of
damaged region is highly probable. To allow for such an operation the developed
principle involves two basic components. The first one of ethic nature is the
triage concept determining the current city priority in the resource delivery.
The second one is the minimization of the delivery time subjected to this
priority. Finally a certain plan of the resource redistribution is generated
according to this principle. Several specific examples are studied numerically.
It elucidates, in particular, the effects of system characteristics such as the
city limit capacity in resource delivery, the type of initial resource
allocation among the cities, the number of cities able to participate in the
resource redistribution, and the damage level in the affected cities. As far as
the uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged region is concerned, some
specific cases were studied. It assumes the initial communication system has
crashed and formation of a new one and the resource redistribution proceed
synchronously. The obtained results enable us to consider the resource
redistribution plan governed by the proposed method semi-optimal and rather
efficient especially under uncertainty.

the CH was clearly destroyed by the intrusion. Brightenings appeared at the
boundaries and in the interior of the CH, meanwhile, its west boundaries began
to retreat and the area gradually shrank. It is noted that the CH went on
shrinking after the end of the intrusion and finally disappeared entirely.
Following the filament activation, three coronal dimmings (D1-D3) were formed,
among which D1 and D2 persisted throughout the complete disappearance of the
CH. The derived coronal magnetic configuration shows that the filament was
located below an extended loop system which obviously linked D1 to D2. By
comparison with this result of extrapolation, our observations imply that the

r-mode instability can lead to stellar differential rotation, which winds the

($\sim 10^{17}$ G) toroidal field component. Subsequently, by succumbing to the
Tayler instability, the toroidal field could be partially transformed into a
new poloidal field. Through such dynamo processes, the newly born neutron star
with sufficiently rapid rotation could become a magnetar on a timescale of
$\sim 10^{2-3}$ s, with a surface dipolar magnetic field of $\sim10^{15}$ G.
Accompanying the field amplification, the star could spin down to a period of
$\sim5$ ms through gravitational wave radiation due to the r-mode instability

two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) that is dual to black holes. We
start from the Cardy formula and get the CFT thermodynamics with minimal
reasonable assumptions. We use both the microcanonical ensemble and canonical
ensemble versions of the Cardy formula. In the black hole/CFT correspondence
the black hole is dual to a CFT with excitations, and the black hole mass $M$
and charge $N$ correspond to the energy and charge of the excited CFT. The CFT
left- and right-moving central charges $c_{L,R}$ should be quantized, and so we
assume that they are mass-independent. Also we assume the difference of the
left- and right-moving sector levels $N_L-N_R$ is mass-independent dual to
level matching condition. The thermodynamics of two-dimensional CFT we get is
universal and supports the thermodynamics method of black hole/CFT
correspondence.

We find remarkable similarities between the spectroscopic features attributable

pseudogap state in both systems include a weak absorption feature at about 500
cm-1 followed by a featureless continuum between 500 and 1500 cm-1 in the
conductivity data and a significant suppression in the scattering rate below
700 - 900 cm-1. The latter result allows us to identify the energy scale

materials the superconductivity-induced changes of the infrared spectra occur
in the frequency region below 100 - 200 cm-1, which is much lower than the
energy scale of the pseudogap. We performed theoretical analysis of the
scattering rate data of the two compounds using the same model which accounts
for the effects of the pseudogap and electron-boson coupling. We find that the
scattering rate suppression in Ba122-based compounds below $\Delta_{PG}$ is
solely due to the pseudogap formation whereas the impact of the electron-boson
coupling effects is limited to lower frequencies. The magnetic resonance modes
used as inputs in our modeling are found to evolve with the development of the
pseudogap, suggesting an intimate correlation between the pseudogap and

poses new challenges in statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a
semiparametric model named latent Gaussian copula model for binary and mixed

latent variable satisfying the Gaussian copula distribution or the
nonparanormal distribution. The latent Gaussian model with the assumption that
the latent variables are multivariate Gaussian is a special case of the

methods achieve the same rates of convergence for both precision matrix

observed. Under similar conditions, the consistency of graph structure recovery
and feature selection for leading eigenvectors is established. The performance
of the proposed methods is numerically assessed through simulation studies, and
the usage of our methods is illustrated by a genetic dataset.

on a smooth algebraic variety X have steadfastly resisted the efforts of

""linearization"" approach to this problem, focusing on the infinitesimal
structure of the Chow groups near their identity elements. This method was
adumbrated in recent work of Mark Green and Phillip Griffiths. Similar topics
have been explored by Bloch, Stienstra, Hesselholt, Van der Kallen, and others.
A famous formula of Bloch expresses the Chow groups as Zariski sheaf cohomology
groups of algebraic K-theory sheaves on X. ""Linearization"" of the Chow groups
is thereby related to ""linearization"" of algebraic K-theory, which may be
described in terms of negative cyclic homology. The ""proper formal
construction"" arising from this approach is a ""machine"" involving the coniveau
spectral sequences arising from four different generalized cohomology theories
on X, with the last two sequences connected by the algebraic Chern character.
Due to the critical role of the coniveau filtration, I refer to this
construction as the coniveau machine. The main theorem in this book establishes
the existence of the coniveau machine for algebraic K-theory on a smooth
algebraic variety. An immediate corollary is a new formula expressing
generalized tangent groups of Chow groups in terms of negative cyclic homology.

divides the population under study into compartments containing persons that
share the same status. Here we consider a three-state model with the
compartments: A, B and Dead. States A and B may be the states of any
dichotomous variable, for example, Healthy and Ill, respectively. The
transitions between the states are described by change rates (or synonymously:
densities), which depend on calendar time and on age. So far, a rigorous
mathematical calculation of the prevalence of property B has been difficult,
which has limited the use of the model in epidemiology and public health.
  Methods: We develop an equation that simplifies the use of the three-state
model. To demonstrate the broad applicability and the validity of the equation,
it is applied to simulated data and real world data from different
health-related topics.
  Results: The three-state model is governed by a partial differential equation
(PDE) that links the prevalence with the change rates between the states. The
validity of the PDE has been shown in two simulation studies, one about a
hypothetical chronic disease and one about dementia. In two further
applications, the equation may provide insights into smoking behaviour of males
in Germany and the knowledge about the ovulatory cycle in Egyptian women.
  Conclusions: We have found a simple equation that links the prevalence of a
dichotomous variable with the transmission rates in the three-state model. The
equation has a broad applicability in epidemiology and public health. Examples
are the estimation of incidence rates from cross-sectional surveys, the
prediction of the future prevalence of chronic diseases, and planning of
interventions against risky behaviour (e.g., smoking).

there are also far-from-CMC data sets that construct one-parameter families of

one-parameter families, they differ in important ways. Most significantly,

of this difficulty, we propose modifications of the conformal method that

of neutron stars are pulsars, whose magnetic field distribution peaks at $B
\sim 10^{12}$ G. If the neutron star magnetic field has at least this strength
at birth, it must decay considerably before jets can be launched in binary
systems. We study the magnetic field evolution of a neutron star that accretes
matter from the wind of a high-mass stellar companion so that we can constrain
the accretion rate and the impurities in the crust, which are necessary
conditions for jet formation. We solved the induction equation for the
diffusion and convection of the neutron star magnetic field confined to the
crust, assuming spherical accretion in a simpliflied one-dimensional treatment.
We incorporated state-of-the-art microphysics, including consistent thermal
evolution profiles, and assumed two different neutron star cooling scenarios
based on the superfluidity conditions at the core. We find that in this
scenario, magnetic field decay at long timescales is governed mainly by the
accretion rate, while the impurity content and thermal evolution of the neutron
star play a secondary role. For accretion rates $\dot{M}\gtrsim10^{-10}$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, surface magnetic fields can decay up to four orders of
magnitude in $\sim$10$^7$ yr, which is the timescale imposed by the evolution
of the high-mass stellar companion in these systems. Based on these results, we
discuss the possibility of transient jet-launching in strong wind-accreting
high-mass binary systems like supergiant fast X-ray transients.

dex) is found for the outer objects beyond 7 kpc independent of galactocentric
radius and compatible with the absence of a metallicity gradient confirming the
results of a recent investigation of interstellar medium HII region gas oxygen
abundances. The stellar metallicities are slightly higher than those from the
HII regions when based on measurements of the weak forbidden auroral oxygen

such a continuously driven system with an odd number of Floquet bands, the
bands are found to have nonzero Chern numbers in general and topological phase
transitions take place as we tune various system parameters, such as the
amplitude or the period of the driving field. The nontrivial Floquet band
topology results in a quantized transport of Wannier states in the lattice
space. For certain parameter choices, very flat yet topologically nontrivial
Floquet bands may also emerge, a feature that is potentially useful for the
simulation of physics of strongly correlated systems. Some cases with an even
number of Floquet bands may also have intriguing Dirac cones in the spectrum.
Under open boundary conditions, anomalous counter-propagating chiral edge modes
and degenerate zero modes are also found as the system parameters are tuned.
These results should be of experimental interest because a continuously driven
system is easier to realize than a periodically kicked system.

bursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations
containing two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected
by the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a
simple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations
useful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the
rho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium
state and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external
parameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our
work is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when
the source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean
count rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in
the count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution
that reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we
found that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.
Moreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to
those observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these
results, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state
transitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes
stronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple
relation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical
equations can be derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion
disks remains to be furtherly explored.

  Imaging",,,,,"physics.ins-det physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography(XFCT) is a prevalent experimental
technique which is utilized to investigate the spatial distribution of elements
in sample. The sensitivity of L-shell XFCT of some elements is lower than that
of K-shell XFCT. However, the image reconstruction for this technique has much
more problems than that of transmission tomography, one of which is
self-absorption. In the present work, a novel strategy was developed to deal
with such problems. But few researches are concerned on attenuation correction
of L-shell XFCT that are essential to get accurate reconstructed image. We make
use of the known quantities and the unknown elemental concentration of interest
to express the unknown attenuation maps. And then the attenuation maps are
added in the contribution value of the pixel in MLEM reconstruction method.
Results indicate that the relative error is less than 14.1%, which is proved
this method can correct L-shell XFCT very well.

"1404.7253","Christophe Raffalli","Christophe Raffalli (LAMA)","Distance to the discriminant",,,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We will study algebraic hyper-surfaces on the real unit sphere $\mathcal
S^{n-1}$ given by an homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n variables with the
view point, rarely exploited, of Euclidian geometry using Bombieri's scalar
product and norm. This view point is mostly present in works about the topology
of random hyper-surfaces \cite{ShubSmale93, GayetWelschinger14}. Our first
result (lemma \ref{distgen} page \pageref{distgen}) is a formula for the
distance $\dist(P,\Delta)$ of a polynomial to the {\em real discriminant}
$\Delta$, i.e. the set of polynomials with a real singularity on the sphere.
This formula is given for any distance coming from a scalar product on the
vector space of polynomials. Then, we concentrate on Bombieri scalar product
and its remarkable properties. For instance we establish a combinatoric formula
for the scalar product of two products of linear-forms (lemma
\ref{scalarlinear} page \pageref{scalarlinear}) which allows to give a (new ?)
proof of the invariance of Bombieri's norm by composition with the orthogonal
group. These properties yield a simple formula for the distance in theorem
\ref{bombineqdist} page \pageref{bombineqdist} from which we deduce the
following inequality: $$\dist(P, \Delta) \leq \min_{x \hbox{ critical point of
} P \hbox{ on } \mathcal S^{n-1}} |P(x)|$$ The definition \ref{maindef} page
\pageref{maindef} classifies in two categories the ways to make a polynomial
singular to realise the distance to the discriminant. Then, we show, in theorem
\ref{extremal} page \pageref{extremal}, that one of the category is forbidden
in the case of an {\em extremal} hyper-surfaces (i.e. with maximal Betti
numbers). This implies as a corollary \ref{bombeqdistbis} (page
\pageref{bombeqdistbis}) that the above inequality becomes an equality is that
case. The main result in this paper concerns extremal hyper-surfaces $P=0$ that
maximise the distance to the discriminant (with $\|P\| = 1$). They are very
remarkable objects which enjoy properties similar to those of quadratic forms:
they are linear combination of powers of linear forms $x \mapsto \langle x |
u_i \rangle^d$ where the vectors $u_i$ are the critical points of $P$ on
$\mathcal S^{n-1}$ corresponding to the least positive critical value of $|P|$.
This is corollary \ref{comblinbis} page \pageref{comblinbis} of a similar
theorem \ref{comblin} page \pageref{comblin} for all algebraic hyper-surfaces.
The next section is devoted to homogeneous polynomials in $2$ variables. We
prove that a polynomial of degree $d$ with $2d$ regularly spaced roots on the
unit circle is a local maximum of the distance to the discriminant among
polynomials with the same norm and number of roots. We conjecture that it is a
global maximum and that the polynomial of degree $d$ with $2r$ regularly spaced
roots on the unit circle is also a similar global maximum when $d < r \leq 2d$.
This claim is supported by the fact that we were able to prove the consequence
of this together with corollary \ref{comblinbis} which yields to interesting
trigonometric identities that we could not find somewhere else (proposition
\ref{trigo} page \pageref{trigo}). We also obtain metric information about
algebraic hyper-surfaces. First, in the case of extremal hyper-surface, we give
an upper bound (theorem \ref{bandwidth} page \pageref{bandwidth}) on the length
of an integral curve of the gradient of $P$ in the band where $|P|$ is less
that the least positive critical value of $|P|$. Then, a general lower bound on
the size and distance between the connected components of the zero locus of $P$
(corollary \ref{sphereinside} and theorem \ref{distancebetween}). The last
section will present experimental results among which are five extremal sextic
curves far from the discriminant. These are obtained by very long running
numerical optimisation (many months) some of which are not terminated.

on ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$ which play a key role in several heuristic qualitative and
quantitative approaches to describe the complex behavior of glassy dynamics.
With rate one and independently among the vertices of ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$, to each
occupation variable $\eta_x\in\{0,1\}$ a new value is proposed by tossing a
$(1-q)$-coin. If a certain local constraint is satisfied by the current
configuration the proposed move is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. For
$d=1$, the constraint requires that there is a vacancy at the vertex to the
left of the updating vertex. In this case, the process is the well-known East
process. On ${\mathbb{Z}}^2$, the West or the South neighbor of the updating
vertex must contain a vacancy, similarly, in higher dimensions. Despite of
their apparent simplicity, in the limit $q\searrow0$ of low vacancy density,
corresponding to a low temperature physical setting, these processes feature a
rather complicated dynamic behavior with hierarchical relaxation time scales,
heterogeneity and universality. Using renormalization group ideas, we first
show that the relaxation time on ${\mathbb{Z}}^d$ scales as the $1/d$-root of
the relaxation time of the East process, confirming indications coming from
massive numerical simulations. Next, we compute the relaxation time in finite
boxes by carefully analyzing the subtle energy-entropy competition, using a
multiscale analysis, capacity methods and an algorithmic construction. Our
results establish dynamic heterogeneity and a dramatic dependence on the
boundary conditions. Finally, we prove a rather strong anisotropy property of
these processes: the creation of a new vacancy at a vertex $x$ out of an
isolated one at the origin (a seed) may occur on (logarithmically) different
time scales which heavily depend not only on the $\ell_1$-norm of $x$ but also
on its direction.

Because the radiative process is not local and radiation from the interstellar
medium cannot be ignored, the local radiative cooling would not be balanced
with the viscous heating in a massive disk around a low mass star. In our
simulations, there are cases in which the disk does not fragment even though it
satisfies the fragmentation criterion based on disk cooling time ($Q \sim 1$

not sufficient condition for fragmentation. We determine the parameter range

of information is encoded into the binary projection (i.e. the sign) of such
increments. In this paper we provide further evidence of this by showing strong
nonlinear relations between binary and non-binary properties of financial time

We then introduce an information-theoretic approach to the analysis of the

maximum-entropy ensembles of binary matrices and their mapping to spin models

binary properties of real time series and identify the most informative

replicate, and mathematically characterize, the observed binary/non-binary

on the instantaneous aggregate return of a set of multiple time series, a
regime where the so-called `market mode' has an optimal interpretation in terms
of collective (endogenous) effects, a regime where it is parsimoniously
explained by pure noise, and a regime where it can be regarded as a combination

the two systems is that in the nanotube facile PT is facilitated by a favorable
prealignment of water molecules, whereas in bulk liquid water solvent
reorganization is required prior to PT. Configurations where the quantum excess
proton is delocalized over several adjacent water molecules along with
continuous interconversion between different hydration states reveals that, as
in liquid water, the hydrated proton under confinement is best described as a

Zundel, Eigen, or the so-called linear H7O3+ complex along the water chain.

proportional to the growth factor $D$ restricts the form of noise spectrum
through a 1-loop renormalization argument. For this choice, the SAM field
theory is renormalizable to one loop. We comment on the suitability of this

attitudinal dimensions, and we suppose that one dimension is important, the
other secondary. The dynamics are mainly ruled by the level of agreement on the
main dimension. If two individuals are close on the main dimension, then they
attract each other on the main and on the secondary dimensions, whatever their
disagreement on the secondary dimension. If they are far from each other on the
main dimension, then too much proximity on the secondary dimension is
uncomfortable, and generates rejection on this dimension. The proximity is
defined by comparing the opinion distance with a threshold called attraction
threshold on the main dimension and rejection threshold on the secondary
dimension. With such dynamics, a population with opinions initially uniformly
drawn evolves to a set of clusters, inside which secondary opinions fluctuate
more or less depending on threshold values. We observe that a low attraction
threshold favours fluctuations on the secondary dimension, especially when the
rejection threshold is high. The opinion evolutions of the model can be related
to some stylised facts.

communication between source-destination pairs to one path, when often better
alternatives exist. To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be
dampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to
mitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing
through an indirect-path via overlay peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in
overlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring both availability and
performance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive monitoring of all
overlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An alternate
technique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on physical
disjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently,
several techniques have emerged which can optimize the selection of a
disjoint-path without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths.
In this paper, we show that using only commodity approaches, i.e. running
infrequent traceroutes between overlay hosts, a lot of information can be
revealed about the underlying physical path diversity in the overlay network
which can be used to make informed-guesses for alternate-path selection. We

significant role in the determination of the ages of the different Galactic
stellar populations, when main sequence evolutionary tracks are employed. Here
we analyze the role that metallicity plays on the white dwarf luminosity
function of the Galactic disk, which is often used to determine its age. We
employ a Monte Carlo population synthesis code that accounts for the properties
of the population of Galactic disk white dwarfs. Our code incorporates the most
up-to-date evolutionary cooling sequences for white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich
and hydrogen-deficient atmospheres for both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon
cores. We use two different models to assess the evolution of the metallicity,
one in which the adopted metallicity is constant with time, but with a moderate
dispersion, and a second one in which the metallicity increases with time. We
found that our theoretical results are in a very satisfactory agreement with
the observational luminosity functions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and from the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS), independently of the
adopted age-metallicity law. In particular, we found that the age-metallicity
law has no noticeable impact in shaping the bright branch of the white dwarf
luminosity function, and that the position of its cut-off is almost insensitive
to the adopoted age-metallicity relationship. Because the shape of the bright
branch of the white dwarf luminosity function is insensitive to the
age-metallicity law, it can be safely employed to test the theoretical
evolutionary sequences, while due to the limited sensitivity of the position of
the drop-off to the distribution of metallicities, its location provides a
robust indicator of the age of the Galactic disk.

geometric origin of the type-C QPOs - for instance arising from relativistic
precession of the inner flow within a truncated disk - while the noise would
correspond to intrinsic brightness variability from mass accretion rate

stronger in low inclinations sources - supports the hypothesis that type-B QPOs

deletions and (2) answers problem specific queries. The time complexity of (1)
and (2) are referred to as the update time and the query time respectively.
There are many researches on dynamic graphs whose update time and query time
are $o(|G|)$, that is, sublinear in the graph size. However, almost all such
researches are for problems in P. In this paper, we investigate dynamic graphs
for NP-hard problems exploiting the notion of fixed parameter tractability
(FPT).
  We give dynamic graphs for Vertex Cover and Cluster Vertex Deletion
parameterized by the solution size $k$. These dynamic graphs achieve almost the
best possible update time $O(\mathrm{poly}(k)\log n)$ and the query time
$O(f(\mathrm{poly}(k),k))$, where $f(n,k)$ is the time complexity of any static
graph algorithm for the problems. We obtain these results by dynamically
maintaining an approximate solution which can be used to construct a small
problem kernel. Exploiting the dynamic graph for Cluster Vertex Deletion, as a
corollary, we obtain a quasilinear-time (polynomial) kernelization algorithm
for Cluster Vertex Deletion. Until now, only quadratic time kernelization
algorithms are known for this problem.
  We also give a dynamic graph for Chromatic Number parameterized by the
solution size of Cluster Vertex Deletion, and a dynamic graph for
bounded-degree Feedback Vertex Set parameterized by the solution size. Assuming
the parameter is a constant, each dynamic graph can be updated in $O(\log n)$

variation in the profiles of spectral lines. We studied the profile of a 585 nm
neon spectral line in the dusty structures. The structures levitated in a
positive column of a glow discharge at a pressure of 50-150 Pa and with a
current of 1-9 mA. We scanned the profile with the use of a Fabry-Perot

is resistant to a noise and a scanning speed instability. We have found an

trades with collateralization, counterparty credit gap risk, and funding costs,
following the approach first proposed by Pallavicini and co-authors in 2011.
Based on the risk-neutral pricing principle, we derive a general pricing
equation where Credit, Debit, Liquidity and Funding Valuation Adjustments (CVA,
DVA, LVA and FVA) are introduced by simply modifying the payout cash-flows of
the deal. Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the
bilateral nature of the deal price and render the valuation problem a
non-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive
adjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new
adjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address
double-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final
equations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and
variation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In
particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement
close-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation takes the form of a
backward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential
equation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by
least-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case
study involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes
for option pricing. Our numerical results confirm that funding risk has a
non-trivial impact on the deal price, and that double counting matters too. We
conclude the article with an analysis of large scale implications of
non-linearity of the pricing equations.

networks, and most of them are based on spin interaction models that produce a
consensus. In reality, however, many networks such as Twitter and the World
Wide Web are directed and are composed of both unidirectional and bidirectional
links. Moreover, from choosing a coffee brand to deciding who to vote for in an
election, two or more competing opinions often coexist. In response to this
ubiquity of directed networks and the coexistence of two or more opinions in
decision-making situations, we study a non-consensus opinion model introduced
by Shao et al. \cite{shao2009dynamic} on directed networks. We define
directionality $\xi$ as the percentage of unidirectional links in a network,
and we use the linear correlation coefficient $\rho$ between the indegree and
outdegree of a node to quantify the relation between the indegree and
outdegree. We introduce two degree-preserving rewiring approaches which allow
us to construct directed networks that can have a broad range of possible
combinations of directionality $\xi$ and linear correlation coefficient $\rho$
and to study how $\xi$ and $\rho$ impact opinion competitions. We find that, as
the directionality $\xi$ or the indegree and outdegree correlation $\rho$
increases, the majority opinion becomes more dominant and the minority
opinion's ability to survive is lowered.

forces via the addition of a mobility term to the flow field in the limit of
Stokes drag law. The former, non-divergence free term is responsible for
migration of particles towards the sharp microchannel junction corner, where
they can potentially accumulate. Experimental observations of particle trapping
for various applied electric fields and microparticle size are rationalized in

order for fluid dynamics to be applicable the microscopic and macroscopic
distance/time scales of the system have to be sufficiently separated. The
degree of separation is quantified by the ratio between these scales, usually
referred to as the Knudsen number. In this work, we calculate the Knudsen
numbers reached in fluid dynamical simulations of AA and pA collisions at RHIC

viscosity parametrizations, initial states and initialization times. We then
estimate the values of shear viscosity for which the fluid dynamical
description of ultrarelativistic AA and pA collisions breaks down. In
particular, we study how such values depend on the centrality, in the case of
AA collision, and multiplicity, in the case of pA collision. We found that the
maximum viscosity in AA collisions is of the order $\eta/s \sim 0.1 \ldots

simulations of heavy ion collisions. For pA collisions, we found that such

simultaneous presence of integrable boundaries and defects. The respective
sewing conditions as well as the relevant equations of motion on the defect
point are accordingly extracted. We consider a specific prototype i.e. the
vector non-linear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) model to exemplify our construction.
This model displays a highly non-trivial behavior and allows the existence of
two distinct types of boundary conditions based on the reflection algebra or
the twisted Yangian.

$[1,n]=\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a certain family of subsets of
$\mathbb{Z}^+$. When $\mathcal{F}$ is fixed to be the set of arithmetic
progressions, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers are called the van der
Waerden numbers.
  I started the project choosing $\mathcal{F}$ to be the set of
semi-progressions of scope $m$. A semi-progression of scope $m\in \mathbb{Z}^+$
is a set of integers $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k\}$ such that for some
$d\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $x_{i}-x_{i-1}\in\{d,2d,\ldots,md\}$ for all
$i\in\{2,3,\ldots,k\}$. The exact values of Ramsey-type functions corresponding
to semi-progressions are not known. We use $SP_m(k)$ to denote these numbers as
a Ramsey-type function of $k$ for a fixed scope $m$. During this project, I
used the probabilistic method to get an exponential lower bound for any fixed
$m$. The first chapter starts with a brief introduction to Ramsey theory and
then explains the problem considered. In the second chapter, I give the results
obtained on semi-progressions. In the third chapter, I will discuss the lower
bound obtained on $Q_1(k)$. When $\mathcal{F}$ is chosen to be
quasi-progressions of diameter $n$, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers
obtained are denoted as $Q_n(k)$. The last chapter gives an exposition of
advanced probabilistic techniques, in particular concentration inequalities and
how to apply them.

rejection of subjets that have no charged tracks from the leading vertex, a

at densities below the isostatic jamming density ($\phi_c$). It remains
unclear, however, how much friction affects this so-called shear-jamming.
Friction appears in two ways in this type of experiment: friction between
particles, and friction between particles and the base on which they rest.
Here, we study how particle-bottom friction, or basal friction, affects shear
jamming in quasi-two dimensional experiments. In order to study this issue
experimentally, we apply simple shear to a disordered packing of photoelastic
disks. We can tune the basal friction of the particles by immersing the
particles in a density matched liquid, thus removing the normal force, hence
the friction, between the particles and base. We record the overall shear
stress, and particle motion, and the photoelastic response of the particles. We
compare the shear response of dry and immersed samples, which enables us to
determine how basal friction affects shear jamming. Our findings indicate that
changing the basal friction shifts the point of shear jamming, but it does not
change the basic phenomenon of shear jamming.

built on sparse classification methods. CCS is a lightweight and flexible tool
that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently
in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for
text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this
important field. For a particular topic of interest (e.g., China or energy),
CSS automatically labels documents as being either on- or off-topic (usually
via keyword search), and then uses sparse classification methods to predict
these labels with the high-dimensional counts of all the other words and
phrases in the documents. The resulting small set of phrases found as
predictive are then harvested as the summary. To validate our tool, we, using
news articles from the New York Times international section, designed and
conducted a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human
understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media
analysis of the framing of ""Egypt"" in the New York Times throughout the Arab

bulk kinetic energy. (ii) At large inflow electron magnetization ($\sigma_e >

thermal inertia. It challenges the thermal-inertia-paradigm and its
implications. (iii) The inflows feature sharp transitions at the entrance of
the diffusion zones. These are not shocks but results from particle ballistic
motions, all bouncing at the same location, provided that the thermal velocity
in the inflow is far smaller than the inflow E cross B bulk velocity. (iv)
Island centers are magnetically isolated from the rest of the flow, and can
present a density depletion at their center. (v) The reconnection rates are
slightly larger than in non-relativistic studies. They are best normalized by
the inflow relativistic Alfv\'en speed projected in the outflow direction,

  Feedback Scenarios","17 pages, 19 figures Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu1376",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  The disparity between the density profiles of galactic dark matter haloes
predicted by dark matter only cosmological simulations and those inferred from
rotation curve decomposition, the so-called cusp-core problem, suggests that
baryonic physics has an impact on dark matter density in the central regions of
galaxies. Feedback from black holes, supernovae and massive stars may each play
a role by removing matter from the centre of the galaxy on shorter timescales
than the dynamical time of the dark matter halo. Our goal in this paper is to
determine constraints on such feedback scenarios based on the observed
properties of a set of nearby galaxies.
  Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of galactic rotation curves,
via a method developed in a previous paper, we constrain density profiles and
an estimated minimum radius for baryon influence, $r_1$, which we couple with a
feedback model to give an estimate of the fraction of matter within that radius
that must be expelled to produce the presently observed halo profile. We show
that in the case of the gas rich dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154, an outflow
from a central source (e.g. a black hole or star forming region) could produce
sufficient feedback on the halo without removing the disk gas.
  We examine the rotation curves of 8 galaxies taken from the THINGS data set
and determine constraints on the radial density profiles of their dark matter
haloes. For some of the galaxies, both cored haloes and cosmological $\rho
\propto r^{-1}$ cusps are excluded. These intermediate central slopes require
baryonic feedback to be finely tuned. We also find for galaxies which exhibit
extended cores in their haloes (e.g. NGC 925), the use of a split power-law
halo profile yields models without the unphysical, sharp features seen in
models based on the Einasto profile.

Hya (1.9-2.47 microm) with the VLTI/AMBER instrument at medium spectral
resolution. To obtain the fundamental parameters, we compared our data with
hydrostatic atmosphere models (PHOENIX).
  We estimated the Rosseland angular diameters of epsilon Oct, beta Peg, NU
Pav, psi Peg, and gamma Hya. Together with distances and bolometric fluxes, we
estimated radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities of our targets. In
the beta Peg visibility, we observed a molecular layer of CO with a size
similar to that modeled with PHOENIX. However, there is an additional slope in
absorption starting around 2.3 microm. This slope is possibly due to a shell of
water that is not modeled with PHOENIX. The visibility of psi Peg shows a low
increase in the CO bands, compatible with the modeling of the PHOENIX model.
The visibility data of the other sources show no increase in molecular bands.
  The spectra and visibilities predicted by the PHOENIX atmospheres agree with
the spectra and the visibilities observed in our stars (except for beta Peg).
This indicates that the opacity of the molecular bands is adequately included
in the model, and the atmospheres of our targets have an extension similar to
the modeled atmospheres. The atmosphere of beta Peg is more extended than that
predicted by the model. The targets are located close to the red limits of the
evolutionary tracks of the STAREVOL model.

concentrate light to the origin of the perturbation, where the permittivity
varied spontaneously. We demonstrate dynamic light focusing onto moving targets

of their ground states. Stabilised by competing interactions, a rich diversity

lattice geometry provide a fruitful source of emergent phenomena, such as
fractionalised excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. The degeneracy
inherent in frustrated systems may prevail all the way down to absolute zero
temperature, or it may be lifted by small perturbations or entropic effects. In
the geometrically frustrated Ising--like magnet Ca3Co2O6, we follow the
temporal and spatial evolution of nanoscale magnetic fluctuations firmly

opportunistic inter-agent communication to achieve dynamic average consensus.
In our solutions each agent is endowed with a local criterion that enables it
to determine whether to broadcast its state to its neighbors. Our starting
point is a continuous-time distributed coordination strategy that, under
continuous-time communication, achieves practical asymptotic tracking of the
dynamic average of the time-varying agents' reference inputs. Then, for this
algorithm, depending on the directed or undirected nature of the time-varying
interactions and under suitable connectivity conditions, we propose two
different distributed event-triggered communication laws that prescribe agent
communications at discrete time instants in an opportunistic fashion. In both
cases, we establish positive lower bounds on the inter-event times of each
agent and characterize their dependence on the algorithm design parameters.
This analysis allows us to rule out the presence of Zeno behavior and
characterize the asymptotic correctness of the resulting implementations.
Several simulations illustrate the results.

find that for static extradimension, the solution is equivalent to the standard
cosmology with stiff matter. For a general case of pure free scalar field with
NMDC, we find that the de Sitter solution is the solution of our model. For

can steer electromagnetic fields so as to prevent waves from penetrating into
the {\em cloaked region} (denoted by $\Omega_0$, where the objects inside are
invisible to observers outside). The ideal circular and elliptic cylindrical
cloaked regions are blown up from a point and a line segment, respectively, so
the transformed material parameters and the corresponding coefficients of the
resulted equations are highly singular at the cloaking boundary $\partial
\Omega_0$. The electric field or magnetic field is not continuous across
$\partial\Omega_0.$ The imposition of appropriate {\em cloaking boundary
conditions} (CBCs) to achieve perfect concealment is a crucial but challenging
issue.
  Based upon the principle that finite electromagnetic fields in the original
space must be finite in the transformed space as well, we obtain CBCs that
intrinsically relate to the essential ""pole"" conditions of a singular
transformation. We also find that for the elliptic cylindrical cloak, the CBCs
should be imposed differently for the cosine-elliptic and sine-elliptic
components of the decomposed fields. With these at our disposal, we can
rigorously show that the governing equation in $\Omega_0$ can be decoupled from
the exterior region $\Omega_0^c$, and the total fields in the cloaked region
vanish. We emphasize that our proposal of CBCs is different from any existing
ones.

lives, and yet most of us receive handwritten prescriptions when we visit our
doctors and rely on paper-based medical records in our healthcare. Although
electronic health record (EHR) systems have long been promoted as a
cost-effective and efficient alternative to this situation, clear-cut evidence
of their success has not been forthcoming. An examination of some of the
underlying problems that prevent EHR systems from delivering the benefits that
their proponents tout identifies four broad objectives - reducing cost,
reducing errors, improving coordination and improving adherence to standards -
and shows that they are not always met. The three possible causes for this
failure to deliver involve problems with the codification of knowledge, group
and tacit knowledge, and coordination and communication. There is, however,
reason to be optimistic that EHR systems can fulfil a healthy part, if not all,
of their potential.

algorithmic parallelism to that inherent in the hardware. From an application
developer's perspective, it is also important that code can be maintained in a
portable manner across a range of hardware. Here we present targetDP (target
Data Parallel), a lightweight programming layer that allows the abstraction of
data parallelism for applications that employ structured grids. A single source
code may be used to target both thread level parallelism (TLP) and instruction
level parallelism (ILP) on either SIMD multi-core CPUs or GPU-accelerated
platforms. targetDP is implemented via standard C preprocessor macros and
library functions, can be added to existing applications incrementally, and can
be combined with higher-level paradigms such as MPI. We present CPU and GPU
performance results for a benchmark taken from the lattice Boltzmann
application that motivated this work. These demonstrate not only performance
portability, but also the optimisation resulting from the intelligent exposure
of ILP.
