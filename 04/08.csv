excess B-mode power observed by the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
Polarization (BICEP2) experiment is almost twice as large as the 95% CL upper
limits derived from temperature measurements of the WMAP (r<0.13) and Planck
(r<0.11) space missions. Very recently, it was suggested that additional
relativistic degrees of freedom beyond the three active neutrinos and photons
can help to relieve this tension: the data favor an effective number of light
neutrino species N_{eff} = 3.86 \pm 0.25. Since the BICEP2 ratio implies the
energy scale of inflation (V_*^{1/4} \sim 2 \times 10^{16} GeV) is comparable
to the grand unification scale, in this paper we investigate whether we can
accommodate the required N_{eff} with three right-handed (partners of the
left-handed standard model) neutrinos living in the fundamental representation
of a grand unified exceptional E_6 group. We show that the superweak
interactions of these Dirac states (through their coupling to a TeV-scale Z'
gauge boson) lead to decoupling of right-handed neutrino just above the QCD
cross over transition: 175 MeV < T_{\nu_R}^{dec} < 250 MeV. For decoupling in
this transition region, the contribution of the three right-handed neutrinos to
N_{eff} is suppressed by heating of the left-handed neutrinos (and photons).
Consistency (within 1\sigma) with the favored N_{eff} is achieved for 4.5 TeV <
M_{Z'} < 7.5 TeV. The model is fully predictive and can be confronted with
future data from LHC14.

overhead when managing contiguous blocks of memory using the explicit, dynamic

is that temporal and spatial overhead can be bounded, related, and predicted in
constant time through the notion of partial and incremental compaction. Partial
compaction determines the maximally tolerated degree of memory fragmentation.
Incremental compaction of objects, introduced here, determines the maximal
amount of memory involved in any, logically atomic, portion of a compaction
operation. We explore CF's potential application space on (1) multiprocessor
and multicore systems as well as on (2) memory-constrained uniprocessor
systems. For (1), we argue that little or no compaction is likely to avoid the
worst case in temporal as well as spatial overhead but also observe that
scalability only improves by a constant factor. Scalability can be further
improved significantly by reducing overall data sharing through separate
instances of Compact-fit. For (2), we observe that incremental compaction can
effectively trade-off throughput and memory fragmentation for lower latency.

Coupling F-term hybrid inflation to soft supersymmetry breaking distorts the
rotational invariance in the complex inflaton plane---an important fact, which
has been neglected in all previous studies. Based on the delta-N formalism, we
analyze the cosmological perturbations for the first time in the full two-field

inflation. As a consequence of the two-field nature of hybrid inflation, the
predictions for the primordial fluctuations depend not only on the parameters
of the Lagrangian, but are eventually fixed by the choice of the inflationary
trajectory. Recognizing hybrid inflation as a two-field model resolves two
shortcomings often times attributed to it: The fine-tuning problem of the
initial conditions is greatly relaxed and a spectral index in accordance with
the PLANCK data can be achieved in a large part of the parameter space without
the aid of supergravity corrections. Our analysis can be easily generalized to
other (including large-field) scenarios of inflation in which soft
supersymmetry breaking transforms an initially single-field model into a

introduced in order to explain the most energetic gamma ray bursts (GRBs),

to the concept of binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) originating in a tight
binary system composed by a FeCO core on the verge of a SN explosion and a
companion neutron star (NS). Their evolution is characterized by a rapid
sequence of events: [...]. AIMS: We investigate whether GRB 090423, one of the
farthest observed GRB at z=8.2, is a member of the BdHN family. METHODS: We
compare and contrast the spectra, the luminosity evolution and the
detectability in the observations by Swift of GRB 090423 with the corresponding
ones of the best known BdHN case, GRB 090618. RESULTS: Identification of
constant slope power-law behavior in the late X-ray emission of GRB 090423 and
its overlapping with the corresponding one in GRB 090618, measured in a common
rest frame, represents the main result of this article. This result represents
a very significant step on the way to using the scaling law properties, proven
in Episode 3 of this BdHN family, as a cosmological standard candle.
CONCLUSIONS: Having identified GRB 090423 as a member of the BdHN family, we
can conclude that SN events, leading to NS formation, can already occur already
at z=8.2, namely at 650 Myr after the Big Bang. It is then possible that these
BdHNe originate stem from 40-60 M_{\odot} binaries. They are probing the
Population II stars after the completion and possible disappearance of
Population III stars.

existence of a ""firewall"" at the event horizon that may incinerate an infalling

detects nothing special in the vicinity of the horizon. The behavior of
Karlhede's invariant raises the possibility that the event horizon is a real

manner. Although centralization is a convenient way for implementing OSNs, it
has several well known drawbacks. Chief among them are the risks they pose to
the security and privacy of the information maintained by the OSN; and the loss
of control over the information contributed by individual members.
  These concerns prompted several attempts to create decentralized OSNs, or
DOSNs. The basic idea underlying these attempts, is that each member of a
social network keeps its data under its own control, instead of surrendering it
to a central host; providing access to it to other members of the OSN according
to its own access-control policy. Unfortunately all existing DOSN projects have
a very serious limitation. Namely, they are unable to subject the membership of
a DOSN, and the interaction between its members, to any global policy.
  We adopt the decentralization idea underlying DOSNs, complementing it with a
means for specifying and enforcing a wide range of policies over the membership
of a social community, and over the interaction between its disparate
distributed members. And we do so in a scalable fashion.

The broad class of granular and particulate materials is immune from the

invalidates the fundamental postulates of equilibrium statistical mechanics.
However, granular materials exhibit distributions of microscopic quantities

explore the history of statistical ensemble ideas in the context of granular

of sources that are too faint to be detected individually in surveys of
polarized radio sources. Stacking offers not only high sensitivity to the
median signal of a class of radio sources, but also avoids a detection
threshold in polarized intensity, and therefore an arbitrary exclusion of
source with a low percentage of polarization. Correction for polarization bias
is done through a Monte Carlo analysis and tested on a simulated survey. We
show that the non-linear relation between the real polarized signal and the
detected signal requires knowledge of the shape of the distribution of
fractional polarization, which we constrain using the ratio of the upper
quartile to the lower quartile of the distribution of stacked polarized
intensities. Stacking polarized intensity for NVSS sources down to the
detection limit in Stokes I, we find a gradual increase in median fractional
polarization that is consistent with a trend that was noticed before for bright
NVSS sources, but is much more gradual than found by previous deep surveys of
radio polarization. Consequently, the polarized radio source counts derived
from our stacking experiment predict fewer polarized radio sources for future
surveys with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders.

as a function of the number of participating nucleons. In the Cu-going

non-gyrotropic beam generates freely escaping electromagnetic radiation with
properties similar to the Type-III solar radio bursts. In this study the
backwards propagating wave component evident in the perpendicular components of
the elecromagnetic field in such a system is presented for the first time.
Background magnetic field strength in the system is varied in order to prove
that the backwards propagating wave's frequency, prescribed by the whistler
wave dispersion relation, is proportional to the specified magnetic field.
Moreover, the identified whistlers are shown to be generated by the normal
Doppler-shifted relativistic resonance. Large fraction of the energy of the
perpendicular electromagnetic field components is found to be carried away by
the whistler waves, while a small but sufficient fraction is going into L- and
R- electromagnetic modes.

suited to measurements in the anti-Jovian hemisphere that shadows Jupiter's
strong decametric emission. The passive nature of this technique also serves as

automated processing pipeline keeps pace with observations to produce
observable quantities, including the photospheric vector magnetic field, from
sequences of filtergrams. The primary 720s observables were released in mid
2010, including Stokes polarization parameters measured at six wavelengths as
well as intensity, Doppler velocity, and the line-of-sight magnetic field. More
advanced products, including the full vector magnetic field, are now available.
Automatically identified HMI Active Region Patches (HARPs) track the location
and shape of magnetic regions throughout their lifetime.
  The vector field is computed using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes
Vector (VFISV) code optimized for the HMI pipeline; the remaining 180 degree
azimuth ambiguity is resolved with the Minimum Energy (ME0) code. The
Milne-Eddington inversion is performed on all full-disk HMI observations. The
disambiguation, until recently run only on HARP regions, is now implemented for
the full disk. Vector and scalar quantities in the patches are used to derive
active region indices potentially useful for forecasting; the data maps and
indices are collected in the SHARP data series, hmi.sharp_720s. Patches are
provided in both CCD and heliographic coordinates.
  HMI provides continuous coverage of the vector field, but has modest spatial,
spectral, and temporal resolution. Coupled with limitations of the analysis and
interpretation techniques, effects of the orbital velocity, and instrument
performance, the resulting measurements have a certain dynamic range and
sensitivity and are subject to systematic errors and uncertainties that are
characterized in this report.

$\alpha$ and $\beta,$ it is required that $\alpha,\beta>0.$ In this paper, we

A Simple, Universal Model for Energy Disaggregation","12 pages, 5 figures, and 4 tables",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy disaggregation is to discover the energy consumption of individual
appliances from their aggregated energy values. To solve the problem, most
existing approaches rely on either appliances' signatures or their state
transition patterns, both hard to obtain in practice. Aiming at developing a
simple, universal model that works without depending on sophisticated machine
learning techniques or auxiliary equipments, we make use of easily accessible
knowledge of appliances and the sparsity of the switching events to design a
Sparse Switching Event Recovering (SSER) method. By minimizing the total
variation (TV) of the (sparse) event matrix, SSER can effectively recover the
individual energy consumption values from the aggregated ones. To speed up the
process, a Parallel Local Optimization Algorithm (PLOA) is proposed to solve
the problem in active epochs of appliance activities in parallel. Using
real-world trace data, we compare the performance of our method with that of
the state-of-the-art solutions, including Least Square Estimation (LSE) and
iterative Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The results show that our approach has an
overall higher detection accuracy and a smaller overhead.

modeling. Inspired by the economic litterature, it provides a financial
interpretation of the Ramsey rule that links discount rate and marginal utility

possibility of adjusting preferences to new economic information is crucial.
Thus, after recalling some important properties on progressive utility, this
paper first provides an extension of the notion of a consistent progressive
utility to a consistent pair of progressive utilities of investment and
consumption. An optimality condition is that the utility from the wealth
satisfies a second order SPDE of HJB type involving the Fenchel-Legendre
transform of the utility from consumption. This SPDE is solved in order to give
a full characterization of this class of consistent progressive pair of
utilities. An application of this results is to revisit the classical backward

photoelectrons. However the APECS method alone cannot eliminate the background
due to valence band photoemission processes in which the initial photon energy
is shared by two or more electrons and one of the electrons is in the energy
range of the core level photoemission peak. Here we describe an experimental
method to determine the contributions from these background processes and apply
this method in the case of Copper M3VV Auger spectrum obtained in coincidence
with the 3p3/2 photoemission peak. A beam of 200 eV photons was incident on a
Cu(100) sample and a series of coincidence measurements were performed using a
spectrometer equipped with two cylindrical mirror analyzers (CMAs). One CMA was
set at series of fixed energies that ranged between the energy of the core and
the VB peaks. The other CMA was scanned over a range corresponding to electrons
leaving the surface between 0eV and 70eV. The set of measured spectra were then
fit to a parameterized function which was extrapolated to determine the
background in the APECS spectra due to multi-electron and inelastic VB
photoemission processes. The extrapolated background was subtracted from the
APECS spectrum to obtain the spectrum of electrons emitted solely as the result
of the Auger process. A comparison of the coincidence spectrum with the same
spectrum with background removed shows that in the case of Cu M3VV the
background due to the inelastic scattering of VB electrons is negligible in the
region of the Auger peak but is more than half the total signal down in the low
energy tail of the Auger peak.

The Ionel-Parker formula contains two unique features, rim tori refinements of
relative invariants and the so-called S-matrix, which have been a mystery in
GW-theory over the past decade. We explain why the latter, which appears due to
imprecise reasoning, should not be present and how the former should be
interpreted. While the gluing argument in the IP work attempts to address all
of the issues relevant to certain ""semi-positive"" cases, it contains several
highly technical, but crucial, mistakes, which invalidate it and thus the whole
paper almost completely. The SFT type idea behind the Li-Ruan approach has the
potential of avoiding many issues with the degeneration of the metric on the
target occurring in the IP approach. Unfortunately, the LR paper is vague about
the key notions and aspects of the setup, including the definition of relative
stable maps, and does not contain even a description of the local structure of
the relative moduli space or an attempt at a complete proof of any major
statement. The only technical arguments in this paper concern fairly minor
points and are either incorrect or unnecessary. Neither of the two papers even
considers gluing stable maps with extra rubber structure, which is necessary
for defining the relevant invariants outside of a relatively narrow collection
of ""semi-positive"" cases. In this manuscript, we re-formulate the (numerical)
symplectic sum formula, describe the issues arising in both approaches, and

performing a four-dimensional fit of the decay amplitude, using $pp$ collision
data corresponding to $\rm 3 fb^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb detector. The
data cannot be described with $K^+\pi^-$ resonances alone, which is confirmed
with a model-independent approach. A highly significant
$Z(4430)^-\to\psi'\pi^-$ component is required, thus confirming the existence
of this state. The observed evolution of the $Z(4430)^-$ amplitude with the

determined unambiguously to be $1^+$.

the main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined
notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as
principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the
objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other.
In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where
related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also
visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit
representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques,
characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information:
node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these
three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different
tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based
tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links
and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and
accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not
negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group
diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions
contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings.
Taken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the
design of standard and domain specific visualizations tools.

curves modeling. It is inspired by the Ramsey rule of the economic literature,
that links discount rate and marginal utility of aggregate optimal consumption.
For such a long maturity modelization, the possibility of adjusting preferences
to new economic information is crucial, justifying the use of progressive
utility. This paper studies, in a framework with affine factors, the yield
curve given from the Ramsey rule. It first characterizes consistent progressive
utility of investment and consumption, given the optimal wealth and consumption
processes. A special attention is paid to utilities associated with linear
optimal processes with respect to their initial conditions, which is for
example the case of power progressive utilities. Those utilities are the basis
point to construct other progressive utilities generating non linear optimal
processes but leading yet to still tractable computations. This is of
particular interest to study the impact of initial wealth on yield curves.

interesting given the current experimental results. A SUSY scale above the weak

decays populate the dark matter (DM) particles. In the mini-split scenario with
gravitino at about the PeV scale and the lightest TeV scale neutralino being (a
component of) DM, the requirement that the DM relic abundance resulting from
gravitino decays does not overclose the Universe and satisfies the indirect
detection constraints demand the reheating temperature to be below 10^9 -
10^{10} GeV. On the other hand, the BICEP2 result prefers a heavy inflaton with
mass at around 10^{13} GeV and a reheating temperature at or above 10^9 GeV
with some general assumptions. The mild tension could be alleviated if SUSY
scale is even higher with the gravitino mass above the PeV scale. Intriguingly,
in no-scale supergravity, gravitinos could be very heavy at about 10^{13} GeV,
the inflaton mass scale, while gauginos could still be light at the TeV scale.

benefit from new observational constraints and, in turn, improve

also measure detailed abundance ratios for a number of light, alpha, Fe-peak
and n-capture elements. We find low metallicities of [Fe/H]=-2.0 and -2.1 for
the WLM GC and the GC IKN-5, respectively. We estimate that 17%-31% of the
metal-poor stars in WLM belong to the GC, and IKN-5 may even contain a similar
number of metal-poor stars as the whole of the IKN dwarf itself. These high
ratios of metal-poor GCs to field stars are in tension with GC formation
scenarios that require GCs to have lost a very large fraction of their initial
mass. The GCs in the WLM and IKN dwarf galaxies resemble those in the Fornax
dSph by being significantly more metal-poor than a typical halo GC in the Milky
Way and other large galaxies. They are also substantially more metal-poor than
the bulk of the field stars in their parent galaxies. The overall abundance
patterns in the WLM GC are similar to those observed for GCs in the Fornax
dSph: [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] are super-Solar at about +0.3 dex, while [Mg/Fe] is
less elevated than [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe]. The [Na/Fe] ratio is similar to the
averaged [Na/Fe] ratios in Milky Way GCs, but higher than those of Milky Way
halo stars. Fe-peak (Mn, Sc, Cr) and heavy elements (Ba, Y, La) generally
follow the trends seen in the Milky Way halo. The relatively high Na abundance
in the WLM GC suggests that the [Na/O] anti-correlation is present in this
cluster.

may have a holographic interpretation for suitable chosen gauge groups and
boundary conditions on the fields. Conformal Chern-Simons gravity is a
topological model of 3-dimensional gravity that exhibits Weyl invariance and
allows various holographic descriptions, including Anti-de Sitter, Lobachevsky
and flat space holography. The same model also allows to address some aspects
that arise in higher spin gravity in a considerably simplified setup, since
both types of models have gauge symmetries other than diffeomorphisms. In these
lectures we summarize briefly recent results.

all types of galaxies with a new calibration of galaxy halo masses based
entirely on weak lensing. Correlating these two sets of data, we find that the
mass ratio $\eta \equiv M_{GCS}/M_{h}$ (total mass in globular clusters,
divided by halo mass) is essentially constant at $\langle \eta \rangle \sim 4
\times 10^{-5}$, strongly confirming earlier suggestions in the literature.
Globular clusters are the only known stellar population that formed in
essentially direct proportion to host galaxy halo mass. The intrinsic scatter
in $\eta$ appears to be at most 0.2 dex; we argue that some of this scatter is
due to differing degrees of tidal stripping of the globular cluster systems
between central and satellite galaxies. We suggest that this correlation can be
understood if most globular clusters form at very early stages in galaxy
evolution, largely avoiding the feedback processes that inhibited the bulk of
field-star formation in their host galaxies. The actual mean value of $\eta$
also suggests that about $1/4$ of the \emph{initial} gas mass present in
protogalaxies collected into GMCs large enough to form massive, dense star
clusters. Finally, our calibration of $\langle \eta \rangle$ indicates that the
halo masses of the Milky Way and M31 are $(1.2\pm0.5)\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$
and $(3.9\pm1.8)\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ respectively.

seeing on NLR size measurements and conclude that direct measurements of the
NLR size from observed profiles are too large by 0.1 - 0.2 dex on average, as
compared to measurements made to best-fit S\'{e}rsic or Voigt profiles
convolved with the seeing. These data, which span a full order of magnitude in
IR luminosity ($\log{(L_{8 \mu \mathrm{m}} / \mathrm{erg\, s}^{-1})} = 44.4 -
45.4$) also provide strong evidence that there is a flattening of the
relationship between NLR size and AGN luminosity at a seeing-corrected size of
$\sim 7$ kpc. The objects in this sample have high luminosities which place
them in a previously under-explored portion of the size-luminosity
relationship. These results support the existence of a maximal size of the
narrow-line region around luminous quasars; beyond this size either there is
not enough gas, or the gas is over-ionized and does not produce enough

We study the decays $A\rightarrow HZ$ or $H\rightarrow AZ$, which could reach
sizable branching fractions in certain parameter regions. With detailed
collider analysis, we obtain model independent exclusion bounds as well as
discovery reach at the 14 TeV LHC for the process: $gg\rightarrow
A/H\rightarrow HZ/AZ$, looking at final states bbll, \tau\tau ll and ZZZ(4l2j)
for l =e,\mu. We further interpret these bounds in the context of the Type II
Two Higgs Doublet Model, considering three different classes of processes:
$A\rightarrow h^0Z$, $A\rightarrow H^0Z$, and $H^0 \rightarrow AZ$, in which
$h^0$ and $H^0$ are the light and heavy CP-even Higgses respectively. For 100
fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC, we find that for parent
particle mass around 300-400 GeV, $A\rightarrow h^0Z$ has the greatest reach
when $H^0$ is interpreted as the 126 GeV Higgs: most regions in the
tan\beta-sin(\beta-\alpha) parameter space can be covered by exclusion and
discovery. For 126 GeV $h^0$, only relatively small tan\beta<10 (5) can be
reached by exclusion (discovery). For $A\rightarrow H^0Z$, the reach is
typically restricted to sin$(\beta-\alpha)\sim\pm 1$ with tan\beta <10 in bbll
and \tau\tau ll channels. The ZZZ (4l2j) channel, on the other hand, covers a
wide range of 0.3<|sin(\beta-\alpha)|<1 for tan\beta<4. $H^0\rightarrow AZ$
typically favors negative values of sin(\beta-\alpha), with exclusion/discovery
reach possibly extending to all values of tan\beta. A study of exotic decays of
extra Higgses would extend the reach at the LHC and provides nice
complementarity to conventional Higgs search channels.

the two principle routes to turbulent angular momentum transport in accretion
disks. Protoplanetary disks may develop both. This paper aims to reinvigorate
interest in the study of magnetized massive protoplanetary disks, starting from
the basic issue of stability. The local linear stability of a self-gravitating,
uniformly magnetized, differentially rotating, three-dimensional stratified
disk subject to axisymmetric perturbations is calculated numerically. The
formulation includes resistivity. It is found that the reduction in the disk
thickness by self-gravity can decrease MRI growth rates; the MRI becomes global
in the vertical direction, and MRI modes with small radial length scales are
stabilized. The maximum vertical field strength that permits the MRI in a
strongly self-gravitating polytropic disk with polytropic index $\Gamma=1$ is
estimated to be $B_{z,\mathrm{max}} \simeq c_{s0}\Omega\sqrt{\mu_0/16\pi G} $,
where $c_{s0}$ is the midplane sound speed and $\Omega$ is the angular
velocity. In massive disks with layered resistivity, the MRI is not
well-localized to regions where the Elsasser number exceeds unity. For MRI
modes with radial length scales on the order of the disk thickness,
self-gravity can enhance density perturbations, an effect that becomes
significant in the presence of a strong toroidal field, and which depends on
the symmetry of the underlying MRI mode. In gravitationally unstable disks
where GI and MRI growth rates are comparable, the character of unstable modes
can transition smoothly between MRI and GI. Implications for non-linear
simulations are discussed briefly.

the dynamics of outgassing, tidal disruption or other processes which act on
orbital timescales and are assumed to follow Newtonian gravity. By obtaining
and analysing the unaveraged equations of motion in orbital elements due to the
dominant post-Newtonian contribution (1PN), I derive a simple analytic
expression for the maximum deviation in terms of only the stellar mass and
eccentricity of the orbit. This relation can be used to assess the potential
importance of including short-period relativistic terms in models containing
comets, asteroids or planets, and help determine the level of precision needed
in numerical integrations. The magnitude of the deviation in systems with
Solar-like stars is typically comparable to the size of comet nuclei, and the
direction of the deviation is determined by the eccentricity. I show that for
eccentricities above a critical value of approximately 0.359, the direction is

The line ratio is better correlated with H{\alpha} intensity than with height

systematically with electron density. We argue that the variation of the line

that include both the hydrodynamical evolution of the discs around their natal
stars, as well as the dynamics of the stars themselves. The discs are viscously
evolving, accreting mass onto the central star and spreading. We find
penetrating encounters to be very destructive for the discs as in previous
studies, although the frequency of such encounters is low. We also find,
however, that encounter influence the disc radii more strongly than other disc
properties such as the disc mass. The disc sizes are set by the competition
between viscous spreading and the disruptive effect of encounters. As discs
spread, encounters become more and more important. In the regime of rapid
spreading encounters simply truncate the discs, stripping the outer portions.
In the opposite regime, we find that the effect of many distant encounters is
able to limit the disc size. Finally, we predict from our simulations that disc
sizes are limited by encounters at stellar densities exceeding $\sim 2-3 \times

the phase transitions of two-dimensional ferromagnetic models with single-ion
anisotropy at zero and finite temperatures. The Hamiltonian is given by
$H=\sum_{i\neq j} J_{ij}(S_i^xS_j^x+S_i^yS_j^y+\lambda
S_i^zS_j^z)+D\sum_{i}(S_i^z)^2$, where $J_{ij}=-J |r_j-r_i|^{-p}$ ($p\geq 3$)
is a long-range ferromagnetic interaction ($J>0$), $0\leq \lambda\leq 1$ is an
anisotropic constant and $D$ is the single-ion anisotropic constant. It is
well-known that the single-ion anisotropy $D$ creates a competition between an
ordered state (favored by the exchange interaction) and a disordered state,
even at zero temperature. For small values of $D$, the system has a spontaneous
magnetization $m_z\neq 0$, while in the large-D phase $m_z=0$ because a state
with $\langle S^z\rangle\neq 0$ is energetically unfavorable. Therefore, a
phase transition due to quantum fluctuations occurs in some critical value
$D_c$. For systems with short-range interaction $D_c\approx 6J$, depending of
$\lambda$ constant, but in our model we have found larger values of $D$ due to
the higher cost to flip a spin. Since low-dimensional magnetic systems with
long range interaction can be ordered at finite temperature, we also have
analyzed the thermal phase transitions (similar to the BKT transition). The
model has been studied by using a Schwinger boson formalism as well as the
Self-consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and both methods provide
according results.

processed at a rate of $\ell_{ij}$ when scheduled on machine $i$. The online
scheduler knows the values of $w_j$ and $\ell_{ij}$ upon arrival of the job,
but is not aware of the quantity $p_j$. We present the {\em first} online
algorithm that is {\em scalable} ($(1+\eps)$-speed
$O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$-competitive for any constant $\eps > 0$) for the
total weighted flow-time objective. No non-trivial results were known for this
setting, except for the most basic case of identical machines. Our result
resolves a major open problem in online scheduling theory. Moreover, we also
show that no job needs more than a logarithmic number of migrations. We further
extend our result and give a scalable algorithm for the objective of minimizing
total weighted flow-time plus energy cost for the case of unrelated machines
and obtain a scalable algorithm. The key algorithmic idea is to let jobs
migrate selfishly until they converge to an equilibrium. Towards this end, we
define a game where each job's utility which is closely tied to the
instantaneous increase in the objective the job is responsible for, and each
machine declares a policy that assigns priorities to jobs based on when they
migrate to it, and the execution speeds. This has a spirit similar to
coordination mechanisms that attempt to achieve near optimum welfare in the
presence of selfish agents (jobs). To the best our knowledge, this is the first
work that demonstrates the usefulness of ideas from coordination mechanisms and
Nash equilibria for designing and analyzing online algorithms.

Relational databases have been deployed to track these products in operations

stars (spectral types A-K), but rarely around low-mass M-type stars. This
scarcity of detections in M star surveys can be confronted with the predictions
of the steady state collisional evolution model. First, we determine the
parameters of the disk population evolved with this model and fit to the
distribution of the fractional dust luminosities measured in the surveys of A-
and FGK-type stars observed by the infrared satellite Spitzer. Thus, in our
approach, we stipulate that the initial disk mass distribution is bimodal and
that only high-mass collisionally-dominated disks are detected. The best
determined parameter is the diameter $D_c$ of the largest planetesimals in the
collisional cascade of the model, which ranges between 2 and 60 km,
consistently for disks around A- and FGK-type stars. Second, we assume that the
same disk population surrounds the M dwarfs that have been the subjects of
debris disk searches in the far-infrared with Spitzer and at submillimeter
wavelengths with radiotelescopes. We find, in the framework of our study, that
this disk population, which has been fit to the AFGK data, is still consistent

adaptive method for problems on 2-surfaces, and Demlow later extended the a
priori theory to 3-surfaces and higher order elements. In a separate line of
research, the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework has been
developed over the last decade by Arnold, Falk and Winther and others as a way
to exploit the observation that mixed variational problems can be posed on a
Hilbert complex, and Galerkin-type mixed methods can be obtained by solving
finite dimensional subproblems. In 2011, Holst and Stern merged these two lines
of research by developing a framework for variational crimes in abstract
Hilbert complexes, allowing for application of the FEEC framework to problems
that violate the subcomplex assumption of Arnold, Falk and Winther. When
applied to Euclidean hypersurfaces, this new framework recovers the original a
priori results and extends the theory to problems posed on surfaces of
arbitrary dimensions. In yet another seemingly distinct line of research,
Holst, Mihalik and Szypowski developed a convergence theory for a specific
class of adaptive problems in the FEEC framework. Here, we bring these ideas

When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR

Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and
tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic
hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two
classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized
information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information
about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed
population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable
fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load
control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers

the results used to constrain both the physical extent of, and density within,
the electron acceleration region. Here we extend this investigation to a more
physically realistic model of electron transport that takes into account the
finite temperature of the ambient plasma, the initial pitch-angle distribution
of the accelerated electrons, and the effects of collisional pitch-angle
scattering. The finite temperature results in the thermal diffusion of
electrons, that leads to the observationally-inferred value of the acceleration
region volume being an overestimate of its true value. The different directions
of the electron trajectories, a consequence of both the non-zero injection
pitch-angle and scattering within the target, cause the projected propagation
distance parallel to the guiding magnetic field to be reduced, so that a
one-dimensional interpretation can overestimate the actual density by a factor
of up to $\sim 6$. The implications of these results for the determination of

abrupt passage from the ordinary pattern of full equilibration to the aging
scenario characteristic of glass-forming liquids. The same theory explains that
this abrupt transition will always be observed as a blurred crossover by the
unavoidable finiteness of the time window of any experimental observation. We
find that within their finite waiting-time window, the simulations confirm the

independent of both time and space variables (assuming that in the system with
the A+B\arrow B reactions, particles B are distributed homogeneously) we show
that subdiffusion-reaction equations describing these processes as well as
their Greens' functions are qualitatively different. For the subdiffusion
process with the A+B\arrow B reactions we consider three models. We base the
method considered in this paper on a random walk model in a system with both
discrete time and space variables. Then, the system with discrete variables is
transformed into a system with continuous variables. Such a method seems to be
convenient in analysing subdiffusion-reaction processes with partially
absorbing or partially reflecting walls. The reason is that within this method
we can determine Greens' functions without a necessity of solving a fractional
differential subdiffusion-reaction equation with boundary conditions at the
walls. As an example we use the model to find the Greens' functions for a
subdiffusive-reaction system (with the reactions mentioned above), which is
bounded by a partially absorbing wall. This example shows how the model can be
used to analyze the subdiffusion-reaction process in a system with partially

system HD20782 + HD20781. Both stars are G dwarfs, and presumably coeval,
forming in the same molecular cloud. Therefore we expect that they should
possess the same bulk metallicities. Furthermore, both stars also host giant
planets on eccentric orbits with pericenters $\lesssim 0.2\,$ AU. We
investigate if planets with such orbits could lead to the host stars ingesting
material, which in turn may leave similar chemical imprints in their
atmospheric abundances. We derived abundances of 15 elements spanning a range
of condensation temperatures ($T_{C}\approx 40-1660\,$ K). The two stars are
found to have a mean element-to-element abundance difference of $0.04\pm0.07\,$
dex, which is consistent with both stars having identical bulk metallicities.
In addition, for both stars, the refractory elements ($T_{C} > 900\,$ K)
exhibit a positive correlation between abundance (relative to solar) and
$T_{C}$, with similar slopes of $\approx$ $1\times10^{-4}\,$ dex K$^{-1}$. The
measured positive correlations are not perfect; both stars exhibit a scatter of
$\approx$ $5\times10^{-5}\,$ dex K$^{-1}$ about the mean trend, and certain
elements (Na, Al, Sc) are similarly deviant in both stars. These findings are
discussed in the context of models for giant planet migration that predict the
accretion of H-depleted rocky material by the host star. We show that a simple
simulation of a solar-type star accreting material with Earth-like composition
predicts a positive---but imperfect---correlation between refractory elemental
abundances and $T_{C}$. Our measured slopes for HD 20782/81 are consistent with
what is predicted for the ingestion of 10--20 Earths by both stars.

standard approach. The tracks are well reconstructed even in presence of hits
with large errors, with a surprising effect of hit discarding. The applications
illustrated are simulations of the PAMELA tracker, but other type of trackers
can be handled similarly. The probability distributions are calculated for the
center of gravity algorithms, and they are very different from gaussian
probabilities. These differences are crucial to accurately reconstruct tracks
with high error hits and to produce the effective discarding of the too noisy
hits (outliers). The similarity of our distributions with the Cauchy
distribution forced us to abandon the standard deviation for our comparisons
and instead use the full width at half maximum. A set of mathematical
approaches must be developed for these applications, some of them are standard
in wide sense, even if very complex. One is essential and, in its absence, all

setup) as the solution of a particular linear inverse problem, we view the
challenge of obtaining a controller with a desired architecture as one of
finding a structured solution to an inverse problem. Building on this
conceptual connection, we formulate and analyze a framework called
\textit{Regularization for Design (RFD)}, in which we augment the variational
formulations of controller synthesis problems with convex penalty functions
that induce a desired controller architecture. The resulting regularized
formulations are convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently,

field to separate the large and small scale motions. In implicitly filtered LES
the computational mesh and discretization schemes are considered to be the
low-pass filter while in the explicitly filtered LES approach the filtering
procedure is separated from the grid and discretization operators and allows
for better control of the numerical errors. The aim of this paper is to study

circulation models in spectral space. To achieve this goal we present the
results of implicitly filtered and explicitly filtered LES of a barotropic

shows that although in the computation of some integral quantities like total
kinetic energy and total enstrophy the results obtained from implicitly
filtered LES and explicitly filtered LES show the same good agreement with the
DNS results, explicit filtering produces energy spectra that show better
agreement with the DNS results. More importantly, explicit filtering captures
the location of coherent structures over time while implicit filtering does
not.

a faulty Hamiltonian oracle. The effect of dephasing noise to this continuous
time oracle model has first been investigated in [1]. The authors consider a
faulty oracle described by a continuous time master equation that acts as
dephasing noise in the basis determined by the marked item. The analysis
focuses on the implementation with a particular driving Hamiltonian. A
universal lower bound for this oracle model, which rules out a better
performance with a different driving Hamiltonian has so far been lacking. In
this note, we derive an adversary type lower bound which shows that the
evolution time T has to be at least in the order of N, i.e. the size of the
search space, when the error rate of the oracle is constant. For the standard
quantum oracle model this result was first proven in [2]. This note can be seen
as an extension of their result to the continuous time setting.

design-time. At runtime, our specification also allows the service runtime

business-level threats and analyse how they may impact goals. A process flow
modelling tool, utilising Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and
standard error boundary events, allows us to define how threats should be
responded to during service execution on a technical level. Throughout the
software life-cycle, we maintain threats in a centralised threat repository.
Re-use of these threats extends further into monitoring alerts being
distributed through a cloud-based messaging service. To demonstrate our
approach in practice, we have developed a proof-of-concept service for the Air

show how this composite service duly adapts itself when a service component is

However, literature review revealed that in most publications and analyst firms
reports, this issue is just overlooked. On the one hand, the results of the ROI
calculations are implied to be produced with a mathematical rigor, possibility
of errors is not mentioned and amount of errors is not estimated. On the

channels are available, SNRs of the signals received at secondary users (SUs)
due to transmissions from primary users (PUs) for different users and channels
can be different. We assume a cooperative sensing strategy with a general
a-out-of-b aggregation rule and design a synchronized MAC protocol so that SUs
can exploit available channels. We analyze the sensing performance and the
throughput achieved by the joint sensing and access design. Based on this
analysis, we develop algorithms to find optimal parameters for the sensing and
access protocols and to determine channel assignment for SUs to maximize the
system throughput. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the
effectiveness of our design and demonstrate the relative performance of our
proposed algorithms and the optimal ones.

We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1,
obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using both
spectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and
apply a new Bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each light
curve in the sample. We find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-declining
explosions (historically referred to as ""Type IIL"" SNe). However, we identify a
highly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak
luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single
parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controlling
the explosions of red supergiants. This relation could also be applied for
supernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsic
scatter of 0.2 mag. We compare each light curve to physical models from
hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and other
properties of the Pan-STARRS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of
systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light curve
properties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enable
robust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.
This work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapse

achieving the best-fit annihilation rate $\sigma v \sim 5\times 10^{-26}$
cm$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$ with perturbative couplings requires a sub-TeV mediator
particle that interacts with both dark matter and bottom quarks. In this paper,
we consider the minimal viable scenarios in which a Standard Model singlet
mediates s-channel interactions only between dark matter and bottom quarks,
focusing on axial-vector, vector, and pseudoscalar couplings. Using simulations
that include on-shell mediator production, we show that existing sbottom
searches currently offer the strongest sensitivity over a large region of the
favored parameter space explaining the gamma-ray excess, particularly for
axial-vector interactions. The 13 TeV LHC will be even more sensitive; however,
it may not be sufficient to fully cover the favored parameter space, and the
pseudoscalar scenario will remain unconstrained by these searches. We also find
that direct-detection constraints, induced through loops of bottom quarks,
complement collider bounds to disfavor the vector-current interaction when the
mediator is heavier than twice the dark matter mass. We also present some
simple models that generate pseudoscalar-mediated annihilation predominantly to
bottom quarks.

a by-product of query processing; as opposed to traditional full index creation
where the indexing effort is performed up front before answering any queries.
Adaptive indexing has received a considerable amount of attention, and several
algorithms have been proposed over the past few years; including a recent
experimental study comparing a large number of existing methods. Until now,
however, most adaptive indexing algorithms have been designed single-threaded,
yet with multi-core systems already well established, the idea of designing
parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing is very natural. In this regard only
one parallel algorithm for adaptive indexing has recently appeared in the
literature: The parallel version of standard cracking. In this paper we
describe three alternative parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing, including
a second variant of a parallel standard cracking algorithm. Additionally, we
describe a hybrid parallel sorting algorithm, and a NUMA-aware method based on
sorting. We then thoroughly compare all these algorithms experimentally; along
a variant of a recently published parallel version of radix sort. Parallel
sorting algorithms serve as a realistic baseline for multi-threaded adaptive
indexing techniques. In total we experimentally compare seven parallel
algorithms. Additionally, we extensively profile all considered algorithms. The
initial set of experiments considered in this paper indicates that our parallel
algorithms significantly improve over previously known ones. Our results
suggest that, although adaptive indexing algorithms are a good design choice in
single-threaded environments, the rules change considerably in the parallel
case. That is, in future highly-parallel environments, sorting algorithms could
be serious alternatives to adaptive indexing.

fields can be derived in a principled axiomatic manner, from a set of
structural properties to enable invariance of receptive field responses under
natural sound transformations and ensure internal consistency between
spectro-temporal receptive fields at different temporal and spectral scales.
  For defining a time-frequency transformation of a purely temporal sound
signal, it is shown that the framework allows for a new way of deriving the
Gabor and Gammatone filters as well as a novel family of generalized Gammatone
filters, with additional degrees of freedom to obtain different trade-offs
between the spectral selectivity and the temporal delay of time-causal temporal
window functions.
  When applied to the definition of a second-layer of receptive fields from a
spectrogram, it is shown that the framework leads to two canonical families of
spectro-temporal receptive fields, in terms of spectro-temporal derivatives of
either spectro-temporal Gaussian kernels for non-causal time or the combination
of a time-causal generalized Gammatone filter over the temporal domain and a
Gaussian filter over the logspectral domain. For each filter family, the
spectro-temporal receptive fields can be either separable over the
time-frequency domain or be adapted to local glissando transformations that
represent variations in logarithmic frequencies over time. Within each domain
of either non-causal or time-causal time, these receptive field families are
derived by uniqueness from the assumptions.
  It is demonstrated how the presented framework allows for computation of
basic auditory features for audio processing and that it leads to predictions
about auditory receptive fields with good qualitative similarity to biological
receptive fields measured in the inferior colliculus (ICC) and primary auditory
cortex (A1) of mammals.

low-frequency enhancement (boson peak) of the vibrational density of states, as
compared with the Debye law. By measuring the low-temperature heat capacity of
a Zr-based bulk metallic glass relative to a crystalline reference state, we
show that the heat capacity of the glass is strongly enhanced after severe
plastic deformation by high-pressure torsion, while subsequent thermal
annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a significant reduction. The
detailed analysis of corresponding molecular dynamics simulations of an
amorphous Zr-Cu glass shows that the change in heat capacity is primarily due
to enhanced low-frequency modes within the shear band region.

significant acceleration of the rotational motion of optical bullets may be
observed for a very short medium length.

axisymmetric disturbance, simple argument based on the Cauchy-Poisson
initial-value problem suggests that the wake angle decreases following a
Mach-like law at large velocity, $\alpha \simeq Fr_L^{-1}$, where
$Fr_L=U/\sqrt{gL}$ is the Froude number based on the disturbance velocity $U$,
its size $L$, and gravity $g$. In this paper we extend this analysis to the
case of non-axisymmetric disturbances, relevant to real ships. We find that,
for intermediate Froude numbers, the wake angle follows an intermediate scaling
law $\alpha \simeq Fr_L^{-2}$, in agreement with the recent prediction of
Noblesse \textit{et al.} [Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids {\bf 46}, 164 (2014)]. We show
that beyond a critical Froude number, which scales as $A^{1/2}$ (where $A$ is
the length-to-width aspect ratio of the disturbance), the asymptotic scaling
$\alpha \simeq Fr_B^{-1}$ holds, where now $Fr_B = A^{1/2} Fr_L$ is the Froude

By combining a coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) and a non-Markovian
quantum jump (NMQJ) method, this new approach inherits the broad-range validity
from the CMRT and highly efficient propagation from the NMQJ. To implement NMQJ
propagation of CMRT, we show that the CMRT master equation can be casted into a
generalized Lindblad form. Moreover, we extend the NMQJ approach to treat
time-dependent Hamiltonian, enabling the description of excitonic systems under
coherent laser fields. As a benchmark of the validity of this new method, we
show that the CMRT-NMQJ method accurately describes the energy transfer
dynamics in a prototypical photosynthetic complex. Finally, we apply this new
approach to simulate the quantum dynamics of a dimer system coherently excited
to coupled single-excitation states under the influence of laser fields, which
allows us to investigate the interplay between the photoexcitation process and
ultrafast energy transfer dynamics in the system. We demonstrate that
laser-field parameters significantly affect coherence dynamics of
photoexcitations in excitonic systems, which indicates that the photoexcitation
process must be explicitly considered in order to properly describe
photon-induced dynamics in photosynthetic systems. This work should provide a
valuable tool for efficient simulations of coherent control of energy flow in
photosynthetic systems and artificial optoelectronic materials.

galaxies hosting an AGN increases with the stellar mass. A careful selection of
random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar
mass and redshift dependencies of the AGN fraction to explore trends with
several stellar age indicators. We find no significant differences in the
distribution of the rest-frame U-V colour for AGN hosts and inactive galaxies,
in agreement with previous results. However, we find significantly shallower
4000 AA breaks in AGN hosts, indicative of younger stellar populations. With
the help of a model-independent determination of the extinction, we obtain
extinction-corrected U-V colours and light-weighted average stellar ages. We
find that AGN hosts have younger stellar populations and higher extinction

neutron star. In this paper we focus on the return to quiescence following the
2010 outburst of the source. This decay was monitored thanks to 11 pointed
observations taken with XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift. The decay from outburst
to quiescence is very fast, with an exponential decay characteristic time scale
of ~2 d. Once in quiescence the X-ray flux of Aql X-1 remained constant, with
no further signs of variability or decay. The comparison with the only other
well-monitored outburst from Aql X-1 (1997) is tail-telling. The luminosities
at which the fast decay starts are fully compatible for the two outbursts,
hinting at a mechanism intrinsic to the system and possibly related to the
neutron star rotation and magnetic field (i.e., the propeller effect). In
addition, for both outbursts, the decay profiles are also very similar, likely
resulting from the shut-off of the accretion process onto the neutron star
surface. Finally, the quiescent neutron star temperatures at the end of the
outbursts are well consistent with one another, suggesting a hot neutron star
core dominating the thermal balance. Small differences in the quiescent X-ray
luminosity among the two outbursts can be attributed to a different level of
the power law component.

with a power-law for the background with a spectral index which is compatible
with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) data from the same region. If this

$\text{Tr}({\varrho}_{sc})=\text{Tr}({\varrho}_{in})$. On the other hand

power, promises dramatic reduction in the network operation cost and the
network carbon footprints. However, the spatial variation of the energy field
can lead to fluctuations in power supplied to the network and thereby affects
its coverage. This warrants research on quantifying the aforementioned negative
effect and countermeasure techniques, motivating the current work. First, a
novel energy field model is presented, in which fixed maximum energy intensity
$\gamma$ occurs at Poisson distributed locations, called energy centers. The
intensities fall off from the centers following an exponential decay function
of squared distance and the energy intensity at an arbitrary location is given
by the decayed intensity from the nearest energy center. The product between
the energy center density and the exponential rate of the decay function,
denoted as $\psi$, is shown to determine the energy field distribution. Next,
the paper considers a cellular downlink network powered by harvesting energy
from the energy field and analyzes its network coverage. For the case of
harvesters deployed at the same sites as base stations (BSs), as $\gamma$
increases, the mobile outage probability is shown to scale as $(c
\gamma^{-\pi\psi}+p)$, where $p$ is the outage probability corresponding to a
flat energy field and $c$ a constant. Subsequently, a simple scheme is proposed
for counteracting the energy randomness by spatial averaging. Specifically,
distributed harvesters are deployed in clusters and the generated energy from
the same cluster is aggregated and then redistributed to BSs. As the cluster
size increases, the power supplied to each BS is shown to converge to a
constant proportional to the number of harvesters per BS.

Turbulence develops due to the electrostatic fluctuations driven by temperature

temperature gradient (ETG). The analysis consists in decomposing the system
into a series of scale structures, while accounting separately for
contributions made by modes possessing special symmetries (e.g., the zonal flow
modes). The interaction of these scales is analyzed using the energy transfer
functions, including a forward and backward decomposition, scale fluxes and

stronger energy cascade, with implications for gyrokinetic turbulence modeling.

applied on top of a wide range of prediction algorithms. The method has a

desirable that in the case where the assumptions of the underlying algorithm

method inspired by the maximum likelihood estimator and optimal filtering. Our
method consists of two major steps. First, the spectral index and amplitude of
dispersion measure variations are measured via a time-domain spectral analysis.
Second, the linear optimal filter is constructed based on the model parameters
found in the first step, and is used to extract the dispersion measure
variation waveforms. Compared to current existing methods, this method has
better time resolution for the study of short timescale dispersion variations,
and generally produces smaller errors in waveform estimations. This method can
process irregularly sampled data without any interpolation because of its
time-domain nature. Furthermore, it offers the possibility to interpolate or
extrapolate the waveform estimation to regions where no data is available.
Examples using simulated data sets are included for demonstration.

Dirac's equation, hermiticity of Hamiltonians, and the possibility of existence
of stationary bound states of spin-half particles. The constraint on the domain
of the wave functions of the Hamiltonian in a Schwarzschild field in spherical
coordinates (r > r_{0}) resulting from the fulfillment of Hilbert's condition
g_{00} > 0 also holds in other coordinates for all the metrics considered. The
self-adjoint Hamiltonians for the Schwarzschild metrics in the spherical,
isotropic and harmonic coordinates and also for the Eddington-Finkelstein and
Painleve-Gullstrand metrics are Hermitian, and for them the existence of
stationary bound states of spin-half particles is possible. The self-adjoint
Hamiltonians for non-stationary Lemaitre-Finkelstein and Kruskal metrics have
the explicit dependence on the temporal coordinates and stationary bound states
of spin-half particles cannot be defined for these Hamiltonians. The results of

computer vision and have been successfully applied in the domain of image
restoration, especially to image denoising. For image deblurring, however,
discriminative approaches have been mostly lacking. We posit two reasons for
this: First, the blur kernel is often only known at test time, requiring any
discriminative approach to cope with considerable variability. Second, given
this variability it is quite difficult to construct suitable features for
discriminative prediction. To address these challenges we first show a
connection between common half-quadratic inference for generative image priors
and Gaussian CRFs. Based on this analysis, we then propose a cascade model for
image restoration that consists of a Gaussian CRF at each stage. Each stage of
our cascade is semi-parametric, i.e. it depends on the instance-specific
parameters of the restoration problem, such as the blur kernel. We train our
model by loss minimization with synthetically generated training data. Our
experiments show that when applied to non-blind image deblurring, the proposed
approach is efficient and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on images
corrupted with synthetic and real blur. Moreover, we demonstrate its
suitability for image denoising, where we achieve competitive results for
grayscale and color images.

measure the dispersion and alternative polarization of gravitational waves, we
extend the framework to the most general situations, where the combinations of
a massive graviton and alternative polarization modes are considered. The atlas
of the Hellings-Downs functions is completed by the new calculations for these
dispersive alternative polarization modes. We find that each mode and
corresponding graviton mass introduce characteristic features in the
Hellings-Downs function. Thus, in principal, we can not only detect each
polarization mode, measure the corresponding graviton mass, but also
discriminate the different scenarios. In this way, we can test gravity theories
in the radiative regime in a generalized fashion, and such method is a direct
experiment, where one can address the gauge symmetry of the gravity theories in
their linearised limits. Although current pulsar timing still lacks enough
stable pulsars and sensitivity for such practices, we expect that future
telescopes with larger collecting area could make such experiments be feasible.

mean-densities, radii, and surface gravities, as well as estimate ages. In this
writing we present AME as a visual and powerful tool which could be useful; in
particular in the light of the large number of exoplanets being found.
  AME consists of a set of figures from which the stellar parameters are
deduced. These figures are made from a grid of stellar evolutionary models that
cover masses ranging from 0.7 Msun to 1.6 Msun in steps of 0.1 Msun and
metallicities in the interval -0.3 dex <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3 dex in increments of
0.1 dex. The stellar evolutionary models are computed using the Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code with simple input physics.
  We have compared the results from AME with results for three groups of stars;
stars with radii determined from interferometry (and measured parallaxes),
stars with radii determined from measurements of their parallaxes (and
calculated angular diameters), and stars with results based on the modelling of
their individual oscillation frequencies. We find that a comparison of the
radii from interferometry to those from AME yield a weighted mean of the
fractional differences of just 2%. This is also the level of deviation that we
find when we compare the parallax-based radii to the radii determined from AME.
  The comparison between independently determined stellar parameters and those
found using AME show that our method can provide reliable stellar masses,
radii, and ages, with median uncertainties in the order of 4%, 2%, and 25%
respectively.

associated with a particle as a sum of phase-factors, which are periodic
functions of classical action. In the present article, this periodicity is
shown to impart the corresponding periodicity to a one parameter family of
wavefunctions generated by the translations of arclength used to parameterize
the trajectories. Translation parameter is adjoined to the base to obtain an
extended manifold. Periodicity of the family of wavefunctions with respect to
the translation parameter together with solutions of the generalized
Klein-Gordon equation, which is deducible from the path integral formulation,
is used to define a quantized field with zero vacuum energy in the extended
manifold with the particle being its quantum. Classical description of
essentially the same particle is obtained in the extended higher dimensional
space using its properties. This manifold can replace the base in this
treatment to continue the program for higher dimensional manifolds generated in
the process. Results are illustrated by taking the three-dimensional Euclidean
space the base, which yields the classical and quantum particle descriptions of
photon in the base and the field description in the resulting extended
manifold, which is identified with the Minkowski spacetime. The field
formulation yields the quantized Maxwell's equations. A novel interpretation of
time as the corresponding translation parameter results in the process.
Classical description in the extended manifold, i.e., the Minkowski spacetime,
results in the relativistic description of a massive particle related to the
photon. The results are further illustrated for this massive particle in the
Minkowski spacetime obtaining parallel results.

candidates for evaporating very small grains, which are thought to be
precursors of free-flying PAHs. Evaporation rates have been calculated so far
only for species containing up to a few 100 C atoms, whereas interstellar PAH
clusters could contain up to ~1000 C atoms. We present a method that
generalises the calculation of the statistical evaporation rate of large PAH
clusters and provides rates for species containing up to ~1000 C-atoms. The
evaporation of non-rotating neutral homo-molecular PAH clusters containing up
to 12 molecules from a family of highly symmetric compact PAHs is studied.
Statistical calculations were performed and completed with molecular dynamics
simulations at high internal energies to provide absolute values for the
evaporation rate and distributions of kinetic energy released. The calculations
used explicit atom-atom Lennard-Jones potentials in the rigid molecule
approximation. A new method is proposed to take both inter- and intra-molecular
vibrations into account. Without any parameter adjustment, the calculated
evaporation rates agree well with available experimental data. We find that the
non-rotation assumption has a limited impact on the evaporation rates. The
photostability of PAH clusters increases dramatically with the size of
molecules in the clusters, and to a lesser extent with the number of molecules
in the clusters. For values of the UV radiation field that are typical of the
regions where evaporating very small grains are observed, the smallest clusters
in this study (~50 C-atoms) are found to be quickly photo-evaporated, whereas
the largest clusters (~1000 C-atoms) are photostable. Our results support the
idea that large PAH clusters are good candidates for evaporating very small
grains.

  We also prove that the consistency strength of these axioms is below that of

HAT-P-1 stellar binary based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio
Keck/HIRES spectra. The secondary star in this double system is known to host a
transiting giant planet while no planets have yet been detected around the
primary star. The derived metallicities ([Fe/H]) of the primary and secondary
stars are identical within the errors: $0.146 \pm 0.014$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.033
dex) and $0.155 \pm 0.007$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.023 dex), respectively. Extremely
precise differential abundance ratios of 23 elements have been measured (mean
error of $\sigma$([X/Fe]) = 0.013 dex) and are found to be indistinguishable
between the two stars: $\Delta$[X/Fe] (secondary - primary) = $+0.001 \pm
0.006$ dex ($\sigma$ = 0.008 dex). The striking similarity in the chemical
composition of the two stellar components in HAT-P-1 is contrary to the
possible 0.04 dex level difference seen in 16 Cyg A+B, which also hosts a giant
planet, at least 3 times more massive than the one around HAT-P-1 secondary
star. We conclude that the presence of giant planets does not necessarily imply
differences in the chemical compositions of the host stars. The elemental
abundances of each star in HAT-P-1 relative to the Sun show an identical,
positive correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements; their
abundance patterns are thus very similar to those observed in the majority of
solar twins. In view of the Melendez et al. (2009)'s interpretation of the
peculiar solar abundance pattern, we conclude that HAT-P-1 experienced less
efficient formation of terrestrial planets than the Sun. This is in line with
the expectation that the presence of close-in giant planets preventing the
formation or survival of terrestrial planets.

particle model of the dynamics of neutral and ionized magnesium populations,
coupled with an analytical modeling of the atmosphere below the exobase.
Theoretical MgI absorption line profiles are directly compared with the
absorption observed in the blue wing of the line during the planet transit.
Observations are well-fitted with an escape rate of neutral magnesium in the
range 2x10^7-3.4x10^7 g/s, an exobase close to the Roche lobe (Rexo in the
range 2.1-4.3 Rp, where Rp is the planet radius) and a planetary wind velocity
at the exobase vpl=25km/s. The observed velocities of the planet-escaping
magnesium up to -60km/s are well explained by radiation pressure acceleration,
provided that UV-photoionization is compensated for by electron recombination
up to about 13Rp. If the exobase properties are constrained to values given by
theoretical models of the deeper atmosphere (Rexo=2Rp and vpl=10km/s), the best
fit to the observations is found at a similar electron density and escape rate
within 2 sigma. In all cases, the mean temperature of the atmosphere below the
exobase must be higher than about 6100 K. Simulations predict a redward
expansion of the absorption profile from the beginning to the end of the
transit. The spatial and spectral structure of the extended atmosphere is the
result of complex interactions between radiation pressure, planetary gravity,

absorption profiles in the MgI line.

10^{11.4} M_{\odot}$r. We derive surface brightness profiles to a depth of
almost $\mu_r \sim 32 \,\mathrm{mag\,arcsec}^{-2}$. We find that the
ellipticity of the stellar halo is a function of galaxy stellar mass and that
the haloes of high concentration ($C > 2.6$) galaxies are more elliptical than
those of low concentration ($C < 2.6$) galaxies. The $g$-$r$ colour profile of
high concentration galaxies reveals that the $g$-$r$ colour of the stellar
population in the stellar halo is bluer than in the main galaxy, and the colour
of the stellar halo is redder for higher mass galaxies. We further demonstrate
that the full two-dimensional surface intensity distribution of our galaxy
stacks can only be fit through multi-component S\'{e}rsic models. Using the
fraction of light in the outer component of the models as a proxy for the
fraction of accreted stellar light, we show that this fraction is a function of
stellar mass and galaxy type. For high concentration galaxies, the fraction of
accreted stellar light rises from $30\%$ to $70\%$ for galaxies in the stellar
mass range from $10^{10.0} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.4} M_{\odot}$. The fraction of
accreted light is much smaller in low concentration systems, increasing from
$2\%$ to $25\%$ over the same mass range. This work provides important
constraints for the theoretical understanding of the formation of stellar
haloes of galaxies.

a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians

The relay overhears the transmitted message, amplifies it using a variable gain
amplifier, and then forwards the message to the destination. This latter
combines both the source and the relay message and tries to decode the
information. In case of decoding failure, the destination sends a negative
acknowledgement. A new replica of the message containing new parity bits is
then transmitted in the subsequent HARQ round. This process continues until
successful decoding occurs at the destination or a maximum number $M$ of rounds
is reached. We study the performance of HARQ-IR over the considered relay
channel from an information theoretic perspective. We derive exact expressions
and bounds for the information outage probability, the average number of
transmissions, and the average transmission rate. Moreover, we evaluate the
delay experienced by Poisson arriving packets over the considered relay

the sojourn time, and the energy efficiency. The derived exact expressions are

J1357.2-0933 for ~50 ks with XMM-Newton in 2013 July during its quiescent
state. The source is clearly detected at a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed flux of
~3x10^-15 erg cm-2 s-1. If the source is located at a distance of 1.5 kpc (as
suggested in the literature), this would imply a luminosity of ~8x10^29 erg
s-1, making it the faintest detected quiescent black hole LMXB. This would also
imply that there is no indication of a reversal in the quiescence X-ray
luminosity versus orbital period diagram down to 2.8 hr, as has been predicted
theoretically and recently supported by the detection of the 2.4 hr orbital
period black hole MAXI J1659-152 at a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of ~ 1.2 x

the price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often
accompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a
change of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they
leave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is,
before they burst. In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind
financial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power
law emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are,
as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific
trading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major
correction, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards
maturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles

to be relevant in neutron star crusts, is a resistive tearing instability

density-shear instability is of greater significance in neutron stars than the
tearing instability, because it generally has a faster growth-rate and is less

with an invaluable source of scientific information. Attempts to detect such
interstellar particles among the meteors observed in Earth's atmosphere have
almost exclusively assumed that those particles moving above the Solar System's
escape speed -- particles on orbits hyperbolic with respect to the Sun-- were
precisely the extrasolar particles being searched for. Here we show that
hyperbolic particles can be generated entirely within the Solar System by
gravitational scattering of interplanetary dust and meteoroids by the planets.
These particles have necessarily short lifetimes as they quickly escape our
star system; nonetheless some may arrive at Earth at speeds comparable to those
expected of interstellar meteoroids. Some of these are associated with the
encounter of planets with the debris streams of individual comets; however,
such encounters are relatively rare. The rates of occurrence of
hyperbolically-scattered sporadic meteors are also quite low. Only one of every
10,000 optical meteors observed at Earth is expected to be such a locally
generated hyperbolic and its heliocentric velocity is typically only a hundred
meters per second above the heliocentric escape velocity at Earth's orbit.
Mercury and Venus are predicted to generate weak 'hyperbolic meteor showers':
the restrictive geometry of scattering to our planet means that a radiant near
the Sun from which hyperbolic meteors arrive at Earth should recur with the
planet's synodic period. However, though planetary scattering can produce
meteoroids with speeds comparable to interstellar meteors and at fluxes near
current upper limits for such events, the majority of this locally-generated
component of hyperbolic meteoroids is just above the heliocentric escape
velocity and should be easily distinguishable from true interstellar
meteoroids.

wavelength and grating order). Methods: Using PACS, we obtained the spectral
emission of several features of the Titan's stratosphere. We used a
line-by-line radiative transfer code and the least-squares fitting technique to
infer the abundances of the trace constituents. Results: Numerous spectral
features attributable to CH$_4$, CO, HCN, and H$_2$O are present. From the flux
density spectrum measured and by a detailed comparison with synthetic spectra,
we constrain the stratospheric abundance of CH4, which is assumed to be
constant with altitude, to be 1.29 $\pm$ 0.03%. Similarly, we constrain the
abundance of CO to be 50 $\pm$ 2 ppm, and the HCN vertical distribution
consistent with an increase from 40 ppb at $\sim$100 km to 4 ppm at $\sim$200
km, which is an altitude region where the HCN signatures are sensitive.
Measurements of three H$_2$O rotational lines confirm the H$_2$O distribution
profile recently obtained with Herschel. Furthermore, we determine the isotopic
ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in CO and HCN to be 124 $\pm$ 58, and 66 $\pm$ 35,
respectively. Comparisons between our results and the values derived with other
instruments show that our results are consistent with the vertical
distributions and isotopic ratios in previous studies, except for the HCN
distribution obtained with Cassini/CIRS, which does not agree with the PACS
lines at the 1-sigma confidence interval.

guarantees. It proves a formal bound on the probability that solutions returned
by asymptotically optimal roadmap-based methods (e.g., PRM*) are within a bound

of systems there is a maximal temperature allowing for the creation of
entanglement, we show that genuine multipartite entanglement---the strongest
form of entanglement in multipartite systems---can be created at any
temperature when sufficiently many systems are considered. This approach may
find applications, e.g. in quantum information processing, for physical
platforms in which thermodynamic considerations cannot be ignored.

Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has prompted numerous ideas to
explain its structure and properties. One of these ideas is the ""neutral solar
wind"" scenario, which identifies the source particles as pickup protons in the
local interstellar medium originating in solar wind charge-exchange
interactions. This scenario has been thought to require unrealistically weak
pitch-angle scattering of the pickup protons to explain the narrow structure.
Recently, Schwadron & McComas (2013) suggested that this structure could result
from a spatial retention of the pickup protons, rather than from a restricted
pitch-angle distribution. Here, we present a physically motivated, quantitative
mechanism to produce such a spatial configuration. This mechanism is based on
the ""dominant turbulence"" assumption, which can be applied where the production
of new pickup protons is slow, and has been used to successfully explain the
level of turbulent heating observed in the outer solar wind. This formalism
predicts a pickup isotropization process which adds or subtracts energy from
the ambient turbulent fluctuations, depending on the initial pitch angle of the
pickup protons. We show that a simple model of this process can yield a ribbon
structure in qualitative agreement with the observations. The results of this
simple model are not yet quantitatively satisfactory, but we suggest several
improvements which may reduce the quantitative discrepancy.

both spatially and temporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by
stresses or strains, which build up within the moving axoneme, and somehow
regulate dynein activity. While experimenting with axonemes subjected to mild
proteolysis, we observed pairs of doublets associate with each other and form
bends with almost constant curvature. By model- ing the statics of a pair of

J= 4 to 8), [NII] at 1461 GHz from ionized gas, and [CI] (2-1), which together
with the OH+ lines, trace extended CO photodissociation regions along the rims.
The estimated OH+ column density is (1-10)x1e12 cm-2. The CH+ (1-0) line was
not detected at the sensitivity of our observations. Non-LTE models of the CO
excitation were used to constrain the average gas density (n(H2)=(1-5)x1e5

that CO arises from dense and shielded clumps in the western rims of the Helix
Nebula whereas OH+ and [CI] lines trace the diffuse gas and the UV and X-ray
illuminated clumps surface where molecules reform after CO photodissociation.

We perform comprehensive simulations to determine possible biases and
uncertainties in fitting single-component light distributions to real galaxies.
In particular, we examine the robustness of the measurements of the luminosity,
size, and other structural parameters. We devise simulations with increasing
realism to systematically disentangle effects due to the technique
(specifically using GALFIT) and the intrinsic structures of the galaxies. By
accurately capturing the detailed substructures of nearby elliptical galaxies
and then rescaling their sizes and signal-to-noise to mimic galaxies at
different redshifts, we confirm that the massive quiescent galaxies at $z
\approx 2$ are significantly more compact intrinsically than their local
counterparts. Their observed compactness is not a result of missing faint outer
light due to systematic errors in modeling. In fact, we find that fitting
multi-component galaxies with a single S\'ersic profile, the procedure most
commonly adopted in the literature, biases the inferred sizes higher by up to
10% - 20%, which accentuates the amount of size evolution required. If the sky
estimation has been done robustly and the model for the point-spread function

patient characteristics are important tools for managing patient care. Most
current and commonly used risk prediction models have been built from carefully
selected epidemiological cohorts. However, the homogeneity and limited size of
such cohorts restricts the predictive power and generalizability of these risk
models to other populations. Electronic health data (EHD) from large health
care systems provide access to data on large, heterogeneous, and
contemporaneous patient populations. The unique features and challenges of EHD,
including missing risk factor information, non-linear relationships between
risk factors and cardiovascular event outcomes, and differing effects from
different patient subgroups, demand novel machine learning approaches to risk
model development. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach based
on Bayesian networks trained on EHD to predict the probability of having a
cardiovascular event within five years. In such data, event status may be
unknown for some individuals as the event time is right-censored due to
disenrollment and incomplete follow-up. Since many traditional data mining
methods are not well-suited for such data, we describe how to modify both
modelling and assessment techniques to account for censored observation times.
We show that our approach can lead to better predictive performance than the
Cox proportional hazards model (i.e., a regression-based approach commonly used
for censored, time-to-event data) or a Bayesian network with {\em{ad hoc}}
approaches to right-censoring. Our techniques are motivated by and illustrated
on data from a large U.S. Midwestern health care system.

derivative couplings between the field strength tensor and a complex scalar
field, in four dimensional AdS black hole backgrounds. We study this theory in
the probe limit, as well as with backreaction. There are multiple tuning
parameters in the theory, and with two non-zero parameters, we show that the
theory has a rich phase structure, and in particular, the transition from the
normal to the superconducting phase can be tuned to be of first order or of
second order within a window of one of these. This is established numerically
as well as by computing the free energy of the boundary theory. We further
present analytical results for the critical temperature of the model, and
compare these with numerical analysis. Optical properties of this system are
also studied numerically in the probe limit, and our results show evidence for
negative refraction at low frequencies.

multiple data center resource types like CPU, RAM and disk storage. Recent

number of desirable scheduling objectives including so-called dominant resource
fairness (DRF). We argue here that proportional fairness (PF), long recognized
as a desirable objective in sharing network bandwidth between ongoing flows, is
preferable to DRF. The superiority of PF is manifest under the realistic
modelling assumption that the population of jobs in progress is a stochastic
process. In random traffic the strategy-proof property of DRF proves
unimportant while PF is shown by analysis and simulation to offer a
significantly better efficiency-fairness tradeoff.

this paper, we study the optimization of the mapping of the coded bits to the
modulation bits for a polarization-multiplexed fiber-optical system without
optical inline dispersion compensation. Our focus is on protograph-based
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which allow for an efficient hardware
implementation, suitable for high-speed optical communications. The
optimization is applied to the AR4JA protograph family, and further extended to
protograph-based spatially coupled LDPC codes assuming a windowed decoder. Full
field simulations via the split-step Fourier method are used to verify the
analysis. The results show performance gains of up to 0.25 dB, which translate
into a possible extension of the transmission reach by roughly up to 8%,
without significantly increasing the system complexity.

collisions are compared using a statistical model tailored to reproduce many

decay of an excited nucleus and a Fermi gas entropy. We first generate
statistical events as function of excitation energy but stopping the decay
chain at the first step. In such a condition the 'exact' model temperature is
determined from the Fermi gas relation to the excitation energy. From these
events, using quantum and classical fluctuation methods for protons and
neutrons, we derive temperature and density (quantum case only) of the system
under consideration. Additionally, the same quantities are also extracted using
the double ratio method for different particle combinations. A very good
agreement between the ""exact"" temperatures and quantum fluctuation temperatures
is obtained, the role of the density is discussed. Classical methods give a
reasonable estimate of the temperature when the density is very low as
expected. The effects of secondary decays of the excited fragments are
discussed as well.

user preference understanding to content analysis. Typical recommendation
algorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are
IID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on
specific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex
recommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor
heterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective
coupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as
intrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID
complexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective
couplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID
coupling relations between users and items. Such couplings integrate the
intra-coupled interactions within an attribute and inter-coupled interactions
among different attributes. Experimental results on two open data sets
demonstrate that the user/item couplings can be effectively applied in RS and
CMF outperforms the benchmark methods.

(RS) is that the extant techniques, such as Collaborative Filtering (CF) and
Matrix Factorization (MF), mainly rely on the user-item rating matrix, which
sometimes is not informative enough for predicting recommendations. To solve
these challenges, the objective item attributes are incorporated as
complementary information. However, most of the existing methods for inferring
the relationships between items assume that the attributes are ""independently
and identically distributed (iid)"", which does not always hold in reality. In
fact, the attributes are more or less coupled with each other by some implicit
relationships. Therefore, in this pa-per we propose an attribute-based coupled
similarity measure to capture the implicit relationships between items. We then
integrate the implicit item coupling into MF to form the Coupled Item-based
Matrix Factorization (CIMF) model. Experimental results on two open data sets
demonstrate that CIMF outperforms the benchmark methods.
