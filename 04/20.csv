homology thickness with regards to Khovanov homology, odd homology, and

so cannot be quasialternating, by using the results of our computations
[JaSa1], for one of knots which are homology thin, knot $11n_{50}$, J. Greene
proved that it is not quasi-alternating, so this is the first example of

provide a few more candidates for homology thin knots for which the method used

the same types of efficiencies as ESP-index about the top-down searches, it

annihilates to an on-shell particle that subsequently decays to Standard Model

of FUV flux as a tracer of recent star formation on sub-kpc scales. The star
formation rates (SFRs) derived from the extinction-corrected observed FUV
fluxes were, on average, consistent with the 100-Myr mean SFRs of the SFHs to
within the 1$\sigma$ scatter. Overall, the scatter was larger than the
uncertainties in the SFRs and particularly evident among the smallest regions.
The scatter was consistent with an even combination of discrete sampling of the
initial mass function and high variability in the SFHs. This result
demonstrates the importance of satisfying both the full-IMF and the
constant-SFR assumptions for obtaining precise SFR estimates from FUV flux.
Assuming a robust FUV extinction correction, we estimate that a factor of 2.5
uncertainty can be expected in FUV-based SFRs for regions smaller than $10^5$
pc$^2$, or a few hundred pc. We also examined ages and masses derived from UV
flux under the common assumption that the regions are simple stellar
populations (SSPs). The SFHs showed that most of the regions are not SSPs, and
the age and mass estimates were correspondingly discrepant from the SFHs. For
those regions with SSP-like SFHs, we found mean discrepancies of 10 Myr in age
and a factor of 3 to 4 in mass. It was not possible to distinguish the SSP-like
regions from the others based on integrated FUV flux.

super Yang--Mills superfields is proposed. Their equations of motions are shown
to take the same form as in the single-particle case, supplemented by contact
terms. A recursive construction of these superfields is inspired by the
iterated OPEs among massless vertex operators in the pure spinor formalism. An
enlarged set of BRST-covariant pure spinor blocks is then defined in a
streamlined fashion and combined to multiparticle vertex operators. The latter
can be used to universally describe tree-level subdiagrams in the perturbative
open and closed superstring, regardless of the loop order. The inherent
symmetries of the multiparticle superfields are reproduced by structure
constants of the gauge group, hinting a natural appearance of the BCJ-duality
between color and kinematics in the fundamentals of super Yang--Mills theory.
We present one-loop applications where known scalar cohomology objects are
systematically recomputed and a novel vector cohomology particularly relevant
to the closed string is constructed for arbitrary multiplicity.

formation process starting from planetesimals using high-resolution
simulations, and to examine the dependences of the architecture of planetary
systems on input parameters (e.g., disk mass, disk viscosity). We observe that
protoplanets that arise from oligarchic growth and undergo type I migration
stop migrating when they join a chain of resonant planets outside the orbit of
a hot Jupiter. The formation of a resonant chain is almost independent of our
model parameters, and is thus a robust process. At the end of our simulations,
several terrestrial planets remain at around 0.1 AU. The formed planets are not
equal-mass; the largest planet constitutes more than 50 percent of the total
mass in the close-in region, which is also less dependent on parameters. In the
previous work of this paper (Ogihara et al. 2013), we have found a new physical
mechanism of induced migration of the hot Jupiter, which is called a
crowding-out. If the hot Jupiter opens up a wide gap in the disk (e.g., owing
to low disk viscosity), crowding-out becomes less efficient and the hot Jupiter
remains. We also discuss angular momentum transfer between the planets and
disk.

circulation and hence the spatial pattern of clouds. Since clouds can exert a
dominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be
critical for determining mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea
using a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud
scheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an
Earth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets
(like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too
hot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The
explanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak
Coriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence
and convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of
optically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In
contrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in
the deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A particularly striking
example of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that
a planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern
Venus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus
went through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.

However, because of anisotropy in the Coulomb matrix elements, there is
anticrossing in the plasmon dispersion only in the direction perpendicular to

larger clusters when they collide with another particle or cluster. We study
the stochastic process both analytically and numerically. Analytically, we
derive a kinetic theory which approximately describes the process dynamics. One
of our strongest assumptions in this respect is the so called well-stirred
limit, that allows neglecting the appearance of spatial coordinates in the
theory, so this becomes effectively reduced to a zeroth dimensional model. We
determine the long time behavior of such a model, making emphasis in one
special case in which it displays self-similar solutions. In particular these
calculations answer the question of how the system gets ordered, with all
particles and clusters moving in the same direction, in the long time. We
compare our analytical results with direct numerical simulations of the
stochastic process and both corroborate its predictions and check its

significant. We discuss the effects of TKF on the size of convection zone and
find that the TKF may help to solve the solar abundance problem. The solar
abundance problem is that, with new abundances, the solar convection zone
depth, sound speed in the radiative interior, the helium abundance and density
in the convective envelope are not in agreement with helioseismic inversions.
We have done Monte Carlo simulations on solar convective envelope models with
different profile of TKF to test the effects. The solar abundance problem is
revealed in the standard solar convective envelope model with AGSS09
composition, which shows significant differences ($\rm{\sim 10 %}$) on density
from the helioseicmic inversions, but the differences in the model with old
composition GN93 is small ($\rm{\sim 0.5 %}$). In the testing models with
different imposed TKF, it is found that the density profile is sensitive to the
value of TKF at the base of convective envelope and insensitive to the
structure of TKF in the convection zone. Required value of turbulent kinetic
luminosity at the base is about $\rm{-13%\sim-19%L_{\odot}}$. Comparing with
the 3D-simulations, this value is plausible. This study is for the solar
convective envelope only. The evolutionary solar models with TKF are required
for investigating its effects on the solar interior structure below the
convection zone and the whole solar abundance problem, but the profile of TKF
in the overshoot region is needed.

$\sigma^2$ the variance of the unknown mixture, we prove that
$\Theta(\sigma^{12})$ samples are necessary and sufficient to estimate each

arbitrary dimension $d>1$ up to a (provably necessary) logarithmic loss in $d$
using a novel---yet simple---dimensionality reduction technique. We further
identify several interesting special cases where the sample complexity is
notably smaller than our optimal worst-case bound. For instance, if the means
of the two components are separated by $\Omega(\sigma)$ the sample complexity
reduces to $O(\sigma^2)$ and this is again optimal.
  Our results also apply to learning each component of the mixture up to small
error in total variation distance, where our algorithm gives strong
improvements in sample complexity over previous work. We also extend our lower

any setting where the magnitude of financial transactions is sufficiently
large. Those constraints have been traditionally modeled in mechanism design as
\emph{hard budget}, i.e., mechanism is not allowed to charge agents more than a
certain amount. Yet, real auction systems (such as Google AdWords) allow more
sophisticated constraints on agents' ability to pay, such as \emph{average
budgets}. In this work, we investigate the design of Pareto optimal and
incentive compatible auctions for agents with \emph{constrained quasi-linear
utilities}, which captures more realistic models of liquidity constraints that
the agents may have. Our result applies to a very general class of allocation
constraints known as polymatroidal environments, encompassing many settings of
interest such as multi-unit auctions, matching markets, video-on-demand and
advertisement systems.
  Our design is based Ausubel's \emph{clinching framework}. Incentive
compatibility and feasibility with respect to ability-to-pay constraints are
direct consequences of the clinching framework. Pareto-optimality, on the other
hand, is considerably more challenging, since the no-trade condition that
characterizes it depends not only on whether agents have their budgets
exhausted or not, but also on prices {at} which the goods are allocated. In
order to get a handle on those prices, we introduce novel concepts of dropping
prices and saturation. These concepts lead to our main structural result which
is a characterization of the tight sets in the clinching auction outcome and
its relation to dropping prices.

distances between arbitrary numbers of node pairs. Since computation of exact
distances between all node-pairs of a large graph, e.g., 10M nodes and up, is
prohibitively expensive both in computational time and storage space, distance
approximation is often used in place of exact computation. In this paper, we
present a novel and scalable distance oracle that leverages the hyperbolic core
of real-world large graphs for fast and scalable distance approximation. We
show empirically that the proposed oracle significantly outperforms prior
oracles on a random set of test cases drawn from public domain graph libraries.
There are two sets of prior work against which we benchmark our approach. The
first set, which often outperforms other oracles, employs embedding of the
graph into low dimensional Euclidean spaces with carefully constructed
hyperbolic distances, but provides no guarantees on the distance estimation
error. The second set leverages Gromov-type tree contraction of the graph with
the additive error guaranteed not to exceed $2\delta\log{n}$, where $\delta$ is
the hyperbolic constant of the graph. We show that our proposed oracle 1) is
significantly faster than those oracles that use hyperbolic embedding (first
set) with similar approximation error and, perhaps surprisingly, 2) exhibits
substantially lower average estimation error compared to Gromov-like tree
contractions (second set). We substantiate our claims through numerical
computations on a collection of a dozen real world networks and synthetic test
cases from multiple domains, ranging in size from 10s of thousand to 10s of

resulting from a magnetic quadrupole, including an hyperbolic flux tube (HFT)
configuration which is relatively stable at the time scale of the flare ($\sim
1-2$ hours). A strong QSL, which corresponds to some highly sheared arcades

matter (DM) can be observed via astrophysical gamma rays because photons are
produced in various DM annihilation or decay processes, either as broad-band or
line emission, or because of the secondary processes of charged particles in
the final stages of the annihilations or the decays. The energy range of the
former processes is accessible by current ground-based Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs, like H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS). The strengths
of this technique are: a) the expected DM gamma-ray spectra show peculiar
features like bumps, spikes and cutoff that make them clearly distinguishable
from the smoother astrophysical spectra, b) the expected DM spectrum is
universal and therefore by observing two or more DM targets with the same
spectrum, a clear identification (besides detection) of DM would be enabled.
The role of IACTs may gain more importance in the future as the results from
the LHC may hint to a DM particle with mass at the TeV or above, where the
IACTs sensitivity is unsurpassed by other experiments. In this contribution, a
review of the search for DM with the current generation of IACT will be

and core accretion rates. It is shown that in order to form Uranus-like and
Neptune-like planets in terms of final mass and solid-to-gas ratio, very
specific conditions are required. We also show that when recently proposed high
solid accretion rates are assumed, along with solid surface densities about 10
times those in the minimum-mass solar nebula, the challenge in forming Uranus
and Neptune at large radial distances is no longer the formation timescale, but
is rather finding agreement with the final mass and composition of these
planets. In fact, these conditions are more likely to lead to gas-giant
planets. Scattering of planetesimals by the forming planetary core is found to
be an important effect at the larger distances. Our study emphasizes how (even
slightly) different conditions in the protoplanetary disk and the birth
environment of the planetary embryos can lead to the formation of very
different planets in terms of final masses and compositions (solid-to-gas
ratios), which naturally explains the large diversity of intermediate-mass

condition of the system matrices and without applying any sparsity constraint
on the signal statistics. Further, we can estimate the DOAs of the sources by

The techniques which are suggested have some generalizations for $(1,t,n)$-LRM,

  Log-Density",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by
identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require
to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular
clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of
the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation
and then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not
necessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect
two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to
directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density
estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus
is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point
algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean
shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We
empirically show that the proposed clustering method works much better than the
mean shift especially for high-dimensional data. Experimental results further
indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing clustering methods.

  arXiv:1304.4151",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Accurate state estimation is of paramount importance to maintain the power
system operating in a secure and efficient state. The recently identified
coordinated data injection attacks to meter measurements can bypass the current
security system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional
wisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing meter measurements to evade
malicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend
against false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological
information. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from
attackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set
of state variables. We first investigate from the attackers' perspective the
necessary condition to perform injection attack. Based on the arguments, we
characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables
with minimum cost, as a well-studied Steiner tree problem in a graph. Besides,
we also propose a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of
covert topological information and secure meter measurements when either method
alone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective. A mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed
defending strategy. To tackle the NP-hardness of the problem, a tree
pruning-based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution
in polynomial time. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending
mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.

of parabolic parameters, and there are bifurcations between hyperbolic

the number of hyperbolic components of any period of the multicorns. Since

reported a slow power law decay in the hydration dynamics of a DNA molecule.
Such a power law has neither been observed in computer simulations nor in some

collective ion contribution because in experiments DNA is immersed in a buffer
solution, and also from groove bound water and lastly from DNA dynamics itself.

of dynamic structure factors of the solution. We use mode coupling theory to
calculate analytically the time dependence of collective ionic contribution. A
power law decay in seen to originate from an interplay between long range
probe-ion direct correlation function and ion-ion dynamic structure factor.
Although the power law decay is reminiscent of Debye-Falkenhagen effect yet
solvation dynamics is dominated by ion atmosphere relaxation times at longer
length scales (small wave number) than in electrolyte friction. We further
discuss why this power law may not originate from water motions which have been
computed by molecular dynamics simulations. Lastly, we propose several

of alpha helices. In contrast, 8M DMSO solution unfolds alpha helices first,
followed by the separation of beta-sheets for majority of proteins. Sequence of

gave several lectures in Brazil. Invited by Theodoro Ramos to work in S\~ao
Paulo, he preferred to stay in Rome and went to the USA in 1938. However, Fermi
recommended Gleb Wataghin to come in his place. Wataghin made history in
Brazil, becoming one of the first Professors of the future S\~ao Paulo
University. Besides his relevance to the History of Science, Fermi eventually
leaved an indelible mark on the creation and institutionalization of national
scientific research due to the indication of Wataghin. Despite this fact, very
little is known about Fermi's trip to Brazil. This work tries to reconstruct
the fullest possible steps of the famous Italian physicist in our lands.

mechanism of generating primordial perturbations is achieved by varying the
speed of light in a primordial epoch. This yields an alternative to inflation
for explaining the formation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the
large scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The initial value horizon and
flatness problems in cosmology are solved. The model predicts primordial scalar
and tensor fluctuation spectral indices $n_s=0.96$ and $n_t=- 0.04$,
respectively. We make use of the $\delta{\cal N}$ formalism to identify
signatures of primordial nonlinear fluctuations, and this allows the VSL model
to be distinguished from inflationary models. In particular, we find that the
parameter $f_{\rm NL}=5$ in the variable speed of light cosmology. The value of
the parameter $g_{\rm NL}$ evolves during the primordial era and shows a
running behavior.

  Queries and Conditional Sampling",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a basic problem of approximating the size of an unknown set $S$ in a
known universe $U$. We consider two versions of the problem. In both versions
the algorithm can specify subsets $T\subseteq U$. In the first version, which
we refer to as the group query or subset query version, the algorithm is told
whether $T\cap S$ is non-empty. In the second version, which we refer to as the
subset sampling version, if $T\cap S$ is non-empty, then the algorithm receives
a uniformly selected element from $T\cap S$. We study the difference between
these two versions under different conditions on the subsets that the algorithm
may query/sample, and in both the case that the algorithm is adaptive and the
case where it is non-adaptive. In particular we focus on a natural family of
allowed subsets, which correspond to intervals, as well as variants of this
family.

ankle to the highest energies are briefly reviewed. A knee of heavy primaries
and an ankle of light primaries have been observed at about 10^{17} eV. The
light component starts to dominate the flux at the ankle in the all particle
spectrum at about 4x10^{18} eV and sheds light on the transition from galactic
to extragalactic cosmic rays. The prime question at the highest energies is
about the origin of the flux suppression observed at E > 4x10^{19} eV. Is this
the long awaited GZK-effect or the exhaustion of sources? The key to answering
this question is again the still largely unknown mass composition at the
highest energies. Data from different observatories don't quite agree and
common efforts have been started to settle that question. The high level of
isotropy observed even at the highest energies challenges models of a proton
dominated composition if extragalactic magnetic fields are on the order of a
few nG or less. We will discuss the experimental and theoretical progress in
the field and the prospects for the next decade.

Security is assumed to be ensured by the random pairwise key predistribution
scheme of Chan, Perrig, and Song, and unreliable wireless links are represented
by independent on/off channels. Modeling the network by an intersection of a
random $K$-out graph and an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph, we present scaling
conditions (on the number of nodes, the scheme parameter $K$, and the
probability of a wireless channel being on) such that the resulting graph
contains no nodes with degree less than $k$ with high probability, when the
number of nodes gets large. Results are given in the form of zero-one laws and
are shown to improve the previous results by Ya\u{g}an and Makowski on the
absence of isolated nodes (i.e., absence of nodes with degree zero). Via
simulations, the established zero-one laws are shown to hold also for the
property of $k$-connectivity; i.e., the property that graph remains connected
despite the deletion of any $k-1$ nodes or edges.
