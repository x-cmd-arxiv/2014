Crabs caught by the general public had more injuries than crabs caught in

to blame. Since there is much evidence that such injuries have negative impacts
on the survival and reproductive success of the shore crab, this is taken as
evidence of non-lethal injury from humans having a population-level effect on
these animals. Questionnaire data demonstrated a public lack of awareness and
want for information, which was then used to obtain funding to produce a

shown that as the network size n goes to infinity, if the minimum length of

even thousands of such connections, and many of these connections do not
correspond to real friendships or more generally to accounts that users

communities: activity-based, topic-based, and interaction-based. We analyze a

associated with these weightings. We show that the communities obtained in the

community detection in online social networks, and that different questions can

nearby (4-30 Mpc), star-forming galaxies based on ACS source lists generated by
the Hubble Legacy Archive. Comparisons are made with other recently generated
cluster catalogs demonstrating that the HLA-generated catalogs are of similar
quality, but in general do not go as deep. A typical cluster luminosity
function can be approximated by a power-law, $dN/dL\propto L^{\alpha}$, with an
average value for $\alpha$ of $-2.37$ and RMS scatter = 0.18 when using the
F814W (""$I$"") band. We find that galaxies with high rates of star formation (or
equivalently, with the brightest or largest numbers of clusters) have a slight
tendency to have shallower values of $\alpha$. In particular, the Antennae
galaxy (NGC4038/39), a merging system with a relatively high star formation
rate, has the second flattest luminosity function in the sample. A tentative
correlation may also be present between Hubble Type and values of $\alpha$, in
the sense that later type galaxies (i.e., Sd and Sm) appear to have flatter
luminosity functions. Hence, while there do appear to be some weak
correlations, the relative similarity in the values of $\alpha$ for a large
number of star-forming galaxies suggests that, to first order, the LFs are
fairly universal. We examine the bright end of the luminosity functions and
find evidence for a downturn, although it only pertains to about 1% of the
clusters. Our uniform database results in a small scatter ($\approx$0.4 to 0.5
mag) in the correlation between the magnitude of the brightest cluster
($M_\mathrm{brightest}$) and log of the number of clusters brighter than
$M_{I}=-9$ (log N). We also examine the magnitude of the brightest cluster vs.

stars born in the innermost disk tend to dominate the innermost regions of the
boxy bulge, while stars originating closer to the OLR are preferentially found
in the outer regions of the boxy/peanut structure; (iii) stellar birth radii
are imprinted in the bulge kinematics, the larger the birth radii of stars
ending up in the bulge, the greater their rotational support and the higher
their line-of- sight velocity dispersions (but note that this last trend
depends on the bar viewing angle); (iv) the higher the classical

melt a significant part or even the entire mantle of a terrestrial body, giving
rise to a global magma ocean. [...] Assuming fractional crystallization of the
magma ocean, dense cumulates are produced close to the surface, largely due to
iron enrichment in the evolving magma ocean liquid (Elkins-Tanton et al.,
2003). A gravitationally unstable mantle thus forms, which is prone to
overturn. We investigate the cumulate overturn and its influence on the thermal
evolution of Mars using mantle convection simulations in 2D cylindrical
geometry. We present a suite of simulations using different initial conditions
and a strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. We assume that all radiogenic
heat sources have been enriched during the freezing-phase of the magma ocean in
the uppermost 50 km and that the initial steam-atmosphere created by the
degassing of the freezing magma ocean was rapidly lost, implying that the
surface temperature is set to present-day values. In this case, a stagnant lid
forms rapidly on top of the convective interior preventing the uppermost dense
cumulates to sink, even when allowing for a plastic yielding mechanism. Below
this dense stagnant lid, the mantle chemical gradient settles to a stable
configuration. The convection pattern is dominated by small-scale structures,
which are difficult to reconcile with the large-scale volcanic features
observed over Mars' surface and partial melting ceases in less than 900 Ma.
Assuming that the stagnant lid can break because of additional mechanisms and
allowing the uppermost dense layer to overturn, a stable density gradient is
obtained, with the densest material and the entire amount of heat sources lying
above the CMB. This stratification leads to a strong overheating of the
lowermost mantle [...]

Consider the following forest-fire model on $B_n$: Each vertex can be ""vacant""
or ""occupied"". At time $0$ all vertices are vacant. Then the process is
governed by two opposing mechanisms: Vertices become occupied at rate $1$,
independently for all vertices. Independently thereof and independently for all
vertices, ""lightning"" hits vertices at rate $\lambda(n) > 0$. When a vertex is
hit by lightning, its occupied cluster instantaneously becomes vacant.
  Now suppose that $\lambda(n)$ decays exponentially in $n$ but much more
slowly than $1/|B_n|$. We show that then there exist a supercritical time
$\tau$ and $\epsilon > 0$ such that the forest-fire model on $B_n$ between time
$0$ and time $\tau + \epsilon$ tends to the following process on $T$ as $n$
goes to infinity: At time $0$ all vertices are vacant. Between time $0$ and
time $\tau$ vertices become occupied at rate $1$, independently for all

time $\tau$ and time $\tau + \epsilon$ vertices again become occupied at rate

absorption lines of MgII, FeII, and HI. Results: In contrast to previous
representations, our new picture of the local interstellar medium consists of a
single, monolithic cloud that surrounds the Sun in all directions and accounts
for most of the matter present in the first 50 parsecs around the Sun. The
cloud fills the space around us out to about 9 pc in most directions, although
its boundary is very irregular with possibly a few extensions up to 20 pc. The
cloud does not behave like a rigid body: gas within the cloud is being
differentially decelerated in the direction of motion, and the cloud is
expanding in directions perpendicular to this flow, much like a squashed
balloon. Average HI volume densities inside the cloud vary between 0.03 and 0.1
cm-3 over different directions. Metals appear to be significantly depleted onto
grains, and there is a steady increase in depletion from the rear of the cloud
to the apex of motion. There is no evidence that changes in the ionizing
radiation influence the apparent abundances. Secondary absorption components
are detected in 60% of the sight lines. Almost all of them appear to be
interior to the volume occupied by the main cloud. Half of the sight lines
exhibit a secondary component moving at about -7.2 km/s with respect to the
main component, which may be the signature of a shock propagating toward the
cloud's interior.

decomposition we identify a network of interrelated datasets from a large

driving forces for determining relevant datasets, the found relationships were
richer and the model-based search was more accurate than keyword search; it

in space and time of human concentrations and mobility in general. Besides its
theoretical interest, describing mobility is of great importance for a number
of practical applications ranging from the forecast of disease spreading to the
design of new spaces in urban environments. While classical data sources, such
as surveys or census, have a limited level of geographical resolution (e.g.,
districts, municipalities, counties are typically used) or are restricted to
generic workdays or weekends, the data coming from mobile devices can be
precisely located both in time and space. Most previous works have used a
single data source to study human mobility patterns. Here we perform instead a
cross-check analysis by comparing results obtained with data collected from
three different sources: Twitter, census and cell phones. The analysis is
focused on the urban areas of Barcelona and Madrid, for which data of the three
types is available. We assess the correlation between the datasets on different
aspects: the spatial distribution of people concentration, the temporal
evolution of people density and the mobility patterns of individuals. Our
results show that the three data sources are providing comparable information.
Even though the representativeness of Twitter geolocated data is lower than
that of mobile phone and census data, the correlations between the population
density profiles and mobility patterns detected by the three datasets are close
to one in a grid with cells of 2x2 and 1x1 square kilometers. This level of
correlation supports the feasibility of interchanging the three data sources at
the spatio-temporal scales considered.

orbits, in a centrally-dominated potential. The random fluctuations of the
discrete stellar background cause small potential perturbations, which
accelerate the evolution of orbital angular momentum by resonant relaxation.
This drives many phenomena near MBHs, such as extreme mass-ratio gravitational
wave inspirals, the warping of accretion disks, and the formation of exotic
stellar populations. We present here a formal statistical mechanics framework
to analyze such systems, where the background potential is described as a
correlated Gaussian noise. We derive the leading order, phase-averaged 3D
stochastic Hamiltonian equations of motion, for evolving the orbital elements
of a test star, and obtain the effective Fokker-Planck equation for a general
correlated Gaussian noise, for evolving the stellar distribution function. We
show that the evolution of angular momentum depends critically on the temporal
smoothness of the background potential fluctuations. Smooth noise has a maximal
variability frequency $\nu_{\max}$. We show that in the presence of such noise,
the evolution of the normalized angular momentum $j=\sqrt{1-e^{2}}$ of a
relativistic test star, undergoing Schwarzschild (in-plane) General
Relativistic precession with frequency $\nu_{GR}/j^{2}$, is exponentially
suppressed for $j<j_{b}$, where $\nu_{GR}/j_{b}^{2}\sim\nu_{\max}$, due to the
adiabatic invariance of the precession against the slowly varying random
background torques. This results in an effective Schwarzschild
precession-induced barrier in angular momentum. When $j_{b}$ is large enough,
this barrier can have significant dynamical implications for processes near the
MBH.

quantize-and-forward (GQF) scheme in the slow fading Multiple Access Relay
Channel (MARC) where the relay has no channel state information (CSI) of the
relay-to-destination link. Relay listens to the channel in the first slot of
the transmission block and cooperatively transmits to the destination in the
second slot. In order to investigate the performance of the GQF, the following
steps have been taken: 1)The GQF scheme is applied to establish the achievable
rate regions of the discrete memoryless half-duplex MARC and the corresponding
additive white Gaussian noise channel. This scheme is developed based on the
generalization of the Quantize-and-Forward (QF) scheme and single block with
two slots coding structure. 2) as the general performance measure of the slow
fading channel, the common outage probability and the expected sum rate (total
throughput) of the GQF scheme have been characterized. The numerical examples
show that when the relay has no access to the CSI of the relay-destination
link, the GQF scheme outperforms other relaying schemes, e.g., classic
compress-and-forward (CF), decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward
(AF). 3) for a MAC channel with heterogeneous user channels and
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, individual outage probability and total
throughput of the GQF scheme are also obtained and shown to outperform the
classic CF scheme.

either the plane $\mathbb{C}$ or to the cylinder $\mathbb{A}$ and in the latter

this rules out the existence of trapped regions with cylindrical boundary. In
the second part of the article, we restrict our attention to asymptotically
flat data $(M,g,k)$ and show that, in that setting, the existence of an

scale, in this paper we construct a new class of large field inflaton
potentials where the inflaton starts with a power law potential; after initial
period of relative fast roll that lasts until after a few e-folds inside the
horizon, it transits to the attractor of the slow roll part of the potential
with a lower power. Due to the initial fast roll stages of inflation, we find a
suppression in scalar primordial power at large scales and at the same time the
choice of the potential can provide us a tensor primordial spectrum with high
amplitude. This suppression in scalar power with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio
helps us to reconcile the Planck and BICEP2 data in a single framework. We find
that a transition from a cubic to quadratic form of inflaton potential
generates an appropriate suppression in power of scalar primordial spectrum
that provides significant improvement in fit compared to power law model when
compared with Planck and BICEP2 data together. We calculate the extent of
non-Gaussianity, specifically, the bispectrum for the best fit potential and
show that it is consistent with Planck bispectrum constraints.

cooperation. An efficient information exchange is likewise important,
especially on structured populations, where interactions between players are
limited. Motivated by these two facts, we explore the role of facilitators in
social dilemmas on networks. Facilitators are here mirrors to their neighbors
-- they cooperate with cooperators and defect with defectors -- but they do not
participate in the exchange of strategies. As such, in addition to introducing
direct reciprocity, they also obstruct information exchange. In well-mixed
populations, facilitators favor the replacement and invasion of defection by
cooperation as long as their number exceeds a critical value. In structured
populations, on the other hand, there exists a delicate balance between the
benefits of reciprocity and the deterioration of information exchange.
Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of social dilemmas on various interaction
networks reveal that there exists an optimal interplay between reciprocity and
information exchange, which sets in only when a small number of facilitators
occupies the main hubs of the scale-free network. The drawbacks of missing
cooperative hubs are more than compensated by reciprocity and, at the same
time, the compromised information exchange is routed via the auxiliary hubs
with only marginal losses in effectivity. These results indicate that it is not
always optimal for the main hubs to become ''leaders of the masses'', but
rather to exploit their highly connected state to promote tit-for-tat-like
behavior.

identify lattice instabilities due to soft-phonon modes, and describe two
mechanisms leading to gap opening in the Dirac-fermion electronic spectrum of
these systems: symmetry breaking, connected with the lattice instabilities, and
partial incorporation of an $sp^3$-hybrid character in the covalent-bonding
network of a buckled hydrogenated $\alpha$-graphyne lattice that retains the
symmetries of the parent pristine $\alpha$-graphyne. In the case of an
oxygen-functionalized $\alpha$-graphyne structure, each O atom binds
asymmetrically to two twofold-coordinated C atoms, breaking inversion and
mirror symmetries, and leading to the opening of a sizeable gap of 0.22 eV at
the Dirac point. Generally, mirror symmetries are found to suffice for the
occurrence of gapless Dirac cones in these $\alpha$-graphyne systems, even in
the absence of inversion symmetry centers. Moreover, we analyze the gapless and
gapped Dirac cones of pristine and functionalized $\alpha$-graphynes from the
perspective of the dispersion relations for massless and massive free Dirac
fermions. We find that mirror-symmetry breaking mimics a Dirac-fermion
mass-generation mechanism in the oxygen-functionalized $\alpha$-graphyne,
leading to gap opening and to isotropic electronic dispersions with a rather
small electron-hole asymmetry. In the hydrogen-functionalized case, we find
that carriers show a remarkable anisotropy, behaving as massless fermions along

formation history, of different types of galaxies. All these trends depend on
n; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. Late-type galaxies (n_r

a result of their two-component (bulge-disk) nature, though stellar population
gradients within each component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role.
All galaxies show a substantial decrease in R_e with wavelength. This is
strongest for early-types (n_r > 2.5), even though they maintain constant n
with wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of different
stellar populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events.
Processes leading to structures with larger R_e must be associated with lower
metallicity or younger stellar populations. This appears to rule out the
formation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an important
mechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.

gas-embedded star clusters. Using a simple three-component (i.e. one gas and
two stellar components) model, we compare the rates of mass segregation due to
two-body relaxation, accretion from the interstellar medium, and gas dynamical
friction in both the supersonic and subsonic regimes. Using observational data
in the literature, we apply our analytic predictions to two different
astrophysical environments, namely galactic nuclei and young open star
clusters. Our analytic results are then tested using numerical simulations
performed with the NBSymple code, modified by an additional deceleration term
to model the damping effects of the gas.
  The results of our simulations are in reasonable agreement with our analytic
predictions, and demonstrate that gas damping can significantly accelerate the
rate of mass segregation. A stable state of approximate energy equilibrium
cannot be achieved in our model if gas damping is present, even if Spitzer's
Criterion is satisfied. This instability drives the continued dynamical
decoupling and subsequent ejection (and/or collisions) of the more massive
population. Unlike two-body relaxation, gas damping causes overall cluster
contraction, reducing both the core and half-mass radii. If the cluster is mass
segregated (and/or the gas density is highest at the cluster centre), the
latter contracts faster than the former, accelerating the rate of core
collapse.

surface density profile of the disc, $\Sigma \propto R^\beta$ with $\beta =
-2$. Recently, however, speculations about this profile arose. In particular,
it now seems to be better described by a sort of broken power-law. By means of
both analytical arguments and numerical N-body modelling, we show that such a
broken power-law profile is a natural consequence of the two-body relaxation of
the disc which is, due to small relative velocities of stars on nearby
co-planar Keplerian orbits around the SMBH, effective enough to affect the
evolution of the disc on time-scales comparable to its estimated age. In the
inner, densest part of the disc, the profile becomes rather flat ($\beta ~ -1$)
while the outer parts keep imprints of the initial state. Our numerical models
show that the observed projected surface density profile of the young stellar
disc can result from two-body relaxation driven evolution of a disc with
initial single power-law profile with $-2 < \beta < -1.5$. In addition, we
suggest that two-body relaxation may have caused a significant radial migration
of the S-stars towards the central SMBH, thus playing an important role in
their formation scenario.

accelerates pockets of gas in which stars form, yielding populations of stars

enough velocities to escape the galaxy. These stellar population signatures can
serve to identify past jet activity as well as jet-induced star formation.

binary neutron star mergers we critically evaluate, analytically and through

formed hyper-massive neutron star can allow the collimated relativistic outflow
that follows its collapse to actually produce a sGRB or not. Upon comparison
with the observed sGRB duration distribution, we find that collapse cannot be
significantly delayed (<=100 ms) before the outflow is choked, thus limiting
the possibility that long-lived hyper-massive remnants can account for these

objects with different evolutionary stages and metallicities and conducted
high-resolution echelle spectroscopy. In most cases, we succeeded in detecting
the weak signals from the outer nebular shell which are attached to the main
line emission from the bright nebular rim. Next to the measurement of the
motion of the rim gas by decomposition of the main line components into
Gaussians, we were able to measure separately, for most objects for the first
time, the gas velocity immediately behind the leading shock of the shell, i.e.
the post-shock velocity. We more than doubled the number of objects for which
the velocities of both rim and shell are known and confirm that the overall
expansion of planetary nebulae is accelerating with time. There are, however,
differences between the expansion behaviour of the shell and the rim. This
observed distinct velocity evolution of both rim and shell is explained by
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, at least qualitatively. Because of the
time-dependent boundary conditions, a planetary nebula will never evolve into a
simple self-similar expansion. Also the metal-poor objects behave as theory
predicts: The post-shock velocities are higher and the rim flow velocities are
equal or even lower compared to disk objects at similar evolutionary stage. We
detected, for the first time, in some objects an asymmetric expansion
behaviour: The relative expansions between rim and shell appear to be different

between the neutralino scattering through the exchange of the lightest CP-even

values of $m_A$, the tree-level contribution from the light Higgs exchange
cancels the contribution from the heavy Higgs, so the scattering cross section
vanishes. We denote these configurations as blind spots, since they provide a

tau-model, with SFR ~ exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the SFH of our SPH

systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A
one-parameter lin-exp model, with SFR ~ t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful
on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most
actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, ""red and dead"" galaxies. We
introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp
after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We
test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1)
the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar
population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full SPH star
formation histories using the FSPS code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with
tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by ~ 0.2 dex, overestimate
population ages by ~ 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate sSFR by ~ 0.05 dex. Fits with
lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best
results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters
of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than
1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our

behind patterns of cognitive brain activity. This paper proposes a new approach
to infer such interaction mechanisms from electroencephalographic (EEG) data
using a new estimator of directed information (DI) called logit shrinkage
optimized directed information assessment (L-SODA). Unlike previous directed
information measures applied to neural decoding, L-SODA uses shrinkage
regularization on multinomial logistic regression to deal with the high
dimensionality of multi-channel EEG signals and the small sizes of many
real-world datasets. It is designed to make few a priori assumptions and can
handle both non-linear and non-Gaussian flows among electrodes. Our L-SODA
estimator of the DI is accompanied by robust statistical confidence intervals
on the true DI that make it especially suitable for hypothesis testing on the
information flow patterns. We evaluate our work in the context of two different
problems where interaction localization is used to determine highly interactive
areas for EEG signals spatially and temporally. First, by mapping the areas
that have high DI into Brodmann area, we identify that the areas with high DI
are associated with motor-related functions. We demonstrate that L-SODA
provides better accuracy for neural decoding of EEG signals as compared to
several state-of-the-art approaches on the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) EEG
motor activity dataset. Second, the proposed L-SODA estimator is evaluated on
the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database. We demonstrate that compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method provides better performance in
detecting the epileptic seizure.

focuses on the challenges encountered when extending the adaptive wavelet
method to the sphere and ensuring an efficient parallel implementation using
MPI. The wavelet method is implemented in Fortran95 with an emphasis on
computational efficiency and scales well up to O(10^2) processors for
load-unbalanced scenarios and up to at least O(10^3) processors for
load-balanced scenarios. The method is verified using standard smooth test
cases (Williamson et al. 1992) and a nonlinear test case proposed by (Galewsky

50 times in a challenging homogenous turbulence test case. The adaptive code is
about three times slower per active grid point than the equivalent non-adaptive

serve as the foundation on which to build a complete climate or weather model.

Dirac fermion and a singlet scalar. The scalar implements spontaneous symmetry
breaking in the dark sector, and is responsible for the communication between
dark matter and Standard Model particles through a coupling to the Higgs. These
interactions are supressed by the mixing between the scalar and the Higgs.
Therefore, the singlet fermionic dark matter is naturally a weakly interacting
massive particle (WIMP) and can explain the observed relic density. We show
that this model cannot produce the signal identified in the Fermi-LAT data.
Thus, we propose a modification in the model by introducing a new scalar
multiplet that carries electric charge and couples to the singlet scalar. It
enhances the annihilation into two photons and succeeds in producing the

array of $N$ antennas to one or multiple users [1]. In wireless communications,
the goal is to increase the signal power at the intended user and reduce
interference to non-intended users. A high signal power is achieved by
transmitting the same data signal from all antennas, but with different
amplitudes and phases, such that the signal components add coherently at the
user. Low interference is accomplished by making the signal components add
destructively at non-intended users. This corresponds mathematically to
designing beamforming vectors (that describe the amplitudes and phases) to have
large inner products with the vectors describing the intended channels and
small inner products with non-intended user channels.
  While it is fairly easy to design a beamforming vector that maximizes the
signal power at the intended user, it is difficult to strike a perfect balance
between maximizing the signal power and minimizing the interference leakage. In
fact, the optimization of multiuser transmit beamforming is generally a
nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard problem [2]. Nevertheless, this
lecture shows that the optimal transmit beamforming has a simple structure with
very intuitive properties and interpretations. This structure provides a
theoretical foundation for practical low-complexity beamforming schemes.

electrode materials are predicted using density functional theory calculations.
The utilization of the reversible LiBN2 + 2 Li+ + 2 e- -> Li3BN2
electrochemical cell reaction leads to a voltage of 3.62 V (vs Li/Li$^{+}$),
theoretical energy densities of 3251 Wh/kg and 5927 Wh/L, with capacities of
899 mAh/g and 1638 mAh/cm3, while the cell volume of alpha-Li3BN2 changes only
2.8% per two-electron transfer. These values are far superior to the best
existing or theoretically designed intercalation or conversion-based positive
electrode materials. For comparison, the theoretical energy density of a
Li-O2/peroxide battery is 3450 Wh/kg (including the weight of O2), that of a
Li-S battery is 2600 Wh/kg, that of Li3Cr(BO3)(PO4) (one of the best
designerintercalation materials) is 1700 Wh/kg, while already commercialized
LiCoO2 allows for 568 Wh/kg. alpha-Li3BN2 is also known as a good Li-ion
conductor with experimentally observed 3 mS/cm ionic conductivity and 78 kJ/mol
(~ 0.8 eV) activation energy of conduction. The attractive features of
alpha-LixBN2 (1<x<3) are based on a crystal lattice of 1D conjugated polymers
with -Li-N-B-N- repeating units. When some of the Li is deintercalated from
alpha-Li3BN2 the crystal becomes a metallic electron conductor, based on the
underlying 1D conjugated pi-electron system. Thus alpha-LixBN2 (1<x<3)
represents a new type of 1D conjugated polymers with great potential for energy
storage and other applications.

energy paths for transitions between states are carried out using a
noncollinear extension of the multiple-impurity Alexander-Anderson model and a
magnetic force theorem which is derived and used to evaluate the total energy
gradient with respect to orientation of magnetic moments -- an important tool
for efficient navigation on the energy surface. By using this force theorem,
the search for stable and metastable magnetic states as well as minimum energy
paths revealing the mechanism and activation energy of transitions can be
carried out efficiently. For Fe monolayer on W(110) surface, the model gives
magnetic moment as well as exchange coupling between nearest and next-nearest
neighbors that are in good agreement with previous density functional theory
calculations. When applied to nanoscale Fe islands on this surface, the
magnetic moment is predicted to be 10\% larger for atoms at the island rim,
explaining in part an experimentally observed trend in the energy barrier for
magnetization reversal in small islands. Surprisingly, the magnetic moment of
the atoms does not change much along the minimum energy path for the
transitions, which for islands containing more than 15 atom rows along either
$[001]$ or $[1\bar{1}0]$ directions involves the formation of a thin, temporary
domain wall. A noncollinear magnetic state is identified in a $7\times 7$
atomic row Fe island where the magnetic moments are arranged in an antivortex
configuration with the central ones pointing out of the $(110)$ plane. This
illustrates how the model can describe complicated exchange interactions even
though it contains only a few parameters. The minimum energy path between this
antivortex state and the collinear ground state is also calculated and the
thermal stability of the antivortex state estimated.

that a code idiom is a syntactic fragment that recurs across projects and has a
single semantic role. Idioms may have metavariables, such as the body of a for
loop. Modern IDEs commonly provide facilities for manually defining idioms and
inserting them on demand, but this does not help programmers to write idiomatic
code in languages or using libraries with which they are unfamiliar. We present
HAGGIS, a system for mining code idioms that builds on recent advanced
techniques from statistical natural language processing, namely, nonparametric
Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars. We apply HAGGIS to several
of the most popular open source projects from GitHub. We present a wide range
of evidence that the resulting idioms are semantically meaningful,
demonstrating that they do indeed recur across software projects and that they
occur more frequently in illustrative code examples collected from a Q&A site.
Manual examination of the most common idioms indicate that they describe
important program concepts, including object creation, exception handling, and

rather straightforward, soft-output minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection

partition information and its transmission over a noise-free Boolean
multi-access channel. The objective of transmission is not message restoration,
but to partition active users into distinct groups so that they can,
subsequently, transmit their messages without collision. We first calculate (by
mutual information) the amount of information needed for the partitioning
without channel effects, and then propose two different coding schemes to
obtain achievable transmission rates over the channel. The first one is the
brute force method, where the codebook design is based on centralized source
coding; the second method uses random coding where the codebook is generated
randomly and optimal Bayesian decoding is employed to reconstruct the
partition. Both methods shed light on the internal structure of the partition
problem. A novel hypergraph formulation is proposed for the random coding
scheme, which intuitively describes the information in terms of a strong
coloring of a hypergraph induced by a sequence of channel operations and
interactions between active users. An extended Fibonacci structure is found for
a simple, but non-trivial, case with two active users. A comparison between
these methods and group testing is conducted to demonstrate the uniqueness of
our problem.

the prediction of unknown or future interactions. Popular approaches, including
the stochastic block model, assume edges are unweighted, which limits their
utility by throwing away potentially useful information. We introduce the
`weighted stochastic block model' (WSBM), which generalizes the stochastic
block model to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential family
distribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges,
allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weights
are discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm for
efficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent block

posteriori} without requiring additional full-order-model solves. The technique
is analogous to mesh-adaptive $h$-refinement: it enriches the reduced-basis
space online by `splitting' a given basis vector into several vectors with
disjoint support. The splitting scheme is defined by a tree structure
constructed offline via recursive $k$-means clustering of the state variables
using snapshot data. The method identifies the vectors to split online using a
dual-weighted-residual approach that aims to reduce error in an output quantity
of interest. The resulting method generates a hierarchy of subspaces online
without requiring large-scale operations or full-order-model solves. Further,
it enables the reduced-order model to satisfy \emph{any prescribed error
tolerance} regardless of its original fidelity, as a completely refined
reduced-order model is mathematically equivalent to the original full-order
model. Experiments on a parameterized inviscid Burgers equation highlight the
ability of the method to capture phenomena (e.g., moving shocks) not contained
in the span of the original reduced basis.

modeling biological networks, such as e.g. signaling, metabolic or gene
networks. An ANIMO model is essentially the sum of a network topology and a
number of interaction parameters. The topology describes the interactions
between biological entities in form of a graph, while the parameters determine
the speed of occurrence of such interactions. When a mismatch is observed
between the behavior of an ANIMO model and experimental data, we want to update
the model so that it explains the new data. In general, the topology of a model
can be expanded with new (known or hypothetical) nodes, and enables it to match
experimental data. However, the unrestrained addition of new parts to a model
causes two problems: models can become too complex too fast, to the point of
being intractable, and too many parts marked as ""hypothetical"" or ""not known""
make a model unrealistic. Even if changing the topology is normally the easier
task, these problems push us to try a better parameter fit as a first step, and
resort to modifying the model topology only as a last resource. In this paper
we show the support added in ANIMO to ease the task of expanding the knowledge
on biological networks, concentrating in particular on the parameter settings.

the sensitivity to the heavy DM coupling is lost. Finally, the detection of

sections. After presenting the rationale of our studies, we discuss the event

increasing petrologic type as predicted by the onion-shell model in which types
3 to 5 are arranged in concentric layers around a type 6 core. Some type 4
chondrites cooled slower than some type 6 chondrites and type 3 chondrites did
not cool faster than other types, contrary to the onion-shell model. Cloudy
taenite particle sizes, which range from 40 to 120 nm, are inversely correlated
with metallographic cooling rates and show that the latter were not compromised
by shock heating. The three H4 chondrites that were used to develop the
onion-shell model, Ste. Marguerite, Beaver Creek, and Forest Vale, cooled
through 500 C at ~5000 C/Myr. Our thermal modeling shows that these rates are
50 times higher than could be achieved in a body that was heated by 26Al and
cooled without disturbance by impact. Published Ar-Ar ages do not decrease
systematically with increasing petrologic type but do correlate inversely with
cloudy taenite particle size suggesting that impact mixing decreased during
metamorphism. Metal and silicate compositions in regolith breccias show that
impacts mixed material after metamorphism without causing significant heating.

application of cellular automata in bioinformatics is a virgin field in
research. None of the researchers has tried to relate the major problems in
bioinformatics and find a common solution. Extensive literature surveys were
conducted. We have considered some papers in various journals and conferences
for conduct of our research. This paper provides intuition towards relating
various problems in bioinformatics logically and tries to attain a common frame
work for addressing the same.

entanglement entropy below the transition temperature, they often serve as
classical or quantum self-correcting memory. In particular, their memory time
grows exponentially in the system size due to polynomially growing energy
barrier, as in the 2D Ising model and 4D Toric code. Here, we argue that this
is not always the case. We demonstrate that memory time of classical clock
model (a generalization of ferromagnet to q-state spins) may be polynomially
long even when the system possesses finite magnetization. This weak violation
of the Arrhenius law occurs above the percolation temperature, but below the
transition temperature, a regime where excitation droplets percolate the entire
lattice, yet the system retains a finite magnetization. We present numerical
evidences for polynomial scaling as well as analytical argument showing that
energy barrier is effectively suppressed and is only logarithmically divergent.
We also suggest an intriguing possibility of experimentally observing the
precession of magnetization vectors at experimentally relevant time scale.

""random crystal"" structures with defects. We find that for systems with $\alpha

simultaneously, promising super fast scans along with possible radiation dose
reductions. While the simultaneous CT capture model has already been proposed

the model through better initialization along with prior smoothing before
successive iterations of the iterative algorithms. We also elaborate the model
considering different X-ray source/detector configurations. Results show that
it is possible reconstruct a cross-section slice by considering only four
angular projections. With eight projections, the reconstruction is further
improved. The main promising matter about this method is that, all these
projections (i.e. four or eight) can in principle be captured simultaneously,
implying CT capture in one go just like a chest X-ray.

harvesting capabilities. The HAP implements the full-duplex through two
antennas: one for broadcasting wireless energy to users in the downlink and one
for receiving independent information from users via
time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) in the uplink at the same time. All users
can continuously harvest wireless power from the HAP until its transmission
slot, i.e., the energy causality constraint is modeled by assuming that energy
harvested in the future cannot be used for tranmission. Hence, latter users'
energy harvesting time is coupled with the transmission time of previous users.
Under this setup, we investigate the sum-throughput maximization (STM) problem
and the total-time minimization (TTM) problem for the proposed multi-user
full-duplex wireless-powered network. The STM problem is proved to be a convex
optimization problem. The optimal solution strategy is then obtained in
closed-form expression, which can be computed with linear complexity. It is
also shown that the sum throughput is non-decreasing with increasing of the
number of users. For the TTM problem, by exploiting the properties of the
coupling constraints, we propose a two-step algorithm to obtain an optimal
solution. Then, for each problem, two suboptimal solutions are proposed and
investigated. Finally, the effect of user scheduling on STM and TTM are
investigated through simulations. It is also shown that different user
scheduling strategies should be used for STM and TTM.

densities and gas-like transport properties. These features are purposely
exploited in different contexts ranging from natural products
extraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. Large part of studies
concerns this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at
high Mach number where compressibility and thermodynamics strictly interact.
Despite the widespread use also at low Mach number, the turbulent mixing
properties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in
detail in this regime. This topic is addressed here by dealing with Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a coaxial jet of a slightly supercritical Van
der Waals fluid. Since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the Low Mach number
conditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based
on a suitable low-Mach number expansion of the governing equation. According to
experimental observations, the weakly supercritical regime is characterized by
the formation of finger-like structures-- the so-called ligaments --in the
shear layers separating the two streams. The mechanism of ligament formation at
vanishing Mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed
statistical characterization is provided. Ligaments always form whenever a high
density contrast occurs, independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. The
difference between real and perfect gas conditions is found in the ligament
small-scale structure. More intense density gradients and thinner interfaces
characterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior
of the perfect gas. A phenomenological interpretation is here provided on the
basis of the real gas thermodynamics properties.

quantization of the electron energy spectra caused by the confinement of the
electron motion in the direction perpendicular to the sample. The calculated
values of critical fields for different nanofilm thicknesses are analyzed in

in O-rich circumstellar shells and it is expected to be fairly abundant in the

nucleosynthesis and dust formation, we present a self-consistent exploration on
the Al$_2$O$_3$ production in the winds of AGB stars with progenitor masses
between $\sim$3 and 7 M$_{\odot}$ and metallicities in the range 0.0003 $\le$ Z
$\le$ 0.018. We find that Al$_2$O$_3$ particles form at radial distances from
the centre between $\sim2$ and 4 R$_*$ (depending on metallicity), which is in
agreement with recent interferometric observations of Galactic O-rich AGB
stars. The mass of Al$_2$O$_3$ dust is found to scale almost linearly with
metallicity, with solar metallicity AGBs producing the highest amount (about
10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$) of alumina dust. The Al$_2$O$_3$ grain size decreases
with decreasing metallicity (and initial stellar mass) and the maximum size of
the Al$_2$O$_3$ grains is $\sim$0.075 $\mu m$ for the solar metallicity models.
Interestingly, the strong depletion of gaseous Al observed in the
low-metallicity HBB AGB star HV 2576 seems to be consistent with the formation
of Al$_2$O$_3$ dust as predicted by our models. We suggest that the content of
Al may be used as a mass (and evolutionary stage) indicator in AGB stars

by Martins {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 84}, 011125(2011)] leads to the
appearance of an unusual active asymmetric phase, in which the system
sublattices are unequally populated. It differs from the usual CP only by the
fact that particles also interact with their next-nearest neighbor sites via a
distinct strength creation rate and for the inclusion of an inhibition effect,
proportional to the local density. Aimed at investigating the robustness of
such asymmetric phase, in this paper we study the influence of distinct
interactions for two bidimensional CPs. In the first model, the interaction
between first neighbors requires a minimal neighborhood of adjacent particles
for creating new offspring, whereas second neighbors interact as usual (e.g. at
least one neighboring particle is required). The second model takes the
opposite situation, in which the restrictive dynamics is in the interaction
between next-nearest neighbors sites. Both models are investigated under mean
field theory (MFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In similarity with results by
Martins {\it et. al.}, the inclusion of distinct sublattice interactions
maintain the occurrence of an asymmetric active phase and reentrant transition
lines. In contrast, remarkable differences are presented, such as discontinuous
phase transitions (even between the active phases), the appearance of
tricritical points and the stabilization of active phases under larger values
of control parameters. Finally, we have shown that the critical behaviors are
not altered due to the change of interactions, in which the absorbing
transitions belong to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, whereas
second-order active phase transitions belong to the Ising universality class.

applying a common Ba isotope mixture. We used high-quality VLT/UVES spectra and

leads to a lower Ba, but a higher Eu abundance. The resulting elemental ratio

  Compuational Physics",,"10.1016/j.jcp.2014.04.001",,"physics.comp-ph math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-order reconstruction schemes for the solution of hyperbolic conservation
laws in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates are revised in the finite volume
approach. The formulation employs a piecewise polynomial approximation to the
zone-average values to reconstruct left and right interface states from within
a computational zone to arbitrary order of accuracy by inverting a
Vandermonde-like linear system of equations with spatially varying
coefficients. The approach is general and can be used on uniform and
non-uniform meshes although explicit expressions are derived for polynomials
from second to fifth degree in cylindrical and spherical geometries with
uniform grid spacing. It is shown that, in regions of large curvature, the
resulting expressions differ considerably from their Cartesian counterparts and
that the lack of such corrections can severely degrade the accuracy of the
solution close to the coordinate origin. Limiting techniques and monotonicity
constraints are revised for conventional reconstruction schemes, namely, the
piecewise linear method (PLM), third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) scheme and the piecewise parabolic method (PPM).
  The performance of the improved reconstruction schemes is investigated in a
number of selected numerical benchmarks involving the solution of both scalar
and systems of nonlinear equations (such as the equations of gas dynamics and
magnetohydrodynamics) in cylindrical and spherical geometries in one and two
dimensions. Results confirm that the proposed approach yields considerably
smaller errors, higher convergence rates and it avoid spurious numerical
effects at a symmetry axis.

  Biology",,,,"q-bio.BM cond-mat.other","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a novel theoretical framework for interpreting
long-range dynamical correlations unveiled in proteins through NMR
measurements. The theoretical rationale relies on the hypothesis that
correlated motions in proteins may be reconstructed as large-scale, collective
modes sustained by long-lived nonlinear vibrations known as discrete breathers
(DB) localized at key, hot-spot sites. DBs are spatially localized modes, whose
nonlinear nature hinders resonant coupling with the normal modes, thus
conferring them long lifetimes as compared to normal modes. DBs have been
predicted to exist in proteins, localized at few $hotspot$ residues typically
within the stiffest portions of the structure. We compute DB modes analytically
in the framework of the nonlinear network model, showing that the displacement
patterns of many DBs localized at key sites match to a remarkable extent the
experimentally uncovered correlation blueprint. The computed dispersion
relations prove that it is physically possible for some of these DBs to be
excited out of thermal fluctuations at room temperature.
  Based on our calculations, we speculate that transient energy redistribution
among the vibrational modes in a protein might favor the emergence of DB-like
bursts of long-lived energy at hot-spot sites with lifetimes in the ns range,
able to sustain critical, function-encoding correlated motions. More generally,
our calculations provide a novel quantitative tool to predict fold-spanning
dynamical pathways of correlated residues that may be central to allosteric
cross-talk in proteins.

incorporate high fluctuation amplitude levels and finite Larmor radius (FLR)
effects using a fully nonlinear global gyrofluid model. This is in line with
conditions found in tokamak scrape-off-layers (SOL) regions.
  Varying the ion temperature, the initial blob width, and the initial
amplitude, we found an FLR dominated regime where the blob behavior is
significantly different from what is predicted by cold-ion models. The
transition to this regime is very well described by the ratio of the ion
gyroradius to the characteristic gradient scale length of the blob.
  We compare the global gyrofluid model with a partly linearized local model.
For low ion temperatures we find that simulations of the global model show more
coherent blobs with an increased cross-field transport compared to blobs
simulated with the local model. The maximal blob amplitude is significantly
higher in the global simulations than in the local ones. When the ion
temperature is comparable to the electron temperature, global blob simulations
show a reduced blob coherence and a decreased cross-field transport in
comparison with local blob simulations.

introduce a new intermittency parameter $\Upsilon$ that measures the difference
between the resulting analysis and the Obukhov model of turbulence, the
simplest stochastic model reproducing both Richardson law and the Kolmogorov
spectrum. We test the method on datasets measured in a von K\'arm\'an swirling
flow experiment. We found that the ARMA analysis is well correlated with
spatial structures of the flow, and can discriminate between two different
flows with comparable mean velocities, obtained by changing the forcing.
Moreover, we show that the intermittency parameter is highest in regions where
shear layer vortices are present, thereby establishing a link between
intermittency corrections and coherent structures. We show that some salient
features of the analysis are preserved when considering global instead of local
observables. Finally we analyze flow configurations with multistability
features where the ARMA technique is efficient in discriminating different

instabilities, namely the collisionless, unmagnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz

the electron scales. We show that these processes are important candidates to
generate magnetic fields in the presence of strong velocity shears, which may
naturally originate in energetic matter outburst of active galactic nuclei and
gamma-ray bursters. We show that the KHI is robust to density jumps between
shearing flows, thus operating in various scenarios with different density
contrasts. Multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the KHI,
performed with OSIRIS, reveal the emergence of a strong and large-scale dc
magnetic field component, which is not captured by the standard linear fluid
theory. This dc component arises from kinetic effects associated with the
thermal expansion of electrons of one flow into the other across the shear
layer, whilst ions remain unperturbed due to their inertia. The electron
expansion forms dc current sheets, which induce a dc magnetic field. Our
results indicate that most of the electromagnetic energy developed in the KHI
is stored in the dc component, reaching values of equipartition on the order of
$10^{-3}$ in the electron time-scale, and persists longer than the proton
time-scale. Particle scattering/acceleration in the self generated fields of

different conformation. Upon further compression, the monoclinic phase
undergoes pressure-induced amorphization into an amorphous phase, in agreement
with experiments. We study the dynamics of the amorphization transition and
investigate the evolution of intra and intermolecular distances in the

to get the coordinates of an user -close to Earth- in an almost inertial
reference system. We have simulated both GPS and GALILEO constellations.
Uncertainties in the satellite world lines lead to dominant positioning errors.
In this paper, a detailed analysis of these errors is developed inside a great
region surrounding Earth. This analysis is performed in the framework of the
so-called relativistic positioning systems. Our study is based on the Jacobian,
J, of the transformation giving the emission coordinates in terms of the
inertial ones. Around points of vanishing J, positioning errors are too large.
We show that, for any 4-tuple of satellites, the points with J=0 are located at
distances, D, from the Earth centre greater than about 2R/3, where R is the
radius of the satellite orbits which are assumed to be circumferences. Our
results strongly suggest that, for D-distances greater than 2R/3 and smaller
than 100000 km, a rather good positioning may be achieved by using appropriate
satellite 4-tuples without J=0 points located in the user vicinity. The way to
find these 4-tuples is discussed for arbitrary users with D<100000 km and,
then, preliminary considerations about satellite navigation at D<100000 km are
presented. Future work on the subject of space navigation -based on appropriate
simulations- is in progress.

Hence, as long as this ratio is upper bounded by a polynomial function of $n$,
the corresponding SLV problem can be solved in polynomial complexity. Our
investigations are motivated by the emergence of such lattices in the field of

been widely studied and has many interesting properties. It is classical, in
the sense that it admits the axiom schema of double negation, [DNE]. However,
our understanding of {\L}ukasiewicz logic can be improved by separating its
classical and intuitionistic aspects. The intuitionistic aspect of
{\L}ukasiewicz logic is captured in an axiom schema, [CWC], which asserts the
commutativity of a weak form of conjunction. This is equivalent to a very
restricted form of contraction. We show how {\L}ukasiewicz Logic can be viewed
both as an extension of classical affine logic with [CWC], or as an extension
of what we call \emph{intuitionistic} {\L}ukasiewicz logic with [DNE],
intuitionistic {\L}ukasiewicz logic being the extension of intuitionistic
affine logic by the schema [CWC]. At first glance, intuitionistic affine logic
seems very weak, but, in fact, [CWC] is surprisingly powerful, implying results
such as intuitionistic analogues of De Morgan's laws. However the proofs can be
very intricate. We present these results using derived connectives to clarify
and motivate the proofs and give several applications. We give an analysis of
the applicability to these logics of the well-known methods that use negation
to translate classical logic into intuitionistic logic. The usual proofs of
correctness for these translations make much use of contraction. Nonetheless,
we show that all the usual negative translations are already correct for
intuitionistic {\L}ukasiewicz logic, where only the limited amount of
contraction given by [CWC] is allowed. This is in contrast with affine logic
for which we show, by appeal to results on semantics proved in a companion
paper, that both the Gentzen and the Glivenko translations fail.

""avalanches,"" where a subset of particles undergo large rearrangements. Second,
we find that crystallization is associated with these avalanches but that the
connection is not straightforward. The amount of crystal in the system
increases during an avalanche, but most of the particles that become
crystalline are different from those involved in the avalanche. Third, the
occurrence of the avalanches is a largely stochastic process. Randomizing the
velocities of the particles at any time during the simulation leads to a
different subsequent series of avalanches. The spatial distribution of
avalanching particles appears random, although correlations are found among

take place in regions that already show incipient local order.

$\mathcal{P}_{\scriptscriptstyle N,L}(N_L=\kappa_L N)\approx\exp\left(-{\beta}

and $\psi_L(\kappa_L)$ is a $\beta$-independent rate function that we compute

$\mathcal{O}(N^{-{2}/{3}})$ (edge) and (iii) $\ L > \sqrt{2}$ (tail). We find a

self-triggered policy. The latter only requires the measurements of the
relative position and velocity at the last transmission instants, which is
useful to reduce both the communication and the computation costs. The
strategies guarantee the existence of a uniform minimum amount of times between

at DESY, in Hamburg, Germany. The target consisted of a long, thin-walled,
tubular cell within an aluminum scattering chamber. Hydrogen entered at the
center of the cell and exited through the ends, where it was removed from the
beamline by a multistage pumping system. A cryogenic coldhead cooled the target
cell to counteract heating from the beam and increase the density of hydrogen
in the target. A fixed collimator protected the cell from synchrotron radiation
and the beam halo. A series of wakefield suppressors reduced heating from beam
wakefields. The target system was installed within the DORIS storage ring and
was successfully operated during the course of the OLYMPUS experiment in 2012.

asymmetric in SrRuO(3) as expected in a metallic system, and exhibit multiple
features for the intermediate compositions that can be attributed to the
difference in Ca-O and Sr-O covalency. The Ru core level spectra exhibit
distinct signature of satellite features due to the finite electron
correlations strength among Ru 4d electrons. The intensity of the satellite
feature is weaker in the surface spectra compared to the bulk. The low
temperature spectra exhibit enhancement of satellite intensity in the spectra
corresponding to ferromagnetic compositions due to the inter-site exchange
coupling induced depletion of the intensity at the Fermi level. The increase in
x leads to a decrease in satellite intensity that has been attributed to the
increase in hopping interaction strength due to the enhancement of the Ru-O-Ru
bond angle. Evidently, the complex electronic properties of these materials are
derived from the interplay between the electron correlation and hopping
interaction strengths.

by computing the marginal posterior distributions for density contrast and

ratios for transverse oscillations under the assumption that damping is
produced by resonant absorption. The obtained distributions show that, for
damping times of a few oscillatory periods, low density contrasts and short

  We consider the approach of examining multiple protein structure descriptors

favoring particular classes of aminoacid interactions in each of them, later
aggregating these individual preferences into a global preference. This 2-step

and cases of $q>p$ for even $p$, where the poloidal flux $\psi\propto1/r^n$ and

photospheric vector magnetograms obtained using the spectropolarimeter on board
Hinode. The effectiveness of our search strategy is first demonstrated on test
inputs of dipolar, axisymmetric,and non axisymmetric linear force-free fields.
Using the best-fit to these magnetograms, we build three-dimensional
axisymmetric field configurations and calculate the energy and relative
helicity with two independent methods, which are in agreement. We have analyzed
five magnetograms for AR 10930 spanning a period of three days during which two
X-class flares occurred which allowed us to find the free energy and relative

such as SF-calculus. Traditionally process calculi capture computation by
encoding the lambda-calculus, such as in the pi-calculus. Following this
increased expressiveness via intensionality, other recent work has shown that
concurrent pattern calculus is more expressive than pi-calculus. This paper
formalises the relative expressiveness of all four of these calculi by placing
them on a square whose edges are irreversible encodings. This square is
representative of a more general result: that expressiveness increases with
both intensionality and concurrency.

study of volcanic eruptions. Such phenomena are characterized by large Reynolds
number (exceeding $10^7$) and a large number of polydispersed particles~[1].
Thus, the choice of the methodology to be used is straightforward: we need LES
of a multiphase gas-particles flow. Since the simulation of the behavior of a
large number of dispersed particles is very difficult with Lagrangian methods,
we model the particles as a continuum, Eulerian fluid (dust), by using reduced
models involving two fluids, as proposed in Ref.~[2,3,4]. Moreover, we need a
robust numerical scheme to simultaneously treat compressibility, buoyancy
effects and turbulent dispersal dynamics.
  We analyze the turbulence properties of such models in a homogeneous and
isotropic setting, with the aim of formulating a LES model. In particular, we
examine the development of freely decaying homogeneous and isotropic turbulence
in subsonic regime (the r.m.s. Mach number either 0.2 or 0.5) using
OpenFOAM\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, which is one of the best known CFD
open source software packages.

  Colombia (Bogot\'a, Colombia, Noviembre - 2013). 101 pages",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamics of extended bodies is a fundamental problem in any gravitational
theory. In the case of General Relativity, this problem is under study since
the theory was published. Several methods have been developed and different
approaches are avalaible in the literature to interpret the relativistic
contributions in the motion under gravity influence. The main goal in this
thesis is to study a general method to face the equation of motion for extended
bodies in General Relativity. We started with a proposal in the Newtonian
theory, which consists in a multipolar expansion for the gravitational
potentials as a function of the mass density moments and other physical
variables as the stress tensor. The methodology give us the equation of motion
for an isolated and self-gravitating system of extended bodies in Newtonian
mechanics. A geometrical approach to get the equation of motion is also used
for the Newtonian problems, it allows us to extend the methodology to General
Relativity. In General Relativity, some new concepts are necessary: world tube,
world line, generalized ideas of momentum, angular momentum, torque and center
of mass are introduced in a general context. General expressions for the
equation of motion in the case of extended bodies are written without any
restriction. In order to gain some physical understanding, we compute the
Papapetrous's equation of motion for a test extended body in a static and
isotropic metric. Finally, we study a system of two extended bodies in the
post-Newtonian approximation. We define the mass multipole moments and momentum
from the gravitational potentials (metric functions) to the first
post-Newtonian order. We follow the Landau-Liftshitz formalism to find out the
equation of motion for the moments and applying the standard coordinate
transformation for this theory, we write the traslational equation of motion.

Classifier Graph, which aims to generalize and integrate ideas from many of
today's successful hierarchical recognition approaches. Our graph-based model
has the advantage of enabling rich interactions between classes from different
levels of interpretation and abstraction. The proposed multi-class system is
efficiently learned using step by step updates. The structure consists of
simple logistic linear layers with inputs from features that are automatically
selected from a large pool. Each newly learned classifier becomes a potential
new feature. Thus, our feature pool can consist both of initial manually
designed features as well as learned classifiers from previous steps (graph
nodes), each copied many times at different scales and locations. In this
manner we can learn and grow both a deep, complex graph of classifiers and a
rich pool of features at different levels of abstraction and interpretation.
Our proposed graph of classifiers becomes a multi-class system with a recursive
structure, suitable for deep detection and recognition of several classes
simultaneously.
