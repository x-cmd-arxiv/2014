of the dynamics of compressible dispersed multiphase flows. We adopt the
Eulerian approach because we focus our attention to dispersed (concentration
smaller than 0.001) and small particles (the Stokes number has to be smaller
than 0.2). We apply these models to the compressible ($\text{Ma} = 0.2,\,0.5$)
homogeneous and isotropic decaying turbulence inside a periodic
three-dimensional box ($256^3$ cells) using a numerical solver based on the
OpenFOAM$^{R}$ C++ libraries. In order to validate our simulations in the
single-phase case we compare the energy spectrum obtained with our code with
the one computed by an eighth order scheme getting a very good result (the
relative error is very small $4*10^{-4}$). Moving to the bi-phase case,
initially we insert inside the box an homogeneous distribution of particles
leaving unchanged the initial velocity field. Because of the centrifugal force,
turbulence induce particle preferential concentration and we study the
evolution of the solid-phase density. Moreover, we do an {\em a-priori} test on
the new sub-grid term of the multiphase equations comparing them with the
standard sub-grid scale term of the Navier-Stokes equations.

of all $k$-element subsets of $X$ captured by $S$. In case when $k=2$ and $S$

Delaunay graphs.
  In this paper we prove that for any $k\geq 2$, any $X$, and any convex

High Coincidence Events (HCE), composed of glitches occurring coincidentally in

clusters had significant peculiar velocities towards the supercluster centroid
(Batiste & Batuski). In this paper we present the results of a thorough
investigation of the CSC: we determine redshifts and virial masses for all 8
clusters associated with the CSC; repeat the analysis of Batiste & Batuski with
the inclusion of A2056 and CL1529+29; estimate the mass of the supercluster by
applying the virial theorem on the supercluster scale (e.g. Small et al.), the
caustics method (e.g. Reisenegger et al.), and a new procedure using the
spherical collapse model (SCM) with the results of the dynamical analysis
(SCM+FP); and perform a series of simulations to assess the likelihood of the
CSC being a gravitationally bound supercluster. We find that the mass of the
CSC is between 0.6 and 12 x 10^{16} h^{-1} M_{sun}. The dynamical analysis,
caustics method and the SCM+FP indicate that the structure is collapsing, with
the latter two both indicating a turn around radius of about 12.5 h^{-1} Mpc.
Lastly, the simulations show that with a reasonable amount of inter-cluster
mass, there is likely extended bound structure in the CSC. Our results suggest

with an unknown demand model is considered. Under the day-ahead dynamic pricing
(a.k.a. real time pricing) mechanism, a retailer obtains electricity in a
twosettlement wholesale market and serves its customers in real time. Without
knowledge on the aggregated demand function of its customers, the retailer aims
to maximize its retail surplus by sequentially adjusting its price based on the
behavior of its customers in the past. An online learning algorithm, referred
to as piecewise linear stochastic approximation (PWLSA), is proposed. It is
shown that PWLSA achieves the optimal rate of learning defined by the growth
rate of cumulative regret. In particular, the regret of PWLSA is shown to grow
logarithmically with respect to the learning horizon, and no other on-line
learning algorithm can have the growth rate slower than that of PWLSA.
Simulation studies are presented using traces of actual day-ahead prices, and
PWLSA compares favorably under both static and dynamically changing parameters.

  Computation","Extended version of the 2-page paper accepted to ACM SIGMETRICS 2014",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One typical use case of large-scale distributed computing in data centers is
to decompose a computation job into many independent tasks and run them in
parallel on different machines, sometimes known as the ""embarrassingly
parallel"" computation. For this type of computation, one challenge is that the
time to execute a task for each machine is inherently variable, and the overall
response time is constrained by the execution time of the slowest machine. To
address this issue, system designers introduce task replication, which sends
the same task to multiple machines, and obtains result from the machine that
finishes first. While task replication reduces response time, it usually
increases resource usage. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to
analyze the trade-off between response time and resource usage. We show that,
while in general, there is a tension between response time and resource usage,
there exist scenarios where replicating tasks judiciously reduces completion
time and resource usage simultaneously. Given the execution time distribution
for machines, we investigate the conditions for a scheduling policy to achieve
optimal performance trade-off, and propose efficient algorithms to search for
optimal or near-optimal scheduling policies. Our analysis gives insights on
when and why replication helps, which can be used to guide scheduler design in
large-scale distributed computing systems.

explicit quadratures of products of singular parts (logarithms) and

convergence of the discrete solutions. In the case of analytic boundaries, we

searches use the 8 TeV pp collision dataset collected by the CMS detector at
the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.7 inverse

to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 inverse femtobarns. The searches are
sensitive to non-standard-model invisible decays of the recently observed Higgs

large invisible branching fractions. In all channels, the observed data are
consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. Limits are set on the
production cross section times invisible branching fraction, as a function of
the Higgs boson mass, for the vector boson fusion and ZH production modes. By
combining all channels, and assuming standard model Higgs boson cross sections

Therefore, understanding the structure of the Twitter social graph is
interesting not only for computer scientists, but also for researchers in other
fields, such as sociologists. However, little is known about how the
information propagation in Twitter is constrained by its inner structure. In
this paper, we present an in-depth study of the macroscopic structure of the

specific user activity associated with each component of this macroscopic
structure, and the evolution of this macroscopic structure with time for the

over KMT, Kennicutt-Schmidt & GMC Collision laws is not especially significant,

detailed treatment of interstellar medium processes. We next search for

on a parametric process model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the
observed random process. Instead, we only require certain smoothness properties
(in the Fourier domain) of the process. The proposed inference scheme works
even for sample sizes much smaller than the number of scalar process components
if the true underlying CIG is sufficiently sparse. A theoretical performance
analysis provides conditions which guarantee that the probability of the
proposed inference method to deliver a wrong CIG is below a prescribed value.
These conditions imply lower bounds on the sample size such that the new method
is consistent asymptotically. Some numerical experiments validate our
theoretical performance analysis and demonstrate superior performance of our
scheme compared to an existing (parametric) approach in case of model mismatch.

our results indicate that the phase transition towards a chirally-broken phase

and nonlocal elements. Let $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be separated into two components by
a smooth hypersurface $\Gamma$. On one side of $\Gamma$, a function satisfies a
local second-order elliptic equation. On the other, it satisfies a nonlocal one
of lower order. In addition, a nonlocal transmission condition is imposed
across the interface $\Gamma$, which has a natural variational interpretation.
We deduce the existence of solutions to the corresponding Dirichlet problem,
and show that under mild assumptions they are H\""older continuous, following
the method of De Giorgi. The principal difficulty stems from the lack of scale
invariance near $\Gamma$, which we circumvent by deducing a special energy
estimate which is uniform in the scaling parameter. We then turn to the
question of optimal regularity and qualitative properties of solutions, and
show that (in the case of constant coefficients and flat $\Gamma)$ they satisfy
a kind of transmission condition, where the ratio of ""fractional conormal
derivatives"" on the two sides of the interface is fixed. A perturbative
argument is then given to show how to obtain regularity for solutions to an
equation with variable coefficients and smooth interface. Throughout, we pay
special attention to a nonlinear version of the problem with a drift given by a
singular integral operator of the solution, which has an interpretation in the
context of quasigeostrophic dynamics.

nontrivial gravitational interactions. The data provide compelling evidence
($\gtrsim 6\sigma$) for nonzero neutrino masses, with $\Sigma m_\nu \gtrsim

  This result can be considered as a non-commutative generalization of a result
due to Braverman and Rao [2011] where they considered the special case when
$\rho$ and $\sigma$ are classical probability distributions (or commute with
each other) and use shared randomness instead of shared entanglement. We use P
to obtain an alternate proof of a direct-sum result for entanglement assisted
quantum one-way communication complexity for all relations, which was first
shown by Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [2005,2008]. We also present a variant of
protocol P in which Bob has some side information about the state with Alice.
We show that in such a case, the amount of communication can be further
reduced, based on the side information that Bob has.
  Our second result provides a quantum analogue of the widely used classical
correlated-sampling protocol. For example, Holenstein [2007] used the classical
correlated-sampling protocol in his proof of a parallel-repetition theorem for
two-player one-round games.

classical elliptic obstacle problems as well as some related free boundary

also works for nonlinear variational inequalities arising from convex
minimization problems.

total FIR luminosity measured with over 15 photometric data points between 100
to 1000 um is 2900 Msun/yr. Keck/NIRC2 Ks band adaptive optics imaging data
showed two potential NIR counterparts near HFLS3. Previously, the northern
galaxy was taken to be in the foreground at z=2.1 while the southern galaxy was
assumed to HFLS3's NIR counterpart. New HST/WFC3 and ACS imaging data show both
optically bright galaxies are in the foreground at z<6. A new lensing model
based on HST data and mm-wave continuum emission yields a magnification of
2.2+/-0.3. The lack of multiple imaging constrains the lensing magnification to
be lower than either 2.7 or 3.5 at the 95% confidence level for the two
scenarios, which attribute one or two components to HFLS3 in the source plane.
Correcting for gravitational lensing, the inst. SFR is 1320 Msun/yr with the
95% confidence lower limit around 830 Msun/yr. Using models for the restframe
UV to FIR SED, the ave. SFR over the last 100 Myr is around 660 Msun/yr. The
dust and stellar masses of HFLS3 from the same SED models are 3x10^8 Msun and
~5x10^10 Msun, respectively, with large systematic uncertainties on assumptions
related to the SED model. With HST/WFC3 images we also find diffuse NIR
emission about 0.5"" (~3 kpc) SW of HFLS3 that remains undetected in the ACS
data. The emission has a photometric redshift consistent with either z~6 or a
dusty galaxy template at z~2. If at the same redshift as HFLS3 the detected
diffuse emission could be part of the complex merger system that could be
triggering the starburst. Alternatively, it could be part of the foreground
structure at z~2.1 that is responsible for lensing of HFLS3.

MUSIC-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-mass
relation for the CLASH cluster sample. We study nearly 1400 halos simulated at
high spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along many
lines-of-sight each. We study the shape of both their density and
surface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,
including the Navarro-Frenk-White, the generalised Navarro-Frenk-White, and the
Einasto density profiles. We derive concentrations and masses from these fits
and investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halo
relaxation. We use the X-ray image simulator X-MAS to produce simulated Chandra
observations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling the
X-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the CLASH X-ray selected
sample. We also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensing
clusters. We find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the X-ray
morphology of the CLASH clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but it
also contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. For such a sample
we measure an average 2D concentration which is ~11% higher than found for the
full sample of simulated halos. After accounting for projection and selection
effects, the average NFW concentrations of CLASH clusters are expected to be
intermediate between those predicted in 3D for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.
Matching the simulations to the individual CLASH clusters on the basis of the

a longstanding quest in solid state physics. Recently, there has been a lot of
interest in nanoscale hybrid systems as possible candidates for thermal
devices. In this context, we study the heat current in the simplest hybrid
device of a two level system weakly coupled to two heat baths. We use the
reduced density matrix approach together with a simple Born-Markov
approximation to calculate the heat current in the steady state. We consider
different kinds of reservoirs and show that the nature of the reservoir plays a
very important role in determining the thermal characteristics of the device.
In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of a conventional
superconductor as a reservoir with regard to manipulating the heat current. In
the emergent temperature characteristics, we find that superconductivity in the
reservoirs leads to enhanced thermal currents and that the superconducting
phase transition is clearly visible in the heat current. We observe negative
differential thermal conductance and a pronounced rectification of the heat
current, making this a good building block for a quantum thermal diode.

supports authors of Android security extensions in developing their modules.
This overcomes the current unsatisfactory situation to provide security

into Android's mainline codebase. As a result, ASF provides different practical
benefits such as a higher degree of acceptance, adaptation, and maintenance of

optimized pruning methods based on different approaches. Briefly, a clear
direction on the decision process for selection of methods was developed with
key choices being the cooling rate, plunge temperature on the one hand and
biomaterial choice, use of composites (sugars and proteins), loading procedure
and cell location in 3D scaffold on the other. Secondly, using machine learning
and generalized approaches via the Na\""ive Bayes Classification (NBC) approach,
these metadata were used to develop posterior probabilities for combinatorial
approaches that were implicitly recorded in the metadata. These latter results
showed that newer protocol choices developed using probability elicitation
techniques can unearth improved protocols consistent with multiple

proposes the use of DTLA models and subsequently NBC for the improvement of
modern cryopreservation techniques through an integrative approach.

analysis (Pi theorem), it is shown that any properly scaled statistics of the
small-scale turbulence are universal functions of a stability parameter defined
as the ratio of a reference height z and the Dougherty-Ozmidov length scale
which in the limit of z-less stratification is linearly proportional to the
Obukhov length scale. Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at five
levels on a 20-m tower over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget
of the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to examine the behaviour of
different similarity functions in the stable boundary layer. It is found that
in the framework of this approach the non-dimensional turbulent viscosity is
equal to the gradient Richardson number whereas the non-dimensional turbulent
thermal diffusivity is equal to the flux Richardson number. These results are a
consequence of the approximate local balance between production of turbulence
by the mean flow shear and viscous dissipation. The turbulence framework based
on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic
energy may have practical advantages for estimating turbulence when the fluxes
are not directly available.

consumption in social networks. We consider two competing firms in a market
providing two substitutable products with preset qualities. Agents choose their
consumptions following a myopic best response dynamics which results in a
local, linear update for the consumptions. At some point in time, firms receive
a limited budget which they can use to trigger a larger consumption of their
products in the network. Firms have to decide between marginally improving the
quality of their products and giving free offers to a chosen set of agents in
the network in order to better facilitate spreading their products. We derive a
simple threshold rule for the optimal allocation of the budget and describe the
resulting Nash equilibrium. It is shown that the optimal allocation of the
budget depends on the entire distribution of centralities in the network,
quality of products and the model parameters. In particular, we show that in a
graph with a higher number of agents with centralities above a certain
threshold, firms spend more budget on seeding in the optimal allocation.
Furthermore, if seeding budget is nonzero for a balanced graph, it will also be
nonzero for any other graph, and if seeding budget is zero for a star graph, it
will be zero for any other graph too. We also show that firms allocate more
budget to quality improvement when their qualities are close, in order to
distance themselves from the rival firm. However, as the gap between qualities
widens, competition in qualities becomes less effective and firms spend more
budget on seeding.

leading term of the Casimir free interaction energy is known as the classical
term since it does not depend on the Planck constant $\hbar$. From the
functional representation of the zero temperature Casimir interaction energy,
we use Matsubara formalism to derive the classical term. It can be expressed as
a weighted sum over logarithms of determinants. Using similarity transforms of
matrices, we re-express this classical term as an infinite series. This series
is then computed exactly using generalized Abel-Plana summation formula. From
this, we deduce the short distance asymptotic expansions of the classical
Casimir interaction force. As expected, the leading term agrees with the
proximity force approximation. The next two terms in the asymptotic expansion
are also computed. It is observed that the ratio of the next-to-leading order
term to the leading order term is proportional to the dimension of spacetime.
Hence, a larger correction to the proximity force approximation is expected in
spacetime with higher dimensions. This is similar to a previous result deduced
for the zero temperature case.

discrepancy, a concept originates from Quasi Monte Carlo analysis, to control

  Systems",,,,,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The GVW algorithm is a signature-based algorithm for computing Gr\""obner
bases. If the input system is not homogeneous, some J-pairs with higher
signatures but lower degrees are rejected by GVW's Syzygy Criterion, instead,
GVW have to compute some J-pairs with lower signatures but higher degrees.
Consequently, degrees of polynomials appearing during the computations may
unnecessarily grow up higher and the computation become more expensive. In this
paper, a variant of the GVW algorithm, called M-GVW, is proposed and mutant
pairs are introduced to overcome inconveniences brought by inhomogeneous input
polynomials. Some techniques from linear algebra are used to improve the
efficiency. Both GVW and M-GVW have been implemented in C++ and tested by many
examples from boolean polynomial rings. The timings show M-GVW usually performs
much better than the original GVW algorithm when mutant pairs are found.
Besides, M-GVW is also compared with intrinsic Gr\""obner bases functions on
Maple, Singular and Magma. Due to the efficient routines from the M4RI library,
the experimental results show that M-GVW is very efficient.

general Bayesian approach, which relies on an encompassing nonparametric Bayes
model for the joint distribution of $Y$, $X$ and $Z$. The framework allows $Y$,
$X$ and $Z$ to be random variables on arbitrary spaces, and can accommodate
different dimensional vectors having a mixture of discrete and continuous
measurement scales. Using conditional mutual information as a scalar summary of
the strength of the conditional dependence relationship, we construct null and

in this paper. The polarized waves are generated through curvature radiation
from the relativistic particles streaming along curved magnetic field lines and
co-rotating with the pulsar magnetosphere. Within the 1/{\deg} emission cone,
the waves can be divided into two natural wave mode components, the ordinary
(O) mode and the extraord nary (X) mode, with comparable intensities. Both
components propagate separately in magnetosphere, and are aligned within the
cone by adiabatic walking. The refraction of O-mode makes the two components
separated and incoherent. The detectable emission at a given height and a given
rotation phase consists of incoherent X-mode and O-mode components coming from
discrete emission regions. For four particle-density models in the form of
uniformity, cone, core and patches, we calculate the intensities for each mode
numerically within the entire pulsar beam. If the co-rotation of relativistic
particles with magnetosphere is not considered, the intensity distributions for
the X-mode and O-mode components are quite similar within the pulsar beam,
which causes serious depolarization. However, if the co-rotation of
relativistic particles is considered, the intensity distributions of the two
modes are very different, and the net polarization of out-coming emission
should be significant. Our numerical results are compared with observations,
and can naturally explain the orthogonal polarization modes of some pulsars.
Strong linear polarizations of some parts of pulsar profile can be reproduced
by curvature radiation and subsequent propagation effect.

(without mean-field coupling) of Lim and Zhou (2005), derived for feedback (or
Markov) type optimal controls, to optimal control problems for non-Markovian
dynamics which may be time-inconsistent in the sense that the Bellman
optimality principle does not hold. In our approach to the risk-sensitive SMP,
the smoothness assumption on the value-function imposed in Lim and Zhou (2005)
need not to be satisfied. For a general action space a Peng's type SMP is
derived, specifying the necessary conditions for optimality. Two examples are
carried out to illustrate the proposed risk-sensitive mean-field type SMP under
linear stochastic dynamics with exponential quadratic cost function. Explicit
solutions are given for both mean-field free and mean-field models.

Collecting missions so that they can be achieved at minimal cost by a generic
vehicle. The problem mixes combinatorial optimization to select and order the
debris among a list of candidates, and continuous optimization to fix the
rendezvous dates and to define the minimum fuel orbital maneuvers. The solution
method proposed consists in three stages. Firstly the orbital transfer problem
is simplified by considering a generic transfer strategy suited either to a
high thrust or a low thrust vehicle. A response surface modelling is built by
solving the reduced problem for all pairs of debris and for discretized dates,
and storing the results in cost matrices. Secondly a simulated annealing
algorithm is applied to find the optimal mission planning. The cost function is
assessed by interpolation on the response surface based on the cost matrices.
This allows the convergence of the simulated algorithm in a limited computation
time, yielding an optimal mission planning. Thirdly the successive missions are
re-optimized in terms of transfer maneuvers and dates without changing the
debris order. These continuous control problems yield a refined solution with
the performance requirement for designing the future Space Debris Collecting
vehicle. The method is applicable for large list of debris and for various
assumptions regarding the cleaning program (number of missions, number of
debris per mission, total duration, deorbitation scenario, high or low thrust
vehicle). It is exemplified on an application case with 3 missions to plan,
each mission visiting 5 SSO debris to be selected in a list of 21 candidates.

of two curves. Many variants and extensions have been studied since Alt and
Godau introduced this measure to computational geometry in 1991. Their original
algorithm to compute the Frechet distance of two polygonal curves with n
vertices has a runtime of O(n^2 log n). More than 20 years later, the state of
the art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n^2 / log n),
but no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity
theoretic assumptions.
  To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no
O*((2-delta)^N) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any delta > 0. Under this assumption
we show that the Frechet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic
time, i.e., in time O(n^{2-delta}) for any delta > 0. This means that finding
faster algorithms for the Frechet distance is as hard as finding faster CNF-SAT
algorithms, and the existence of a strongly subquadratic algorithm can be
considered unlikely.
  Our result holds for both the continuous and the discrete Frechet distance.
We extend the main result in various directions. Based on the same assumption
we (1) show non-existence of a strongly subquadratic 1.001-approximation, (2)
present tight lower bounds in case the numbers of vertices of the two curves
are imbalanced, and (3) examine realistic input assumptions (c-packed curves).

this inflationary model for natural parameter values. A salient feature of the

called dynamic heterogeneity during the isomerization of diluted azobenzene
molecules in a host glass-former. In this paper we raise the issue of the
coupling between these ""artificial"" heterogeneities and the isomerization
period. How do these induced heterogeneities differ in the saturation regime
and in the linear response regime ? Is there a maximum of the heterogeneous
motion versus isomerization rate and why ? Are the heterogeneity evolution with
the isomerization rate connected with the diffusion or relaxation time
evolution ? We use out of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to answer
these questions. We find that the heterogeneity increases in the linear
response regime for large isomerization periods and small perturbations. In
contrast the heterogeneity decreases in the saturation regime, i.e. when the
isomerization half-period ($\tau_{p}/2$) is smaller than the relaxation time of
the material ($\tau_{\alpha}$). This result makes possible a test of the effect
of cooperative motions on the dynamics using the chromophores as Maxwell demons
that destroy or stimulate the cooperative motions. Because the heterogeneities
increase in the linear regime and then decrease in the saturation regime, we
find a maximum for $\tau_{p}/2 \approx \tau_{\alpha}$. The induced excitations
concentration follows a power law evolution versus the isomerization rate and
then saturates. As a consequence the $\alpha$ relaxation time is related to the
excitation concentration with a power law, a result in qualitative agreement
with recent findings in constrained models. This result supports a common
origin for the heterogeneities with constrained models and a similar relation
to the excitation concentration.

affects the cosmological term, supposing that a condensation occurs for quark

proposed here using a modified version of the HyperCuts packet classification
algorithm. A new pre-cutting process has been implemented to reduce the memory
size to fit in an FPGA. This classifier can classify packets with high speed
and with a power consumption factor of less than 3W. This methodology removes
the need for floating point division to be performed by replacing the region
compaction scheme of HyperCuts by pre-cutting, while classifying the packets
and concentrates on classifying the packets at the core of the network.

anti-symmetric generalized eigenvalue - eigenstate decomposition consistent
with the anti-symmetry of electric and magnetic fields referred to the same
coordinate frame: this is achieved by anti-diagonalization through rotation by
2x2 complex operators of the SU(2) rotation group. The eigenstates comprise
simple proportional relationships between linearly polarized eigenvalues of the
input magnetic and output electric field along the locally resistive and
conductive propagation path into the Earth, respectively mediated by the
maximum and minimum characteristic values of the tensor (eigen-impedances). It
is shown from first principles that the eigen-impedances are expected to be
positive real (passive) functions, analytic in the entire lower-half complex
frequency plane and with singularities confined on the positive imaginary
frequency axis. Insofar as the impedance tensor is generated by isometric
transformation of the eigen-impedances, it is also passive. The expected
passivity is an effective means of appraising measured tensors for compliance
with the basic tenets of the MT method: it can be violated only in the presence
of sources in the Earth. In addition to extrinsic effects (e.g. noise), it is
demonstrated with examples, that such sources may be secondary large or small
scale inductive phenomena generated by realistic conductivity configurations.
However, they may not be time-independent effects taking place in a passive
induction context, such as steady-state current channelling, galvanic
distortion and electric field reversals. In general, to assert whether
violation of passivity has occurred, it is necessary to decompose the impedance
tensor, refer it to its intrinsic coordinate frame and evaluate the compliance
of the eigen-impedances with their expected analytic properties

Michelson interferometer, regardless of the relationship between the temporal
path difference introduced between the arms of the interferometer and the
spectral width of the input pulse. This observation is possible by introducing
the polarization degree of freedom into a Michelson interferometer using a
typical weak value amplification scenario.

universe cause electromagnetic cascades resulting in a flux of extragalactic
gamma rays, detectable to some 100 GeV. Recent precise measurements of the
extragalactic gamma ray flux by Fermi-LAT, coupled with estimates of the
background from active galactic nuclei of various types, allows limits to be
set on the cascade component. By comparison with prediction and, making various
assumptions, ie taking a particular model, limits can be set on the maximum
energy to which ultra-high energy particle can be accelerated.
  If our model is correct, it is unlikely that the maximum energy is above 100
EeV, in turn, the apparent 'GZK' cut-off in the measured ultra-high energy
spectrum could instead be due to a fall-off in the intrinsic emergent particle
spectrum. However, it is not plausible to be dogmatic at the present time
because of uncertainty in many of the parameters involved. We have used recent
estimates of the range of parameters and have found that although our model has
parameters in the allowable ranges the uncertainties are so large that our
result is not unique, although the method is satisfactory. The result must
thus, so far, be taken as an indication only.

  Super-resolution","Studies on the super-resolution of the MUSIC algorithm have been
  added in Section 4 and Section 5.4",,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the problem of line spectral estimation in the continuum
of a bounded interval with one snapshot of array measurement. The
single-snapshot measurement data is turned into a Hankel data matrix which
admits the Vandermonde decomposition and is suitable for the MUSIC algorithm.
The MUSIC algorithm amounts to finding the null space (the noise space) of the
Hankel matrix, forming the noise-space correlation function and identifying the
s smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation as the frequency set.
  In the noise-free case exact reconstruction is guaranteed for any arbitrary
set of frequencies as long as the number of measurements is at least twice the
number of distinct frequencies to be recovered. In the presence of noise the
stability analysis shows that the perturbation of the noise-space correlation
is proportional to the spectral norm of the noise matrix as long as the latter
is smaller than the smallest (nonzero) singular value of the noiseless Hankel
data matrix. Under the assumption that frequencies are separated by at least
twice the Rayleigh Length (RL), the stability of the noise-space correlation is
proved by means of novel discrete Ingham inequalities which provide bounds on
nonzero singular values of the noiseless Hankel data matrix.
  The numerical performance of MUSIC is tested in comparison with other
algorithms such as BLO-OMP and SDP (TV-min). While BLO-OMP is the stablest
algorithm for frequencies separated above 4 RL, MUSIC becomes the best
performing one for frequencies separated between 2 RL and 3 RL. Also, MUSIC is
more efficient than other methods. MUSIC truly shines when the frequency
separation drops to 1 RL or below when all other methods fail. Indeed, the
resolution length of MUSIC decreases to zero as noise decreases to zero as a
power law with an exponent much smaller than an upper bound established by
Donoho.

how information about what the mathematical literature contains can be
formalized and made easier to express, encode, and explore. Many of the tools
necessary to make this information system a reality will require much more than
indexing and will instead depend on community input paired with machine
learning, where mathematicians' expertise can fill the gaps of automatization.
This report proposes the establishment of an organization; the development of a
set of platforms, tools, and services; the deployment of an ongoing applied
research program to complement the development work; and the mobilization and
coordination of the mathematical community to take the first steps toward these
capabilities. The report recommends building on the extensive work done by many
dedicated individuals under the rubric of the World Digital Mathematical
Library, as well as many other community initiatives. Developing a 21st Century
Global Library for Mathematics envisions a combination of machine learning
methods and community-based editorial effort that makes a significantly greater
portion of the information and knowledge in the global mathematical corpus
available to researchers as linked open data through a central organizational
entity-referred to in the report as the Digital Mathematics Library. This
report describes how such a library might operate - discussing development and
research needs, role in facilitating discover and interaction, and establishing
partnerships with publishers.
