approximating processes with completely monotone jumps by processes with
hyperexponential jumps, the latter being the most convenient class for
performing numerical computations. Our approach is based on connecting L\'{e}vy
processes with completely monotone jumps with several areas of classical
analysis, including Pad\'{e} approximations, Gaussian quadrature and orthogonal

force decreases the effective acceleration due to gravity (as measured in the
rotating frame) at the equator while increasing the acceleration at the poles
due to the centrifugal flattening of the star into an oblate spheroid. We
compute the effective gravitational acceleration for relativistic rapidly
rotating neutron stars and show that for a star with mass $M$, equatorial
radius $R_e$, and angular velocity $\Omega$, the deviations of the effective
acceleration due to gravity from the nonrotating case take on a universal form
that depends only on the compactness ratio $M/R_e$, the dimensionless square of
the angular velocity $\Omega^2R_e^3/GM$, and the latitude on the star's
surface. This dependence is universal, in that it has very little dependence on
the neutron star's equation of state. The effective gravity is expanded in the
slow rotation limit to show the dependence on the effective centrifugal force,
oblate shape of the star and the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field.
In addition, an empirical fit and simple formula for the effective gravity is
found. We find that the increase in the acceleration due to gravity at the
poles is of the same order of magnitude as the decrease in the effective
acceleration due to gravity at the equator for all realistic value of mass,
radius and spin. For neutron stars that spin with frequencies near 600 Hz the
difference between the effective gravity at the poles and the equator is about
20%.

for the equivalent width (EW) of the iron line. 4U 1916-05 - whose optical
spectrum is consistent with reflection from a He-rich accretion disk - exhibits
a bright broad iron emission line. This behavior is in agreement with the
theoretical predictions presented in Koliopanos, Gilfanov and Bildsten (2013).
Namely, we expect strong suppression of the Fe K${\alpha}$ emission line in
spectra originating in moderately bright (LogLx less than $\approx$ 37.5) UCXBs
with C/O or O/Ne/Mg-rich donors. On the other hand the EW of the iron line in
spectra from UCXBs with He-rich donors is expected to retain its nominal value
of $\approx$ 100 eV. Our analysis also reveals a strong Fe K${\alpha}$ line in
the spectrum of 4U 0614+091. This detection points towards a He-rich donor and
seems to be at odds with the source's classification as C/O-rich. Nevertheless,
a He-rich donor would explain the bursting activity reported for this system.
Lastly, based on our theoretical predictions, we attribute the lack of a strong
iron emission line - in the two remaining UCXB sources in our sample (XTE
J1807-294, 4U 0513-40) - as an indication of a C/O or O/Ne/Mg white dwarf
donor. From the upper limits of the Fe K${\alpha}$ line EW in 4U 0513-40, 2S
0918-549 and XTE J1807-294 we obtain a lower limit on the oxygen-to-iron
ratio,O/Fe$\ge$ 10$\times$[O/Fe]$_{\odot}$.

This approach, however, disregards the occurrence of gene duplication

proteins that share a common domain, taking into consideration the evolutionary
history of genes under study may provide a more reliable annotation of
predicted proteins with unknown function. A computer program that enables
real-time comparison of 'gene trees' with 'species trees' was developed. The
Phylogenetic Genome Annotator (PGA) performs a profile based multiple sequence
alignment of a set of sequences that share a common domain to generate a
phylogenetic gene tree, which is compared to the species phylogeny inferred
from aligned ribossomal RNA data. The correlated protein domains are then
displayed side-by-side with the phylogeny of the corresponding species. The
statistical support of gene clusters (branches) is given by the quartet
puzzling method. This analysis readily discriminates paralogs from orthologs,
enabling the identification of proteins originated by gene duplications and the
prediction of possible functional divergence in groups of similar sequences.
The tool was tested in three distinct subfamilies of the G-protein coupled
receptor superfamily. In the analysed datasets, the paralogy prediction agreed
with the known subfamily grouping, suggesting that subfamily divergence was
facilitated by duplication events in the ancestral nodes.

vector-tensor theory of gravitation (hereafter VT). This theory is first
compared with the so-called extended electromagnetism (EE). These theories have
a notable resemblance and both explain the existence of a cosmological
constant. It is shown that, in EE, a positive dark energy density requires a
Lagrangian leading to quantum ghosts, whereas VT is free from these ghosts. On
account of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology
in the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve
the evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain
scalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity
(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the
scalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of
the VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution
of the standard GR ones. Some well known suitable codes (CMBFAST and COSMOMC)
have been modified to include our VT initial conditions and evolution
equations, which are fully general. One of the resulting codes -based on
standard statistical methods- has been used to fit VT predictions and
observational evidences about both Ia supernovae and cosmic microwave
background anisotropy. Seven free parameters are used in this fit. Six of them
are often used in GR cosmology and the seventh one is characteristic of VT.
From the statistical analysis it follows that VT seems to be advantageous
against GR in order to explain cosmological observational evidences.

rocky planet can support liquid water on its surface. The most intriguing
question driving the search for habitable planets is whether they host life.
But is the age of the planet important for its habitability? If we define
habitability as the ability of a planet to beget life, then probably not. After
all, life on Earth has developed within only about 800 Myr after its formation.
If, however, we define habitability as our ability to detect life on the
surface of exoplanets, then age becomes a crucial parameter. Only after life
had evolved sufficiently complex to change its environment on a planetary
scale, can we detect it remotely through its imprint on the atmosphere - the
biosignatures, out of which the photosynthetic oxygen is the most prominent
indicator of developed life as we know it. But the onset of photosynthesis on
planets in habitable zones may take much longer time than the planetary age.
The knowledge of the age of a planet is necessary for developing a strategy to
search for exoplanets carrying complex (developed) life - many confirmed
potentially habitable planets are too young (orbiting Population I stars) and
may not have had enough time to develop and/or sustain detectable life. In the
last decade, many planets orbiting old (9-13 Gyr) metal-poor Population II
stars have been discovered. Such planets had had enough time to develop
necessary chains of chemical reactions and may carry detectable life if located
in a habitable zone. These old planets should be primary targets in search for
the extraterrestrial life.

a significant contribution at early times. The strong spectral features in the

finite fields are given. The first states that over any finite field
$\mathbb{F}$, for any polynomial $f$ on $n$ variables with degree $d \le
\log(n)/10$, there exists a subspace of $\mathbb{F}^n$ with dimension $\Omega(d
\cdot n^{1/(d-1)})$ on which $f$ is constant. This result is shown to be tight.
Stated differently, a degree $d$ polynomial cannot compute an affine disperser
for dimension smaller than $\Omega(d \cdot n^{1/(d-1)})$. Using a recursive
argument, we obtain our second structural result, showing that any degree $d$
polynomial $f$ induces a partition of $F^n$ to affine subspaces of dimension
$\Omega(n^{1/(d-1)!})$, such that $f$ is constant on each part.
  We extend both structural results to more than one polynomial. We further
prove an analog of the first structural result to sparse polynomials (with no
restriction on the degree) and to functions that are close to low degree
polynomials. We also consider the algorithmic aspect of the two structural
results.
  Our structural results have various applications, two of which are:
  * Dvir [CC 2012] introduced the notion of extractors for varieties, and gave
explicit constructions of such extractors over large fields. We show that over
any finite field, any affine extractor is also an extractor for varieties with
related parameters. Our reduction also holds for dispersers, and we conclude
that Shaltiel's affine disperser [FOCS 2011] is a disperser for varieties over
$F_2$.
  * Ben-Sasson and Kopparty [SIAM J. C 2012] proved that any degree 3 affine
disperser over a prime field is also an affine extractor with related
parameters. Using our structural results, and based on the work of Kaufman and
Lovett [FOCS 2008] and Haramaty and Shpilka [STOC 2010], we generalize this
result to any constant degree.

performance, extended strings of spiking and silence, particularly burst

of many important intracellular signal transduction processes. In this paper we
analyse a mathematical model of a canonical gene regulatory network consisting
of a single negative feedback loop between a protein and its mRNA (e.g. the
Hes1 transcription factor system). The model consists of two partial
differential equations describing the spatio-temporal interactions between the
protein and its mRNA in a 1-dimensional domain. Such intracellular negative
feedback systems are known to exhibit oscillatory behaviour and this is the
case for our model, shown initially via computational simulations. In order to
investigate this behaviour more deeply, we next solve our system using Green's
functions and then undertake a linearized stability analysis of the steady
states of the model. Our results show that the diffusion coefficient of the
protein/mRNA acts as a bifurcation parameter and gives rise to a Hopf
bifurcation. This shows that the spatial movement of the mRNA and protein
molecules alone is sufficient to cause the oscillations. This has implications
for transcription factors such as p53, NF-$\kappa$B and heat shock proteins

wave data analysis --- Bayesian non-parameterics --- to the problem of
gravitational wave detection, with an emphasis on pulsar timing array
observations. In Bayesian non-parametrics, constraints are set on the function
space that may be reasonably thought to characterize the range of
gravitational-wave signals. This differs from the approaches currently employed
or proposed, which focus on introducing parametric signal models or looking for
excess power as evidence of the presence of a gravitational wave signal. Our
Bayesian nonparametrics analysis method addresses two issues: (1) investigate
if a gravitational wave burst is present in the data; (2) infer the sky
location of the source and the duration of the burst. Compared with the popular
method proposed by Finn \& Lommen, our method improves in two aspects: (1) we
can estimate the burst duration by adding the prior that the gravitational wave
signals are smooth, while Finn \& Lommen ignored this important point; (2) we
perform a full Bayesian analysis by marginalizing over all possible parameters
and provide robust inference on the presence of gravitational waves, while Finn
\& Lommen chose to optimize over parameters, which would increase false alarm
risk and also underestimate the parameter uncertainties.

then be used for fast computation and storage of long simulations. We prove
guarantees that related the number of short paths requested from the microscale

Since its launch in 2010, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the

exquisite detail, thanks to its high spatio-temporal resolution and full-disk,
wide-temperature coverage. A combination of statistical analysis of this large

leading their physical interpretations to a convergence, favoring a bimodal
composition of an outer, fast-mode magnetosonic wave component and an inner,
non-wave CME component. Adding to this multifaceted picture, AIA has also
discovered new EUV wave and wave-like phenomena associated with various
eruptions, including quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave trains,
magnetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) in the corona and associated
nonlinear waves, and a variety of mini EUV waves. Seismological applications

excluded with neutralino masses of 6.2 TeV, with stops at 2.8 TeV, and with
squarks at 4.0 TeV. Using a soft lepton search, compressed spectra with a
chargino-neutralino splitting of $\Delta m = 20 - 30$ GeV can exclude

unspotted stars of the same luminosity, where beta is the equivalent covering
fraction of dark starspots and N \simeq 0.45+/-0.05. This is a much stronger
inflation than predicted by the models of Spruit & Weiss (1986) for main
sequence stars with the same beta, where N \sim 0.2 to 0.3. These models have
been compared to radii determined for very magnetically active K- and M-dwarfs
in the young Pleiades and NGC 2516 clusters, and the radii of tidally-locked,
low-mass eclipsing binary components. The binary components and ZAMS K-dwarfs
have radii inflated by \sim 10 per cent compared to an empirical
radius-luminosity relation that is defined by magnetically inactive field
dwarfs with interferometrically measured radii; low-mass M-type PMS stars, that

this were attributable to starspots alone, we estimate that an effective spot

we find greater consistency with the starspot models when comparing the loci of
active young stars and inactive field stars in colour-magnitude diagrams,
particularly for the highly inflated PMS stars, where the large, uniform

diverge at the horizon. For the in-falling observer starting from far off, both
the quantities -- energy density and flux at the horizon crossing are
\emph{regular and finite}. For example, the flux at the horizon for the
in-falling observer from infinity is approximately 24 times the flux for the
observer at infinity. Compared with the static observers in the near-horizon
region, this is quite small. Both the quantities grow as the in-fall progresses
inside the horizon and diverge at the singularity.

topological insulator (TI) compounds for the study and future application of

exploitation of predicted surface state properties, such as protection from
backscattering, dissipationless spin-polarized currents, and the emergence of
novel particles. Towards this end, major progress was recently made with the
introduction of highly resistive Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se, in which surface state
conductance and quantum oscillations are observed at low temperatures.
Nevertheless, an unresolved and pivotal question remains: while room
temperature ARPES studies reveal clear evidence of TI surface states, their
observation in transport experiments is limited to low temperatures. A better
understanding of this surface state suppression at elevated temperatures is of
fundamental interest, and crucial for pushing the boundary of device
applications towards room-temperature operation. In this work, we
simultaneously measure TI bulk and surface states via temperature dependent
optical spectroscopy, in conjunction with transport and ARPES measurements. We
find evidence of coherent surface state transport at low temperatures, and
propose that phonon mediated coupling between bulk and surface states
suppresses surface conductance as temperature rises.

various types of biological macromolecules within separate cellular
compartments and in highly viscous cytosol. Functioning of biochemical networks
suggests that such serendipitous collisions, as a whole, result into a perfect
synchronous order. Nonetheless, owing to the very nature of Brownian
collisions, a small yet non-trivial probability can always be associated with
the events when such synchronizations fail to emerge consistently; which
account for a damage of a biochemical pathway. The repair mechanism of the
system then attempts to minimize the damage, in the pursuit to bring restore
the appropriate level of synchronization between reactant concentrations.
Present work presents a predictive probabilistic model that describes the
various facets of this complicated and coupled process(damaging and repairing).
By describing the cytosolic reality of Brownian collisions with
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, the model presents analytical answers to the

within an arbitrary interval of time? and with what probability the damage to a

spectral energy distribution indicates the presence of an optically thin inner
cavity within the dust disk believed to mark the disappearance of the
primordial massive disk. We present new Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectra
of [OI] 63 micron for 21 transitional disks. Our survey complements the larger
Herschel GASPS program ""Gas in Protoplanetary Systems"" (Dent et al. 2013) by
quadrupling the number of transitional disks observed with PACS at this

beyond the inner cavity of most transitional disks. We find that transitional
disks have [OI] 63 micron line luminosities two times fainter than their full
disk counterparts. We self consistently determine various stellar properties
(e.g. bolometric luminosity, FUV excess, etc.) and disk properties (e.g. disk
dust mass, etc.) that could influence the [OI] 63 micron line luminosity and we
find no correlations that can explain the lower [OI] 63 micron line
luminosities in transitional disks. Using a grid of thermo-chemical
protoplanetary disk models, we conclude that either transitional disks are less
flared than full disks or they possess lower gas-to-dust ratios due to a
depletion of gas mass. This result suggests that transitional disks are more
evolved than their full disk counterparts, possibly even at large radii.

  Derivative Properties",,,,,"cs.DM cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary problem in property testing is to decide whether a given function
satisfies a certain property, or is far from any function satisfying it. This
crucially requires a notion of distance between functions. The most prevalent
notion is the Hamming distance over the {\em uniform} distribution on the
domain. This restriction to uniformity is more a matter of convenience than of
necessity, and it is important to investigate distances induced by more general
distributions.
  In this paper, we make significant strides in this direction. We give simple
and optimal testers for {\em bounded derivative properties} over {\em arbitrary
product distributions}. Bounded derivative properties include fundamental
properties such as monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity. Our results subsume
almost all known results (upper and lower bounds) on monotonicity and Lipschitz
testing.
  We prove an intimate connection between bounded derivative property testing
and binary search trees (BSTs). We exhibit a tester whose query complexity is
the sum of expected depths of optimal BSTs for each marginal. Furthermore, we
show this sum-of-depths is also a lower bound. A fundamental technical
contribution of this work is an {\em optimal dimension reduction theorem} for
all bounded derivative properties, which relates the distance of a function
from the property to the distance of restrictions of the function to random
lines. Such a theorem has been elusive even for monotonicity for the past 15
years, and our theorem is an exponential improvement to the previous best known
result.

and investigate the wavefront distortion as seen by a distant observer. Near
the observer, the propagating wave can be decomposed using the
Laguerre-Gaussian mode basis and its wavefront distortion can be characterized
by the decomposition coefficient. We find that this decomposition spectrum is
symmetric for wave sources located near a Schwarzschild black hole, but is
generically asymmetric if the host black hole is rotating. The spectrum
asymmetry, or the net orbital angular momentum carried by the wave, is
intimately related to the black hole spin and mass, the wave frequency and the
locations of the source and the observer. We present semi-analytical
expressions and numerical results for these parameter-dependences. If the
radiation is temporally coherent, our results show that the secondary images of
the source can be almost as bright as its primary image. In the case of
temporally-incoherent radiation, we show that the non-fundamental spectrum
components could be resolved by spatially-separated telescopes, although that
would be degenerate with the telescope direction. Finally, our results suggest
that the black-hole-induced spectrum asymmetry is generally too weak to be
observed in radio astronomy, even if the observer were located near a caustic

image segmentation. The diffusion matrix is defined based on the input image.
The eigenfunctions and the projection of the input image in some eigenspace
capture key features of the input image. An important property of the model is
that for many input images, the first few eigenfunctions are close to being
piecewise constant, which makes them useful as the basis for a variety of
applications such as image segmentation and edge detection. The eigenvalue
problem is shown to be related to the algebraic eigenvalue problems resulting
from several commonly used discrete spectral clustering models. The relation
provides a better understanding and helps developing more efficient numerical
implementation and rigorous numerical analysis for discrete spectral
segmentation methods. The new continuous model is also different from
energy-minimization methods such as geodesic active contour in that no initial
guess is required for in the current model. The multi-scale feature is a
natural consequence of the anisotropic diffusion operator so there is no need
to solve the eigenvalue problem at multiple levels. A numerical implementation
based on a finite element method with an anisotropic mesh adaptation strategy
is presented. It is shown that the numerical scheme gives much more accurate
results on eigenfunctions than uniform meshes. Several interesting features of
the model are examined in numerical examples and possible applications are
discussed.

properties in three flat-histogram simulation methods, the Wang-Landau (WL)
algorithm, the 1/t algorithm, and tomographic sampling (TS). In the first case
the refinement parameter f is rescaled (f -> f/2) each time the flat-histogram
condition is satisfied, in the second f ~ 1/t after a suitable initial phase,
while in the third f is constant (t corresponds to Monte Carlo time). To
examine the intrinsic convergence properties of these methods, free of any
complications associated with a specific model, we study a featureless entropy
landscape, such that for each allowed energy E = 1,...,L, there is exactly one
state, that is, g(E) = 1 for all E. Convergence of sampling corresponds to
g(E,t) -> const. as t -> infinity, so that the standard deviation sigma_g of g
over energy values is a measure of the overall sampling error. Neither the WL
algorithm nor TS converge: in both cases sigma_g saturates at long times. In
the 1/t algorithm, by contrast, sigma_g decays \propto 1/\sqrt{t}. Modified TS
and 1/t procedures, in which f \propto 1/t^alpha, converge for alpha values
between 0 and 1. There are two essential facets to convergence of
flat-histogram methods: elimination of initial errors in g(E), and correction
of the sampling noise accumulated during the process. For a simple example, we
demonstrate analytically, using a Langevin equation, that both kinds of errors
can be eliminated, asymptotically, if f ~ 1/t^alpha with 0 < \alpha \leq 1.
Convergence is optimal for alpha = 1. For alpha \leq 0 the sampling noise never
decays, while for alpha > 1 the initial error is never completely eliminated.

Tauri, using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini
North. The blueshifted outflow shows two distinct components in [Fe II] 1.644
micron emission, which are separated using multi-component line fitting. A
stationary recollimation shock is observed, in agreement with previous X-ray
and FUV observations. The presence of this shock indicates that the innermost
streamlines of the high-velocity component are launched at a very small radius,
0.01-0.15 AU, from the central star. The jet accelerates and expands downstream
of the recollimation shock; the 'acceleration' is likely a sign of velocity
variations in the jet. No evidence of rotation is found, and we compare this
non-detection to previous counter-claims. Moving jet knots, likely the result
of the jet velocity variations, are observed. One of these knots moves more
slowly than previously observed knots, and the knot ejection interval appears
to be non-periodic. An intermediate-velocity component surrounds this central
jet, and is interpreted as the result of a turbulent mixing layer along the jet
boundaries. Such lateral entrainment requires the presence of a magnetic field
of strength a few mG or less at hundreds of AU above the disc surface, which is
argued to be a reasonable proposition. In H2 1-0 S(1) 2.1218 micron emission, a
wide-angle, intermediate-velocity blueshifted outflow is observed. Both
outflows are consistent with being launched by a magnetocentrifugal disc wind,
although an X-wind origin for the high-velocity jet cannot be ruled out.

modelling of neural networks, because it allows a quantification of the

hard to achieve. The mechanism responsible for this hole alignment is the
destructive interference of the direct and indirect (via the autoionizing

nuclear matter at saturation density has become one of the major constraints on
mean-field models of nuclear many-body systems as well as of models of high
density matter in astrophysical objects and heavy-ion collisions. We present a
comprehensive re-analysis of recent data on GMR energies in even-even $^{\rm
112-124}$Sn and $^{\rm 106,100-116}$Cd and earlier data on 58 $\le$ A $\le$ 208
nuclei. The incompressibility of finite nuclei $K_{\rm A}$ is expressed as a
leptodermous expansion with volume, surface, isospin and Coulomb coefficients
$K_{\rm vol}$, $K_{\rm surf}$, $K_\tau$ and $K_{\rm coul}$. \textit{Assuming}
that the volume coefficient $K_{\rm vol}$ is identified with $K_{\rm 0}$, the
$K_{\rm coul}$ = -(5.2 $\pm$ 0.7) MeV and the contribution from the curvature
term K$_{\rm curv}$A$^{\rm -2/3}$ in the expansion is neglected, compelling
evidence is found for $K_{\rm 0}$ to be in the range 250 $ < K_{\rm 0} < $ 315
MeV, the ratio of the surface and volume coefficients $c = K_{\rm surf}/K_{\rm
vol}$ to be between -2.4 and -1.6 and $K_{\rm \tau}$ between -840 and -350 MeV.
We show that the generally accepted value of $K_{\rm 0}$ = (240 $\pm$ 20) MeV
can be obtained from the fits provided $c \sim$ -1, as predicted by the
majority of mean-field models. However, the fits are significantly improved if
$c$ is allowed to vary, leading to a range of $K_{\rm 0}$, extended to higher
values. A self-consistent simple (toy) model has been developed, which shows
that the density dependence of the surface diffuseness of a vibrating nucleus
plays a major role in determination of the ratio K$_{\rm surf}/K_{\rm vol}$ and
yields predictions consistent with our findings.

and a new formula is derived for multiplying long matrix sequences that not
only leads to an elegant representation of the wave function, but also results
in much faster computation than earlier methods. The proposed method covers a
broad spectrum of potentials of which multi-barrier systems are special cases.
The paradigm is exemplified with a finite lattice of non-uniform rectangular
barriers - non-uniformity being crucial, as the uniform case has been solved
exactly by Griffiths and Steinke. For the non-uniform multi-barrier problem,
the intervening wells strongly influence the transmission probability.
Surprisingly, we find that the wells act 'individually', i.e. their influence
is only a function of their width and is independent of their exact 'location'
in a multi-barrier system. This leads to a startling observation, which we have
termed as the 'Alias Effect.' The exact solutions are supported with asymptotic
formulas.

recovery of the structure of a network from data is of prime importance for the

exponential-time algorithms.
  An instance of the problem Max (r,2)-CSP, or simply Max 2-CSP, is
parametrized by the domain size r (often 2), the number of variables n
(vertices in the constraint graph G), and the number of constraints m (edges in
G). When G is cubic, and omitting sub-exponential terms here for clarity, we
give an algorithm running in time r^((1/5)n) = r^((2/15)m); the previous best
was r^((1/4)n) = r^((1/6)m). By known results, this improvement for the cubic
case results in an algorithm running in time r^((9/50)m) for general instances;
the previous best was r^((19/100)m). We show that the analysis of the earlier
algorithm was tight: our improvement is in the algorithm, not just the
analysis. The new algorithm, like the old, extends to Polynomial and Ring CSP.
  We also give faster algorithms for #Dominating Set, counting the dominating
sets of every cardinality 0,...,n for a graph G of order n. For cubic graphs,
our algorithm runs in time 3^((1/6)n); the previous best was 2^((1/2)n). For
general graphs, we give an unrelated algorithm running in time 1.5183^n; the
previous best was 1.5673^n.
  The previous best algorithms for these problems all used local
transformations and were analyzed by the ""Measure and Conquer"" method. Our new
algorithms capitalize on the existence of small balanced separators for cubic
graphs - a non-local property - and the ability to tailor the local algorithms
always to ""pivot"" on a vertex in the separator. The new algorithms perform much
as the old ones until the separator is empty, at which point they gain because
the remaining vertices are split into two independent problem instances that
can be solved recursively. It is likely that such algorithms can be effective
for other problems too, and we present their design and analysis in a general
framework.

each Dirac point with four-fold degeneracy carries a zero Chern number, a Dirac
semimetal can be stable only in the presence of certain crystalline symmetries.
In this work, we propose a general framework to classify stable 3D Dirac
semimetals. Based on symmetry analysis, we show that various types of stable 3D
Dirac semimetals exist in systems having the time-reversal, inversion, and
uniaxial rotational symmetries. There are two distinct classes of stable 3D
Dirac semimetals. In the first class, a pair of 3D Dirac points locate on the
rotation axis, away from its center. Moreover, the 3D Dirac semimetals in this
class have nontrivial topological properties characterized by 2D topological
invariants, such as the $Z_{2}$ invariant or the mirror Chern number. These 2D
topological indices give rise to stable 2D surface Dirac cones, which can be
deformed to Fermi arcs when the surface states couple to the bulk states on the
Fermi level. On the other hand, the second class of Dirac SM phases possess a
3D Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum (TRIM) on the rotation
axis and do not have surface states in general.

polymer systems, and can play a role in the organization of chromosomes.
Despite many theoretical studies, the effects of topological constraints on the
equilibrium state of a single compact polymer have not been systematically
studied. Here we use simulations to address this longstanding problem. We find
that sufficiently long unknotted polymers differ from knotted ones in the
spatial and topological states of their subchains. The unknotted globule has
subchains that are mostly unknotted and form asymptotically compact $R_G(s)
\sim s^{1/3}$ crumples. However, crumples display high fractal dimension of the
surface $d_b = 2.8$, forming excessive contacts and interpenetrating each
other. We conclude that this topologically constrained equilibrium state
resembles a conjectured crumpled globule [Grosberg et al., Journal de Physique,
1988, 49, 2095], but differs from its idealized hierarchy of self-similar,
isolated and compact crumples.

relaxation modulus at different temperatures G(t,T) was calculated by the
Green-Kubo relation. The TTS of G(t,T) of bead-spring polymer melts worked well
at temperatures sufficiently higher than its Tg. However, when the system
temperature is approaching the glass transition regime, the breakdown of TTS is
observed. At temperatures near the Tg, the temperature dependence of the shift
factor aTB, which is defined at the time scale between the bond relaxation and
the chain relaxation regimes of a G(t)-function, is significantly stronger than
ones aTA defined by the time scale of the chain relaxation modes. In direct
relation to the breakdown of TTS of G(t,T), the decoupling of Stokes-Einstein
law of diffusion-viscosity relation also appears in the glass transition
regime. The analysis of the van Hove function Gs(r,t) and non-gaussian
parameter, a2(t), of the bead motions strongly suggest that the TTS breakdown
is concerned with the dynamic heterogeneity. The effect of the chain stiffness
on the temperature dependence of the shift factors was also investigated in
this study. The stiffer chains melt has a stronger temperature dependence of
the shift factors than the ones of the flexible chains melt. However,
regardless of the chain stiffness, the stress relaxation modulus functions of

Classically, we find stable N\'{e}el, spiral and collinear magnetically ordered

theory shows that ring exchange induces a large quantum disordered region in
the phase diagram, completely wiping out the classically stable collinear

demonstrates that the large spin-liquid phase observed in the full model is a
direct manifestation of competing classical orders. To understand the origin of

gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio $\beta$ is lower than unity, are essential for
understanding the thermal structure and dynamical activity of the solar
atmosphere. Recent developments in the theory and numerical modeling of
polarization in spectral lines have suggested that information on the magnetic
field of the chromosphere-corona transition region could be obtained by
measuring the linear polarization of the solar disk radiation at the core of
the hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ line at 121.6~nm, which is produced by scattering
processes and the Hanle effect. The Chromospheric Lyman-$\alpha$
Spectropolarimeter (CLASP) sounding rocket experiment aims to measure the
intensity (Stokes $I$) and the linear polarization profiles ($Q/I$ and $U/I$)
of the hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ line. In this paper we clarify the information
that the Hanle effect can provide by applying a Stokes inversion technique
based on a database search. The database contains all theoretical $Q/I$ and
$U/I$ profiles calculated in a one-dimensional semi-empirical model of the
solar atmosphere for all possible values of the strength, inclination, and
azimuth of the magnetic field vector, though this atmospheric region is highly
inhomogeneous and dynamic. We focus on understanding the sensitivity of the
inversion results to the noise and spectral resolution of the synthetic
observations as well as the ambiguities and limitation inherent to the Hanle
effect when only the hydrogen Lyman-$\alpha$ is used. We conclude that
spectropolarimetric observations with CLASP can indeed be a suitable diagnostic
tool for probing the magnetism of the transition region, especially when
complemented with information on the magnetic field azimuth that can be
obtained from other instruments.

from the identity by a matrix of bounded rank. All quantities except the rank
of $\Sigma - I_M$ may depend on $M$ in an arbitrary fashion. We investigate the
principal components, i.e.\ the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors, of $\mathcal

$\langle \mathbf w, \boldsymbol \xi_i \rangle$ of the outlier and non-outlier
eigenvectors $\boldsymbol \xi_i$. Our results also hold near the so-called BBP

near-degenerate outliers. We believe the obtained rates of convergence to be
optimal. In addition, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the generalized

approximated by polyhedrons with several thousands of surface elements, which
have been determined by 3D laser scanning method of 36 terrestrial rock
samples. These samples came from three distinct sets with different origin and
shape characteristics. Two types of gas-meteoroid interactions (diffuse and

(unknown) shapes of real meteoroids. A simple relationship between median of
meteoroid spin frequencies $\bar{f}$ (Hz), ejection velocities $v_{\rm ej}$ (m

components enter orbit about each other (Scheeres, D.J. [2007]. Icarus 189,
370-385). Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the
orbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid
classes along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio.
Related to this is a new binary process termed secondary fission - the
secondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally accelerated via
gravitational torques until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary
system. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a synchronous
binary by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary
asteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides. These
results emphasize the importance of the initial component size distribution and
configuration within the parent asteroid. NEAs may go through multiple binary
cycles and many YORP-induced rotational fissions during their approximately 10
Myr lifetime in the inner Solar System. Rotational fission and the ensuing
dynamics are responsible for all NEA systems including the most commonly

$w_{\infty}$ and $\omega$ are the free-stream and the body rotation velocities
respectively, and $\nu$ is the fluid kinematic viscosity. The spectrum and the
eigenfunctions obtained allow us to explain the different bifurcations from the
axisymmetric state observed in previous numerical studies. Our results reveal
that three global eigenmodes, denoted Low-Frequency (LF), Medium-Frequency (MF)
and High-Frequency (HF) modes, become unstable in different regions of the
$Re-\Omega$ parameter plane. We provide precise computations of the
corresponding neutral curves, that divide the $Re-\Omega$ plane into four
different regions: the stable axisymmetric flow prevails for small enough
values of $Re$ and $\Omega$, while three different frozen states, where the
wake structures co-rotate with the body at different angular velocities, take
place as a consequence of the destabilization of the LF, MF and HF modes.

equivariant bifurcations implies that the weakly non-linear regimes that emerge
close to criticality must necessarily take the form of rotating-wave states.
These states, previously referred to as frozen wakes in the literature, are
thus shown to result from the base-flow symmetry.

reduce costs and, at the same time, to meet user QoS for NOs inside the same

maximize its profit. This algorithms adopts a distributed approach in which
each NO autonomously makes its own decisions, and where the best solution
arises without the need to synchronize them or to resort to a trusted third

engineering, and a common solution is to rely on a broad class of
$\textit{filtering}$ techniques in order to afford stability to intrinsically
unstable systems. For instance, electronic systems are frequently designed to
incorporate electrical filters composed of, $\textit{e.g.}$ RLC components, in
order to suppress the effects of out-of-band fluctuations that interfere with
desired performance. Quantum coherent systems are now moving to a level of
complexity where challenges associated with realistic time-dependent noise are
coming to the fore. Unfortunately, standard control solutions involving
feedback are generally impossible due to the strictures of quantum mechanics,
and existing error-suppressing gate constructions generally rely on unphysical
bang-bang controls or quasi-static error models that do not reflect realistic
laboratory environments. In this work we use the theory of quantum control
engineering and experiments with trapped $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions to demonstrate
the construction of novel $\textit{noise filters}$ which are specifically
designed to mitigate the effect of realistic time-dependent fluctuations on
qubits \emph{during useful operations}. Starting with desired filter
characteristics and the Walsh basis functions, we use a combination of analytic
design rules and numeric search to construct time-domain noise filters tailored
to a desired state transformation. Our results validate the generalized
filter-transfer function framework for arbitrary quantum control operations,
and demonstrate that it can be leveraged as an effective and efficient tool for
developing novel robust control protocols.

exhibit a peak at about solar abundance whereas for stars with low-mass and
high-mass planets the [X$_\alpha$/H] and [X$_{\rm Fe}$/H] peak abundances
remain at $\sim -0.1$~dex and $\sim +0.15$~dex, respectively. We display these
element abundances for stars with low-mass and high-mass planets, and BDs
versus the minimum mass, $m_C \sin i$, of the most-massive substellar companion
in each system, and we find a maximum in $\alpha$-element as well as Fe-peak
abundances at $m_C \sin i \sim 1.35\pm 0.20$ jupiter masses. We discuss the
implication of these results in the context of the formation scenario of BDs in

one-to-one correspondence between the non-degenerate ground-state and the
particle and paramagnetic current density. Definition of $N$-representable
density pairs $(\rho,j^p)$ is given and it is proven that the set of
$v$-representable densities constitutes a proper subset of the set of
$N$-representable densities. For a Levy-Lieb type functional $Q(\rho,j^p)$, it
is demonstrated that (i) it is a proper extension of the universal
Hohenberg-Kohn functional, $F_{HK}(\rho,j^p)$, to $N$-representable densities,
(ii) there exists a wavefunction $\psi_0$ such that
$Q(\rho,j^p)=(\psi_0,H_0\psi_0)_{L^2}$, where $H_0$ is the Hamiltonian without
external potential terms, and (iii) it is not convex. Furthermore, a convex and
universal functional $F(\rho,j^p)$ is studied and proven to be equal the convex
envelope of $Q(\rho,j^p)$. For both $Q$ and $F$, we give upper and lower

cooperation and partial cribbing and characterize its capacity region.
Cooperation means that the two encoders send a message to one another via a
rate-limited link prior to transmission, while partial cribbing means that each
of the two encoders obtains a deterministic function of the other encoder's
output with or without delay. Prior work in this field dealt separately with
cooperation and partial cribbing. However, by combining these two methods we
can achieve significantly higher rates. Remarkably, the capacity region does
not require an additional auxiliary random variable (RV) since the purpose of
both cooperation and partial cribbing is to generate a common message between
the encoders. In the proof we combine methods of block Markov coding, backward
decoding, double rate-splitting, and joint typicality decoding. Furthermore, we
present the Gaussian MAC with combined one-sided cooperation and quantized
cribbing. For this model, we give an achievability scheme that shows how many
cooperation or quantization bits are required in order to achieve a Gaussian
MAC with full cooperation/cribbing capacity region. After establishing our main
results, we consider two cases where only one auxiliary RV is needed. The first
is a rate distortion dual setting for the MAC with a common message, a private
message and combined cooperation and cribbing. The second is a state-dependent
MAC with cooperation, where the state is known at a partially cribbing encoder
and at the decoder. However, there are cases where more than one auxiliary RV
is needed, e.g., when the cooperation and cribbing are not used for the same
purposes. We present a MAC with an action-dependent state, where the action is
based on the cooperation but not on the cribbing. Therefore, in this case more
than one auxiliary RV is needed.

to consider the nature of its adversaries. In the particular context of
controller synthesis for quantitative specifications, the usual problem is to
devise a strategy for a reactive system which yields some desired performance,
taking into account the possible impact of the environment of the system. There
are at least two ways to look at this environment. In the classical analysis of
two-player quantitative games, the environment is purely antagonistic and the
problem is to provide strict performance guarantees. In Markov decision
processes, the environment is seen as purely stochastic: the aim is then to
optimize the expected payoff, with no guarantee on individual outcomes.
  In this expository work, we report on recent results introducing the beyond
worst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee
some quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher
expected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given
as input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide
nice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict
(but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while
unlikely) circumstances. It has been studied for both the mean-payoff and the
shortest path quantitative measures.

corresponding FCGs and their associated infinite duration games are memoryless

modeling and verification of real-time behaviors. The approach facilitates the
composition of system models from reusable building blocks as well as the
verification of functional and real-time properties and the automatic
generation of Java code.
  In this paper, we describe the extension of the tool-set to enable the
modeling and verification of probabilistic real-time system behavior with the
focus on spatial properties that ensure system safety. In particular, we
incorporate descriptions of probabilistic behavior into our Reactive Blocks
models and integrate the model checker PRISM which allows to verify that a
real-time system satisfies certain safety properties with a given probability.
Moreover, we consider the spatial implication of probabilistic system
specifications by integrating the spatial verification tool BeSpaceD and give
an automatic approach to translate system specifications to the input languages
of PRISM and BeSpaceD. The approach is highlighted by an example.

test it have improved over the last 40 years, thus far all Bell tests have
suffered at least from the detection or the locality loophole. Most photonic
Bell tests rely on inefficient discrete-outcome measurements, often provided by
photon counting detection. One possible way to close the detection loophole in
photonic Bell tests is to involve efficient continuous-variable measurements
instead, such as homodyne detection. Here, we propose a test of the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality that applies photon counting and
homodyne detection on weakly amplified two-photon N00N states. The scheme
suggested is remarkably robust against experimental imperfections and suits the
limits of current technology. As amplified quantum states are considered, our
work also contributes to the exploration of entangled macroscopic quantum
systems. Further, it may constitute an alternative platform for a loophole-free
Bell test, which is also important for quantum-technological applications.

networks using the example of coupled R\""ossler systems. In an ON, the nodes
with NDP values at one extreme, e.g. nodes with higher frequencies in coupled
R\""ossler systems, have higher degrees and are chosen as hubs. These nodes also
show higher betweenness centrality. The links in ON are preferably between
nodes with large differences in NDP values. The ONs have in general higher
clustering coefficient. We also study other network properties such as average
shortest path, degree mixing etc. and their relation to the NDP in ON. We
consider cases of both one and two NDPs and also directed networks.

collapse of a massive star and that the GRB site was a region with properties
different from the rest of the galaxy. We reobserved the galaxy in high spatial
resolution using the VIMOS integral-field unit (IFU) at the VLT with a spaxel
size of 0.67 arcsec. Furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data from
HIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the center of
the galaxy and an HII region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties
of different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global
and local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the
GRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 Z_solar, but
its specific SFR (SSFR) of 7.4 M_solar/yr/L/L* and age (determined by the
Halpha EW) are similar to other HII regions in the host. The galaxy shows a
gradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is
common for spiral galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs
prefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in S-type
galaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.
Kinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for large
perturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. This study
confirms the collapsar origin of GRB060505 but reveals that the properties of
the HII region surrounding the GRB were not unique to that galaxy. Spatially
resolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations of
unresolved GRB hosts observations at higher redshifts.

widespread reionization (z~15-200) is the sky-averaged \lambda 21 cm background
arising from hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. Though an individual antenna
could in principle detect the line signature, data analysis must separate
foregrounds that are orders of magnitude brighter than the \lambda 21 cm
background (but that are anticipated to vary monotonically and gradually with
frequency). Using more physically motivated models for foregrounds than in
previous studies, we show that the intrinsic ""spectral smoothness"" of the
foregrounds is likely not a concern, and that data analysis for an ideal
antenna should be able to detect the \lambda 21 cm signal after deprojecting a
~5th order polynomial in log(\nu). However, we find that the foreground signal
is corrupted by the frequency-dependent response of a real antenna. The
frequency dependence complicates modeling of foregrounds commonly based on the
assumption of spectral smoothness. Much of our study focuses on the
Large-aperture Experiment to detect the Dark Age (LEDA), which combines both
radiometric and interferometric measurements. We show that statistical
uncertainty remaining after fitting antenna gain patterns to interferometric
measurements does not compromise extraction of the \lambda 21 cm signal for a
range of cosmological models after fitting a 7th order polynomial to
radiometric data. Our results generalize to most efforts to measure the

Domainko","The environment of the unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1507-622","6 pages, 3 figure, comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nature of the gamma-ray source HESS J1507-622 that is located
significantly off-set from the Galactic plane is not ascertained to date.
Identifying the environment of an enigmatic object may help to constrain its
nature. The path of the line of sight of HESS J1507-622 through the Galaxy is
compared to the characteristic length scales of stellar populations of
different ages. Furthermore, for this object, the energy density in particles
is contrasted to the magnetic field energy density and constraints on the
distance based on equipartition between these two components are calculated.
The line of sight of HESS J1507-622 reaches a minimum distance to the Galactic
center at around a galactocentric distance of 5.3 kpc at about 300 pc off the
Galactic disc. This location coincides with the scale length and width of stars
with an age of 1.2 Gyr which could in principle be an indication that HESS
J1507-622 is connected to a stellar population of similar age. For such a case
the source appears to be strongly particle dominated. In a leptonic scenario,
if a magnetic field in the source of 1 $\mu$G is assumed, equipartition between
magnetic field and particles would be realized at a distance of >1 Mpc. This
could indicate an extragalactic origin of this object. However, an
extragalactic origin is challenged by the extension of the source. The
environment of HESS J1507-622 still remains elusive. For the case where this
source belongs to a new class of gamma-ray emitters, the distribution of
related objects (if existing) may help to settle the respective environment and
distance scale.

the study of the quadratic correction, the curvature function, started only
very recently. At any fixed $J$, the curvature function can be extracted at all
loops from the $\mathbf{P}\mu$-system formulation of the Thermodynamical Bethe

present a systematic double expansion of the Bethe Ansatz equations at large

obtain a closed explicit simple formula for the one-loop curvature function.
The formula is parametric in $J$ and can be evaluated with minor effort for any

$10^{13}$ ions cm$^{-2}$. The chemical evolution of the sample was evaluated

Our goal is to characterise the warm absorber (WA) properties along the
line-of-sight to the active nucleus. We significantly detect WAs in $65\%$ of
the sample sources. Our results are consistent with WAs being present in at
least half of the Seyfert galaxies in the nearby Universe, in agreement with
previous estimates . We find a gap in the distribution of the ionisation
parameter in the range $0.5<\log\xi<1.5$ which we interpret as a thermally
unstable region for WA clouds. This may indicate that the warm absorber flow is
probably constituted by a clumpy distribution of discrete clouds rather than a
continuous medium. The distribution of the WA column densities for the sources
with broad Fe K$\alpha$ lines are similar to those sources which do not have
broadened emission lines. Therefore the detected broad Fe K$\alpha$ emission
lines are bonafide and not artifacts of ionised absorption in the soft X-rays.
The WA parameters show no correlation among themselves, with the exception of
the ionisation parameter versus column density. The shallow slope of the
$\log\xi$ versus $\log v_{\rm out}$ linear regression ($0.12\pm 0.03$) is
inconsistent with the scaling laws predicted by radiation or
magneto-hydrodynamic-driven winds. Our results suggest also that WA and Ultra
Fast Outflows (UFOs) do not represent extreme manifestation of the same
astrophysical system.

asks for k nodes in G that (directly and indirectly) influence the largest
number of nodes under a pre-defined diffusion model. This problem finds
important applications in viral marketing, and has been extensively studied in
the literature. Existing algorithms for influence maximization, however, either
trade approximation guarantees for practical efficiency, or vice versa. In
particular, among the algorithms that achieve constant factor approximations
under the prominent independent cascade (IC) model or linear threshold (LT)
model, none can handle a million-node graph without incurring prohibitive
overheads.
  This paper presents TIM, an algorithm that aims to bridge the theory and
practice in influence maximization. On the theory side, we show that TIM runs
in O((k+\ell) (n+m) \log n / \epsilon^2) expected time and returns a
(1-1/e-\epsilon)-approximate solution with at least 1 - n^{-\ell} probability.
The time complexity of TIM is near-optimal under the IC model, as it is only a
\log n factor larger than the \Omega(m + n) lower-bound established in previous
work (for fixed k, \ell, and \epsilon). Moreover, TIM supports the triggering
model, which is a general diffusion model that includes both IC and LT as
special cases. On the practice side, TIM incorporates novel heuristics that
significantly improve its empirical efficiency without compromising its
asymptotic performance. We experimentally evaluate TIM with the largest
datasets ever tested in the literature, and show that it outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions (with approximation guarantees) by up to four orders
of magnitude in terms of running time. In particular, when k = 50, \epsilon =
0.2, and \ell = 1, TIM requires less than one hour on a commodity machine to
process a network with 41.6 million nodes and 1.4 billion edges.

position of the optical star, thus proving it to be the first Be/BH X-ray
binary. The spectrum analysis requires a model fit with two components, a black
body plus a power law, with $k_{\rm B}T = 0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$~keV and a
photon index $\Gamma= 1.0\pm0.8$, respectively. The non-thermal component
dominates above $\simeq$0.8 keV. The obtained total flux is $F(0.3$--$5.5~{\rm

distance of $2.6\pm0.6$~kpc the total flux translates into a luminosity $L_{\rm
X} = (3.7\pm1.7)\times10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Considering the estimated range of
BH masses to be 3.8--6.9 $M_{\odot}$, this luminosity represents
$(6.7\pm4.4)\times10^{-8}~L_{\rm Edd}$, which is typical of stellar-mass BHs in
quiescence. We discuss the origin of the two spectral components: the thermal
component is associated with the hot wind of the Be star, whereas the power law
component is associated with emission from the vicinity of the BH. We also find
that the position of MWC~656 in the radio versus X-ray luminosity diagram may
be consistent with the radio/X-ray correlation observed in BH low-mass X-ray
binaries. This suggests that this correlation might also be valid for BH
high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) with X-ray luminosities down to $\sim10^{-8}

of a quantum system exhibits derivative discontinuities with respect to
different degrees of freedom that are a consequence of the integer nature of
electrons. The classical understanding refers to the derivative discontinuity
of the total energy as a function of the total number of electrons ($N$), but
it can also manifest at constant $N$. Examples are shown in models including
several Hydrogen systems with varying numbers of electrons or nuclear charge
($Z$), as well as the 1-dimensional Hubbard model (1DHM). Two sides of the
problem are investigated: first, the failure of currently used approximate
exchange-correlation functionals in DFT and, second, the importance of the
derivative discontinuity in the exact electronic structure of molecules, as
revealed by full configuration interaction (FCI). Currently, all approximate
functionals miss the derivative discontinuity, leading to basic errors that can
be seen in many ways: from the complete failure to give the total energy of
H$_2$ and H$_2^+$, to the missing gap in Mott insulators such as stretched
H$_2$ and the thermodynamic limit of the 1DHM, or a qualitatively incorrect
density in the HZ molecule with two electrons and incorrect electron transfer
processes. Description of the exact particle behavior of electrons is
emphasized, which is key to many important physical processes in real systems,

information (CSI) available, it can compensate for a significant portion of

bidirectional amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system, the relay already has
instantaneous CSI of both links available, as this is required for relay gain
adjustment. We therefore develop an optimal power allocation strategy for the
relay, which adjusts its instantaneous output power to the minimum level
required to avoid outages, but only if the required output power is below some
cutoff level; otherwise, the relay is silent in order to conserve power and
prolong its lifetime. The proposed scheme is proven to minimize the system

black hole and its host galaxy. We assume AGN feedback driven by radiation
pressure on dust, which sweeps up the ambient dusty gas into an outflowing
shell, and consider feedback-triggered star formation in the outflow. An upper
limit to the characteristic size of galaxies may be defined by the critical
radius beyond which radiation pressure on dust is no longer able to drive the
shell. The corresponding enclosed mass may be compared with the host galaxy
bulge mass. We show that the resulting relation between characteristic radius
and mass, of the form $R \propto \sqrt M$, corresponds to the observed
mass-radius relation of early-type galaxies. We suggest that such simple
physical scalings may account for a number of observed galaxy scaling
relations. In this picture, both the size and structural evolution of galaxies
can be interpreted as a consequence of AGN feedback-driven star formation,
mainly associated with the spheroidal component. The accreting black hole is
responsible for triggering star formation in the host galaxy, while ultimately
clearing the dusty gas out of the host, thus also contributing to the chemical
evolution of galaxies. We discuss the importance of radiation pressure on dust
in determining the galaxies large-scale properties, and consider the
possibility of the central black hole directly shaping its host galaxy through
AGN feedback.

order(s), the ""pure"" pairing gap of cuprates is detected in the nodal region,

has been viewed to be rather conventional, closing at the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc). However, the density of states contributed from
the nodal region was claimed to have a gap-like structure even above Tc. Here
we present a missing evidence for a single-particle gap near the node
signifying the realization of a phase incoherent d-wave superconductivity above
Tc in the optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d. We find that the pair formation is
formulated by momentum-independent temperature evolutions of three parameters:
a BCS-type energy gap (Delta), a single particle scattering rate (Gamma_single)
and a pair breaking rate (Gamma_pair). The superconductivity occurs when the
Gamma_pair value is suppressed smaller than Gamma_single on cooling, and the
magnitude of Tc in cuprates is governed by a condition of
Gamma_single(Tc)=Gamma_pair(Tc).

applications of iron-based superconductors. By intercalating spacer layers,
superconducting transition temperature has been raised over 40 K. On the other

crystals, which hinders the appearance of bulk superconductivity and causes
strong controversies over its fundamental properties. Here we report a

by controlling the amount of O$_2$, annealing temperature, and time. Bulk
superconductivity can be gradually induced by increasing the amount of O$_2$

the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods.
  Results: We made ten SNP and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five
variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a
similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid
genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and
the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major
sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas.
We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in
10-15kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200kb
without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

surfaces of a toroidal magnetic confinement device are presented. Measurements
are taken in the TJ-II stellarator with two distant Langmuir probe arrays. The
edge floating potentials display differences of several tens of Volts in
electron-root wave-heated plasmas. The differences are reduced for higher
densities and lower electron temperatures after the ion-root electric field
forms at the plasma edge. Neoclassical Monte Carlo simulations estimate the
correct order of magnitude for the overall variation in potential and predict
the trend observed with the radial electric field. However, for the specific
location of the probes, the simulations give differences smaller than those
observed experimentally.

and conclude that the main reason for the optical darkness is local extinction
inside of the host galaxy. Automatic observations were performed at
BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope. We also triggered target of opportunity (ToO)
observation at the OSN, IRAM PdBI and the GTC+OSIRIS. The host galaxy
photometric observations in optical to near-infrared (nIR) wavelengths were
achieved through large ground-based aperture telescopes, such as the 10.4m GTC,
the 4.2m WHT, 6m BTA, and the 2m LT. Based on these observations, spectral
energy distributions (SED) for the host galaxy and afterglow were constructed.
Thanks to mm observations at PdBI, we confirm the presence of a mm source
within the XRT error circle that faded over the course of our observations and
identify the host galaxy. However, we do not find any credible optical source
within early observations with BOOTES-4/MET and 1.5m OSN telescopes.
Spectroscopic observation of this galaxy by GTC showed a single faint emission
line that likely corresponds to [OII] 3727\{AA} at a redshift of 1.250+/-0.001
implying a SFR(M_sun/yr) > 6.18 M_sun/yr without correcting for dust
extinction. The probable extinction was revealed through analysis of the
afterglow SED, resulting in a value of AV >= ~ 0.9 at the rest frame, this is
comparable to extinction levels found among other dark GRBs. The SED of the
host galaxy is explained well (chi2/d.o.f.=0.564) by a luminous (MB=-21.16),
low-extinction (AV =0, rest frame), and aged (2.6 Gyr) stellar population. We
can explain this apparent contradiction in global and line-of-sight extinction
if the GRB birth place happened to lie in a local dense environment. In light
of having relatively small specific SFR (SSFR) ~ 5.3 M_sun/yr (L/L_star)-1,
this also could explain the age of the old stellar population of host galaxy.

A double of a Klein

the study of both moduli spaces and automorphisms of Klein surfaces.

means of incorporating parametric uncertainty into numerical simulations of

overall error that is within a desired tolerance, a large number of sample
simulations may be required (to control the sampling error), each of which may
need to be run at high levels of spatial fidelity (to control the spatial
error). Multilevel sampling methods aim to achieve the same accuracy as
traditional sampling methods, but at a reduced computational cost, through the
use of a hierarchy of spatial discretization models. Multilevel algorithms
coordinate the number of samples needed at each discretization level by
minimizing the computational cost, subject to a given error tolerance. They can
be applied to a variety of sampling schemes, exploit nesting when available,
can be implemented in parallel and can be used to inform adaptive spatial
refinement strategies. We extend the multilevel sampling algorithm to sparse
grid stochastic collocation methods, discuss its numerical implementation and
demonstrate its efficiency both theoretically and by means of numerical

Specifically, we consider Bayesian binary hypothesis testing performed by a
distributed detection and fusion system, where all decision-making agents have
binary votes that carry equal weight. Decision-making agents in the team
sequentially make local decisions based on their own private signals and all
precedent local decisions. It is shown that the optimal decision rule is not
affected by precedent local decisions when all agents observe conditionally
independent and identically distributed private signals. Perfect Bayesian
reasoning will cancel out all effects of social learning. When the agents
observe private signals with different signal-to-noise ratios, social learning
is again futile if the team decision is only approved by unanimity. Otherwise,
social learning can strictly improve the team performance. Furthermore, the
order in which agents make their decisions affects the team decision.

conjecture has been that of the NP-hardness of binary pattern tile set
synthesis (2-PATS). The $k$-PATS problem is that of designing a tile assembly
system with the smallest number of tile types which will self-assemble an input
pattern of $k$ colors. Of both theoretical and practical significance, $k$-PATS
has been studied in a series of papers which have shown $k$-PATS to be NP-hard
for $k = 60$, $k = 29$, and then $k = 11$. In this paper, we close the
fundamental conjecture that 2-PATS is NP-hard, concluding this line of study.
  While most of our proof relies on standard mathematical proof techniques, one
crucial lemma makes use of a computer-assisted proof, which is a relatively
novel but increasingly utilized paradigm for deriving proofs for complex
mathematical problems. This tool is especially powerful for attacking
combinatorial problems, as exemplified by the proof of the four color theorem
by Appel and Haken (simplified later by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and
Thomas) or the recent important advance on the Erd\H{o}s discrepancy problem by
Konev and Lisitsa using computer programs. We utilize a massively parallel
algorithm and thus turn an otherwise intractable portion of our proof into a
program which requires approximately a year of computation time, bringing the
use of computer-assisted proofs to a new scale. We fully detail the algorithm
employed by our code, and make the code freely available online.

Markov chains can be approximated by sets of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) when their indexing parameter grows very large. This approximation
cannot capture the stochastic nature of the process and, consequently, it can
provide an erroneous view of the behavior of the Markov chain if the indexing
parameter is not sufficiently high. Important phenomena that cannot be revealed
include non-negligible variance and bi-modal population distributions. A
less-known approximation proposed by Kurtz applies stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) and provides information about the stochastic nature of the
process. In this paper we apply and extend this diffusion approximation to
study stochastic Petri nets. We identify a class of nets whose underlying
stochastic process is a density dependent Markov chain whose indexing parameter
is a multiplicative constant which identifies the population level expressed by
the initial marking and we provide means to automatically construct the
associated set of SDEs. Since the diffusion approximation of Kurtz considers
the process only up to the time when it first exits an open interval, we extend
the approximation by a machinery that mimics the behavior of the Markov chain
at the boundary and allows thus to apply the approach to a wider set of
problems. The resulting process is of the jump-diffusion type. We illustrate by
examples that the jump-diffusion approximation which extends to bounded domains
can be much more informative than that based on ODEs as it can provide accurate
quantity distributions even when they are multi-modal and even for relatively
small population levels. Moreover, we show that the method is faster than
simulating the original Markov chain.

moving features cluster around an axis at position angle -166.6 deg that
connects the core with the standing feature. The moving features appear to
emanate from the standing feature in a manner strikingly similar to the results
of numerical 2-D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations in which
moving shocks are generated at a recollimation shock. Because of this, and the
close analogy to the jet feature HST-1 in M87, we identify the standing feature
in BL Lac as a recollimation shock. We assume that the magnetic field dominates
the dynamics in the jet, and that the field is predominantly toroidal. From
this we suggest that the moving features are compressions established by slow
and fast mode magneto-acoustic MHD waves. We illustrate the situation with a
simple model in which the slowest moving feature is a slow-mode wave, and the
fastest feature is a fast-mode wave. In the model the beam has Lorentz factor
about 3.5 in the frame of the host galaxy, and the fast mode wave has Lorentz
factor about 1.6 in the frame of the beam. This gives a maximum apparent speed
for the moving features 10c. In this model the Lorentz factor of the pattern in
the galaxy frame is approximately 3 times larger than that of the beam itself.

algorithm of Henzinger, Klein, Subramanian, and Rao [STOC'94]. The second is
Fakcharoenphol and Rao's algorithm [FOCS'01] for emulating Dijkstra's algorithm
on the dense distance graph (DDG). A DDG is defined for a decomposition of a
planar graph $G$ into regions of at most $r$ vertices each, for some parameter
$r < n$. The vertex set of the DDG is the set of $\Theta(n/\sqrt r)$ vertices
of $G$ that belong to more than one region (boundary vertices). The DDG has
$\Theta(n)$ arcs, such that distances in the DDG are equal to the distances in

(nicknamed FR-Dijkstra) runs in $O(n\log(n) r^{-1/2} \log r)$ time, and is a
key component in many state-of-the-art planar graph algorithms for shortest
paths, minimum cuts, and maximum flows. By combining these two techniques we
remove the $\log n$ dependency in the running time of the shortest-path
algorithm, making it $O(n r^{-1/2} \log^2r)$.
  This work is part of a research agenda that aims to develop new techniques
that would lead to faster, possibly linear-time, algorithms for problems such
as minimum-cut, maximum-flow, and shortest paths with negative arc lengths. As
immediate applications, we show how to compute maximum flow in directed
weighted planar graphs in $O(n \log p)$ time, where $p$ is the minimum number
of edges on any path from the source to the sink. We also show how to compute
any part of the DDG that corresponds to a region with $r$ vertices and $k$
boundary vertices in $O(r \log k)$ time, which is faster than has been
previously known for small values of $k$.

intriguing self-ordered phases of matter. Well known examples are crystalline
solids or Coulomb crystals in ion traps. In those systems, crystallization
proceeds via a classical transition, driven by thermal fluctuations. In
contrast, ensembles of ultracold atoms laser-excited to Rydberg states provide
a well-controlled quantum system, in which a crystalline phase transition
governed by quantum fluctuations can be explored. Here we report on the
experimental preparation of the crystalline states in such a Rydberg many-body
system. Fast coherent control on the many-body level is achieved via
numerically optimized laser excitation pulses. We observe an excitation-number
staircase as a function of the system size and show directly the emergence of
incompressible ordered states on its steps. Our results demonstrate the
applicability of quantum optical control techniques in strongly interacting
systems, paving the way towards the investigation of novel quantum phases in
long-range interacting quantum systems, as well as for detailed studies of
their coherence and correlation properties.

ratio of $ t \to c h$ can only reach $3.0\times10^{-6}$, which is about one
order smaller than previous results obtained before the advent of the LHC.
Among the considered constraints, the Higgs mass and the LHC search for

In the singlet extension of the MSSM, since the squark sector is less
constrained by the Higgs mass, the branching ratio of $t \to c h$ can reach the
order of $10^{-5}$ in the allowed parameter space. (3) The chiral-conserving

discuss the theoretical grounds of that model and we are led to a chameleonic
equivalence postulate (CEP). Whenever a theory satisfies our CEP (and some
other additional conditions), a density-dependence of the mass of matter fields
is naturally present. Let us summarize the main results of this paper. 1) The
CEP can be considered the microscopic counterpart of the Einstein's Equivalence
Principle and, hence, a chameleonic description of quantum gravity is obtained:
in our model, (quantum) gravitation is equivalent to a conformal anomaly. 2) To
illustrate one of the possible applications of the CEP, we point out a
connection between chameleon fields and quantum-mechanical wave function
collapse. The collapse is induced by the chameleonic nature of the theory. We
discuss the collapse for a Stern-Gerlach experiment and for a diffraction
experiment with electrons. More research efforts are necessary to verify
whether these ideas are compatible with phenomenological constraints.
