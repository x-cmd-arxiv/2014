Hall plateaux series in the monolayer graphene, determined by the expression

one type of molecule available to be used as an information carrier. We
identify self-interference as the performance-limiting effect for the second

full-duplex and half-duplex. In particular, while our main focus is on
full-duplex relaying, half-duplex relaying is employed as a means to mitigate

the prior regularizer is a proper lower semicontinuous and convex function
which is also partly smooth relative to a Riemannian submanifold. This
encompasses as special cases several known penalties such as the Lasso
($\ell^1$-norm), the group Lasso ($\ell^1-\ell^2$-norm), the
$\ell^\infty$-norm, and the nuclear norm. This also includes so-called
analysis-type priors, i.e. composition of the previously mentioned penalties
with linear operators, typical examples being the total variation or fused
Lasso penalties.We study the sensitivity of any regularized minimizer to
perturbations of the observations and provide its precise local
parameterization.Our main sensitivity analysis result shows that the predictor
moves locally stably along the same active submanifold as the observations
undergo small perturbations. This local stability is a consequence of the
smoothness of the regularizer when restricted to the active submanifold, which
in turn plays a pivotal role to get a closed form expression for the variations
of the predictor w.r.t. observations. We also show that, for a variety of
regularizers, including polyhedral ones or the group Lasso and its analysis
counterpart, this divergence formula holds Lebesgue almost everywhere.When the
perturbation is random (with an appropriate continuous distribution), this
allows us to derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom and of the
risk of the estimator prediction.Our results hold true without requiring the
design matrix to be full column rank.They generalize those already known in the

$\ell^1$-penalty), or the group Lasso where existing results for the latter

Standard Model quark. We perform a detailed parton level analysis of the

finding that it is a very promising signature to test the region at high
$W^{'}$ mass, $m_{W^{'}}\gtrsim 2$ TeV, and of the $W^{'}\to Tb$ mode, that is
one of the best channels to test the intermediate $W^{'}$ mass region and that,
already with the LHC-8 data, could extend the present exclusion bounds.

microscopic mechanism of heterogeneous ice nucleation. In this work, we perform
hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of the heterogeneous nucleation of ice on a
range of generic surfaces, both flat and structured, in order to probe the
underlying factors affecting the nucleation process. The structured surfaces we
study comprise one basal plane bilayer of ice with varying lattice parameters
and interaction strengths. We show that what determines the propensity for
nucleation is not just the surface attraction, but also the orientational
ordering imposed on liquid water near a surface. In particular, varying the
ratio of the surface's attraction and orientational ordering can change the
mechanism by which nucleation occurs: ice can nucleate on the structured
surface even when the orientational ordering imposed by the surface is weak, as
the water molecules that interact strongly with the surface are themselves a
good template for further growth. We also show that lattice matching is
important for heterogeneous nucleation on the structured surface we study. We
rationalise these brute-force simulation results by explicitly calculating the
interfacial free energies of ice and liquid water in contact with the
nucleating surface and their variation with surface interaction parameters.

optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to
structures of constant treewidth. In this work we provide the first extension
of such results to the quantum setting. We show that given a quantum circuit
$C$ with $n$ uninitialized inputs, $\mathit{poly}(n)$ gates, and treewidth $t$,
one can compute in time $(\frac{n}{\delta})^{\exp(O(t))}$ a classical
assignment $y\in \{0,1\}^n$ that maximizes the acceptance probability of $C$ up
to a $\delta$ additive factor. In particular, our algorithm runs in polynomial
time if $t$ is constant and $1/poly(n) < \delta < 1$. For unrestricted values
of $t$, this problem is known to be complete for the complexity class
$\mathrm{QCMA}$, a quantum generalization of MA. In contrast, we show that the
same problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-complete if $t=O(\log n)$ even when $\delta$ is
constant.
  On the other hand, we show that given a $n$-input quantum circuit $C$ of
treewidth $t=O(\log n)$, and a constant $\delta<1/2$, it is
$\mathrm{QMA}$-complete to determine whether there exists a quantum state
$\mid\!\varphi\rangle \in (\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$ such that the acceptance
probability of $C\mid\!\varphi\rangle$ is greater than $1-\delta$, or whether
for every such state $\mid\!\varphi\rangle$, the acceptance probability of
$C\mid\!\varphi\rangle$ is less than $\delta$. As a consequence, under the
widely believed assumption that $\mathrm{QMA} \neq \mathrm{NP}$, we have that
quantum witnesses are strictly more powerful than classical witnesses with
respect to Merlin-Arthur protocols in which the verifier is a quantum circuit
of logarithmic treewidth.

conditions (GIBCs) for a strongly absorbing obstacle in the {\bf time} regime
in two and three dimensions. The GIBCs in the time domain are heuristically
derived from the corresponding conditions in the time harmonic regime. The
latters are frequency dependent except the one of order 0; hence the formers
are non-local in time in general. The error estimates in the time regime can be
derived from the ones in the time harmonic regime when the frequency dependence
is well-controlled. This idea is originally due to Nguyen and Vogelius in
\cite{NguyenVogelius2} for the cloaking context. In this paper, we present the
analysis to the GIBCs of orders 0 and 1. To implement the ideas in
\cite{NguyenVogelius2}, we revise and extend the work of Haddar, Joly, and
Nguyen in \cite{HJNg1}, where the GIBCs were investigated for a fixed frequency
in three dimensions. Even though we heavily follow the strategy in
\cite{NguyenVogelius2}, our analysis on the stability contains new ingredients
and ideas. First, instead of considering the difference between solutions of
the exact model and the approximate model, we consider the difference between
their derivatives in time. This simple idea helps us to avoid the machinery
used in \cite{NguyenVogelius2} concerning the integrability with respect to
frequency in the low frequency regime. Second, in the high frequency regime,
the Morawetz multiplier technique used in \cite{NguyenVogelius2} does not fit
directly in our setting. Our proof makes use of a result by H\""ormander in
\cite{Hor}. Another important part of the analysis in this paper is the
well-posedness in the time domain for the approximate problems imposed with
GIBCs on the boundary of the obstacle, which are non-local in time.

announcement of the first recognised physical instantiation of the memristor

boundary, $w$, between two types of inter-converting material,
$R_{\mathrm{off}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{on}}$, seemingly under a uniform field
across the entire device. In fact, what was intended was a field with a
discontinuity at $w$, that was uniform between $0<x<w$. In this paper we show
that the discontinuity is required for the Strukov model derivation to be
completed, and thus the derivation as given does not describe a situation with
a uniform field across the entire device. The discontinuity can be described as
a Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common
single-valued approximations for $H(w)$. The Strukov model as intended includes
an approximation for the Heaviside function (the field is taken to be the same
as that across the $R_{\mathrm{on}}$ part of the device). We compare
approximations and give solutions. We then extend the description of the field
to a more-realistic continuously varying sigmoidal transition between two
uniform fields and demonstrate that the centro-symmetric approximation model
(taking the field as being the average of the fields across $R_{\mathrm{on}}$
and $R_{\mathrm{off}}$) is a better single-point model of that situation: the
other two approximations over or underestimate the field.

controllably cycles an atom between a dark state and a fluorescing state while
eliminating heating and loss. Through spatially resolved sideband spectroscopy
following the imaging sequence, we demonstrate the efficacy of this imaging
technique in various regimes of lattice depth and fluorescence acquisition
rate. Our work provides an important extension of quantum gas imaging to the
nondestructive detection, control and manipulation of atoms in optical
lattices. In addition, our technique can also be extended to atomic species
that are less amenable to molasses-based lattice imaging.

revival in the study of metabolic networks, which increased the demand for
efficient vertex enumeration algorithms for high-dimensional polyhedra given by
inequalities. It is a famous and long standing open question in polyhedral
theory and computational geometry whether the vertices of a polytope (bounded
polyhedron), described by a set of linear constraints, can be enumerated in
total polynomial time. In this paper we apply the concept of
branch-decomposition to the vertex enumeration problem of polyhedra $P = \{x :
Ax = b, x \geq 0\}$. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of $k$-module
and show how it relates to the separators of the linear matroid generated by
the columns of $A$. We then use this to present a total polynomial time
algorithm for polytopes $P$ for which the branch-width of the linear matroid
generated by $A$ is bounded by a constant $k$.

method by maximizing the margin of image sets. The margin of an image set is
defined as the difference of the distance to its nearest image set from
different classes and the distance to its nearest image set of the same class.
By modeling the image sets by using both their image samples and their affine
hull models, and maximizing the margins of the images sets, the image set
representation parameter learning problem is formulated as an minimization
problem, which is further optimized by an expectation -maximization (EM)
strategy with accelerated proximal gradient (APG) optimization in an iterative

contentious matter of debate. In particular, no clear observational proof
exists of a general influence by magnetic fields during the initial collapse of

influence on a wide range of spatial scales in low-mass star-forming regions.
Method: We trace the large-scale magnetic field structure on scales of
10^3-10^5 AU in the local environment of Bok globules through optical and
near-infrared polarimetry and combine these measurements with existing
submillimeter measurements, thereby characterizing the small-scale magnetic
field structure on scales of 10^2-10^3 AU. Results: For the first time, we
present polarimetric observations in the optical and near-infrared of the three
Bok globules B335, CB68, and CB54, combined with archival observations in the
submillimeter and the optical. We find a significant polarization signal
(P>=2%, P/sigma(P)>3) in the optical and near-infrared for all three globules.
Additionally, we detect a connection between the structure on scales of
10^2-10^3 AU to 10^3-10^4 AU for both B335 and CB68. Furthermore, for CB54, we
trace ordered polarization vectors on scales of ~10^5 AU. We determine a
magnetic field orientation that is aligned with the CO outflow in the case of
CB54, but nearly perpendicular to the CO outflow for CB68. For B335 we find a
change in the magnetic field oriented toward the outflow direction, from the
inner core to the outer regions. Conclusion: We find strongly aligned
polarization vectors that indicate dominant magnetic fields on a wide range of
spatial scales.

multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless
radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to
codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword
represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same
time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the
near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm
(MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword
overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension
of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding
levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation
mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve
link-adaptation as a result of less colored interference. In this paper a
technique is developed to enable multi-user SCMA (MU-SCMA) for downlink
wireless access. User pairing, power sharing, rate adjustment, and scheduling
algorithms are designed to improve the downlink throughput of a heavily loaded
network. The advantage of SCMA spreading for lightly loaded networks is also
evaluated.

large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to
discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same
time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR) - the expected
fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries - is not too high, in order
to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and
replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection
procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there
are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR
control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the
number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression
coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the
name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are
cheap - their construction does not require any new data - and are designed to
mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way
that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with
permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and
flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the
method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and
obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power
than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.

Operated at the fundamental limit where a single quantum of light or matter

applications such as long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum
information processing and metrology, and the exploration of novel quantum
states of matter. Here, by strongly coupling a photon to a single atom trapped
in the near field of a nanoscale photonic crystal cavity, we realize a system
where a single atom switches the phase of a photon, and a single photon
modifies the atom's phase. We experimentally demonstrate an atom-induced
optical phase shift that is nonlinear at the two-photon level, a photon number
router that separates individual photons and photon pairs into different output

circumbinary planets are preferentially coplanar with their host binaries, as
has been suggested, then the rate of occurrence of planets with $R_p>6R_\oplus$

that formation and subsequent dynamical evolution in circumbinary disks must
either lead to largely coplanar planets, or proceed with significantly greater
ease than in circumstellar disks. As a result of this investigation we also
show that giant planets (${>}10R_\oplus$) are significantly less common in

We find ~1,500 voids out to redshift $0.6$ using a heavily modified and
extended version of the watershed algorithm ZOBOV, which we call VIDE (Void
IDentification and Examination). To assess the impact of peculiar velocities we
use the mock void catalogs presented in Sutter et al. (2013). We find a
constant uniform flattening of 14% along the line of sight when peculiar

at all redshifts and for all tracer densities. We also use these mocks to
identify an optimal stacking strategy. After correcting for systematic effects
we find that our Alcock-Paczynski measurement leads to a preference of our
best-fit value of $\Omega_{\rm M}\sim 0.15$ over $\Omega_{\rm M} = 1.0$ by a

absorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the first

displays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from the
inner accretion disk. Through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that the
strength of the relativistic iron line and the Compton reflection hump relative
to the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are two
aspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. We apply self-consistent
disk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain the
inner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption to
account for the vastly different absorption states observed. Each of the four
observations is treated independently to test the consistency of the results
obtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should not
vary on observable timescales. We find both the spin and the inclination

to have gapped as well as gapless regions around the Fermi surface. As a
result, the system remains compressible in the density-wave phase, and it

circumstellar emission on a spatial scale of 9 AU. The continuum emission
traces a dusty annulus of 45 AU in radius that is consistent with the dust
morphology observed at shorter wavelengths. The VLA observations also reveal a

at the position of the candidate protoplanet LkCa 15 b. By comparing the

lighter than all the scalars. We therefore focus on the gluino phenomenology in

condensations of cold gas in the hot atmospheres of galaxies and galaxy

presence of radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction. For both
axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric linear perturbations we provide the general
equations that can be applied locally to specific systems to establish whether

cluster cool cores, while it is possible under certain conditions in rotating
galactic coronae. If the magnetic field is sufficiently weak the

previous research has been motivated by the understanding that, through
cooperation, multi-agent systems can achieve tasks that are unachievable by
single-agent systems, there are no formal characterizations of situations where
cooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of
multi-agent systems. In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from
the planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required
cooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that
require cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems
with heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the
conditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none
of these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.
Furthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum
number of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study
not only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many
applications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve
a task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be
informed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a
solution.

the pulsation phases at those frequencies in 10-d segments. This produces a
series of time-delay measurements in which binarity is apparent as a periodic
modulation whose amplitude gives the projected light travel time across the
orbit. Fourier analysis of this time-delay curve provides the parameters of the
orbit, including the period, eccentricity, angle of ascending node and time of

radial-velocity curve directly from the Kepler photometry, without the need for

distribution functions of observables from statistical systems, by maximizing
entropy under constraints. The MEP has found hundreds of applications in
ergodic and Markovian systems in statistical mechanics, information theory, and
statistics. For several decades there exists an ongoing controversy whether the
notion of the maximum entropy principle can be extended in a meaningful way to
non-extensive, non-ergodic, and complex statistical systems and processes. In
this paper we start by reviewing how Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy is related
to multiplicities of independent random processes. We then show how the
relaxation of independence naturally leads to the most general entropies that
are compatible with the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms, the
(c,d)-entropies. We demonstrate that the MEP is a perfectly consistent concept
for non-ergodic and complex statistical systems if their relative entropy can
be factored into a generalized multiplicity and a constraint term. The problem
of finding such a factorization reduces to finding an appropriate
representation of relative entropy in a linear basis. In a particular example
we show that path-dependent random processes with memory naturally require
specific generalized entropies. The example is the first exact derivation of a
generalized entropy from the microscopic properties of a path-dependent random
process.

circumbinary ring at a radius of 235 AU with a FWHM width of ~60 AU. We find no
clear evidence for a radial gradient in the spectral shape of the ring,
suggesting that the particle size distribution is spatially homogeneous on
angular scales of ~0.1"". A central point source, likely associated with the
primary component (GG Tau Aa), exhibits a composite spectrum from dust and
free-free emission. Faint emission at 7.3 mm is observed toward the low-mass
star GG Tau Ba, although its origin remains uncertain. Using these measurements
of the resolved, multifrequency emission structure of the GG Tau A system,
models of the far-infrared to radio spectrum are developed to place constraints
on the grain size distribution and dust mass in the circumbinary ring. The
non-negligible curvature present in the ring spectrum implies a maximum
particle size of 1-10 mm, although we are unable to place strong constraints on
the distribution shape. The corresponding dust mass is 30-300 M_earth, at a

estimation by sparse optimization (SpESO) method uses prior information about
isotropic homogeneous turbulent flows with power law energy spectra and applies
the methods of CS to 1-D and 2-D turbulence signals to estimate their energy
spectra with small logarithmic errors. SpESO is distinct from existing energy
spectrum estimation methods which are based on sparse support of the signal in
Fourier space. SpESO approximates energy spectra with an order of magnitude
fewer samples than needed with Shannon sampling. Our results demonstrate that
SpESO performs much better than lumped orthogonal matching pursuit (LOMP), and
as well or better than wavelet-based best M-term or M/2-term methods, even

exoplanet research. While planets that are Earth-sized and smaller have been
detected, these planets reside in orbits that are too close to their host star
to allow liquid water on their surface. We present the detection of
Kepler-186f, a 1.11+\-0.14 Earth radius planet that is the outermost of five
planets - all roughly Earth-sized - that transit a 0.47+\-0.05 Rsun star. The
intensity and spectrum of the star's radiation places Kepler-186f in the
stellar habitable zone, implying that if Kepler-186f has an Earth-like
atmosphere and H2O at its surface, then some of this H2O is likely to be in
liquid form.

  Rationality","7 pages, 4 figures. Proceedings of AAAI-14",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there has been a growing interest in modeling planning with
information constraints. Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expected
utility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by the
information divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approach
can be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics and
information theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decision-making
against adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggested
in work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensive
form games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization is
equivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary. The
adversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminish
the decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of the
adversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision maker
indifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nash
equilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimization
and game theory.

referred to as randomized pivots. We show that these randomized pivots yield
central limit theorems with a significantly smaller magnitude of error as

This constitutes a desirable result when a relatively small number of data is

pivots to make inference about the mean based on significantly smaller
sub-samples. The approach taken is shown to relate naturally to estimating
distributions of both small and big data sets.

quarks moving in opposite directions involving momentum transfer much smaller
than the center-of-mass energy is described by the Glauber interaction operator
which has two-dimensional Coulomb-like behavior. Here, we determine this
$n$-$\bar{n}$ collinear Glauber interaction operator and consider its
renormalization properties at one loop. At this order a rapidity divergence
appears which gives rise to an infrared divergent (IR) rapidity anomalous
dimension commonly called the gluon Regge trajectory. We then go on to consider
the forward quark scattering cross section in SCET. The emission of real soft
gluons from the Glauber interaction gives rise to the Lipatov vertex. Squaring
and adding the real and virtual amplitudes results in a cancelation of IR
divergences, however the rapidity divergence remains. We introduce a rapidity
counterterm to cancel the rapidity divergence, and derive a rapidity
renormalization group equation which is the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov
Equation. This connects Glauber interactions with the emergence of Regge
behavior in SCET.

correlation between the far-infrared luminosity and 1.4-GHz luminosity for
radio-loud quasars. Partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsic
correlation after removing the redshift contribution while for radio-quiet
quasars no partial correlation is found. Using a single-temperature grey-body
model we find a general trend of lower dust temperatures in the case of
radio-loud quasars comparing to radio-quiet quasars. Also, radio-loud quasars
are found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift and
optical luminosity bins. In addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at lower
optical luminosities tend to have on average higher FIR and 250-micron
luminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same optical
luminosites. Even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe the
FIR data, the FIR luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.
These results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with star
formation especially at lower accretion rates.

workhorse technique in cold-atom physics is the magneto-optical trap (MOT),
which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from radiation pressure.
For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture and cool large numbers of
particles to ultracold temperatures (<1 mK); this has enabled the study of a
wide range of phenomena from optical clocks to ultracold collisions whilst also
serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the regime of
quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules could provide a
similarly powerful starting point for the study and manipulation of ultracold
molecular gases. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional magneto-optical
trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature
of approximately 2.5 mK. This method is expected to be viable for a significant
number of diatomic species. Such chemical diversity is desired for the wide
array of existing and proposed experiments which employ molecules for
applications ranging from precision measurement, to quantum simulation and
quantum information, to ultracold chemistry.

(SMBHB) mergers are predicted to emit prodigious amounts of gravitational waves

is permanent and non-oscillatory. For SMBHB mergers, the memory is created
primarily during the most violent moments of the inspiral immediately preceding
the final plunge and ring-down when the strongest gravitational fields are at
work and the non-linearities of general relativity are most pronounced. The
essentially time-domain nature of memory makes it forbiddingly difficult to
detect with ground based GW detectors, leaving pulsar timing array (PTA)
experiments as the most promising means by which it may be detected and
studied. In this paper, we discuss how GW bursts with memory (BWMs) influence
pulsar timing experiments and develop methods to assess how sensitive modern
timing efforts are to such GW events. We discuss how PTA searches for BWMs can
be used to constrain the rate of BWMs and how these constraints relate to

  Multidimensional Range Index","12 pages, VLDB 2014",,,,"cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Smart Grid applications, as the number of deployed electric smart meters
increases, massive amounts of valuable meter data is generated and collected
every day. To enable reliable data collection and make business decisions fast,
high throughput storage and high-performance analysis of massive meter data
become crucial for grid companies. Considering the advantage of high
efficiency, fault tolerance, and price-performance of Hadoop and Hive systems,
they are frequently deployed as underlying platform for big data processing.
However, in real business use cases, these data analysis applications typically
involve multidimensional range queries (MDRQ) as well as batch reading and
statistics on the meter data. While Hive is high-performance at complex data
batch reading and analysis, it lacks efficient indexing techniques for MDRQ.
  In this paper, we propose DGFIndex, an index structure for Hive that
efficiently supports MDRQ for massive meter data. DGFIndex divides the data
space into cubes using the grid file technique. Unlike the existing indexes in
Hive, which stores all combinations of multiple dimensions, DGFIndex only
stores the information of cubes. This leads to smaller index size and faster
query processing. Furthermore, with pre-computing user-defined aggregations of
each cube, DGFIndex only needs to access the boundary region for aggregation
query. Our comprehensive experiments show that DGFIndex can save significant
disk space in comparison with the existing indexes in Hive and the query
performance with DGFIndex is 2-50 times faster than existing indexes in Hive
and HadoopDB for aggregation query, 2-5 times faster than both for
non-aggregation query, 2-75 times faster than scanning the whole table in
different query selectivity.

Fundamental elements of the basis known as ""atoms"" allow us to define ""atomic
norms"" that can be used to formulate convex regularizations for the
reconstruction problem. Efficient algorithms are available to solve these
formulations in certain special cases, but an approach that works well for
general atomic norms, both in terms of speed and reconstruction accuracy,
remains to be found. This paper describes an optimization algorithm called
CoGEnT that produces solutions with succinct atomic representations for
reconstruction problems, generally formulated with atomic-norm constraints.
CoGEnT combines a greedy selection scheme based on the conditional gradient
approach with a backward (or ""truncation"") step that exploits the quadratic
nature of the objective to reduce the basis size. We establish convergence
properties and validate the algorithm via extensive numerical experiments on a
suite of signal processing applications. Our algorithm and analysis also allow
for inexact forward steps and for occasional enhancements of the current
representation to be performed. CoGEnT can outperform the basic conditional
gradient method, and indeed many methods that are tailored to specific
applications, when the enhancement and truncation steps are defined
appropriately. We also introduce several novel applications that are enabled by
the atomic-norm framework, including tensor completion, moment problems in

the FRII radio galaxy PKS B1358-113, hosted in the brightest cluster galaxy of
Abell 1836. The galaxy harbors one of the most massive black holes known to
date and our analysis of the optical data reveals that this black hole is only
weakly active. Based on new Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations and
archival radio data we derive the preferred range for the jet kinetic
luminosity $\sim (0.5-3) \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This is above the values
implied by various scaling relations proposed for radio sources in galaxy
clusters, being instead very close to the maximum jet power allowed for the
given accretion rate. We constrain the radio source lifetime as $\sim 40-70$
Myrs, and the total amount of deposited jet energy $\sim (2-8) \times
10^{60}$\,ergs. The detailed analysis of the X-ray data provides indication for
the presence of a bow-shock driven by the expanding radio lobes into the Abell
1836 cluster environment, with the corresponding Mach number $\sim 2-4$. This,
together with the recently growing evidence that powerful FRII radio galaxies
may not be uncommon in the centers of clusters at higher redshifts, supports
the idea that jet-induced shock heating may indeed play an important role in
shaping the properties of clusters, galaxy groups, and galaxies in formation.
We speculate on a possible bias against detecting jet-driven shocks in poorer
environments, resulting from an inefficient electron heating at the shock
front, combined with a relatively long electron-ion equilibration timescale.

Here, we introduce an extension of the Axelrod (1997} model of cultural
differentiation in which traits have prerequisite relationships, and where
social learning is dependent upon the ordering of those prerequisites. We
examine the resulting structure of cultural repertoires as learning
environments range from largely unstructured imitation, to structured teaching
of necessary prerequisites, and we find that in combination with individual
learning and innovation, high probabilities of teaching prerequisites leads to
richer cultural repertoires. Our results point to ways in which we can build
more comprehensive explanations of the archaeological record of the Paleolithic

astronomical observations including the first data release from Planck. We
consider a model with one dimensionless parameter, $\alpha$, describing the
interaction between dark matter and vacuum energy (with fixed equation of state
$w=-1$). The background dynamics correspond to a generalised Chaplygin gas
cosmology, but the perturbations have a zero sound speed. The tension between
the value of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, determined by Planck data plus WMAP
polarisation (Planck+WP) and that determined by the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) can be alleviated by energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum
($\alpha>0$). A positive $\alpha$ increases the allowed values of $H_0$ due to
parameter degeneracy within the model using only CMB data. Combining with
additional datasets of including supernova type Ia (SN Ia) and baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO), we can significantly tighten the bounds on $\alpha$.
Redshift-space distortions (RSD), which constrain the linear growth of
structure, provide the tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined
with Planck+WP, and prefer energy transfer from vacuum to dark matter
($\alpha<0$) which suppresses the growth of structure. Using the combined
datasets of Planck+WP+Union2.1+BAO+RSD, we obtain the constraint on $\alpha$ to
be $-0.083<\alpha<-0.006$ (95% C.L.), allowing low $H_0$ consistent with the
measurement from 6dF Galaxy survey. This interacting vacuum model can alleviate
the tension between RSD and Planck+WP in the $\Lambda$CDM model for $\alpha<0$,
or between HST measurements of $H_0$ and Planck+WP for $\alpha>0$, but not both
at the same time.

  We find that software developers prefer to persist in same kinds of

activities and so forth, rather than switch them frequently; this tendency
strengthens with time, suggesting that developers become more efficient, and
can work longer with fewer interruptions. This process is accompanied by the
formation of community culture: developers' patterns in the same communities
get closer with time while different communities get relatively more different.
The emergence of community culture is apparently driven by both ""talk"" and

ratio (S/N) of the molecular absorption of the exoplanetary atmosphere: it
works as a spectroscopic coronagraph. Assuming a 30 m telescope, we demonstrate
the benefit of these high-contrast instruments for nearby close-in planets that
mimic 55 Cnc b ($0.6 \lambda/D$ of the angular separation in the K band). We
find that the tip-tilt error is the most crucial factor; however, low-order
speckles also contribute to the noise. Assuming relatively conservative
estimates for future wavefront control techniques, the spectroscopic
coronagraph can increase the contrast to $ \sim 50-130 $ times and enable us to
obtain $\sim 3-6 $ times larger S/N for warm Jupiters and Neptunes at 10 pc
those without it. If the tip-tilt error can be reduced to $\lesssim 0.3$ mas
(rms), it gains $\sim 10-30$ times larger S/N and enables us to detect warm
super-Earths with an extremely large telescope. This paper demonstrates the
concept of spectroscopic coronagraphy for future spectroscopic direct
detection. Further studies of the selection of coronagraphs and tip-tilt

remarkably uniform at both far northern and far southern Galactic latitudes,
and it increases toward lower Galactic latitudes at all Galactic longitudes. We
examine speculation that it might be due to interaction of the dark matter with
the nuclei of the interstellar medium but we are unable to point to a plausible
mechanism for an effective interaction. We also explore the possibility that we
are seeing radiation from bright FUV-emitting stars scattering from a ""second
population"" of interstellar grains---grains that are small compared with FUV
wavelengths. Such grains are known to exist (Draine 2011) and they scatter with
very high albedo, with an isotropic scattering pattern. However, comparison

location and the observed FUV emission. Our modeling of the FUV scattering by
small grains also shows that there must be remarkably few such ""smaller"" grains

there is very little interstellar dust of any kind at the Galactic poles, in
agreement with Perry & Johnston (1982). We also review our limited knowledge of

transverse susceptibility does not decrease below the transition temperature

redshift $z=6.3$, in combination with hydrogen column densities and
metallicities. This data set enables us to investigate the relation between
dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity out to high redshift for a wide metallicity
range. By applying our evolution models of dust content in galaxies, we find
that the dust-to-gas ratio derived from GRB afterglow extinction data are
excessively high such that they can be explained with a fraction of gas-phase
metals condensed into dust ($f_\mathrm{in}$) $\sim 1$, while theoretical
calculations on dust formation in the wind of asymptotic giant branch stars and
in the ejecta of Type II supernovae suggest a much more moderate condensation
efficiency ($f_\mathrm{in}\sim 0.1$). Efficient dust growth in dense clouds has
difficulty in explaining the excessive dust-to-gas ratio at metallicities
$Z/\mathrm{Z}_\odot <\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the star formation
efficiency of the dense clouds. However, if $\epsilon$ is as small as 0.01, the
dust-to-gas ratio at $Z\sim 10^{-2}$ Z$_\odot$ can be explained with
$n_\mathrm{H}\gtrsim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. Therefore, a dense environment hosting
dust growth is required to explain the large fraction of metals condensed into
dust, but such clouds should have low star formation efficiencies to avoid
rapid metal enrichment by stars.

babies were identified from various spectral measures of arterial baroreflex
and cerebral autoregulation functions. It was also observed that the
cross-spectral transfer function analysis of cerebral NIRS and arterial blood
pressure was able to provide a number of parameters that were potentially
useful for distinguishing between preterm infants with or without IVH.
Furthermore, the detrended fluctuation analysis that quantifies the fractal
correlation properties of physiological signals has been examined, to determine
whether it could derive markers for the identification of preterm infants with
IVH. Cardiac output(CO) and total peripheral resistance(TPR) are two important
parameters of the cardiovascular system. Measurement of these two parameters
can provide valuable information for the assessment and management of patients
needing intensive care, including preterm infants in the neonatal intensive
care unit. To further assess the changes in CO and TPR in the preterm infants,
the multivariate regression model based on the useful features from ABP method
was used to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. The
combination of signal analysis and multivariate regression model in estimation
of CO has produced some outcomes, and in the future, more effort should be
involved in this kind of research to improve the prediction of serious diseases

The role of the $K$-linear terms appearing in the exciton Hamiltonian under the

the nanostructure. It is predicted that the spectral oscillations caused by
interference of the exciton-like and photon-like polariton modes disappear with
the increase of applied pressure and then appear again with opposite phase

of masses of excitons with heavy and light holes due to their mixing by the

the temporal resolution of the technique. By using an optimal filtering method

halos is strongly associated with the strength of ultraviolet (UV) flux
produced by the stellar populations in the first galaxies. Depending on the
stellar spectrum, these UV photons can either dissociate $\rm H_{2}$ molecules
directly or indirectly by photo-detachment of $\rm H^{-}$ as the latter
provides the main pathway for $\rm H_{2}$ formation in the early universe. In
this study, we aim to determine the critical strength of the UV flux above
which the formation of molecular hydrogen remains suppressed for a sample of
five distinct halos at $z>10$ by employing a higher order chemical solver and a
Jeans resolution of 32 cells. We presume that such flux is emitted by PopII
stars implying atmospheric temperatures of $\rm 10^{4}$~K. We performed
three-dimensional cosmological simulations and varied the strength of the UV
flux below the Lyman limit in units of $\rm J_{21}$. Our findings show that the
value of $\rm J_{21}^{crit}$ varies from halo to halo and is sensitive to the
local thermal conditions of the gas. For the simulated halos it varies from
400-700 with the exception of one halo where $\rm J_{21}^{crit} \geq 1500$.
This has important implications for the formation of direct collapse black
holes and their estimated population at z > 6. It reduces the number density of
direct collapse black holes by almost three orders of magnitude compared to the
previous estimates.

systems close to criticality are thought to maximise their dynamic range of
information processing and communication. To date, there have been two key
experimental observations supporting this hypothesis: i) neuronal avalanches
with power law distribution of size and ii) long-range temporal correlations
(LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these
maximise dynamic range of information processing and communication is still
being made and because a significant substrate for information coding and
transmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronisation
measures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterising
criticality in synchronisation based on a new metric of phase synchronisation
(rate of change of phase difference) and a set of methods we have developed for
detecting LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of
criticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these
models aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these
simulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of
LRTCs in phase synchronisation. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing
pairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of
corticomuscular phase synchronisation can be detected in the resting state. The
existence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronisation suggests that these
fluctuations are governed by non-local behaviour. This has important
implications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see
LRTCs in phase synchronisation. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit
LRTCs reflecting a state of readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts
towards and away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.

on these estimates by relaxing this assumption and instead determining the

by re-analyzing RESIK data for a GOES class M1.0 flare on 2002 November~14
(SOL2002-11-14T22:26) for which there was good data coverage. The analysis
method uses a maximum-likelihood (Withbroe--Sylwester) routine for evaluating
the DEM. In a first step, called here AbuOpt, an optimized set of abundances of
Si, S, Ar, and K is found that is consistent with the observed spectra. With
these abundances, the differential emission measure evolution during the flare
is found. The abundance optimization leads to revised abundances of silicon and
sulfur in the flare plasma: $A({\rm S}) = 6.94 \pm 0.06$ and $A({\rm Si}) =
7.56 \pm 0.08$ (on a logarithmic scale with $A({\rm H}) = 12$). Previously

imposing spatial cut-off radii on sparse matrices, and the propagation of the
density matrix in this manner provides direct access to the optical response of
very large systems, which would be otherwise impractical to obtain using the
standard formulations of TDDFT. Following a brief summary of our
implementation, along with several benchmark tests illustrating the validity of
the method, we present an exploration of the factors affecting the accuracy of
the approach. In particular we investigate the effect of basis set size and
matrix truncation, the key approximation used in achieving linear scaling, on
the propagator unitarity and optical spectra. Finally we illustrate that, with
an appropriate density matrix truncation range applied, the computational load
scales linearly with the system size and discuss the limitations of the
approach.

one of the valence quarks carries most of the hadron momentum. Hadron form
factors and fixed angle scattering are related directly to the quark wave
function, which can be directly extracted from experimental data. A universal
linear endpoint behavior explains the proton electromagnetic form factor,
proton-proton fixed angle scattering, and the t-dependence of proton-proton
scattering at large s>>t. Endpoint constituent counting rules relate the number
of quarks in a hadron to the power-law behavior. All proton reactions surveyed
are consistent with three quarks participating. The model is applicable at
laboratory energies and does not need assumptions of asymptotically-high energy

core-collapse supernovae is often limited by uncertainties pertaining to
various model assumptions. It is shown that under conditions when the
temperature of the circumstellar medium is set by heating due to free-free
absorption, observations of the accompanying free-free optical depth allow a
direct determination of the mass-loss rate from observed quantities in a rather
model independent way. The temperature is determined self-consistently, which
results in a characteristic time dependence of the free-free optical depth.
This can be used to distinguish free-free heating from other heating
mechanisms. Since the importance of free-free heating is quite model dependent,
this also makes possible several consistency checks of the deduced mass-loss
rate. It is argued that the free-free absorption observed in SN 1993J is
consistent with heating from free-free absorption. The deduced mass-loss rate
of the progenitor star is, approximately, 10^(-5) solar masses per year for a

the first uniform census of GCs across the M31 halo - we find clusters to the

Tests using artificial clusters reveal that detection incompleteness cuts in at

splitting with those derived from continuum source rotation measures have
prompted new analysis of the propagation of the Zeeman split components, and
the inferred field orientation. In order to do this, we first review differing
electric field polarization conventions used in past studies. With these
clearly and consistently defined, we then show that for a given Zeeman
splitting spectrum, the magnetic field direction is fully determined and
predictable on theoretical grounds: when a magnetic field is oriented away from
the observer, the left-hand circular polarization is observed at higher
frequency and the right-hand polarization at lower frequency. This is
consistent with classical Lorentzian derivations. The consequent interpretation
of recent measurements then raises the possibility of a reversal between the
large-scale field (traced by rotation measures) and the small-scale field
(traced by maser Zeeman splitting).

planet's magnetic field are presented. The goal is to explore magnetic effects
on the layer of the atmosphere that is ionized and heated by stellar EUV
radiation, and the imprint of these effects on the Ly$\alpha$ transmission
spectrum. The simulations are axisymmetric, isothermal, and include both
rotation and azimuth-averaged stellar tides. Mass density is converted to
atomic hydrogen density through the assumption of ionization equilibrium. The
three-zone structure -- polar dead zone, mid-latitude wind zone, and equatorial
dead zone -- found in previous analytic calculations is confirmed. For a
magnetic field comparable to that of Jupiter, the equatorial dead zone, which
is confined by the magnetic field and corotates with the planet, contributes at
least half of the transit signal. For even stronger fields, the gas escaping in
the mid-latitude wind zone is found to have a smaller contribution to the
transit depth than the equatorial dead zone. Transmission spectra computed from
the simulations are compared to HST STIS and ACS data for HD 209458b and HD
189733b, and the range of model parameters consistent with the data is found.
The central result of this paper is that the transit depth increases strongly
with magnetic field strength when the hydrogen ionization layer is magnetically
dominated, for dipole magnetic field $B_0 > 10\ {\rm G}$. Hence transit depth
is sensitive to magnetic field strength, in addition to standard quantities
such as the ratio of thermal to gravitational binding energies.

type of upper bound on the severity of the actual tuning in the UV completion;
the actual tuning can be less severe than the naive tuning or even

Different particles stochastically associate and dissociate with microscopic

on-the-fly. Because we focus on reversible assembly, we introduce a scheme
which ensures detailed balance for patchy particles. We then show how the
macroscopic rates follow from the microscopic ones. As an instructive example,
we study the assembly of a pentameric ring structure, for which we find
excellent agreement between simulation results and a macroscopic kinetic
description without any adjustable parameters. This demonstrates that our
approach correctly accounts for both the diffusive and reactive processes

  Fields. Technical Report",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel feedback method on the motion planning for
unicycle robots in environments with static obstacles, along with an extension
to the distributed planning and coordination in multi-robot systems. The method
employs a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, whose integral curves
exhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter lambda. More
specifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector field has a
unique singular point of dipole type and can be used to steer the unicycle to a
goal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector
field has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves are used to
define flows around obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan can then
be constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a
static obstacle environment. The method does not suffer from the appearance of
sinks (stable nodes) away from goal point. Compared to other similar methods
which are free of local minima, the proposed approach does not require any
parameter tuning to render the desired convergence properties. The paper also
addresses the extension of the method to the distributed coordination and
control of multiple robots, where each robot needs to navigate to a goal
configuration while avoiding collisions with the remaining robots, and while
using local information only. More specifically, based on the results which
apply to the single-robot case, a motion coordination protocol is presented
which guarantees the safety of the multi-robot system and the almost global
convergence of the robots to their goal configurations. The efficacy of the
proposed methodology is demonstrated via simulation results in static and
dynamic environments.

climate trends and body size change of organisms. In many cases, climate might
be expected to influence body size by altering thermoregulation, energetics or
food availability. However, observed body size changes can result from
ecological processes (e.g., growth, selection, population dynamics), yet may
also be due to imperfect observation. We used two extensive datasets to
evaluate alternative hypotheses for recently reported changes in the observed
body size of plethodontid salamanders. We found that mean adult body size of
salamanders can be highly sensitive to survey conditions, particularly
rainfall, such that smaller individuals are more likely to be sampled under dry
conditions. This systematic bias in the detection of individuals across a range
in body size would result in a signature of body size reduction in relation to
reported climate trends when it is simply observation error. We also identify
considerable variability in body size distributions among years that shows
correspondence with rainfall. This suggests that annual variation in growth or
shifting population age structure could also result in a correlation between
climate and mean body size. Finally, our study demonstrates that measures of
mean adult body size can be highly variable among surveys and that large sample
sizes may be required to make reliable inferences. Identifying the effects of
climate change is critical for future research in ecology and conservation.
Researchers should be aware that observed body size changes in some organisms
may be a result of true ecological processes or systematic bias due to
non-random sampling of populations. Ultimately, the credibility of ecological
research related to climate change depends on researchers demonstrating a
thorough consideration of alternative hypotheses for observed changes in
species.

inert Higgs doublet and an additional scalar singlet is added to the Standard

imposing a $Z_2$ symmetry on this additional inert doublet. The additional
singlet scalar has a vacuum expectation value (VEV) and mixes with the Standard
Model Higgs doublet resulting in two CP even scalars $h_1$ and $h_2$. We treat
one of these scalars, $h_1$, to be consistent with the SM Higgs like boson of
mass around 125 GeV reported by the LHC experiment. These two CP even scalars
affect the annihilation cross-section of this inert doublet dark matter
resulting in a larger dark matter mass region that satisfies the observed relic
density. We also investigate the $h_1 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $h_1
\rightarrow \gamma Z$ processes and compared these with LHC results. This is
also used to constrain the dark matter parameter space in the present model. We
find that the dark matter candidate in the mass region $\frac {m_1} {2} < m_H <

possibilities and limitations of thermal model techniques. In total, we used 25
published ground-based mid-infrared photometric observations and 5 so far
unpublished measurements from the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite
AKARI in combination with improved H-G values. Our thermophysical model (TPM)
approach allowed us to determine correctly the sense of rotation, to estimate
the thermal inertia and to derive robust effective size and albedo values by
only using a simple spherical shape model. A more complex shape model, derived
from light-curve inversion techniques, improved the quality of the predictions
considerably and made the interpretation of thermal light-curve possible. The
radiometrically derived effective diameter value agrees within 2% of the true
Itokawa size value. The combination of our TPM and the final Itokawa in-situ
shape model was then used as a benchmark for deriving and testing radiometric
solutions. The consolidated value for the surface-averaged thermal inertia is
700 $\pm$ 200 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$. We found that even the high
resolution shape models still require additional small-scale roughness in order
to explain the disk-integrated infrared measurements. Our description of the
thermal effects as a function of wavelengths, phase angle, and rotational phase
facilitates the planning of crucial thermal observations for sophisticated
characterization of small bodies, including other potentially hazardous
asteroids. Our analysis shows the power of radiometric techniques to derive the
size, albedo, thermal inertia, and also spin-axis orientation from small sets

thickness removed is reproducible and reasonably uniform. Together, these tests
demonstrate the effectiveness of removal of radon daughters for a proposed

using the spin and shape model recently derived from applying a 2-period
Fourier series method to a large sample of well-calibrated photometric
observations. We find that the tumbling asteroid Apophis has an elongated shape
with a mean diameter of 375$^{+14}_{-10}$ m (of an equal volume sphere) and a
geometric V-band albedo of 0.30$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. We find a thermal inertia in
the range 250-800 Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$ (best solution at 600
Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$K$^{-1}$), which can be explained by a mixture of low
conductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermal
inertia on the surface. The thermal inertia, and other similarities with
(25143) Itokawa indicate that Apophis might also have a rubble-pile structure.
If we combine the new size value with the assumption of an Itokawa-like density
and porosity we estimate a mass between 4.4 and 6.2 10$^{10}$ kg which is more
than 2-3 times larger than previous estimates. We expect that the newly derived

Its

although these studies did not yield any firm detection. In contrast to hot
cores, low-mass star forming regions, and in particular their earliest stages
represented by cold pre-stellar cores, may be better suited for the detection
of glycine as well as more relevant for the study of pre-biotic chemistry in
young Solar System analogs. We present 1D spherically symmetric radiative
transfer calculations of the glycine emission expected to arise from the
low-mass pre-stellar core L1544. Water vapour has recently been reported toward
this core, indicating that a small fraction of the grain mantles in L1544
(~0.5%) has been injected into the gas phase. Assuming that glycine is
photo-desorbed together with water in L1544, and considering a solid abundance
of glycine on ices of ~1E-4 with respect to water, our calculations reveal that
several glycine lines between 67 GHz and 80 GHz have peak intensities larger
than 10 mK. These results show for the first time that glycine could reach
detectable levels in cold objects such as L1544. This opens up the possibility
to detect glycine, and other pre-biotic species, at the coldest and earliest

dominated by the cool component and we attribute the variability to pulsations
in a red giant star. If we remove this approximate month long modulation from

radio setting. Based on channel sensing and access performances, we consider
the problem of assigning channels orthogonally to secondary users through
distributed coordination and cooperation algorithms. Two economic models are
applied for this purpose: matching markets and competitive markets. In the
matching market model, secondary users and channels build two agent sets. We
implement a stable matching algorithm in which each secondary user, based on
his achievable rate, proposes to the coordinator to be matched with desirable
channels. The coordinator accepts or rejects the proposals based on the channel
preferences which depend on interference from the secondary user. The
coordination algorithm is of low complexity and can adapt to network dynamics.
In the competitive market model, channels are associated with prices and
secondary users are endowed with monetary budget. Each secondary user, based on
his utility function and current channel prices, demands a set of channels. A
Walrasian equilibrium maximizes the sum utility and equates the channel demand
to their supply. We prove the existence of Walrasian equilibrium and propose a
cooperative mechanism to reach it. The performance and complexity of the
proposed solutions are illustrated by numerical simulations.

analysis to enforce the divergence free subdomain boundary velocity conditions,
are no longer needed. This greatly reduces the size of the coarse level problem
in the algorithm, especially for three-dimensional problems. The coarse level
velocity space can be chosen as simple as for solving scalar elliptic problems
corresponding to each velocity component. Both Dirichlet and lumped

0.2-0.3 dex in optical and X-ray luminosities, which is essentially consistent
with the amplitude of the aperiodic flux variability for these objects. At
X-ray luminosities Lx~1e32 erg/sec or lower, the optical g-band luminosity of
the accretion flow is shown to be related to its X-ray luminosity by a factor
~2-3. At even lower X-ray luminosities (Lx~1e30 erg/sec), the contribution from
the photosphere of the white dwarf begins to dominate in the optical spectrum
of the binary system and its optical brightness does not drop below Mg~13-14.
Using the latter fact, we show that in current and planned X-ray sky surveys,
the family of accreting nonmagnetic white dwarfs can be completely identified
to the distance determined by the sensitivity of an optical sky survey in this

paper gives, for a given parameter ideal $Q$ for $M$, bounds for the second
Hilbert coefficients ${\mathrm{e}}_Q^2(M)$ in terms of the homological degrees
and torsions of modules. We also report a criterion for a certain equality of
the second Hilbert coefficients of parameters and the homological torsions of
modules.

functional unit (a placentone). The effect of villi density on oxygen transfer
efficiency is assessed by numerically solving the diffusion-convection equation
in a 2D+1D geometry for a wide range of villi densities. For each set of
physiological parameters, we observe the existence of an optimal villi density
providing a maximal oxygen uptake as a trade-off between the incoming oxygen
flow and the absorbing villus surface. The predicted optimal villi density
$0.47\pm0.06$ is compatible to previous experimental measurements. Several
other ways to experimentally validate the model are also proposed. The proposed
stream-tube model can serve as a basis for analyzing the efficiency of human
placentas, detecting possible pathologies and diagnosing placental health risks
for newborns by using routine histology sections collected after birth.

with the centroid of the Earth, of clocks carried by aircraft circumnavigating
the Earth in different directions, as in the Hafele-Keating experiment,
predicts time differences between airborne and Earth-bound clocks at variance
with the results of the experiment. The latter imply new relativistic velocity
transformations differing from the conventional ones. These transformations
demonstrate in turn the invariance of length intervals on the surface of the
rotating Earth and so resolve the Ehrenfest paradox for this case.
