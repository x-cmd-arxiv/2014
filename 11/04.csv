Calculations of atmospheric circulation on tidally locked planets around M
stars suggest that this peculiar orbital configuration lends itself to the
trapping of large amounts of water in kilometers-thick ice on the night side,
potentially removing all liquid water from the day side where photosynthesis is
possible. We study this problem using a global climate model including coupled
atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea-ice components as well as a continental ice
sheet model driven by the climate model output. For a waterworld we find that
surface winds transport sea ice toward the day side and the ocean carries heat
toward the night side. As a result, night-side sea ice remains O(10 m) thick
and night-side water trapping is insignificant. If a planet has large
continents on its night side, they can grow ice sheets O(1000 m) thick if the
geothermal heat flux is similar to Earth's or smaller. Planets with a water
complement similar to Earth's would therefore experience a large decrease in
sea level when plate tectonics drives their continents onto the night side, but
would not experience complete day-side dessication. Only planets with a
geothermal heat flux lower than Earth's, much of their surface covered by
continents, and a surface water reservoir O(10 %) of Earth's would be
susceptible to complete water trapping.

learning, kernel machines, etc.--require selecting a small yet representative
subset from a large dataset. Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a
submodular set function subject to various constraints. Classical approaches to
submodular optimization require centralized access to the full dataset, which
is impractical for truly large-scale problems. In this paper, we consider the
problem of submodular function maximization in a distributed fashion. We
develop a simple, two-stage protocol GreeDi, that is easily implemented using
MapReduce style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and show
that under certain natural conditions, performance close to the centralized
approach can be achieved. We begin with monotone submodular maximization
subject to a cardinality constraint, and then extend this approach to obtain
approximation guarantees for (not necessarily monotone) submodular maximization
subject to more general constraints including matroid or knapsack constraints.
In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on several applications, including sparse Gaussian process inference and
exemplar based clustering on tens of millions of examples using Hadoop.

hydrides are presented. The calculations are based on density functional theory
and used different local and semilocal approximations. The thermodynamic
stability of all structures as well as the electronic and chemical bonding
properties are addressed. For the monohydride, taking into account the
zero-point energy is important to identify the octahedral Pd-H arrangement with
its larger voids and, hence, softer hydrogen vibrational modes as favorable
over the tetrahedral arrangement as found in the zincblende and wurtzite
structures. Stabilization of the rocksalt structure is due to strong bonding of
the 4d and 1s orbitals, which form a characteristic split-off band separated
from the main d-band group. Increased filling of the formerly pure d states of
the metal causes strong reduction of the density of states at the Fermi energy,
which undermines possible long-range ferromagnetic order otherwise favored by
strong magnetovolume effects. For the dihydride, octahedral Pd-H arrangement as
realized e.g. in the pyrite structure turns out to be unstable against
tetrahedral arrangement as found in the fluorite structure. Yet, from both heat
of formation and chemical bonding considerations the dihydride turns out to be
less favorable than the monohydride. Finally, the vacancy ordered defect phase
Pd3H4 follows the general trend of favouring the octahedral arrangement of the
rocksalt structure for Pd:H ratios less or equal to one.

classes, including notably the plane curves and general helices.
  This paper shows constructively how to solve the natural equations explicitly
for an infinite series of curve classes. For every Frenet curve, a family of
successor curves can be constructed which have the tangent of the original
curve as principal normal. Helices are exactly the successor curves of plane
curves and applying the successor transformation to helices leads to slant
helices, a class of curves that has received considerable attention in recent
years as a natural extension of the concept of general helices.
  The present paper gives for the first time a generic characterization of the
slant helix in three-dimensional Euclidian space in terms of its curvature and
torsion, and derives an explicit arc-length parametrization of its tangent
vector. These results expand on and put into perspective earlier work on
Salkowski curves and curves of constant precession, both of which are

growth proceeds to kilometre sizes, but it has been proposed that water ice
beyond the snowline might affect this process. To better understand collisional
processes in protoplanetary disks leading to planet formation, the individual
low velocity collisions of small ice particles were investigated. The particles
were collided under microgravity conditions on a parabolic flight campaign
using a purpose-built, cryogenically cooled experimental setup. The setup was
capable of colliding pairs of small ice particles (between 4.7 and 10.8 mm in
diameter) together at relative collision velocities of between 0.27 and 0.51 m
s ^-1 at temperatures between 131 and 160 K. Two types of ice particle were
used: ice spheres and irregularly shaped ice fragments. Bouncing was observed
in the majority of cases with a few cases of fragmentation. A full range of
normalised impact parameters (b/R = 0.0-1.0) was realised with this apparatus.
Coefficients of restitution were evenly spread between 0.08 and 0.65 with an
average value of 0.36, leading to a minimum of 58% of translational energy
being lost in the collision. The range of coefficients of restitution is
attributed to the surface roughness of the particles used in the study.
Analysis of particle rotation shows that up to 17% of the energy of the
particles before the collision was converted into rotational energy.
Temperature did not affect the coefficients of restitution over the range
studied.

acquiring multiple images of the same scene at different controlled positions.
Then a fast super-resolution algorithm \cite{eh01} can be used for efficient

for a resolution enhancement factor $r$ is generally not enough to obtain
satisfying results due to the random inaccuracy of the positioning system. Thus
we propose to take several images around each reference position. We study the
error produced by the super-resolution algorithm due to spatial uncertainty as
a function of the number of images per position. We obtain a lower bound on the

describing quantum transport in disordered tight-binding networks connected to
external environments, acting as sinks. Usually, non-Hermitian terms are added,
on a phenomenological basis, to such networks to summarize the effects of the
coupling to the sinks. Here we consider a paradigmatic model of open quantum
network for which we derive a non-Hermitian effective model, discussing its
limit of validity by a comparison with the analysis of the full Hermitian
model. Specifically, we consider a ring of sites connected to a central
one-dimensional lead. The lead acts as a sink which absorbs the excitation
initially present in the ring. The coupling strength to the lead controls the
opening of the ring system. This model has been widely discussed in literature
in the context of light-harvesting systems. We analyze the effectiveness of the
non-Hermitian description both in absence and in presence of static disorder on
the ring. In both cases, the non-Hermitian model is valid when the energy range
determined by the eigenvalues of the ring Hamiltonian is smaller than the
energy band in the lead. Under such condition, we show that results about the
interplay of opening and disorder, previously obtained within the non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian approach, remain valid when the full Hermitian model in presence of
disorder is considered. The results of our analysis can be extended to generic
networks with sinks, leading to the conclusion that the non-Hermitian approach
is valid when the energy dependence of the coupling to the external
environments is sufficiently smooth in the energy range spanned by the
eigenstates of the network.

characterizing systems obeying both classical or quantum dynamics. We consider
iterated open quantum dynamical systems in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, a
broad class of systems that includes classical Markov chains and unitary
discrete time quantum walks on networks. Starting from a pure state, the time
evolution is induced by repeated applications of a general quantum channel, in
each timestep followed by a measurement to detect whether the system has
returned to the original state. We prove that if the superoperator is unital in
the relevant Hilbert space (the part of the Hilbert space explored by the
system), then the expectation value of the return time is an integer, equal to
the dimension of this relevant Hilbert space. We illustrate our results on
partially coherent quantum walks on finite graphs. Our work connects the
previously known quantization of the expected return time for bistochastic
Markov chains and for unitary quantum walks, and shows that these are special
cases of a more general statement. The expected return time is thus a
quantitative measure of the size of the part of the Hilbert space available to
the system when the dynamics is started from a certain state.

models of portfolio risk as well as options pricing. The abstracted problem,
extensively studied in the literature, corresponds to finding a probability
measure that minimizes relative entropy with respect to a specified measure
while satisfying constraints on moments of associated random variables. These
moments may correspond to views held by experts in the portfolio risk setting
and to market prices of liquid options for options pricing models. However, it
is reasonable that in the former settings, the experts may have views on tails
of risks of some securities. Similarly, in options pricing, significant
literature focuses on arriving at the implied risk neutral density of benchmark
instruments through observed market prices. With the intent of calibrating
models to these more general stipulations, we develop a unified entropy based
methodology to allow constraints on both moments as well as marginal
distributions of functions of underlying securities. This is applied to
Markowitz portfolio framework, where a view that a particular portfolio incurs
heavy tailed losses is shown to lead to fatter and more reasonable tails for
losses of component securities. We also use this methodology to price
non-traded options using market information such as observed option prices and

cylindrical coordinate system. The phase-space distribution function was
reduced to a collection of finite-sized macro-particles of arbitrary shape
moving on a virtual Cartesian grid. However, the discretization of field
quantities was performed in cylindrical coordinates and decomposed into a
truncated Fourier series in angle. A straightforward finite element
interpolation scheme is used to transform between the two grids. The equations
of motion were then obtained by demanding the action be stationary. The primary
advantage of the variational approach is preservation of Lagrangian symmetries.
In the present case, this leads to exact energy conservation, thus avoiding
possible difficulties with grid heating.

normally described by the atom-molecule theory, which treats the closed channel
as a noninteracting point boson. In this work we present a theoretical
description of the resonant superfluidity in analogy to the two-band
superconductors. We employ the underlying two-channel scattering model of
Feshbach resonance where the closed channel is treated as a composite boson
with binding energy $\varepsilon_0$ and the resonance is triggered by the
microscopic interchannel coupling $U_{12}$. The binding energy $\varepsilon_0$
naturally serves as an energy scale of the system, which has been sent to
infinity in the atom-molecule theory. We show that the atom-molecule theory can
be viewed as a leading-order low-energy effective theory of the underlying
fermionic theory in the limit $\varepsilon_0\rightarrow\infty$ and
$U_{12}\rightarrow0$, while keeping the phenomenological atom-molecule coupling
finite. The resulting two-band description of the superfluid state is in
analogy to the BCS theory of two-band superconductors. In the dilute limit
$\varepsilon_0\rightarrow\infty$, the two-band description recovers precisely
the atom-molecule theory. The two-band theory provides a natural approach to
study the corrections because of a finite binding energy $\varepsilon_0$ in
realistic experimental systems. For broad and moderate resonances, the
correction is not important for current experimental densities. However, for
extremely narrow resonance, we find that the correction becomes significant.
The finite binding energy correction could be important for the stability of
homogeneous polarized superfluid against phase separation in imbalanced Fermi
gases across a narrow Feshbach resonance.

the system from one with unkown CSI at the transmitter to a system with
instantanous CSI at both sides of the communication. We derive new extentions
of the fundamental relation between the gradient of the mutual information and
the MMSE for the conditional and non-conditional mutual information.
Capitalizing on such relations, we provide the optimal power allocation and
optimal precoding designs with respect to the estimated channel and MMSE. The
designs introduced are optimal for multiple access (MAC) Gaussian coherent
time-varying fading channels with general inputs and can be specialized to
multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels by decoding interference. The
impact of interference on the capacity is quantified by the gradient of the

important prior to the fit of the supernovae's lightcurve is the distribution
of host galaxy extinction values that can be encountered. The SDSS-SN project
has published light curve fits using both MLCS2k2 and SALT2. We use the former
fits extinction parameter ($A_V$) to map this distribution of extinction
values.
  We explore the dependence of this distribution on four observables; the
inclination of the host galaxy disk, radial position of the supernova, redshift
of the supernova and host, and the level of star-formation in the host galaxy.
The distribution of $A_V$ values encountered by supernovae is typically
characterised by: $\rm N_0 ~ e^{-A_V/\tau}$, with $\tau$= 0.4 or 0.33.
  We find that the inclination correction using an infinitely thin disk for the
SNIa is sufficient, resulting in similar exponential $A_V$ distributions for
high- and low-inclination disks. The $A_V$ distribution also depends on the
radial position in the disk, consistent with previous results on the
transparency of spiral disks. The distribution of $A_V$ values narrows with
increased star-formation, possibly due to the destruction or dispersion of the
dusty ISM by stellar winds prior to the ignition of the supernova.
  In future supernova searches, certainly the inclination of the host galaxy
disk, should be considered in the construction of the \av \ prior with

increasingly becoming the standard tool of practise in GW astronomy. However,
algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) require a large number of
iterations to guarantee convergence to the target density. Each chain demands a
large number of evaluations of the likelihood function, and in the case of a
Hessian MCMC, calculations of the Fisher information matrix for use as a
proposal distribution. As each iteration requires the generation of at least
one gravitational waveform, we very quickly reach a point of exclusion for
current Bayesian algorithms, especially for low mass systems where the length
of the waveforms is large and the waveform generation time is on the order of
seconds. This suddenly demands a timescale of many weeks for a single MCMC. As
each likelihood and Fisher information matrix calculation requires the
evaluation of noise-weighted scalar products, we demonstrate that by using the
linearity of integration, and the fact that more than 90% of the generation
time is spent at frequencies less that one third of the maximum, we can
construct composite integrals that speed up the MCMCs for comparable mass
binaries by a factor of between 3.5 and 5.5, depending on the waveform length.
This method is both source and detector type independent, and can be applied to
any waveform that displays significant frequency evolution, such as stellar

  and Bruce D. Cook","Dynamic spatial regression models for space-varying forest stand tables",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many forest management planning decisions are based on information about the
number of trees by species and diameter per unit area. This information is
commonly summarized in a stand table, where a stand is defined as a group of
forest trees of sufficiently uniform species composition, age, condition, or
productivity to be considered a homogeneous unit for planning purposes.
Typically information used to construct stand tables is gleaned from observed
subsets of the forest selected using a probability-based sampling design. Such
sampling campaigns are expensive and hence only a small number of sample units
are typically observed. This data paucity means that stand tables can only be
estimated for relatively large areal units. Contemporary forest management
planning and spatially explicit ecosystem models require stand table input at
higher spatial resolution than can be affordably provided using traditional
approaches. We propose a dynamic multivariate Poisson spatial regression model
that accommodates both spatial correlation between observed diameter
distributions and also correlation between tree counts across diameter classes
within each location. To improve fit and prediction at unobserved locations,
diameter specific intensities can be estimated using auxiliary data such as
management history or remotely sensed information. The proposed model is used
to analyze a diverse forest inventory dataset collected on the United States
Forest Service Penobscot Experimental Forest in Bradley, Maine. Results
demonstrate that explicitly modeling the residual spatial structure via a
multivariate Gaussian process and incorporating information about forest
structure from LiDAR covariates improve model fit and can provide high spatial
resolution stand table maps with associated estimates of uncertainty.

dimer chain, the combination of dissipation, driving of the boundary, and
intrinsic nonlinearity leads to complex dynamics. For fixed driving frequencies
in each of the spectral gaps, we find that the nonlinear surface modes and the
states dictated by the linear drive collide in a saddle-node bifurcation as the
driving amplitude is increased, beyond which the dynamics of the system become
chaotic. While the bifurcation structure is similar for solutions within the
first and second gap, those in the first gap appear to be less robust. We also
conduct a continuation in driving frequency, where it is apparent that the
nonlinearity of the system results in a complex bifurcation diagram, involving
an intricate set of loops of branches, especially within the spectral gap. The

nebulae (PWNe) in the Milky Way are very efficient lepton accelerators. We
argue that, if embryonic PWNe satisfy similar conditions at early stages of SNe
(in ~1-10 months after the explosion), external inverse-Compton emission via
upscatterings of SN photons is naturally expected in the GeV range as well as
broadband synchrotron emission. To fully take into account the Klein-Nishina
effect and two-photon annihilation process that are important at early times,
we perform detailed calculations including electromagnetic cascades. Our
results suggest that hard X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR can observe such
early PWN emission by followup observations in months-to-years. GeV gamma rays
may also be detected by Fermi for nearby SNe, which serve as counterparts of
these GW sources. Detecting the signals will give us an interesting probe of
particle acceleration at early times of PWNe, as well as clues to driving
mechanisms of luminous SNe and GRBs. Since the Bethe-Heitler cross section is
lower than the Thomson cross section, gamma rays would allow us to study
subphotospheric dissipation. We encourage searches for high-energy emission

  Gordeew and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we show that PSPACE is equal to 4th level in the polynomial
hierarchy. We also deduce a lot of important consequences.
  True quantified Boolean formula is a generalisation of the Boolean
Satisfiability Problem, where determining of interpretation that satisfies a
given Boolean formula is replaced by existence of Boolean functions that makes
a given QBF to be tautology. Such functions are called the Skolem functions.
  The essential idea of the proof is to show that for any quantified Boolean
formula $\phi$ we can obtain a formula $\phi'$ which is in the 4th level of the
polynomial hierarchy, no more than polynomial in the size of a given $\phi$,
such that the truth of $\phi$ can be determined from the truth of $\phi'$. The
idea is to skolemize, and then use additional formulas from the 2nd level of
the polynomial hierarchy inside the skolemized prefix to enforce that the
skolem variables indeed depend only on the universally quantified variables
they are supposed to. However, some dependence is lost when the quantification
is reversed. It is called ""XOR issue"" because the functional dependence can be
expressed by means of an XOR formula. Thus, it is needed to locate these XORs,
but there is no need to locate all chains with XORs: any chain includes a XOR
of only two variables. The last can be done locally in each iteration (keep in
mind the algebraic normal form (ANF)), when all arguments are specified, i.e.
as a polynomial subroutine.
  Relativization is defeated due to the well-known fact: PH = PSPACE iff
second-order logic over finite structures gains no additional power from the
addition of a transitive closure operator. The exchange is possible due to
finite possibilities for arguments. So, the theorems with oracles are not
applicable since a random oracle is an arbitrary set. And that's why PH is
infinite relative to a random oracle with probability 1.

give rise to two NLSP selectrons or smuons, each of which subsequently decays
to a nearly massless LSP gravitino and an electron or a muon. In a large region
of the parameter space, the NLSPs travel macroscopic distances, of the order
0.1-1000 mm, before they decay. Hence, these models give rise to collider
signatures involving charged tracks that end at vertices, which are inside the
detector volume but displaced with respect to the original collision point,
from which an electron or a muon is emitted. In order to probe this class of
models we propose a search for disappearing charged tracks in association with
displaced electrons or muons.

and 21.71 mags, respectively. The luminosity of the counterpart is much larger
than that of a single O-type star, indicating that it may be a stellar cluster.
Our optical spectroscopic observations confirm the association of the X-ray
source and the optical counterpart with its host galaxy NGC 470, which
validates the high, > 10^41 erg/s, X-ray luminosity of the source. Its optical
spectrum is embedded with numerous emission lines, including H recombination
lines, metallic forbidden lines and more notably the high-ionization HeII
(lambda 4686 A) line. This line shows a large velocity dispersion of $\simeq$
410 \kms, consistent with the existence of a compact (< 5 AU) highly-ionized
accretion disc rotating around the central X-ray source. The 1.4 x 10^37 erg/s
luminosity of the HeII line emission makes the source one of the most luminous
ULXs in the emission of that line. This, together with the high X-ray
luminosity and the large velocity dispersion of the HeII emission, suggests
that the source is an ideal candidate for more extensive follow-up observations
for understanding the nature of hyper-luminous X-ray sources, a more luminous
subgroup of ULXs and more likely candidates for intermediate-mass black holes.

reporting all $k$ points inside an axis-aligned query rectangle. This is one of
the most fundamental data structure problems in databases and computational
geometry. Despite the importance of the problem its complexity remains
unresolved in the word-RAM. On the upper bound side, three best tradeoffs
exists: (1.) Query time $O(\lg \lg n + k)$ with $O(nlg^{\varepsilon}n)$ words
of space for any constant $\varepsilon>0$. (2.) Query time $O((1 + k) \lg \lg
n)$ with $O(n \lg \lg n)$ words of space. (3.) Query time
$O((1+k)\lg^{\varepsilon} n)$ with optimal $O(n)$ words of space. However, the
only known query time lower bound is $\Omega(\log \log n +k)$, even for linear
space data structures.
  All three current best upper bound tradeoffs are derived by reducing range
reporting to a ball-inheritance problem. Ball-inheritance is a problem that
essentially encapsulates all previous attempts at solving range reporting in
the word-RAM. In this paper we make progress towards closing the gap between
the upper and lower bounds for range reporting by proving cell probe lower
bounds for ball-inheritance. Our lower bounds are tight for a large range of

in the social sciences. Despite multiple approaches to dealing adequately with
missing data, many scholars still fail to address this vital issue. In this
paper, we present a simple-to-use method for generating multiple imputations
using a Gaussian copula. The Gaussian copula for multiple imputation (Hoff,
2007) allows scholars to attain estimation results that have good coverage and
small bias. The use of copulas to model the dependence among variables will
enable researchers to construct valid joint distributions of the data, even
without knowledge of the actual underlying marginal distributions. Multiple
imputations are then generated by drawing observations from the resulting
posterior joint distribution and replacing the missing values. Using simulated
and observational data from published social science research, we compare
imputation via Gaussian copulas with two other widely used imputation methods:
MICE and Amelia II. Our results suggest that the Gaussian copula approach has a
slightly smaller bias, higher coverage rates, and narrower confidence intervals
compared to the other methods. This is especially true when the variables with
missing data are not normally distributed. These results, combined with
theoretical guarantees and ease-of-use suggest that the approach examined
provides an attractive alternative for applied researchers undertaking multiple
imputations.

including the identification of discussion topics, event detection, and content
recommendation. Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and
clustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering
procedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of
information carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based
on multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets
reflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm
takes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including
natural language, the social network, and the patterns of information
diffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically,
structurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on
a variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to
""forget"" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation
of our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics.
Over a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was
able to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method
outperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a
state-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the
underlying follower network. We finally show that our online learning framework
is flexible, due to its independence of the adopted clustering algorithm, and
best suited to work in a streaming scenario.

the special case \eta = 8/3. Here we demonstrate that models with \eta < 8/3
can be made self-consistent if we relax the assumption of constant specific
entropy. Instead, the entropy must increase with increasing r along the
boundary layer, presumably due to multiple shocks driven into the flow as it
gradually collimates. The increase in specific entropy slows the acceleration
rate of the flow and provides a source of internal energy that could be
channeled into radiation. We suggest that this process may be important for
determining the radiative characteristics of tidal disruption events and
gamma-ray bursts from collapsars.

suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficiently
large volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving the

several star-forming compact galaxies. The simulated compact galaxies are
similar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. We
follow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that there
are multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by two
mechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggered
by gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radii
by a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times when
the universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so until

particles because top quark pairs are copiously produced at the Large Hadron
Collider. The signal process is initiated by a rare top decay into a bottom
quark and a charged Higgs boson ($H^\pm$) decaying subsequently into a $W$ and
one or multiple $Z'$s. The light $Z'$ can be invisible in collider searches in
various scenarios, and it would be hard to distinguish the relevant collider
signature from the regular $t\bar{t}$ process in the Standard Model. We suggest
a search strategy using the recently proposed on-shell constrained $M_2$

topology, while the $t\bar{t}$ is $\textit{symmetric}$. The essence behind the
strategy is to evoke some contradiction in the relevant observables by applying
the kinematic variables designed under the assumption of the $t\bar{t}$ event

constraints to date on its $>10$~keV spectral shape. We find no strong
variability over the past two decades, consistent with its Compton-thick AGN
classification. The combined NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift-BAT
spectral dataset offers new insights into the complex reflected emission. The
critical combination of the high signal-to-noise NuSTAR data and a spatial
decomposition with Chandra allow us to break several model degeneracies and
greatly aid physical interpretation. When modeled as a monolithic (i.e., a
single N_H) reflector, none of the common Compton-reflection models are able to
match the neutral fluorescence lines and broad spectral shape of the Compton
reflection. A multi-component reflector with three distinct column densities
(e.g., N_H~1.5e23, 5e24, and 1e25 cm^{-2}) provides a more reasonable fit to
the spectral lines and Compton hump, with near-solar Fe abundances. In this
model, the higher N_H components provide the bulk of the Compton hump flux
while the lower N_H component produces much of the line emission, effectively
decoupling two key features of Compton reflection. We note that ~30% of the
neutral Fe Kalpha line flux arises from >2"" (~140 pc), implying that a
significant fraction of the <10 keV reflected component arises from regions
well outside of a parsec-scale torus. These results likely have ramifications
for the interpretation of poorer signal-to-noise observations and/or more
distant objects [Abridged].

Warped Geometry and it turns out to be a variant of a Newton-Cartan structure

radiative corrections beyond leading-order (LO), approaching up to 60% at
next-to-leading order (NLO), compared to the scale uncertainties which are in
the range 1-5% at LO. If the scale uncertainties are to be taken seriously, the
NLO predictions are as much as 30 sigma away from their LO counterpart
suggesting a very poor convergence of the perturbation theory. In this paper,
we show that there is a second source of scale uncertainty which has not been
considered in the literature, namely the complex phase of the scales, which can
lead to large perturbative corrections. Using the formalism of soft-collinear
effective theory, we resum these large contributions from the complex phase,
finding that the scale uncertainties in fixed-order calculations can be grossly
underestimated compared to the resummed predictions, which have uncertainties
as large as 13-16% at LO. Even at NLO, we find that the scale uncertainties are
marginally higher than previously estimated, depending on the choice of scale.
Using our method of scale variation, the compatibility of LO and NLO results
within the scale uncertainties is vastly improved so that the perturbation
theory can be relied upon. This method of scale variation can be easily
extended to beyond NLO calculations as well as other LHC processes.

have been interpreted as the signature of powerful AGN-driven outflows.
Naively, these findings appear in tension with hydrodynamic models in which
AGN-driven outflows are energy-driven and thus very hot with typical
temperatures T = 10^6-7 K. Using the moving-mesh code Arepo, we perform
'zoom-in' cosmological simulations of a z = 6 QSO and its environment,
following black hole growth and feedback via energy-driven outflows. In the
simulations, the QSO host galaxy is surrounded by a clumpy circum-galactic
medium pre-enriched with metals due to supernovae-driven galactic outflows. As
a result, part of the AGN-driven hot outflowing gas can cool radiatively,
leading to large amounts (> 10^9 M_sun) of cold gas comoving with the hot
bipolar outflow. This results in velocity widths of spatially extended cold gas
similar to those observed. We caution, however, that gas inflows, random
motions in the deep potential well of the QSO host galaxy and cooling of
supernovae-driven winds contribute significantly to the large velocity width of
the cold gas in the simulations, complicating the interpretation of

high luminosity (~ 10^39 erg/s) and super-soft spectrum (T ~ 0.1 keV) during

the $0.3 - 0.7$ keV and $1.2 - 5.0$ keV energy bands at the QPO frequency and
at a frequency band in a 3:2 ratio, strongly suggesting the presence of a QPO
harmonic. An iron K$\alpha$ reverberation lag is found at the harmonic
frequency, indicating the reflecting material subtends some angle to the
primary continuum, which is modulated by the QPO mechanism. Frequency resolved
spectroscopy reveals the QPO and harmonic to have a hard energy dependence.
These properties of the QPO variability, together with the current black hole
mass estimate, $M_{\rm bh} \sim 4 \times 10^{6} M_{\rm sun}$, are consistent
with the QPO originating from the same process as the high frequency QPO
phenomenon observed in black hole X-ray binaries. Principle component analysis
reveals the spectral variability in MS 2254.9-3712 is similar to that of the
active galaxy RE J1034+396, a source which also displays an X-ray QPO. This
suggests a distinct spectral variability pattern for accreting black holes when
in a state where QPOs are present.

supermassive black holes. Simulations suggest that tidal interactions could
enhance black hole accretion, which can be tested by the fraction of binary
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among galaxy mergers. But determining the
fraction requires a statistical sample of binaries. We have identified
kpc-scale binary AGNs directly from high-resolution radio imaging. Inside the
92 square deg covered by the high-resolution Very Large Array survey of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 field, we identified 22 grade A and
30 grade B candidates of binary radio AGNs with angular separations less than
5"" (10 kpc at z = 0.1). Eight of the candidates have optical spectra for both
components from the SDSS spectroscopic surveys and our Keck program. Two grade
B candidates are projected pairs, but the remaining six candidates are all
compelling cases of binary AGNs based on either emission line ratios or the
excess in radio power compared to the H-alpha-traced star formation rate. Only
two of the six binaries were previously discovered by an optical spectroscopic
search. Based on these results, we estimate that ~60% of our binary candidates
would be confirmed once we obtain complete spectroscopic information. We
conclude that wide-area high-resolution radio surveys offer an efficient method
to identify large samples of binary AGNs. These radio-selected binary AGNs
complement binaries identified at other wavelengths and are useful for
understanding the triggering mechanisms of black hole accretion.

strong constraints on ultralight bosons, thus turning black holes into
effective particle detectors. However, very little is known about the
development of the instability and whether its nonlinear time evolution accords
to the linear intuition. For the first time, we attack this problem by studying
the impact of gravitational-wave emission and gas accretion on the evolution of
the instability. Our quasi-adiabatic, fully-relativistic analysis shows that:
(i) gravitational-wave emission does not have a significant effect on the
evolution of the black hole, (ii) accretion plays an important role and (iii)
although the mass of the scalar cloud developed through superradiance can be a
sizeable fraction of the black-hole mass, its energy-density is very low and
backreaction is negligible. Thus, massive black holes are well described by the
Kerr geometry even if they develop bosonic clouds through superradiance. Using
Monte Carlo methods and very conservative assumptions, we provide strong
support to the validity of the linearized analysis and to the bounds of
previous studies.

of the disc around the young, eccentric stellar binary HD 104237. We find that
the binary clears out a large cavity in the disc, driving a significant
eccentricity at the cavity edge. This then precesses around the binary at a
rate of $\dot{\varpi} = 0.48^{\circ}T_{\mathrm{b}}^{-1}$, which for HD 104237
corresponds to 40 years. We find that the accretion pattern into the cavity and
onto the binary changes with this precession, resulting in a periodic accretion
variability driven purely by the physical parameters of the binary and its
orbit. For each star we find that this results in order of magnitude changes in
the accretion rate. We also find that the accretion variability allows the
primary to accrete gas at a higher rate than the secondary for approximately
half of each precession period. Using a large number of 3-body integrations of
test particles orbiting different binaries, we find good agreement between the
precession rate of a test particle and our SPH disc precession. These rates
also agree very well with the precession rates predicted by the analytic theory
of Leung & Lee (2013), showing that their prescription can be accurately used
to predict long-term accretion variability timescales for eccentric binaries
accreting from a disc. We discuss the implications of our result, and suggest
that this process provides a viable way of preserving unequal mass ratios in
accreting eccentric binaries in both the stellar and supermassive black hole

predictions are likely generic to models with oscillations in the inflaton

running spectral index through Planck-scale corrections to the inflaton
potential. Applying this model to a combined data set of Planck, ACT, SPT, and
WMAP low-$\ell$ polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find a
best-fit tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05} = 0.07^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ due to
gravitational waves, which may have been observed by the BICEP2 experiment.
Despite the contribution of gravitational waves, the total power on large
scales (CMB power spectrum at low multipoles) is lower than the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of initial perturbations and
no gravitational waves, thus mitigating some of the tension on large scales.
There is also a reduction in the matter power spectrum of 20-30\% at scales
corresponding to $k = 10~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which are relevant for dwarf galaxy
formation. This will alleviate some of the unsolved small-scale structure
problems in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The inferred matter power

two distinct components separated by ~500 km/s that are nearly coincident along

the blue-shifted component dispersion-dominated and the red-shifted component
showing a clear velocity gradient. CO line ratios differ slightly between the

merger with a mass ratio of (7.8+/-4.0)/sin^2(i), with its overall size and
surface brightness closely resembling that of other merging systems. We perform
large velocity gradient modeling of the CO emission from both components and
find that each component's properties are consistent with a single phase of
molecular gas (i.e., a single temperatures and density); additional multi-phase
modeling of the red-shifted component, although motivated by a CO(1-0) size

in extended objects such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. We
searched for evidence of O VII through all the archival RGS observations of
galaxy clusters, groups of galaxies, and elliptical galaxies focusing on those
with core temperatures below 1 keV. We have discovered O VII resonance (21.6A)

elliptical galaxies: M 84, M 86, M 89, NGC 1316, NGC 4636, and NGC 5846. M 84,
M 86 and M 89 are members of the Virgo Cluster, the others are central dominant
galaxies of groups, and most them show evidence of O VI in UV spectra. We
detect no significant trend between the Fe XVII and O VII

The observed line ratios <Fe(r/f), O(r/f)>= (0.52+/-0.02, 0.9+/-0.2) indicate
that the spectra of all these ellipticals are affected by resonance scattering,
suggesting low turbulence. Deeper exposures will help to understand whether the
Fe XVII and O VII lines are both produced by the same cooling gas or by
multiphase gas. Our O VII luminosities correspond to 0.2-2 Msun/yr, which agree
with the predictions for ellipticals. Such weak cooling rates would not be
detected in clusters because their spectra are dominated by the emission of
hotter gas, and owing to their greater distance, the expected O VII line flux
would be undetectable.

annoying ads can be more effective for some advertisers because of their
ability to attract attention, but after attracting viewers' attention, their
nuisance to viewers can decrease engagement with the platform over time. With
the rise of mobile technology and ad blockers, many platforms are becoming
increasingly concerned about how to improve monetization through digital ads
while improving viewer experience.
  We study an online ad auction mechanism that incorporates a charge for ad
impact on user experience as a criterion for ad selection and pricing. Like a
Pigovian tax, the charge causes advertisers to internalize the hidden cost of
foregone future platform revenue due to ad impact on user experience. Over
time, the mechanism provides an incentive for advertisers to develop ads that
are effective while offering viewers a more pleasant experience. We show that
adopting the mechanism can simultaneously benefit the publisher, advertisers,
and viewers, even in the short term.
  Incorporating a charge for ad impact can increase expected advertiser profits
if enough advertisers compete. A stronger effectiveness-nuisance tradeoff,
meaning that ad effectiveness is more strongly associated with negative impact
on user experience, increases the amount of competition required for the
mechanism to benefit advertisers. The findings suggest that the mechanism can
benefit the marketplace for ad slots that consistently attract many
advertisers.

At the same time, no-go results have shown that generic, uncorrelated noise
limits the quantum advantage to a constant factor. In frequency estimation
scenarios, however, there are exceptions to this rule and, in particular, it
has been found that transversal dephasing does allow for a scaling quantum
advantage. Yet, it has remained unclear whether such exemptions can be
exploited in practical scenarios. Here, we argue that the transversal-noise
model applies to the setting of recent magnetometry experiments and show that a
scaling advantage can be maintained with one-axis-twisted spin-squeezed states
and Ramsey-interferometry-like measurements. This is achieved by exploiting the
geometry of the setup that, as we demonstrate, has a strong influence on the
achievable quantum enhancement for experimentally feasible parameter settings.
When, in addition to the dominant transversal noise, other sources of
decoherence are present, the quantum advantage is asymptotically bounded by a
constant, but this constant may be significantly improved by exploring the
geometry.

However, evaluations of model-accuracy of some of the models that are commonly

evaluate model-accuracy of the two main classes of diffusion MRI models. The
diffusion tensor model (DTM) summarizes diffusion as a 3-dimensional Gaussian
distribution. Sparse fascicle models (SFM) summarize the signal as a linear sum
of signals originating from a collection of fascicles oriented in different

model to predict a second, independent data set. This is the first evaluation
of model-accuracy of these models. In most of the white matter the DTM predicts
the data more accurately than test-retest reliability; SFM model-accuracy is
higher than test-retest reliability and also higher than the DTM, particularly
for measurements with (a) a b-value above 1000 in locations containing fiber

interesting analyses performed by the experiments at the LHC. It encodes
knowledge of correlations between the proton constituents not accessible in
single parton scattering. Within perturbative QCD DPS is described in terms of
partonic subprocesses and double parton distributions (DPDs). There exists a
large number of different DPDs describing the different possible states of two
partons inside a proton. They include correlations between the two partons and
interferences between the two hard subprocesses. Taking the probability
interpretation of the DPDs as starting point, we derive limits on the
interference DPDs and thereby constrain the size of correlations between two
partons inside an unpolarized proton.

view. In the first part, we address the enumeration of planar maps equipped
with a spanning forest, here called forested maps, with a weight $z$ per face
and a weight $u$ per non-root component of the forest. Equivalently, we count
(with respect to the number of faces) the planar maps $C$ weighted by
$T_C(u+1,1)$, where $T_C$ is the Tutte polynomial of $C$. We begin by a purely
combinatorial characterization of the corresponding generating function,
denoted by $F(z,u)$. We deduce from this that $F(z,u)$ is differentially
algebraic in $z$, that is, satisfies a polynomial differential equation in $z$.
Finally, for $u \geq -1$, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the $n$th
coefficient of $F (z,u)$. We observe a phase transition at $0$, with a very
unusual regime in $n^{-3}\ln^{-2} (n)$ for $u \in [-1,0[$, which testifies a
new universality class for planar maps. In the second part, we propose a
framework unifying the notions of activity used in the literature to describe
the Tutte polynomial. The new notion of activity thereby defined is called
$\Delta$-activity. It gathers all the notions of activities that were already
known and has nice properties, as Crapo's property that defines a partition of
the lattice of the spanning subgraphs into intervals with respect to the
activity. Lastly we conjecture that every activity that describes the Tutte
polynomial and that satisfies Crapo's property can be defined in terms of
$\Delta$-activity.

significant misalignment between the spin axis of the host star and the
planet's orbital angular momentum axis. A possible channel for producing such
misaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's
orbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a
recent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot
Jupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often
chaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the
origin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized
non-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are
strictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of
secular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these
resonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution
of stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the
adiabaticity parameter $\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai
nodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on
the planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. For systems
with zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence
(as a function of $\epsilon$) of ""periodic islands"" in the middle of a ""chaotic
ocean"" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle of
regular/periodic spin evolution. Finally, we discuss a novel ""adiabatic
resonance advection"" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped
in a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.
This phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the
planetary orbit is included.

related to the 2175 A bump seen in the Local Group and may be a counterpart of
the 2175 A bump under different conditions in the early Universe. Furthermore,
five objects in this sample show low-ionization broad absorption lines
(LoBALs), such as Mg II and Al III, in addition to the high-ionization broad
absorption lines (HiBALs) of C IV and Si IV. The fraction of LoBALs in our
sample, ~70%, is surprisingly high compared to that of general BAL quasars,
~10%. Although the origin of the bump is still not clear, the coexistence of
both BALs and bumps and the significantly high fraction of LoBALs may indicate
the bump carriers is closely related to the early evolution phase of quasars.

the strength of the magnetic field, the single-particle spectrum has either a
single ground state or two degenerate ground states. The transition between
these two phases is reflected in the many-particle properties. We first
investigate these phases through the Bogoliubov approximation in the superfluid

stronger interactions the system is expected to form a Mott insulator. We
calculate the Mott transition boundary as a function of the magnetic field and
interleg coupling with mean-field theory, strong-coupling expansion and density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Finally, using the DMRG, we investigate
the particle-hole excitation gaps of this system at different filling factors

confinement. Through a careful choice of a Cho-Duan-Ge Abelian Decomposition,
we can construct the QCD Wilson Loop in terms of an Abelian restricted field.
The relationship between the QCD and restricted string tensions is exact; and
we do not need to gauge fix, apply any path ordering of gauge links, or
additional path integrals. This hints at why mesons are colour neutral.
  Furthermore, the Abelian restricted field contains two parts: a Maxwell term,
and a topological term. The topological term can describe magnetic monopoles
and other topological objects, which can be studied both numerically and
theoretically. By examining the topological part of the restricted field
strength we have found evidence suggesting that these objects, which will
contribute to confinement if present, are indeed there.
  Previous studies have used simplifications, breaking the exact relationship
between the restricted and QCD string tensions, but it was found that the
topological term dominated the restricted string tension. Here we remove those
simplifications, and show that the Abelian restricted field does indeed fully
explain confinement. However, our results for how much of the restricted string
tension arises from the topological objects show strong dependence on the
lattice spacing and level of smearing, so we are not yet able to draw a
definitive conclusion.

12CO and 13CO and have similar LTE and non-LTE masses ranging from 200 to
higher than 5,000 M_sun. With larger gas masses than virial masses, these five
clumps are gravitationally unstable and have potential to collapse to form new
stars. The other five clumps are only reliably detected in 12CO and have
relatively small masses. Five clumps are located on the border of the ring
structure and four of them are elongated along the shell. This is well in
agreement with the collect and collapse scenario. The detected velocity
gradient reveals that the ring structure is still under expansion due to
stellar winds from the exciting star(s). Furthermore, 99 young stellar objects
have been identified based on their infrared colors. A group of YSOs reside
inside the ring, indicating active star formation in N6. Although no
confirmative features of triggered star formation detected, the bubble and the
enclosed HII region have profoundly reconstructed the natal could and altered
the dynamics therein.

$\le$0''.5 ($10^{15}$ cm$^2$) penumbral/umbral kernel brightens repeatedly in
the optical continuum and chromospheric emission lines, similar to the temporal
characteristics of the hard X-ray variation as detected by the Gamma-ray Burst

employ a nonthermal electron beam energy flux high enough to produce the
optical contrast in our flare spectra would predict a large Balmer jump in
emission, indicative of hydrogen recombination radiation from the upper flare
chromosphere. However, we find no evidence of such a Balmer jump in the
bluemost spectral region of the continuum excess. Just redward of the expected
Balmer jump, we find evidence of a ""blue continuum bump"" in the excess emission

large number of observational constraints provides a springboard for modeling
the blue/optical emission for this particular flare with radiative-hydrodynamic
codes, which are necessary to understand the opacity effects for the continuum

resulting in a high spin injection efficiency. On the other hand, the
calculated spin injection efficiencies of Ni/Cu/Graphene and

decomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical
reaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes
this basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise
in molecular implementations, such as what we call ""delayed choice,"" that are
not easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway
decomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class

These equations contain unknown parameters, say $\bm\theta$ of physical
significance which have to be estimated from the noisy data. Often there is no
closed form analytic solution of the equations and hence we cannot use the
usual non-linear least squares technique to estimate the unknown parameters.
There is a two-step approach to solve this problem, where the first step
involves fitting the data nonparametrically. In the second step the parameter
is estimated by minimizing the distance between the nonparametrically estimated
derivative and the derivative suggested by the system of ODEs. The statistical
aspects of this approach have been studied under the frequentist framework. We
consider this two-step estimation under the Bayesian framework. The response
variable is allowed to be multidimensional and the true mean function of it is
not assumed to be in the model. We induce a prior on the regression function
using a random series based on the B-spline basis functions. We establish the
Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the parameter of
interest. Interestingly, even though the posterior distribution of the
regression function based on splines converges at a rate slower than
$n^{-1/2}$, the parameter vector $\bm\theta$ is nevertheless estimated at
$n^{-1/2}$ rate.

semiparametric sample selection model in high-dimensional settings under a weak
nonparametric restriction on the selection correction. In particular, the
number of regressors in the main equation, p, and the number of regressors in
the selection equation, d, can grow with and exceed the sample size n. The
analysis considers the exact sparsity case and the approximate sparsity case.
The main theoretical results are finite-sample bounds from which sufficient
scaling conditions on the sample size for estimation consistency and
variable-selection consistency are established. Statistical efficiency of the
proposed estimators is studied via lower bounds on minimax risks and the result
shows that, for a family of models with exactly sparse structure on the
coefficient vector in the main equation, one of the proposed estimators attains
the smallest estimation error up to the (n,d,p)-scaling among a class of
procedures in worst-case scenarios. Inference procedures for the coefficients
of the main equation, one based on a pivotal Dantzig selector to construct
non-asymptotic confidence sets and one based on a post-selection strategy, are
discussed. Other theoretical contributions include establishing the
non-asymptotic counterpart of the familiar asymptotic oracle results from
previous literature: the estimator of the coefficients in the main equation
behaves as if the unknown nonparametric component were known, provided the
nonparametric component is sufficiently smooth. Small-sample performance of the
high-dimensional multi-stage estimation procedure is evaluated by Monte-Carlo
simulations and illustrated with an empirical application to the retail
gasoline market in the Greater Saint Louis area.

decomposition of large-scale matrices with known entry percentage \rho. RSM is
very fast as the floating-point operations (flops) required are compared
favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Meanwhile RSM is very
memory-saving. With known entries homogeneously distributed in the given
matrix, sub-matrices formed by known entries are randomly selected. According
to the just proved theorem that subspace related to smaller singular values is
less perturbed by noise, the null vectors or the right singular vectors
associated with the minor singular values are calculated for each submatrix.
The vectors are the null vectors of the corresponding submatrix in the ground
truth of the given large-scale matrix. If enough sub-matrices are randomly
chosen, the low-rank decomposition is estimated. The experimental results on
random synthetical matrices with sizes such as 131072X1024 and on real data
sets indicate that RSM is much faster and memory-saving, and, meanwhile, has
considerable high precision achieving or approximating to the best.

developed for propagating nuclear data uncertainties in nuclear burn-up
simulations. Most methods fall into the two broad classes of Monte Carlo
approaches, which are exact apart from statistical uncertainties but require
additional computation time, and first order perturbation theory approaches,
which are efficient for not too large numbers of considered response functions
but only applicable for sufficiently small nuclear data uncertainties. Some
methods neglect isotopic composition uncertainties induced by the depletion
steps of the simulations, others neglect neutron flux uncertainties, and the
accuracy of a given approximation is often very hard to quantify. In order to
get a better sense of the impact of different approximations, this work aims to
compare results obtained based on different approximate methodologies with an
exact method, namely the NUDUNA Monte Carlo based approach developed by AREVA
GmbH. In addition, the impact of different covariance data is studied by
comparing two of the presently most complete nuclear data covariance libraries
(ENDF/B-VII.1 and SCALE 6.0), which reveals a high dependency of the
uncertainty estimates on the source of covariance data. The burn-up benchmark
Exercise I-1b proposed by the OECD expert group ""Benchmarks for Uncertainty
Analysis in Modeling (UAM) for the Design, Operation and Safety Analysis of
LWRs"" is studied as an example application. The burn-up simulations are
performed with the SCALE 6.0 tool suite.

equations of electromagnetism from curved four-dimensional space-time to
three-dimensional observer's space. We focus on a minimal set of mathematical
structures that are directly motivated by the language of the physical theory.
Space-time, world-lines, time translation, space platforms, and time
synchronization all find their mathematical counterparts. The splitting
structure is defined without recourse to coordinates or frames. This is
noteworthy since, in much of the prevalent literature, observers are identified
with adapted coordinates and frames. Among the benefits of the approach is a
concise and insightful classification of splitting structures that is
juxtaposed to a classification of observers. The application of the framework
to the Ehrenfest paradox and Schiff's ""Question in General Relativity"" further
illustrates the advantages of the framework, enabling a compact, yet profound
analysis of the problems at hand.

utilize piecewise constant approximation on the generated partition [IEEE
Trans. Inform. Theory 52 (2006) 1335-1353; Mach. Learn. 66 (2007) 209-242], we
consider decorated trees, which allow us to derive higher order methods.
Convergence rates for these methods are derived in terms the parameter $\alpha$
of margin conditions and a rate $s$ of best approximation of the Bayes set by
decorated adaptive partitions. They can also be expressed in terms of the Besov
smoothness $\beta$ of the regression function that governs its approximability
by piecewise polynomials on adaptive partition. The execution of the algorithms
does not require knowledge of the smoothness or margin conditions. Besov
smoothness conditions are weaker than the commonly used H\""{o}lder conditions,
which govern approximation by nonadaptive partitions, and therefore for a given
regression function can result in a higher rate of convergence. This in turn
mitigates the compatibility conflict between smoothness and margin parameters.

simulations of isolated galaxies. The simulations include heating and cooling
of the ISM, self--gravity and stellar feedback. Over timescales $<5$ Myr most
clouds undergo no change, and mergers and splits are found to be typically two
body processes, but evolution over longer timescales is more complex and
involves a greater fraction of intercloud material. We find that mergers, or
collisions, occur every 8-10 Myr (1/15th of an orbit) in a simulation with
spiral arms, and once every 28 Myr (1/5th of an orbit) with no imposed spiral
arms. Both figures are higher than expected from analytic estimates, as clouds
are not uniformly distributed in the galaxy. Thus clouds can be expected to
undergo between zero and a few collisions over their lifetime. We present
specific examples of cloud--cloud interactions in our results, including
synthetic CO maps. We would expect cloud--cloud interactions to be observable,
but find they appear to have little or no impact on the ISM. Due to a
combination of the clouds' typical geometries, and moderate velocity
dispersions, cloud--cloud interactions often better resemble a smaller cloud
nudging a larger cloud. Our findings are consistent with the view that spiral
arms make little difference to overall star formation rates in galaxies, and we
see no evidence that collisions likely produce massive clusters. However, to
confirm the outcome of such massive cloud collisions we ideally need higher
resolution simulations.

ELMs and the ELM cycle. The observed radiative effects paradoxically imply
acceleration of electrons parallel to the magnetic field combined with rapid
acquisition of perpendicular momentum. It is shown that this paradox can be
resolved by the action of the anomalous Doppler instability which enables fast
collective radiative relaxation, in the perpendicular direction, of electrons
accelerated in the parallel direction by inductive electric fields generated by
the initial ELM instability.

first detailed adaptation of concurrent separation logic to a multithreaded

permission with each heap location, ensuring exclusive write accesses and
ruling out data races. Concurrent reads are supported through fractional
permissions. Permissions can be transferred between threads upon thread
starting, thread joining, initial monitor entrancies and final monitor exits.
In order to distinguish between initial monitor entrancies and monitor
reentrancies, auxiliary variables keep track of multisets of currently held
monitors. Data abstraction and behavioral subtyping are facilitated through
abstract predicates, which are also used to represent monitor invariants,
preconditions for thread starting and postconditions for thread joining.
Value-parametrized types allow to conveniently capture common strong global
invariants, like static object ownership relations. The program logic is
presented for a model language with Java-like classes and interfaces, the
soundness of the program logic is proven, and a number of illustrative examples

for very short spacings between the change-points and/or very small jump
magnitudes, unlike standard binary segmentation. On the other hand, despite its
use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span
parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational
complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS:
one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the `strengthened
Schwarz information criterion'. We provide default recommended values of the
parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical
performance in comparison with the state of the art. The WBS methodology is

useful tool for handling large matrices. One limitation with the existing
algorithms for CUR matrix decomposition is that they need an access to the {\it

applications. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR
decomposition algorithm for partially observed matrices. In particular, the
proposed algorithm computes the low rank approximation of the target matrix
based on (i) the randomly sampled rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of
observed entries that are randomly sampled from the matrix. Our analysis shows
the relative error bound, measured by spectral norm, for the proposed algorithm
when the target matrix is of full rank. We also show that only $O(n r\ln r)$
observed entries are needed by the proposed algorithm to perfectly recover a
rank $r$ matrix of size $n\times n$, which improves the sample complexity of
the existing algorithms for matrix completion. Empirical studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

basic problem of generating an efficient hardware implementation of a single
threaded program, in particular, that of an inner loop. We describe a
control-flow mechanism which provides dynamic loop-pipelining capability in
hardware, so that multiple iterations of an arbitrary inner loop can be made
simultaneously active in the generated hardware, We study the impact of this
loop-pipelining scheme in conjunction with source-level loop-unrolling. In
particular, we apply this technique to some common loop kernels: regular
kernels such as the fast-fourier transform and matrix multiplication, as well
as an example of an inner loop whose body has branching. The resulting
resulting hardware descriptions are synthesized to an FPGA target, and then
characterized for performance and resource utilization. We observe that the use
of dynamic loop-pipelining mechanism alone typically results in a significant
improvements in the performance of the hardware. If the loop is statically
unrolled and if loop-pipelining is applied to the unrolled program, then the
performance improvement is still substantial. When dynamic loop pipelining is
used in conjunction with static loop unrolling, the improvement in performance
ranges from 6X to 20X (in terms of number of clock cycles needed for the
computation) across the loop kernels that we have studied. These optimizations
do have a hardware overhead, but, in spite of this, we observe that the joint
use of these loop optimizations not only improves performance, but also the
performance/cost ratio of the resulting hardware.

streams diverging away from the magnetic dipole axis, and forming
azimuthally-structured fan-shaped beams. It is shown that this geometry,
successfully tested on profiles with bifurcated features, naturally solves
several classical pulsar problems and avoids some difficulties of the
traditional nested cone/core model. This is best visible for profiles with
several components, such as those of class T, Q and M, because they most
clearly exhibit a range of effects previously interpreted within the conal
model. In particular, with no reference to the flaring boundary of the polar
magnetic flux tube, the stream model explains the apparent radius-to-frequency
mapping (RFM), including its reduced strength for the inner pair of components.
The lag of the central component (apparent `core') with respect to the
centroids of the flanking (`conal') components can also be naturally explained
with no reference to emission rings located at disparate altitudes. The stream
model also reveals why the millisecond pulsars, despite their more strongly
flaring magnetic field lines, do not exhibit as strong RFM as the normal
pulsars. The model is then successful in reproducing properties of so disparate
objects as the M-class and millisecond pulsars, including some peculiarities of
the latter. With no hesitation we, therefore, advance the view that pulsars
have fan beams generated by outflowing streams, whereas the nested cone/core
beams may well not exist at all.

density is perhaps the most diagnostic quantity. We aim here to characterize
the surface composition, mutual orbit, size, mass, and density of the small
main-belt binary asteroid (939) Isberga. For that, we conduct a suite of
multi-technique observations, including optical lightcurves over many epochs,
near-infrared spectroscopy, and interferometry in the thermal infrared. We
develop a simple geometric model of binary systems to analyze the
interferometric data in combination with the results of the lightcurve
modeling. From spectroscopy, we classify Ibserga as a Sq-type asteroid,
consistent with the albedo of 0.14$^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ (all uncertainties are
reported as 3-$\sigma$ range) we determine (average albedo of S-types is 0.197
$\pm$ 0.153, Pravec et al., 2012, Icarus 221, 365-387). Lightcurve analysis
reveals that the mutual orbit has a period of 26.6304 $\pm$ 0.0001 h, is close
to circular, and has pole coordinates within 7 deg. of (225, +86) in ECJ2000,
implying a low obliquity of 1.5 deg. The combined analysis of lightcurves and
interferometric data allows us to determine the dimension of the system and we
find volume-equivalent diameters of 12.4$^{+2.5}_{-1.2}$ km and
3.6$^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$ km for Isberga and its satellite, circling each other on a
33 km wide orbit. Their density is assumed equal and found to be
$2.91^{+1.72}_{-2.01}$ g.cm$^{-3}$, lower than that of the associated ordinary
chondrite meteorites, suggesting the presence of some macroporosity, but
typical of S-types of the same size range (Carry, 2012, P\&SS 73, 98-118). The
present study is the first direct measurement of the size of a small main-belt
binary. Although the interferometric observations of Isberga are at the edge of

non-zero probability of being exactly equal to zero. By varying the degree of
parsimony our model can accommodate constant parameters, an unknown number of

separated by approximately half a rotation, and these are non-coincident with
the observed radio and X-ray peaks. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray
emission originates in a part of the magnetosphere distinct from where the
radio and X-ray radiation is generated. Thus far, three different methods have
been applied to constrain the viewing geometry of pulsar A (its inclination and
observer angles $\alpha$ and $\zeta$): geometric modelling of the radio and
$\gamma$-ray light curves, modelling of the position angle sweep in phase seen
in the radio polarisation data, and independent studies of the time evolution
of the radio pulse profile of pulsar A. These three independent, complementary
methods have yielded consistent results: pulsar A's rotation axis is likely
perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, and its magnetic axis
close to lying in the orbital plane (making this pulsar an orthogonal rotator).
The observer is furthermore observing emission close to the magnetic axis. Thus
far, however, current models could not reproduce all the characteristics of the
radio and $\gamma$-ray light curves, specifically the large radio-to-$\gamma$
phase lag. In this paper we discuss some preliminary modelling attempts to
address this problem, and offer ideas on how the LC fits may be improved by
adapting the standard geometric models in order to reproduce the profile
positions more accurately.

They range from relatively tame integral currents representing oriented compact
manifolds with boundary and integer multiplicities, to arbitrary elements of
the dual space of differential forms. The flat norm provides a natural distance
in the space of currents, and works by decomposing a $d$-dimensional current
into $d$- and (the boundary of) $(d+1)$-dimensional pieces in an optimal way.
  Given an integral current, can we expect its flat norm decomposition to be
integral as well? This is not known in general, except in the case of
$d$-currents that are boundaries of $(d+1)$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$
(following results from a corresponding problem on the $L^1$ total variation
($L^1$TV) of functionals). On the other hand, for a discretized flat norm on a
finite simplicial complex, the analogous statement holds even when the inputs
are not boundaries. This simplicial version relies on the total unimodularity
of the boundary matrix of the simplicial complex -- a result distinct from the
$L^1$TV approach.
  We develop an analysis framework that extends the result in the simplicial
setting to one for $d$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, provided a suitable
triangulation result holds. In $\mathbb{R}^2$, we use a triangulation result of
Shewchuk (bounding both the size and location of small angles), and apply the
framework to show that the discrete result implies the continuous result for
$1$-currents in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

on the sub-Eddington regime to address the fundamental plane of black hole
activity. The results do not change substantially with regard to previous work
ensuring that the details of the accretion physics are not relevant in the
magnetic reconnection process occurring in the corona. Rather our work puts
fast magnetic reconnection events as a powerful mechanism operating in the core
region, near the jet base of black hole sources on more solid ground. For
microquasars and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) the observed
correlation between radio emission and mass of the sources can be explained by
this process. The corresponding gamma-ray emission also seems to be produced in
the same core region. On the other hand, the emission from blazars and
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) cannot be correlated to core emission based on fast
reconnection.

  In space dimensions up to $n=5$, we establish uniform a priori estimates for
weak solutions of ($P_\lambda$) when $\lambda>0$ is bounded away from $0$. This

that the projection of ${\cal C}$ onto the $\lambda$-axis is an interval of the
form $[0,a]$ for some $a>0$ and that the continuum ${\cal C}$ bifurcates from

The only
analytical model of the fluctuation dynamo, due to Kazantsev, assumes the
velocity to be delta-correlated in time. This assumption breaks down for any
realistic turbulent flow. We generalize the analytic model of fluctuation
dynamo to include the effects of a finite correlation time, $\tau$, using
renewing flows. The generalized evolution equation for the longitudinal
correlation function $M_L$ leads to the standard Kazantsev equation in the
$\tau \to 0$ limit, and extends it to the next order in $\tau$. We find that
this evolution equation involves also third and fourth spatial derivatives of
$M_L$, indicating that the evolution for finite $\tau$ will be non-local in
general. In the perturbative case of small-$\tau$ (or small Strouhl number), it
can be recast using the Landau-Lifschitz approach, to one with at most second
derivatives of $M_L$. Using both a scaling solution and the WKBJ approximation,
we show that the dynamo growth rate is reduced when the correlation time is
finite. Interestingly, to leading order in $\tau$, we show that the magnetic
power spectrum, preserves the Kazantsev form, $M(k) \propto k^{3/2}$, in the
large $k$ limit, independent of $\tau$.

joint law is unknown, the long-standing problem of supervised classification
aims to \textit{optimally} predict the label $Y$ of a given a new observation
$X$. In this context, the nearest neighbor rule is a popular flexible and
intuitive method in non-parametric situations.
  Even if this algorithm is commonly used in the machine learning and
statistics communities, less is known about its prediction ability in general
finite dimensional spaces, especially when the support of the density of the
observations is $\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper is devoted to the study of the
statistical properties of the nearest neighbor rule in various situations. In
particular, attention is paid to the marginal law of $X$, as well as the
smoothness and margin properties of the \textit{regression function} $\eta(X) =
\mathbb{E}[Y | X]$. We identify two necessary and sufficient conditions to
obtain uniform consistency rates of classification and to derive sharp
estimates in the case of the nearest neighbor rule. Some numerical experiments
are proposed at the end of the paper to help illustrate the discussion.

Solar-Flare Apparatus (MiSolFA) is a proposed compact X-ray detector which will
address the two biggest issues in solar flare modeling. Dynamic range
limitations prevent simultaneous spectroscopy with a single instrument of all
X-ray emitting regions of a flare. In addition, most X-ray observations so far
are inconsistent with the high anisotropy predicted by the models usually
adopted for solar flares. Operated at the same time as the STIX instrument of
the ESA Solar Orbiter mission, at the next solar maximum (2020), they will have
the unique opportunity to look at the same flare from two different directions:
Solar Orbiter gets very close to the Sun with significant orbital inclination;
MiSolFA is in a near-Earth orbit. To solve the cross-calibration problems
affecting all previous attempts to combine data from different satellites,
MiSolFA will adopt the same photon detectors as STIX, precisely quantifying the
anisotropy of the X-ray emission for the first time. By selecting flares whose
footpoints (the brightest X-ray sources, at the chromosphere) are occulted by
the solar limb for one of the two detectors, the other will be able to study
the much fainter coronal emission, obtaining for the first time simultaneous

diffusion of antimicrobial resistance in pathogen outbreaks. The most frequent
cause of human infection is Escherichia coli, which is dominated by sequence
type 131 (ST131), a set of rapidly radiating pandemic clones. The highly
infectious clades of ST131 originated firstly by a mutation enhancing virulence
and adhesion. Secondly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred enabling
fluoroquinolone-resistance, which is near-fixed in all ST131. Thirdly, broader
resistance through beta-lactamases has been gained and lost frequently,
symptomatic of conflicting environmental selective effects. This flexible
approach to gene exchange is worrying and supports the proposition that ST131
will develop an even wider range of plasmid and chromosomal elements promoting
antimicrobial resistance. To stymie ST131, deep genome sequencing is required
to understand the origin, evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance
genes. Phylogenetic methods that decipher past events can predict future
patterns of virulence and transmission based on genetic signatures of
adaptation and gene exchange. Both the effect of partial antimicrobial exposure
and cell dormancy caused by variation in gene expression may accelerate the
development of resistance. High-throughput sequencing can decode measurable
evolution of cell populations within patients associated with systems-wide
changes in gene expression during treatments. A multi-faceted approach can
enhance assessment of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli ST131 by examining
transmission dynamics between hosts to achieve a goal of pre-empting resistance
before it emerges by optimising antimicrobial treatment protocols.

ring-opening polymerization and Pt is a well known catalyst surface. We study
here the energetics of the ring-opening of lactide on a surface that has a high
density of kink atoms. These sites are expected to be present on a realistic Pt
surface and show enhanced catalytic activity. The use of a naturally chiral
surface also enables us to study potential chiral selectivity effects of the
reaction at the same time. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with a
functional that includes the van der Waals forces in a first-principles manner,
we find modest adsorption energies of around 1.4 eV for the pristine molecule
and different ring-opened states. The energy barrier to be overcome in the
ring-opening reaction is found to be very small at 0.32 eV and 0.30 eV for LL-
and its chiral partner DD-lactide, respectively. These energies are much
smaller than the activation energy for a dehydrogenation reaction of 0.78 eV.
Our results thus indicate that (a) ring-opening reactions of lactide on Pt(321)
can be expected already at very low temperatures and Pt might be a very
effective catalyst for this reaction; (b) the ring-opening reaction rate shows
noticeable enantioselectivity.

computations and their dependencies by an application graph. This graph is
first partitioned into (nearly) equally sized blocks. These blocks need to
communicate at block boundaries. To assign the processes to PEs, our goal is to
compute a communication-efficient bijective mapping between the blocks and the
PEs.
  This approach of partitioning followed by bijective mapping has many degrees
of freedom. Thus, users and developers of parallel applications need to know
more about which choices work for which application graphs and which parallel
architectures. To this end, we not only develop new mapping algorithms (derived
from known greedy methods). We also perform extensive experiments involving
different classes of application graphs (meshes and complex networks),
architectures of parallel computers (grids and tori), as well as different
partitioners and mapping algorithms. Surprisingly, the quality of the
partitions, unless very poor, has little influence on the quality of the
mapping.
  More importantly, one of our new mapping algorithms always yields the best
results in terms of the quality measure maximum congestion when the application
graphs are complex networks. In case of meshes as application graphs, this
mapping algorithm always leads in terms of maximum congestion AND maximum
dilation, another common quality measure.

natural to ask whether the total derivatives make any essential contribution to
the entropy or they can be totally ignored. In this note we analyze this

surprisingly, in all cases that we consider the total derivatives produce
non-trivial contributions to the entropy. Some of them are non-vanishing even

$\rho$ mass. The combined glue components contribute $\sim 40 - 50\%$ for both
mesons. It is interesting to observe that the quark mass contribution to the
mass of the vector meson is almost linear in quark mass over a large quark mass
region below the charm quark mass. For heavy mesons, the quark mass term
dominates the masses, while the contribution from the glue components is about
$400\sim500$ MeV for the heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons. The charmonium

resolve the emission surrounding both nuclei and conclude that is mostly
synchrotron in nature. The spatial distributions of radio emission in both
nuclei are well described by exponential profiles. These have deconvolved
half-light radii of 51 and 35 pc for the eastern and western nuclei, and they
match the number density profile of radio supernovae observed with very long

cosmic rays electrons caused by the presence of a strong (~ mG) magnetic field

  As a consequence of our result, we find that for some $\beta > 0$,

lattices by means of a quantum cellular automata evolution. We do this by first
introducing a class of discrete noisy dynamics, in the first excitation sector,
in which a wide group of classical stochastic dynamics is embedded within the
more general formalism of quantum operations. We then extend the Hilbert space
of the system to accommodate a global vacuum state, thus allowing for the
transport of initial on-site coherences besides excitations, and determine the
dynamical constraints that define the class of noisy quantum cellular automata
in this subspace. We then study the transport performance through numerical
simulations, showing that for some instances of the dynamics perfect quantum
state transfer is attainable. Our approach provides one with a natural
description of both unitary and open quantum evolutions, where the homogeneity
and locality of interactions allow one to take into account several forms of
quantum noise in a plausible scenario.

superconducting gap equations present a complex set of solutions. For weak
interband couplings, chiral configurations are only attained in a narrow strip
of the in-plane magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram. This strip of
chiral states becomes narrower and disappears at low temperatures, giving way
to a first-order transition between non-chiral superconducting states. For
stronger interband couplings, the chiral strip is much broader, if the
interband couplings are approximately equal; otherwise, the chiral region is
expected to be completely absent of the phase diagram.

Little","Simple approximate MAP Inference for Dirichlet processes","11 pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian
nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this
model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques
such as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which
have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which
computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they
would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware,
where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop
simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP)
inference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means
clustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring
only a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance
asymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the ""rich get
richer"" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate
closed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to
be used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the
probabilistic DPM model.

light of new insights. Over time these changes can result in an imperfect
tracking of taxonomic perspectives through the re-/use of Code-compliant or
informal names. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel approach
for aligning taxonomies through the interaction of human experts and logic
reasoners. We explore the performance of this approach with the Perelleschus
use case of Franz & Cardona-Duque (2013). The use case includes six taxonomies
published from 1936 to 2013, 54 taxonomic concepts (i.e., circumscriptions of
names individuated according to their respective source publications), and 75
expert-asserted Region Connection Calculus articulations (e.g., congruence,
proper inclusion, overlap, or exclusion). An Open Source reasoning toolkit is
used to analyze 13 paired Perelleschus taxonomy alignments under heterogeneous
constraints and interpretations. The reasoning workflow optimizes the logical
consistency and expressiveness of the input and infers the set of maximally
informative relations among the entailed taxonomic concepts. The latter are
then used to produce merge visualizations that represent all congruent and
non-congruent taxonomic elements among the aligned input trees. In this small
use case with 6-53 input concepts per alignment, the information gained through
the reasoning process is on average one order of magnitude greater than in the
input. The approach offers scalable solutions for tracking provenance among
succeeding taxonomic perspectives that may have differential biases in naming
conventions, phylogenetic resolution, ingroup and outgroup sampling, or
ostensive (member-referencing) versus intensional (property-referencing)
concepts and articulations.

dense core in the Cyg OB 7 molecular cloud. The core has an extraordinarily
large mass ($\sim1.1 \times 10^4$ $M_\odot$) and size ($\sim2 \times 5$
pc$^2$), but there is no massive young star forming therein. We observed this
core in various molecular lines such as C$^{18}$O($J=1-0$) using the 45m
telescope at Nobeyama Radio Observatory. We find that the core has an elongated
morphology consisting of several filaments and core-like structures. The
filaments are massive ($10^2-10^3$ $M_\odot$), and they are apparently
colliding against each other. Some candidates of YSOs are distributed around
their intersection, suggesting that the collisions of the filaments may have
influenced on their formation. To understand the formation and evolution of
such colliding filaments, we performed numerical simulations using the adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) technique adopting the observed core parameters (e.g.,
the mass and size) as the initial conditions. Results indicate that the
filaments are formed as seen in other earlier simulations for small cores in
literature, but we could not reproduce the collisions of the filaments simply
by assuming the large initial mass and size. We find that the collisions of the
filaments occur only when there is a large velocity gradient in the initial
core in a sense to compress it. We suggest that the observed core was actually
compressed by an external effect, e.g., shocks of nearby supernova remnants
including HB21 which has been suggested to be interacting with the Cyg OB 7
molecular cloud.

As a paradigmatic example, we consider a harmonic oscillator initially prepared
in a maximally nonclassical state, e.g. a Fock number state or a Schroedinger
cat-like state, and then coupled to either resonant or non-resonant external
field. Stochastic modeling allows us to describe the decoherence dynamics
without resorting to approximated quantum master equations, and to introduce
non- Markovian effects in a controlled way. A detailed comparison among
different nonclassicality criteria and a thorough analysis of the decoherence
time reveal a rich phenomenology whose main features may be summarized as
follows: i) classical memory effects increase the survival time of quantum
coherence; ii) a detuning between the natural frequency of the system and the
central frequency of the classical field induces revivals of quantum coherence.

spreading a rumour in a graph $G$, works as follows. Independent Poisson clocks
of rate 1 are associated with the vertices of $G$. Initially, one vertex of $G$
knows the rumour. Whenever the clock of a vertex $x$ rings, it calls a random
neighbour $y$: if $x$ knows the rumour and $y$ does not, then $x$ tells $y$ the
rumour (a push operation), and if $x$ does not know the rumour and $y$ knows
it, $y$ tells $x$ the rumour (a pull operation). The average spread time of $G$
is the expected time it takes for all vertices to know the rumour, and the
guaranteed spread time of $G$ is the smallest time $t$ such that with
probability at least $1-1/n$, after time $t$ all vertices know the rumour. The
synchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at
times $1,2,\dots$, has been studied extensively. We prove the following results
for any $n$-vertex graph: In either version, the average spread time is at most
linear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed spread time
is within a logarithmic factor of the average spread time, so it is $O(n\log
n)$. In the asynchronous version, both the average and guaranteed spread times
are $\Omega(\log n)$. We give examples of graphs illustrating that these bounds
are best possible up to constant factors. We also prove theoretical
relationships between the guaranteed spread times in the two versions. Firstly,
in all graphs the guaranteed spread time in the asynchronous version is within
an $O(\log n)$ factor of that in the synchronous version, and this is tight.
Next, we find examples of graphs whose asynchronous spread times are
logarithmic, but the synchronous versions are polynomially large. Finally, we
show for any graph that the ratio of the synchronous spread time to the
asynchronous spread time is $O(n^{2/3})$.

in the Minkowski and Lobachevsky spaces. Separating the variables in the frame
of the matrix 10-component Duffin-Kemer-Petiau approach (wave equation) and
making a nonrelativistic approximation in the corresponding radial equations, a
system of three coupled second order linear differential equations is derived
for each type of geometry. For the Minkowski space, the nonrelativistic
equations are disconnected using a linear transformation, which makes the
mixing matrix diagonal. The resultant three unconnected equations involve three
routs of a cubic algebraic equation as parameters. The approach allows
extension to the case of additional external spherically symmetric fields. The
Coulomb and oscillator potentials are considered and for each of these cases
three series of energy spectra are derived. A special attention is given to the
states with minimum value of the total angular momentum. In the case of the
curved background of the Lobachevsky geometry, the mentioned linear
transformation does not disconnect the nonrelativistic equations in the
presence of the monopole. Nevertheless, we derive the solution of the problem
in the case of minimum total angular momentum. In this case, we additionally
involve a Coulomb or oscillator field. Finally, considering the case without
the monopole field, we show that for both Coulomb and oscillator potentials the
problem is reduced to a system of three differential equations involving a
hypergeometric and two general Heun equations. Imposing on the parameters of
the latter equations a specific requirement, reasonable from the physical
standpoint, we derive the corresponding energy spectra.

non-overlapping communities, i.e. disjoint clusters, so that there is higher
density within clusters than across clusters. Both the intra- and inter-cluster
edge densities vanish when the size of the graph grows large, making the
cluster reconstruction problem nosier and hence difficult to solve. We are
interested in scenarios where the network size is very large, so that the
adjacency matrix of the graph is hard to manipulate and store. The data stream
model in which columns of the adjacency matrix are revealed sequentially
constitutes a natural framework in this setting. For this model, we develop two
novel clustering algorithms that extract the clusters asymptotically
accurately. The first algorithm is {\it offline}, as it needs to store and keep
the assignments of nodes to clusters, and requires a memory that scales
linearly with the network size. The second algorithm is {\it online}, as it may
classify a node when the corresponding column is revealed and then discard this
information. This algorithm requires a memory growing sub-linearly with the
network size. To construct these efficient streaming memory-limited clustering
algorithms, we first address the problem of clustering with partial
information, where only a small proportion of the columns of the adjacency
matrix is observed and develop, for this setting, a new spectral algorithm
which is of independent interest.

definition and argued that the attainment of communicative competence is

competencies, but also by a variety of psychosocial factors (e.g., motivation,
attitude, confidence, resilience) as well as by barriers and supports in the

Therefore, recently there has been increased interest in the problem of

Motivated by this model, the TextLuas system provides an implementation for
tracking these dynamic clusters and visualizing their evolution using a metro
