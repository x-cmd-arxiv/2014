equations that gave rise to the concept of a flag system and illustrate these
with the Cartan criterion for Monge equations (1st order) as well as the Cartan
statement concerning the local equivalence of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations
(2nd order). Next, we describe a prolongation functor operating on the
infinitesimal symmetries (automorphisms) of the Darboux flag and extending
these, isomorphically, to all the symmetries of any other flag. Hence, flag
systems cannot be distinguished by their symmetry algebras and the local
classification of these objects is approached by considering higher order
isotropies of these algebras as well as the groupoids of $k-th$ order formal
equivalences since the differential equations defining the latter provide
precious information for the application of flag systems to differential
equations (\textit{e.g.}, Cartan's criterion for non-linear Monge equations).
In examining the behaviour of the isotropy algebras, that can either diminish
or remain the same, when passing from a derived system $S_\nu$ to the previous
system $S_{\nu-1}$, we obtain a full set of numerical invariants for the
elementary flag systems that moreover specify the local models.

depart in an online fashion and repacking of previously packed items is
allowed. The goal is, of course, to minimize both the number of bins used as
well as the amount of repacking. A recently introduced way of measuring the
repacking costs at each timestep is the migration factor, defined as the total
size of repacked items divided by the size of an arriving or departing item.
Concerning the trade-off between number of bins and migration factor, if we
wish to achieve an asymptotic competitive ration of $1 + \epsilon$ for the
number of bins, a relatively simple argument proves a lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for the migration factor. We establish a nearly
matching upper bound of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}^4 \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ using
a new dynamic rounding technique and new ideas to handle small items in a
dynamic setting such that no amortization is needed. The running time of our
algorithm is polynomial in the number of items $n$ and in $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
The previous best trade-off was for an asymptotic competitive ratio of
$\frac{5}{4}$ for the bins (rather than $1+\epsilon$) and needed an amortized

engineering, biology and other disciplines. We focus on non-linear models
containing a set of parameters governing their dynamics. The value of these
parameters is often unknown and not directly observable through measurements,
which are themselves noisy. When treating parameters as random variables, one
can constrain their distribution by conditioning on observations and thereby
constructing a posterior probability distribution. We aim to perform model
verification with respect to this posterior. The main difficulty in performing
verification on a model under the posterior distribution is that in general, it
is difficult to obtain \emph{independent} samples from the posterior,
especially for non-linear dynamical models. Standard statistical model checking
methods require independent realizations of the system and are therefore not
applicable in this context.
  We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo based statistical model checking
framework, which produces a sequence of dependent random realizations of the
model dynamics over the parameter posterior. Using this sequence of samples, we
use statistical hypothesis tests to verify whether the model satisfies a
bounded temporal logic property with a certain probability. We use sample size
bounds tailored to the setting of dependent samples for fixed sample size and
sequential tests. We apply our method to a case-study from the domain of
systems biology, to a model of the JAK-STAT biochemical pathway. The pathway is
modeled as a system of non-linear ODEs containing a set of unknown parameters.
Noisy, indirect observations of the system state are available from an
experiment. The results show that the proposed method enables probabilistic
verification with respect to the parameter posterior with specified error
bounds.

implies the quantization of the volume. In the one-sided case it implies that
the manifold decomposes into a disconnected sum of spheres which will represent
quanta of geometry. The two sided version in dimension 4 predicts the two
algebras M_2(H) and M_4(C) which are the algebraic constituents of the Standard

Lagrangian of gravity coupled with the Standard Model. We show that any

distributional properties like recurrence relation for pmf, cumulative

description of dense fluids and the liquid-glass transition. MCT, however, is
limited by its ad hoc construction and lacks a mechanism to institute
corrections. We use recent results from a new theoretical framework--developed
from first principles via a self-consistent perturbation expansion in terms of
an effective two-body potential--to numerically explore the kinetics of systems
of classical particles, specifically hard spheres obeying Smoluchowski
dynamics. We present here a full solution to the kinetic equation governing the
density-density time correlation function and show that the function exhibits
the characteristic two-step decay of supercooled fluids and an
ergodic-nonergodic transition to a dynamically-arrested state. Unlike many
previous numerical studies and experiments, we have access to the full time and
wavenumber range of the correlation function and can track the solution
unprecedentedly close to the transition, covering nearly 15 decades of time.
Using asymptotic approximation techniques developed for MCT, we fit the
solution to predicted forms and extract critical parameters. Our solution shows
a transition at packing fraction $\eta^*=0.60149761(10)$--consistent with
previous static solutions under this theory and with comparable colloidal
suspension experiments--and the behavior in the $\beta$-relaxation regime is
fit to power-law decays with critical exponents $a=0.375(3)$ and $b=0.8887(4)$,
and with $\lambda=0.5587(18)$. For the $\alpha$-relaxation of the ergodic
phase, we find a power-law divergence of the time scale $\tau_{\alpha}$ as we
approach the transition. Through these results, we establish that this new
theory is able to reproduce the salient features of MCT, but has the advantages
of a first principles derivation and a clear mechanism for making systematic
improvements.

proposed scheme, we have two identical atoms, both initially in their ground
state, each incident on far apart cavities with particular initial momenta. The
two cavities are prepared initially in superposition of zero and one photon
state. First, we interact each atom with a cavity in dispersive way. The
interaction results into atom-field entangled state. Then we perform EPR state
measurement on both atomic momenta state which is an analog of Bell
measurement. The EPR state measurement is designed by passing the atoms through
cavity beam splitters which transfers the atomic momentum state into
superposition state. Finally, these atoms are detected by the detector. After
the detection of the atoms, we can distinguish that cavities in one of the Bell
states. This process leads to two distant cavity fields entanglement.

fundamental questions in distributed computing. In its simplest formulation,
the task is as follows: given $n$ processors, all participants must eventually
return a win or lose indication, such that a single contender may win. Despite
a considerable amount of work on leader election, the following question is
still open: can we elect a leader in an asynchronous fault-prone system faster
than just running a $\Theta(\log n)$-time tournament, against a strong adaptive
adversary?
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative, improving on a
decades-old upper bound. We introduce two new algorithmic ideas to reduce the
time complexity of electing a leader to $O(\log^* n)$, using $O(n^2)$
point-to-point messages. A non-trivial application of our algorithm is a new
upper bound for the tight renaming problem, assigning $n$ items to the $n$
participants in expected $O(\log^2 n)$ time and $O(n^2)$ messages. We
complement our results with lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ messages for solving
these two problems, closing the question of their message complexity.

transverse velocities of the jets, while ground-based spectra sample their
Doppler velocities. Together these yield full three-dimensional space
velocities. Aside from HH 666, their identification as outflows was previously
inferred only from morphology in images. Proper motions now show decisively
that these objects are indeed jets, and confirm that the intermediate-mass
protostars identified as the candidate driving sources for HH 666 and HH 1066
are indeed the origin of these outflows. The appearance of two new knots in the
HH 1066 jet suggest recent (~35 yr) changes in the accretion rate, underscoring
the variable nature of accretion and outflow in the formation of
intermediate-mass stars. In fact, kinematics and mass-ejection histories for
all the jets suggest highly episodic mass loss, and point toward pronounced
accretion fluctuations. Overall, we measure velocities similar to those found
for low-mass protostars. However, the HH jets in Carina have higher densities
and are more massive than their low-mass counterparts. Coarse estimates suggest
that the heavy jets of intermediate-mass protostars can compete with or even
exceed inject ~10 or more times the cumulative momentum injection of lower-mass

(ETS) events. The sources of this non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are largely
unknown. We have developed a model describing the mechanism of NTV generation.
According to this model, NTV is a reflection of resonant-type oscillations
excited in a fault at certain depth ranges. From a mathematical viewpoint,
tremor (phonons) and slip pulses (solitons) are two different solutions of the
sine-Gordon equation describing frictional processes inside a fault. In an ETS
event, a moving slip pulse generates tremor due to interaction with structural
heterogeneities in a fault and to failures of small asperities. Observed tremor
parameters, such as central frequency and frequency attenuation curve, are
associated with fault parameters and conditions, such as elastic modulus,
effective normal stress, penetration hardness and friction. Model prediction of
NTV frequency content is consistent with observations. In the framework of this
model it is possible to explain the complicated pattern of tremor migration,
including rapid tremor propagation and reverse tremor migration. Migration
along the strike direction is associated with movement of the slip pulse. Rapid
tremor propagation in the slip-parallel direction is associated with movement
of kinks along a 2D slip pulse. A slip pulse, pinned in some places, can
fragment into several pulses, causing tremor associated with some of these
pulse fragments to move opposite to the main propagation direction. The model
predicts that the frequency content of tremor during an ETS event is slightly
different from the frequency content of ambient tremor and tremor triggered by
earthquakes.

ellipse (p-ellipse) approximations to orbits of low-to-moderate eccentricity in
power-law potentials. Here I explore several extensions of these approximations
to improve accuracy, especially for nearly radial orbits. 1) It is found that
moderately improved orbital fits can be achieved with higher order perturbation
expansions (in eccentricity), with the addition of `harmonic' terms to the
solution. 2) Alternately, a matching of the extreme radial excursions of an
orbit can be imposed, and a more accurate estimate of the eccentricity
parameter is obtained. However, the error in the precession frequency is
usually increased. 3) A correction function of small magnitude corrects the
frequency problem. With this correction, even first order approximations yield
excellent fits at quite high eccentricity over a range of potential indices
that includes flat and falling rotation curve cases. 4) Adding a first harmonic
term to fit the breadth of the orbital loops, and determining the fundamental
and harmonic coefficients by matching to three orbital positions further
improves the fit. With a couple of additional small corrections one obtains
excellent fits to orbits with radial ranges of more than a thousand for some
potentials.
  These simple corrections to the basic p-ellipse are basically in the form of
several successive approximations, and can provide high accuracy. They suggest
new results including that the apsidal precession rate scales approximately as
$log(1-e)$ at very high eccentricities $e$. New insights are also provided on
the occurrence of periodic orbits in various potentials, especially at high
eccentricity.

the compactified cotangent bundle of a smooth projective curve of an arbitrary
genus. In this quantization, the Hitchin spectral curve of a rank $2$
meromorphic Higgs bundle on the base curve corresponds to a quantum curve,
which is a Rees $D$-module on the base. The topological recursion then gives an
all-order asymptotic expansion of its solution, thus determining a state vector
corresponding to the spectral curve as a meromorphic Lagrangian. We establish a
generalization of the topological recursion for a singular spectral curve. We
show that the partial differential equation version of the topological
recursion automatically selects the normal ordering of the canonical

objects are characterized by very red 24 \micron\ to 70 \micron\ colors and
prominent submillimeter emission, suggesting that they are very young Class 0
protostars embedded in dense envelopes. We detect all of the PBRS in 2.9 mm
continuum emission and emission from 4 protostars and 1 starless core in the
fields toward the PBRS; we also report 1 new PBRS source. The ratio of 2.9 mm
luminosity to bolometric luminosity is higher by a factor of $\sim$5 on
average, compared to other well-studied protostars in the Perseus and Ophiuchus
clouds. The 2.9 mm visibility amplitudes for 6 of the 14 PBRS are very flat as
a function of uv-distance, with more than 50\% of the source emission arising
from radii $<$ 1500 AU. These flat visibility amplitudes are most consistent
with spherically symmetric envelope density profiles with
$\rho$~$\propto$~R$^{-2.5}$. Alternatively, there could be a massive unresolved
structure like a disk or a high-density inner envelope departing from a smooth
power-law. The large amount of mass on scales $<$ 1500 AU (implying high
average central densities) leads us to suggest that that the PBRS with flat
visibility amplitude profiles are the youngest PBRS and may be undergoing a
brief phase of high mass infall/accretion and are possibly among the youngest
Class 0 protostars. The PBRS with more rapidly declining visibility amplitudes
still have large envelope masses, but could be slightly more evolved.

regime is a fundamental problem of modern physics. Previously we developed a
model based on the well-known Frenkel-Kontorova model to describe dry
macroscopic friction. Here this model has been modified to include the effect
of dissipation in derived relations between the kinematic and dynamic
parameters of a transition process. The main (somewhat counterintuitive) result
is a demonstration that the rupture (i.e. detachment front) velocity of the
slip pulse which arises during the transition does not depend on friction. The
only parameter (besides the elastic and plastic properties of the medium)
controlling the rupture velocity is the shear to normal stress ratio. In
contrast to the rupture velocity, the slip velocity does depend on friction.
The model we have developed describes these processes over a wide range of
rupture and slip velocities (up to 7 orders of magnitude) allowing, in
particular, the consideration of seismic events ranging from regular
earthquakes, with rupture velocities on the order of a few km/s, to slow slip
events, with rupture velocities of a few km/day.

optimal in predicting fixations. This lack in performance has been attributed
to an inability to model the influence of high-level image features such as
objects. Recent seminal advances in applying deep neural networks to tasks like
object recognition suggests that they are able to capture this kind of
structure. However, the enormous amount of training data necessary to train
these networks makes them difficult to apply directly to saliency prediction.
We present a novel way of reusing existing neural networks that have been
pretrained on the task of object recognition in models of fixation prediction.
Using the well-known network of Krizhevsky et al. (2012), we come up with a new
saliency model that significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models on
the MIT Saliency Benchmark. We show that the structure of this network allows
new insights in the psychophysics of fixation selection and potentially their
neural implementation. To train our network, we build on recent work on the
modeling of saliency as point processes.

address a new possible operation condition for TWTs based on the super
synchronism between an electron beam and four modes exhibiting a degeneracy
condition near a band edge of the periodic slowwave MTL. We show a
phenomenological change in the band structure of periodic MTL where we observe
at least two growing modal cooperating solutions as opposed to a uniform MTL
interacting with an electron beam where there is rigorously only one growing

in TWTs that leads to larger gain conditions in amplifier regimes and also to
very lowstarting beam current in high power oscillators.

find that the host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are irregular, compact dwarf
galaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. The UV-derived SFR
densities are high (<Sigma_SFR> ~ 0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that SLSNe
form in overdense environments. Their locations trace the UV light of their
host galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regions
of their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normal
core-collapse SNe), though cannot be statistically distinguished from either

SLSN progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinary
core-collapse SNe to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies as
do LGRBs. If the tendency for SLSNe to be less clustered on the brightest

light $({t_0})$, and hence the rise-time $({t_{rise}})$ from first light to
peak luminosity, and the exponent of the power-law rise ($n$). We find a mean
uncorrected rise time of $18.98 {\pm} 0.54$ days, with individual SN rise-times
ranging from $15.98$ to $24.7$ days. The exponent n shows significant
departures from the simple 'fireball model' of $n = 2$ (or ${f(t) \propto
t^2}$) usually assumed in the literature. With a mean value of $n = 2.44 {\pm}
0.13$, our data also show significant diversity from event to event. This
deviation has implications for the distribution of 56Ni throughout the SN
ejecta, with a higher index suggesting a lesser degree of 56Ni mixing. The
range of n found also confirms that the 56Ni distribution is not standard
throughout the population of SNe Ia, in agreement with earlier work measuring
such abundances through spectral modelling. We also show that the duration of
the very early light curve, before the luminosity has reached half of its
maximal value, does not correlate with the light curve shape or stretch used to
standardise SNe Ia in cosmological applications. This has implications for the
cosmological fitting of SN Ia light curves.

~ 90 distinct objects/events for which the distance is well established, and
hence the peak luminosity can be accurately estimated. For each event we
measure this peak and compare it to the rise and decay timescales, as fit by
exponential functions, which allows us in turn to estimate a minimum brightness
temperature for all the events. The astrophysical objects from which the flares
originate vary from flare stars to supermassive black holes in active galactic
nuclei, and include both repeating phenomena and single cataclysmic events
(such as supernovae and gamma ray burst afterglows). The measured timescales
vary from minutes to longer than years, and the peak radio luminosities range
over 22 orders of magnitude. Despite very different underlying phenomena,
including relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, and highly collimated
versus isotropic phenomena, we find a broad correlation between peak radio
luminosity and rise/decay timescales, approximately of the form L ~ t^5. This
rather unexpectedly demonstrates that the estimated minimum brightness
temperature, when based upon variability timescales, and with no attempt to
correct for relativistic boosting, is a strongly rising function of source
luminosity. It furthermore demonstrates that variability timescales could be
used as an early diagnostic of source class in future radio transient surveys.
As an illustration of radio transients parameter space, we compare the
synchrotron events with coherent bursts at higher brightness temperatures to
illustrate which regions of radio transient parameter space have been explored.

quantum Hall state. But the significant controversy surrounding the nature of
the $\nu = 5/2$ state has been hampered by the fact that the competition
between these and other states is affected by small parameter changes. To study
the phase diagram of the $\nu = 5/2$ state we numerically diagonalize a
comprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall
effect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. The
effective Hamiltonian takes Landau level mixing into account to lowest-order
perturbatively in $\kappa$, the ratio of the Coulomb energy scale to the
cyclotron gap. We also incorporate non-zero width $w$ of the quantum well and
sub-band mixing. We find the ground state in both the torus and spherical
geometries as a function of $\kappa$ and $w$. To sort out the non-trivial
competition between candidate ground states we analyze the following 4
criteria: its overlap with trial wave functions; the magnitude of energy gaps;
the sign of the expectation value of an order parameter for particle-hole
symmetry breaking; and the entanglement spectrum. We conclude that the ground
state is in the universality class of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state, rather
than the anti-Pfaffian, for $\kappa < {\kappa_c}(w)$, where ${\kappa_c}(w)$ is
a $w$-dependent critical value $0.6 \lesssim{\kappa_c}(w)\lesssim 1$. We
observe that both Landau level mixing and non-zero width suppress the
excitation gap, but Landau level mixing has a larger effect in this regard. Our
findings have important implications for the identification of non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall states.

progressively blurred by the recent discoveries of several extended star
clusters, with size (20-30 pc) and luminosity (-6 < Mv < -2) comparable to the
one of faint dwarf spheroidals. In order to explain their sparse structure, it
has been suggested that they formed as star clusters in dwarf galaxy satellites
that later accreted onto the Milky Way. If these clusters form in the centre of
dwarf galaxies, they evolve in a tidally-compressive environment where the
contribution of the tides to the virial balance can become significant, and
lead to a super-virial state and subsequent expansion of the cluster, once
removed. Using N-body simulations, we show that a cluster formed in such an
extreme environment undergoes a sizable expansion, during the drastic variation
of the external tidal field due to the accretion process. However, we show that
the expansion due to the removal of the compressive tides is not enough to
explain the observed extended structure, since the stellar systems resulting
from this process are always more compact than the corresponding clusters that
expand in isolation due to two-body relaxation. We conclude that an accreted
origin of extended globular clusters is unlikely to explain their large spatial
extent, and rather favor the hypothesis that such clusters are already extended
at the stage of their formation.

matter over-predicts the numbers of satellite galaxies, as well as the dark
matter (DM) densities in galactic centers. This apparent lack of structure at
small scales can be accounted for if one postulates neutrino-DM and DM-DM
interactions mediated by light O(MeV) force carriers. In this letter, we
consider a simple, consistent model of neutrinophilic DM with these features
where DM and a ""secluded"" SM-singlet neutrino species are charged under a new
$U(1)$ gauge symmetry. An important ingredient of this model is that the
secluded sector couples to the Standard Model fields only through neutrino
mixing. We observe that the secluded and active neutrinos recouple, leading to
a large relic secluded neutrino population. This relic population can prevent
small-scale halos from collapsing, while at same time significantly modifying
the optical depth of ultra-high-energy neutrinos recently observed at Icecube.
We find that the bulk of the parameter space accommodating an (a)symmetric
thermal relic has potentially observable consequences for the IceCube high
energy signal, with some of the parameter ranges already ruled out by the
existing data. Future data may confirm this mechanism if either spectral
absorption features or correlations with nearby sources are observed.

sources, yet modern spectroscopic surveys are limited to ~few x $10^6$ targets.
As we approach the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) era, new algorithmic
solutions are required to cope with the data deluge. Here we report the
development of a machine-learning framework capable of inferring fundamental
stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [Fe/H]) using photometric-brightness
variations and color alone. A training set is constructed from a systematic
spectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec/MMT. In sum, the training set
includes ~9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using the
SEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest
algorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts Teff, log g, and
[Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our final, optimized model
produces a cross-validated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex,
and 0.33 dex for Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of
sources for which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces to
125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievable
via low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable stars this represents a ~12-20%
improvement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch photometric
colors. As an application of our method, we estimate stellar parameters for
~54,000 known variables. We argue that this method may convert photometric
time-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic engines, enabling the
construction of extremely detailed maps of the Milky Way, its structure, and

with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data. We take
advantage of high-precision BAO measurements from galaxy clustering and the
Ly-alpha forest (LyaF) in the BOSS survey of SDSS-III. BAO data alone yield a
high confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the CMB
angular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. Combining BAO
and SN data into an ""inverse distance ladder"" yields a 1.7% measurement of
$H_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This measurement assumes standard pre-recombination
physics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,
so agreement with CMB-based estimates that assume a flat LCDM cosmology is an
important corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. For open LCDM, our
BAO+SN+CMB combination yields $\Omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature
$\Omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. When we allow more general forms of evolving dark
energy, the BAO+SN+CMB parameter constraints remain consistent with flat LCDM.
While the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the LyaF BAO
measurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.
Models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at high
redshifts remain consistent with our constraints. Expansion history alone
yields an upper limit of 0.56 eV on the summed mass of neutrino species,
improving to 0.26 eV if we include Planck CMB lensing. Standard dark energy
models constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that is
high compared to most, but not all, observational estimates. (Abridged)

separated by 0.65"" (3500 AU) from the (rare) vibrationally-excited SiO masers,
excited by the deeply-embedded YSO W51-North. This excludes that the two maser

originate at the same sky position as a peak in a submm line of SO2 imaged with

addition, the thermal emission from the most highly excited ammonia lines,

circumbinary disk surrounding (at least) two high-mass YSOs, W51-North
(exciting the SiO masers) and a nearby companion (exciting the ammonia masers),
separated by 3500 AU. This finding indicates a physical connection (in a

homogeneous (generally anisotropic) universe is described as a quantum gravity
condensate of ""atoms of space,"" which allows the derivation of an effective
cosmological Friedmann equation from the microscopic quantum gravity dynamics.
Here we take a first step towards the study of cosmological perturbations over
the homogeneous background. We consider a state in which a single ""atom"" is
added to an otherwise homogeneous condensate. Backreaction of the perturbation
on the background is negligible and the background dynamics can be solved
separately. The dynamics for the perturbation takes the form of a quantum
cosmology Hamiltonian for a ""wave function,"" depending on background and
perturbations, of the product form usually assumed in a Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. We show that the perturbation we consider corresponds to a
spatially homogeneous metric perturbation, and for this case derive the usual
procedures in quantum cosmology from fundamental quantum gravity.

breakdown of superconductivity. This work is concerned with the identification
of the region where superconductivity persists, in a thin shell superconductor
modeled by a compact surface $\mathcal M\subset\mathbb R^3$, as the intensity
$h$ of the external magnetic field is raised above $H_{c1}$. Using a mean field
reduction approach devised by Sandier and Serfaty as the Ginzburg-Landau
parameter $\kappa$ goes to infinity, we are led to studying a two-sided
obstacle problem. We show that superconductivity survives in a neighborhood of
size $(H_{c1}/h)^{1/3}$ of the zero locus of the normal component $H$ of the
field. We also describe intermediate regimes, focusing first on a symmetric
model problem. In the general case, we prove that a striking phenomenon we call
freezing of the boundary takes place: one component of the superconductivity
region is insensitive to small changes in the field.

The code calculates spectra from 3D, 2D or 1D atmospheric models on a

the cores of very strong lines in an inhomogeneous environment, it is
nevertheless suitable for a large range of scenarios and allows for faster
convergence with finer control over the iteration of each simulation column.
The code scales well to at least tens of thousands of CPU cores, and is

asteroseismic data were selected to map various evolutionary stages and stellar
masses. Seismic evolutionary tracks were then drawn with the combination of the
frequency and period spacings. We measured the asymptotic period spacing for
more than 1170 stars at various evolutionary stages. This allows us to monitor
stellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch and
draw seismic evolutionary tracks. We present clear quantified asteroseismic
definitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, in
particular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giant
branch, and the end of the horizontal branch.The seismic information is so
precise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models.
The quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling,
especially for studying the energy transport in the helium-burning core or for
specifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giant
branches. Modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to be
in the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting the

a small fraction of its entries. A series of recent works [KOM12,JNS13,HW14]
have proposed fast non-convex optimization based iterative algorithms to solve
this problem. However, the sample complexity in all these results is
sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and the desired
accuracy.
  In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that solves the matrix
completion problem by observing $O(nr^5 \log^3 n)$ entries, which is
independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time of
our algorithm is $O(nr^7\log^3 n\log 1/\epsilon)$ which is near linear in the
dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near
linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity
(i.e. independent of $\epsilon$).
  Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient descent method,
where the projection is onto the (non-convex) set of low rank matrices. There
are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a $\ell_{\infty}$
norm potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel
way to obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural
extension of the Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best
low rank approximation of matrices with good eigen-gap. Both of these ideas may
be of independent interest.

non-convex in the entries of the kernel matrix, and this learning problem is
conjectured to be NP-hard. Thus, previous work has instead focused on more
restricted convex learning settings: learning only a single weight for each row

fixed kernel matrices. In this work we propose a novel algorithm for learning
the full kernel matrix. By changing the kernel parameterization from matrix
entries to eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then lower-bounding the likelihood
in the manner of expectation-maximization algorithms, we obtain an effective
optimization procedure. We test our method on a real-world product

all the emission is concentrated within 100"" of the galactic center, produced
almost exclusively by three nuclear sources, an off-nuclear ultraluminous X-ray
source (ULX), and a pulsar candidate that we identify for the first time in
these observations. We detect 21 distinct sources in energy bands up to 25 keV,
mostly consisting of intermediate state black hole X-ray binaries. The global
X-ray emission of the galaxy - dominated by the off-nuclear ULX and nuclear
sources, which are also likely ULXs - falls steeply (photon index >~ 3) above
10 keV, consistent with other NuSTAR-observed ULXs, and no significant excess
above the background is detected at E > 40 keV. We report upper limits on
diffuse inverse Compton emission for a range of spatial models. For the most
extended morphologies considered, these hard X-ray constraints disfavor a
dominant inverse Compton component to explain the {\gamma}-ray emission
detected with Fermi and H.E.S.S. If NGC 253 is typical of starburst galaxies at
higher redshift, their contribution to the E > 10 keV cosmic X-ray background

components is the aggregate of the interactions that occur through different
mechanisms or layers. Recent studies reveal that the existence of multiple
interaction layers can have a dramatic impact in the dynamical processes
occurring on these systems. However, these studies assume that the interactions
between systems components in each one of the layers are known, while typically
for real-world systems we do not have that information. Here, we address the
issue of uncovering the different interaction layers from aggregate data by
introducing multilayer stochastic block models (SBMs), a generalization of
single-layer SBMs that considers different mechanisms of layer aggregation.
First, we find the complete probabilistic solution to the problem of finding
the optimal multilayer SBM for a given aggregate observed network. Because this
solution is computationally intractable, we propose an approximation that
enables us to verify that multilayer SBMs are more predictive of network
structure in real-world complex systems.

that it possesses an IR stable fixed point at imaginary couplings which can be
reached by flow from a nearby fixed point describing a pair of $N=0$ theories.
We calculate certain operator scaling dimensions at the IR fixed point of the

  Planning",,,,,"cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One important challenge for a set of agents to achieve more efficient
collaboration is for these agents to maintain proper models of each other. An
important aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial
and incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models:
MDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many
applications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt.
While it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for
learning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability
models, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning
capability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning,
and the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan
execution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of
incompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP
based and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\em
abstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability
models are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g.,
robot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore,
when used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately),
capability models provide flexible abstraction of actions. The limitation,
however, is that the synthesized plan is incomplete and abstract.

the class of radio relics. It has been found that this radio relic has a rather
flat integrated spectrum at low frequencies that would imply an injection
spectral index for the electrons that is inconsistent with the flattest allowed
by the test particle diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We performed new
high-frequency observations at 2273, 2640, and 4850 MHz. Combining these new
observations with images available in the literature, we constrain the radio
integrated spectrum of the radio relic in Abell 2256 over the widest sampled
frequency range collected so far for this class of objects (63 -10450 MHz).
Moreover, we used X-ray observations of the cluster to check the temperature
structure in the regions around the radio relic. We find that the relic keeps
an unusually flat behavior up to high frequencies. Although the relic
integrated spectrum between 63 and 10450 MHz is not inconsistent with a single
power law with $\alpha_{63}^{10450}= 0.92\pm 0.02$, we find hints of a
steepening at frequencies > 1400 MHz. The two frequency ranges 63-1369 MHz and
1369-10450 MHz are, indeed, best represented by two different power laws, with
$\alpha_{63}^{1369}= 0.85\pm 0.01$ and $\alpha_{1369}^{10450}= 1.00\pm 0.02$.
This broken power law would require special conditions to be explained in terms
of test-particle DSA, e.g., non-stationarity of the spectrum and/or
non-stationarity of the shock. On the other hand, the single power law would
make of this relic the one with the flattest integrated spectrum known so far,
even flatter than what allowed in the test-particle approach to DSA. We find a
rather low temperature ratio of $T_2/T_1 \sim 1.7$ across the G region of the
radio relic and no temperature jump across the H region.

evolution of small gravitational aggregates under the influence of the YORP

centrifugally driven reconfigurations of aggregates can alter the YORP torque
dramatically, resulting in spin evolution that can differ qualitatively from
the rigid-body prediction. One third of our simulations follow a simple
evolution described as a modified YORP cycle. Two-thirds exhibit one or more of
three distinct behaviors---stochastic YORP, self-governed YORP, and stagnating
YORP---which together result in YORP self-limitation. Self-limitation confines
rotation rates of evolving aggregates to far narrower ranges than those
expected in the classical YORP cycle, greatly prolonging the times over which
objects can preserve their sense of rotation. Simulated objects are initially
randomly packed, disordered aggregates of identical spheres in rotating
equilibrium, with low internal angles of friction. Their shape evolution is
characterized by rearrangement of the entire body, including the deep interior.
They do not evolve to axisymmetric top shapes with equatorial ridges. Mass loss
occurs in one-third of the simulations, typically in small amounts from the
ends of a prolate-triaxial body. We conjecture that YORP self-limitation may
inhibit formation of top-shapes, binaries, or both, by restricting the amount
of angular momentum that can be imparted to a deformable body. Stochastic YORP,
in particular, will affect the evolution of collisional families whose orbits
drift apart under the influence of Yarkovsky forces, in observable ways.

continuum theory, which occurs for sufficiently large non-degeneracy, is
continuously connected to the Aoki phase found in the lattice theory with
degenerate quarks. Both for the Aoki and first-order scenarios, this results in
a critical surface along which at least one of the pions is massless. In the

linear programs (LPs) across computer science, operations research, and
optimization. In 1993, Luby and Nisan constructed an iterative algorithm for
approximately solving PC-LPs in nearly linear time, where the time complexity
scales nearly linearly in $N$, the number of nonzero entries of the matrix, and
polynomially in $\varepsilon$, the (multiplicative) approximation error.
Unfortunately, all existing nearly linear-time algorithms for solving PC-LPs
require time at least proportional to $\varepsilon^{-2}$.
  In this paper, we break this longstanding barrier by designing a packing
solver that runs in time $\tilde{O}(N \varepsilon^{-1})$ and covering LP solver
that runs in time $\tilde{O}(N \varepsilon^{-1.5})$. Our packing solver can be
extended to run in time $\tilde{O}(N \varepsilon^{-1})$ for a class of
well-behaved covering programs. In a follow-up work, Wang et al. showed that
all covering LPs can be converted into well-behaved ones by a reduction that
blows up the problem size only logarithmically.
  At high level, these two algorithms can be described as linear couplings of
several first-order descent steps. This is an application of our linear
coupling technique to problems that are not amenable to blackbox applications

operators. It is shown that CLR allows two of four supercharges of the
continuum theory to preserve while a naive lattice model can realize one
supercharge at the most. A striking feature of our lattice model is that there
are no quantum corrections to potential terms in any finite order of

theories in the continuum. It turns out that CLR plays a crucial role in the
proof of the non-renormalization theorem. This result suggests that CLR grasps

red giant, for which few close-in planets have been discovered. Our global
analysis involves spectroscopic and asteroseismic determinations of stellar
parameters (e.g., mass and radius) and radial velocity (RV) measurements. Our
analyses reveal that KOI-977 is indeed a red giant in the red clump, but its
estimated radius ($\gtrsim 20R_\odot=0.093$ AU) is much larger than
KOI-977.01's orbital distance ($\sim 0.027$ AU) estimated from its period
($P_\mathrm{orb}\sim 1.35$ days) and host star's mass. RV measurements show a
small variation, which also contradicts the amplitude of ellipsoidal variations
seen in the light-curve folded with KOI-977.01's period. Therefore, we conclude
that KOI-977.01 is a false positive, meaning that the red giant, for which we
measured the radius and RVs, is different from the object that produces the
transit-like signal (i.e., an eclipsing binary). On the basis of this
assumption, we also perform a light-curve analysis including the modeling of
transits/eclipses and phase-curve variations, adopting various values for the
dilution factor $D$, which is defined as the flux ratio between the red giant
and eclipsing binary. Fitting the whole folded light-curve as well as
individual transits in the short cadence data simultaneously, we find that the
estimated mass and radius ratios of the eclipsing binary are consistent with
those of a solar-type star and a late-type star (e.g., an M dwarf) for

X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 and the persistent ""Sco-like"" Z source GX 17+2.
These two components were studied based on the state-resolved spectra. We found
that the frequencies of XTE J1701-462 lie on the known correlations (WK and
PBK), showing consistency with other types of X-ray binaries (black holes,
atoll sources and millisecond X-ray pulsars). However, GX 17+2 is shifted from
the WK correlation like other typical Z sources. We suggest that the WK/PBK
main track forms a boundary which separates persistent sources from transient
sources. The characteristic frequencies of break and HBO are independent of
accretion rate in both sources, although it depends on spectral models. We also
report the energy dependence of the HBO and break frequencies in XTE J1701-462
and how the temporal properties change with spectral state in XTE J1701-462 and
GX 17+2. We studied the correlation between rms at the break and the HBO
frequency. We suggest that HBO and break components for both sources probably
arise from a similar physical mechanism: Comptonization emission from the
corona. These two components could be caused by same kind of oscillation in a
corona who with uneven density, and they could be generated from different
areas of corona. We further suggest that different proportions of the
Comptonization component in the total flux cause the different distribution
between GX 17+2 and XTE J1701-462 in the $rms_{\rm{break}}$-$rms_{\rm{HBO}}$
diagram.

convolution of the initial density power spectrum with itself, multiplied by a
mode-coupling kernel. We also derive the bispectrum expected in this theory

stars, supernovae, and black holes, but these processes are among the least
understood aspects of galaxy formation theory. We present an analytic galaxy
evolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observed
galaxy scaling relations. The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for
star-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on
the ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows,
outflows, and star formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain
approach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations
between stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from
0<z<2. A good fit (chi^2~1.6) is achieved with eight free parameters. We
further show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also
produces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties.
The resulting best-fit parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic
outflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak
dependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that
evolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar
mass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations
to z~6. Our results suggest that this simple analytic framework captures the
basic physical processes required to model the mean evolution of stars and
metals in galaxies, despite not incorporating many canonical ingredients of
galaxy formation models such as merging or disk formation.

network coding (PNC) with q-level pulse amplitude modulation (q-PAM) in two-way
relay channels (TWRC). A critical issue is how the PNC system performs when the
received powers from the two users at the relay are imbalanced. In particular,
how would the PNC system perform under slight power imbalance that is
inevitable in practice, even when power control is applied? To answer these
questions, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of q-PAM PNC. Our
contributions are as follows: 1) We give a systematic way to obtain the
analytical relationship between the minimum distance of the signal
constellation induced by the superimposed signals of the two users (a key
performance determining factor) and the channel-gain ratio of the two users,
for all q. In particular, we show how the minimum distance changes in a
piecewise linear fashion as the channel-gain ratio varies. 2) We show that the
performance of q-PAM PNC is highly sensitive to imbalanced received powers from
the two users at the relay, even when the power imbalance is slight (e.g., the
residual power imbalance in a power-controlled system). This sensitivity
problem is exacerbated as q increases, calling into question the robustness of
high-order modulated PNC. 3) We propose an asynchronized PNC system in which
the symbol arrival times of the two users at the relay are deliberately made to
be asynchronous. We show that such asynchronized PNC, when operated with a
belief propagation (BP) decoder, can remove the sensitivity problem, allowing a
robust high-order modulated PNC system to be built.

differential equations (ODEs) involving some unknown parameters. Typically
analytical solution of the ODEs is not available, and hence likelihood
evaluation at many parameter values by numerical solution of equations may be
computationally prohibitive. Bhaumik and Ghosal (2015) considered a Bayesian
two-step approach by embedding the model in a larger nonparametric regression
model, where a prior is put through a random series based on B-spline basis
functions. A posterior on the parameter is induced from the regression function
by minimizing an integrated weighted squared distance between the derivative of
the regression function and the derivative suggested by the ODEs. Although this
approach is computationally fast, the Bayes estimator is not asymptotically
efficient. In this paper we suggest a modification of the two-step method by
directly considering the distance between the function in the nonparametric
model and that obtained from a four stage Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. We also
study the asymptotic behavior of the posterior distribution of the parameter
based on an approximate likelihood obtained from an RK4 numerical solution of
the ODEs. We establish a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both methods which
assures that Bayesian uncertainty quantification matches with the frequentist
one and the Bayes estimator is asymptotically efficient.

been proposed. One of the best popular methods is the Bradley-Terry model in
which the ranking of a set of objects is decided by the maximum likelihood
estimates (MLEs) of merits parameters. However, the existence of MLE for the
Bradley-Terry model and its generalized models to allow for tied observation or
home-field advantage or both to occur, crucially depends on the strong
connection condition on the directed graph constructed by a win-loss matrix.
When this condition fails, the MLE does not exist and hence there is no
solution of ranking. In this paper, we propose an improved version of the
$\varepsilon$ singular perturbation proposed by Conner and Grant (2000), to
address this problem and extend it to the generalized Bradley-Terry models.
Some necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of
the penalized MLEs for these generalized Bradley-Terry-$\varepsilon$ models are
derived. Numerical studies show that the ranking is robust to the different
$\varepsilon$. We apply the proposed methods to the data of the 2008 NFL

at the cosmic source $W_e,W_\mu,W_\tau$ evolve to flavor ratios at Earthly
detectors $w_e,w_\mu,w_\tau$ according to $\vec{w}=\mathscr{P} \vec{W}$. The
unitary constraint reduces the Euclidean octant to a ""flavor triangle"". We
prove a theorem that the area of the Earthly flavor triangle is proportional to
Det$(\mathscr{P})$. One more constraint would further reduce the dimensionality
of the flavor triangle at Earth (two) to a line (one). We discuss four
motivated such constraints. The first is the possibility of a vanishing
determinant for $\mathscr{P}$. We give a formula for a unique
$\delta(\theta_{ij}$'s) that yields the vanishing determinant. Next we consider
the thinness of the Earthly flavor triangle. We relate this thinness to the
small deviations of the two angles $\theta_{32}$ and $\theta_{13}$ from maximal
mixing and zero, respectively. Then we consider the confusion resulting from
the tau neutrino decay topologies, which are showers at low energy,
""double-bang"" showers in the PeV range, and a mixture of showers and tracks at
even higher energies. We examine the simple low-energy regime, where there are
just two topologies, $w_{\rm shower}=w_e+w_\tau$ and $w_{\rm track}=w_\mu$. We
apply the statistical uncertainty to be expected from IceCube to this model.
Finally, we consider ramifications of the expected lack of $\nu_\tau$ injection
at cosmic sources. In particular, this constraint reduces the Earthly triangle
to a boundary line of the triangle. Some tests of this ""no $\nu_\tau$

employ a nanofabrication technique based on Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to
define graphene nanoribbons with nanometer precision and well-defined
crystallographic edge orientations. While armchair ribbons display quantum
confinement gap, zigzag ribbons narrower than 7 nm reveal a bandgap of about
0.2 - 0.3 eV, which can be identified as a signature of interaction induced
spin ordering along their edges. Moreover, a semiconductor to metal transition
is revealed upon increasing the ribbon width, indicating the switching of the
magnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from antiferromagnetic to

closely related bacterial isolates to estimate the relative rate of
recombination to mutation for that bacterial species. We consider such an
approach which uses single-locus variants: pairs of isolates whose DNA differ
at a single gene locus. One way of deriving point estimates for the relative
rate of recombination to mutation from such data is to use composite likelihood
methods. We extend recent work in this area so as to be able to construct
confidence intervals for our estimates, without needing to resort to
computationally-intensive bootstrap procedures, and to develop a test for
whether the relative rate varies across loci. Both our test and method for
constructing confidence intervals are obtained by modeling the dependence
structure in the data, and then applying asymptotic theory regarding the
distribution of estimators obtained using a composite likelihood. We applied
these methods to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data from eight bacteria,
finding strong evidence for considerable rate variation in three of these:
Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

wavelength division multiplexed systems by considering the pulse collision
dynamics in the time domain. The fundamental interactions can be classified as
two-pulse, three-pulse, or four-pulse collisions and they can be either
complete, or incomplete. Each type of collision is shown to have its unique
signature and the overall nature of NLIN is determined by the relative
importance of the various classes of pulse collisions in a given WDM system.
The pulse-collision picture provides qualitative and quantitative insight into
the character of NLIN, offering a simple and intuitive explanation to all of
the reported and previously unexplained phenomena. In particular, we show that
the most important contributions to NLIN follow from two-pulse and four-pulse
collisions. While the contribution of two-pulse collisions is in the form of
phase-noise and polarization-state-rotation with strong dependence on
modulation format, four-pulse collisions generate complex circular noise whose
variance is independent of modulation format. In addition, two-pulse collisions
are strongest when the collision is complete, whereas four-pulse collisions are
strongest when the collision is incomplete. We show that two-pulse collisions
dominate the formation of NLIN in short links with lumped amplification, or in
links with distributed amplification extending over arbitrary length. In long
links using lumped amplification the relative significance of four-pulse
collisions increases, emphasizing the circularity of the NLIN while reducing
its dependence on modulation format.

opers defined on pointed stable curves in arbitrary characteristic and their
moduli. In particular, it includes the development of the study of dormant
opers, which are opers of a certain sort in positive characteristic. The theory
of dormant opers (or more generally, opers in positive characteristic) on
pointed stable curves, which has proved to be rather rich and deep, was born in
the work of S. Mochizuki, who developed the theory for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-opers
and used it to establish $p$-adic Teichm\""{u}ller theory. Some parts of
Mochizuki's work were later extended in the case of proper smooth curves by K.
Joshi, C. Pauly, and other mathematicians. This manuscript represents an
advance in the theory of opers that takes the subject beyond the work of
Mochizuki, Joshi, and Pauly. In particular, we provide general unified
formulations and the basics of principal bundles and connections defined on
families of pointed stable curves. The notion of an oper is accordingly
introduced in the context of logarithmic algebraic geometry. Some of the
results can be regarded as generalizations of results obtained in the
fundamental work on the geometric Langlands program developed by A. Beilinson
and V. Drinfeld. We also describe various properties and assertions about
(dormant) opers, such as duality, comparison with differential operators, and
compactification of the moduli space. Our goal is to give an explicit formula,
conjectured by Joshi, for the generic number of dormant
$\mathfrak{sl}_n$-opers. We do so by obtaining a detailed understanding of the
moduli space of dormant opers and computing the Gromov-Witten invariants for
Quot-schemes in characteristic zero. This formula reveals an interaction
between studies in $p$-adic Teichm\""{u}ller theory and certain areas of
mathematics, including Gromov-Witten theory.

problem. When the state space is finite, the latter consists in finding an
eigenpair $(u,\lambda)$ solution of $T(u)=\lambda \mathbf{1} + u$ where
$T:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is the Shapley (dynamic programming)
operator, $\lambda$ is a scalar, $\mathbf{1}$ is the unit vector, and $u \in
\mathbb{R}^n$. The scalar $\lambda$ yields the mean payoff per time unit, and
the vector $u$, called the bias, allows one to determine optimal stationary
strategies. The existence of the eigenpair $(u,\lambda)$ is generally related
to ergodicity conditions. A basic issue is to understand for which classes of
games the bias vector is unique (up to an additive constant). In this paper, we
consider perfect information zero-sum stochastic games with finite state and
action spaces, thinking of the transition payments as variable parameters,
transition probabilities being fixed. We identify structural conditions on the
support of the transition probabilities which guarantee that the spectral
problem is solvable for all values of the transition payments. Then, we show
that the bias vector, thought of as a function of the transition payments, is
generically unique (up to an additive constant). The proof uses techniques of
max-plus (tropical) algebra and nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory.

pre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of emission. In fact, that
expression has the ""of order"" sign instead of the equality. In general, in this
kind of leading order tunnelling calculations, the exponent arises indeed from
the classical action and the pre-factor is an order Planck constant correction.
But in the case of emissions of Hawking quanta, the variation of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is order 1 for an emitted particle having energy of
order the Hawking temperature. As a consequence, the exponent in the Parikh and
Wilczek probability of emission is order unity and one asks what is the real
significance of that scaling if the pre-factor is unknown. Here we solve the
problem assuming the unitarity of the black hole (BH) quantum evaporation and
considering the natural correspondence between Hawking radiation and
quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of excited BHs, in a ""Bohr-like model"" that we
recently discussed in a series of papers. In that papers, QNMs are interpreted
as natural BH quantum levels (the ""electron states"" in the ""Bohr-like model"").
Here we find the intriguing result that, although in general it is well
approximated by 1, the pre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of
emission depends on the BH quantum level n. We also write down an elegant
expression of the probability of emission in terms of the BH quantum levels.

guaranteeing peak-covariance stability described by an inequality in terms of
the spectral radius of the system matrix and transition probabilities of the
Markov chain. We further show that that condition can be interpreted using a
linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. Next, we prove that the
peak-covariance stability implies mean-square stability, if the system matrix
has no defective eigenvalues on the unit circle. This connection between the
two stability notions holds for any random packet drop process. We prove that
there exists a critical curve in the failure-recovery rate plane, below which
the Kalman filter is mean-square stable and no longer mean-square stable above,
via a coupling method in stochastic processes. Finally, a lower bound for this
critical failure rate is obtained making use of the relationship we establish

resulting in a qualitative change of the entire stability diagram, suggesting
this setup as a promising platform to identify MBS. Our calculations are based
on a nonequilibrium Green's function description and is exact when Coulomb
interactions on the QD can be neglected. In addition, we develop a simple
pictorial view of the involved transport processes, which is equivalent to a
description in terms of multiple Andreev reflections, but provides an
alternative way to understand the role of the QD level in enhancing transport
for certain gate and bias voltages. We believe that this description will be
useful in future studies of interacting QDs coupled to superconducting leads

shaping as a shell with a total mass of $\sim2\times10^{4}$ $M_{\odot}$. It is
likely assembled during the expansion of the bubble. The expanding shell
consists of six dense cores. Their dense (a few of $10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and
massive (a few of $10^{3}$ $M_{\odot}$) characteristics coupled with the broad

high-mass stars or clusters. This could be further consolidated by the
detection of compact HII regions in Cores A and E. We tentatively identified
and classified 63 candidate YSOs based on the \emph{Spitzer} and UKIDSS data.
They are found to be dominantly distributed in regions with strong emission of
molecular gas, indicative of active star formation especially in the shell. The
HII region inside the bubble is mainly ionized by a $\sim$O8V star(s), of the

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and strongly coupled Bose-Einstein-condensate
(BEC) limits are among the most fascinating objects to study the behavior of an
assembly of strongly interacting particles. The physics of this crossover has
been of considerable interest both in the fields of condensed matter and
ultracold atoms. One of the most challenging issue in this regime is the effect
of large spin imbalance on a Fermi system under magnetic fields. Although
several exotic physical properties have been predicted theoretically, the
experimental realization of such an unusual superconducting state has not been
achieved so far. Here we show that pure single crystals of superconducting FeSe
offer the possibility to enter the previously unexplored realm where the three
energies, Fermi energy $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$, superconducting gap $\Delta$ and
Zeeman energy, become comparable. Through the superfluid response, transport,
thermoelectric response, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling
microscopy, we demonstrate that $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$ of FeSe is extremely
small, with the ratio $\Delta/\varepsilon_{\rm F}\sim1 (\sim0.3)$ in the
electron (hole) band. Moreover, thermal-conductivity measurements give evidence
of a distinct phase line below the upper critical field, where the Zeeman
energy becomes comparable to $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$ and $\Delta$. The
observation of this field-induced phase provides insights into previously
poorly understood aspects of the highly spin-polarized Fermi liquid in the

macroscopic coherence vanishes, leaving behind droplets of thermally
fluctuating Cooper pair. This superconducting fluctuation effect above $T_c$
has been investigated for many decades and its influence on the transport,
thermoelectric and thermodynamic quantities in most superconductors is well
understood by the standard Gaussian fluctuation theories. The transverse
thermoelectric (Nernst) effect is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations,
and the large Nernst signal found in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped
high-$T_c$ cuprates has raised much debate on its connection to the origin of
superconductivity. Here we report on the observation of a colossal Nernst
signal due to the superconducting fluctuations in the heavy-fermion
superconductor URu$_2$Si$_2$. The Nernst coefficient is enhanced by as large as
one million times over the theoretically expected value within the standard
framework of superconducting fluctuations. This, for the first time in any
known material, results in a sizeable thermomagnetic figure of merit
approaching unity. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the
enhancement in the Nernst signal is more significant with the reduction of the
impurity scattering rate. This anomalous Nernst effect intimately reflects the
highly unusual superconducting state embedded in the so-called hidden-order
phase of URu$_2$Si$_2$. The results invoke possible chiral or Berry-phase
fluctuations originated from the topological aspect of this superconductor,
which are associated with the effective magnetic field intrinsically induced by
broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter.

photonic quasicrystals have attracted strong interest for their specific
behaviour, induced by the particular spectral properties, in light transport,
plasmonic and laser action. Very recently, one of the most salient spectral
feature of quasicrystals, namely the gap labelling, has been observed for a
polariton gas confined in a one dimensional quasi-periodic cavity. This
experimental result confirms a theory which is now very complete in dimension
one. In dimension greater than one, the theory is very far from being complete.
Furthermore, some intriguing phenomena, like the existence of self-similar
eigenmodes can occur. All this makes two dimensional experimental realisations
and numerical simulations pertinent and attractive. Here, we report on
measurements and energy-scaling analysis of the gap labelling and the spatial

understanding of nuclear structure. Effective single-particle energies (ESPEs)
introduced by French and Baranger represent the most appropriate tool to relate
many-body observables to a single-nucleon shell structure. As briefly discussed
in [T. Duguet, G. Hagen, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 85}, 034330 (2012)], the dependence
of ESPEs on one-nucleon transfer probability matrices makes them purely
theoretical quantities that ""run"" with the non-observable resolution scale
$\lambda$ employed in the calculation. Given that ESPEs provide a way to
interpret the many-body problem in terms of simpler theoretical ingredients,
the goal is to specify the terms, i.e. the exact sense and conditions, in which
this interpretation can be conducted meaningfully. State-of-the-art
multi-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group and self-consistent
Gorkov Green's function many-body calculations are employed to corroborate the
formal analysis. This is done by comparing the behavior of several observables
and of non-observable ESPEs (and spectroscopic factors) under (quasi) unitary
similarity renormalization group transformations of the Hamiltonian
parameterized by the resolution scale $\lambda$. The non-observable nature of
the nuclear shell structure, i.e. the fact that it constitutes an intrinsically
theoretical object with no counterpart in the empirical world, must be
recognized and assimilated. Eventually, practitioners can refer to nuclear
shells and spectroscopic factors in their analyses of nuclear phenomena if, and
only if, they use consistent structure and reaction theoretical schemes based
on a fixed resolution scale they have agreed on prior to performing their
analysis and comparisons.

a Milky Way-like halo with a semi-analytic approach, based on Monte-Carlo
sampling of dark matter merger trees, combined with a treatment of the most
important feedback mechanisms. Assuming a logarithmically flat Pop III IMF and
varying its low mass limit, we derive the number of expected survivors of these
first stars, using them to estimate the probability to detect any such Pop III
fossil in stellar archaeological surveys. Following our analysis, the most
promising region to find possible Pop III survivors is the stellar halo of the
Milky Way, which is the best target for future surveys. We find that if no
genuine Pop III survivor is detected in a sample size of $4 \times 10^6$ ($2
\times 10^7$) halo stars with well-controlled selection effects, then we can
exclude the hypothesis that the primordial IMF extended down below $0.8
M_\odot$ at a confidence level of 68% (99%). With the sample size of the
Hamburg/ESO survey, we can tentatively exclude Pop III stars with masses below
$0.65 M_\odot$ with a confidence level of 95%, although this is subject to
significant uncertainties. To fully harness the potential of our approach,
future large surveys are needed that employ uniform, unbiased selection
strategies for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

combines the Brink-Bloch cluster model with the $p_{3/2}$ subshell closure wave
function. We have found that $\alpha$-cluster breaking caused by spin-orbit

through orthogonality to lower states. Spatially developed cluster components
of the $0^{+}_{2}$ state are reduced. The $0^{+}_{3}$ state changes from a
vibration mode in the bending motion of three $\alpha$ clusters to a chain-like
3$\alpha$ structure having an open triangle configuration. As a result of these

state is changed by the $\alpha$-cluster breaking effect. Namely, in model
calculations without the $\alpha$-cluster breaking effect, the $0^{+}_{2}$
state is assigned to be the band-head of the $2^{+}_{2}$ state. However, when

the polymer minimizes its total energy through a collective optimization, where
the energy of each visited site only weakly contributes to the total.
Conversely, a hilly landscape forces the polymer to distort and explore a
larger portion of space to reach some particularly deep energy sites. As soon
as the fifth moment of the disorder diverges, this mechanism radically changes
the standard ""KPZ"" scaling behaviour of the directed polymer, and new exponents
prevail. After confirming again that the Flory argument accurately predicts
these exponent in the tail-dominated phase, we investigate several other
statistical features of the ground state that shed light on this unusual

theoretical challenge posed by this situation, which paradoxically becomes even

and is the main criteria for deciding between a match versus nonmatch in
forensic testimony. Often, prints are subject to varying levels of noise, for
example, the image quality may be low when a print is lifted from a crime
scene. A poor image quality causes human experts as well as automatic systems
to make more errors in feature detection by either missing true features or
detecting spurious ones. This error lowers the extent to which one can claim
individualization of fingerprints that are being matched. The aim of this paper
is to quantify the decrease in individualization as image quality degrades
based on fingerprint images in real databases. This, in turn, can be used by
forensic experts along with their testimony in a court of law. An important
practical concern is that the databases used typically consist of a large
number of fingerprint images so computational algorithms such as the Gibbs
sampler can be extremely slow. We develop algorithms based on the Laplace
approximation of the likelihood and infer the unknown parameters based on this
approximate likelihood. Two publicly available databases, namely, FVC2002 and
FVC2006, are analyzed from which estimates of individuality are obtained. From
a statistical perspective, the contribution can be treated as an innovative
application of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to the field of

of the magnetic flux inside the core, with the period equal to the quantum
flux. As a consequence of the direct interaction of the quantum field with the
magnetic field inside the penetrable core, the core-induced contribution, in
general, is not a periodic function of the flux. In addition, the vacuum
current, in general, is not a monotonic function of the distance from the
string and may change the sign. For a general model of the core interior, we
also evaluate the magnetic fields generated by the vacuum current. As
applications of the general results, we have considered an impenetrable core
modeled by Robin boundary condition, a core with the Minkowski-like interior
and a core with a constant positive curvature space. Various exactly solvable
distributions of the magnetic flux are discussed.

are laser interferometric detectors in space. It is usually assumed that the
noise floor for such a detector is dominated by optical shot noise in the
signal readout. For this to be true, a careful balance of mission parameters is
crucial to keep all other parasitic disturbances below shot noise. We developed
a web application that uses over 30 input parameters and considers many
important technical noise sources and noise suppression techniques. It
optimizes free parameters automatically and generates a detailed report on all
individual noise contributions. Thus you can easily explore the entire
parameter space and design a realistic gravitational wave observatory.
  In this document we describe the different parameters, present all underlying
calculations, and compare the final observatory's sensitivity with
astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. We use as an example parameters
currently assumed to be likely applied to a space mission to be launched in
2034 by the European Space Agency. The web application itself is publicly

IRAS16399-0937, based on new HST/ACS F814W and H$\alpha$+[NII] images and
archive data from HST, 2MASS, Spitzer, Herschel and the VLA. This system has a
double nucleus, whose northern (IRAS16399N) and southern (IRAS16399S)
components have a projected separation of $\sim$ 6'' (3.4 kpc) and have
previously been identified based on optical spectra as a Low Ionization Nuclear
Emission Line Region (LINER) and starburst nucleus, respectively. The nuclei
are embedded in a tidally distorted common envelope, in which star formation is
mostly heavily obscured. The infrared spectrum is dominated by strong
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), but deep silicate and molecular
absorption features are also present, and are strongest in the IRAS16399N
nucleus. The 0.435 - 500$\mu$m SED was fitted with a model including stellar,
ISM and AGN torus components using our new MCMC code, clumpyDREAM. The results
indicate that the IRAS16399N contains an AGN (L$_{bol} \sim 10^{44}$ ergs/s)
deeply embedded in a quasi-spherical distribution of optically-thick clumps
with a covering fraction $\approx1$. We suggest that these clumps are the
source of the OHM emission in IRAS16399-0937. The high torus covering fraction
precludes AGN-photoionization as the origin of the LINER spectrum, however, the
spectrum is consistent with shocks (v $\sim100-200$ km s$^{-1}$). We infer that
the $\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ black-hole in IRAS16399N is accreting at a small
fraction ($\sim1$%) of its Eddington rate. The low accretion-rate and modest
nuclear SFRs suggest that while the gas-rich major merger forming the
IRAS16399-0937 system has triggered widespread star formation, the massive gas
inflows expected from merger simulations have not yet fully developed.

of physical systems, from the basic concepts of symmetries in phase space to
the forefront of current research. Such symmetries emerge naturally in the
description of physical systems as varied as non-relativistic, relativistic,
with or without gravity, classical or quantum, and are related to the existence
of conserved quantities of the dynamics and integrability. In recent years
their study has grown intensively, due to the discovery of non-trivial examples
that apply to different types of theories and different numbers of dimensions.
Applications encompass the study of integrable systems such as spinning tops,
the Calogero model, systems described by the Lax equation, the physics of
higher dimensional black holes, the Dirac equation, supergravity with and
without fluxes, providing a tool to probe the dynamics of non-linear systems.

into feasible sets, where feasibility means that each transmission can be
successfully decoded in spite of the interference caused by simultaneous
transmissions. Feasibility is most closely modeled by a
signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) formula, which unfortunately is
conceptually complicated, being an asymmetric, cumulative, many-to-one
relationship. We re-examine how well graphs can capture wireless receptions as
encoded in SINR relationships, placing them in a framework in order to
understand the limits of such modelling. We seek for each wireless instance a
pair of graphs that provide upper and lower bounds on the feasibility relation,
while aiming to minimize the gap between the two graphs. The cost of a graph
formulation is the worst gap over all instances, and the price of (graph)
abstraction is the smallest cost of a graph formulation. We propose a family of
conflict graphs that is parameterized by a non-decreasing sub-linear function,
and show that with a judicious choice of functions, the graphs can capture
feasibility with a cost of $O(\log^* \Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the ratio
between the longest and the shortest link length. This holds on the plane and
more generally in doubling metrics. We use this to give greatly improved
$O(\log^* \Delta)$-approximation for fundamental link scheduling problems with
arbitrary power control. We explore the limits of graph representations and
find that our upper bound is tight: the price of graph abstraction is
$\Omega(\log^* \Delta)$. We also give strong impossibility results for general
metrics, and for approximations in terms of the number of links.

optical imaging as a diagnostic for the strong lensing nature of Early-Type
Galaxies, in the light of which blurred and faint Einstein rings can hide. We
simulate several thousand mock strong lenses under ground- and space-based
conditions as arising from the deflection of an exponential disk by a
foreground de Vaucouleurs light profile whose lensing potential is described by
a Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid. We then fit for the lensed light distribution
with sl_fit after having subtracted the foreground light emission off (ideal
case) and also after having fitted the deflector's light with galfit. By
setting thresholds in the output parameter space, we can decide the
lens/not-a-lens status of each system. We finally apply our strategy to a
sample of 517 lens candidates present in the CFHTLS data to test the
consistency of our selection approach. The efficiency of the fast modeling
method at recovering the main lens parameters like Einstein radius, total
magnification or total lensed flux, is quite comparable under CFHT and HST
conditions when the deflector is perfectly subtracted off (only possible in
simulations), fostering a sharp distinction between the good and the bad
candidates. Conversely, for a more realistic subtraction, a substantial
fraction of the lensed light is absorbed into the deflector's model, which
biases the subsequent fitting of the rings and then disturbs the selection
process. We quantify completeness and purity of the lens finding method in both
cases. This suggests that the main limitation currently resides in the
subtraction of the foreground light. Provided further enhancement of the
latter, the direct forward modeling of large numbers of galaxy-galaxy strong
lenses thus appears tractable and could constitute a competitive lens finder in
the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.

relevant for strings moving in AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1,
we analyze the corresponding deformations of the AdS_3 and S^3 metrics. We also
construct a two-parameter $q$-deformation of the u(1) + psu(1|1)^2 x u(1) x
R^3-invariant R-matrix and closure condition, which underlie the light-cone
gauge S-matrix and dispersion relation of the aforementioned string theories.
With the appropriate identification of parameters, the near-BMN limit of the

ineffective. Adiabatic theorem, as an alternative to cooling, can be exploited
for driving the many-body system to its ground state. In this paper, we study
two most common disorders in quantum dot arrays, namely exchange coupling
fluctuations and hyperfine interaction, in adiabatically preparation of ground
state in such systems. We show that the adiabatic ground state preparation is
highly robust against those disorder effects making it good analog simulator.
Moreover, we also study the adiabatic classical information transfer, using
singlet-triplet states, across a spin chain. In contrast to ground state
preparation the transfer mechanism is highly affected by disorder and in
particular, the hyperfine interaction is very destructive for the performance.
This suggests that for communication tasks across such arrays adiabatic

in the UK, 23% of travel time is lost in connections for trips with more than
one mode, and the lack of synchronization decreases very slowly with population
size. This lack of synchronization between modes induces differences between
the theoretical quickest trip and the `time-respecting' path, which takes into
account waiting times at interconnection nodes. We analyse here the statistics
of these paths on the multilayer, temporal network of the entire, multimodal
british public transportation system. We propose a statistical decomposition --
the `anatomy' -- of trips in urban areas, in terms of riding, waiting and
walking times, and which shows how the temporal structure of trips varies with
distance and allows us to compare different cities. Weaknesses in systems can
be either insufficient transportation speed or service frequency, but the key
parameter controlling their global efficiency is the total number of stop
events per hour for all modes. This analysis suggests the need for better
optimization strategies, adapted to short, long unimodal or multimodal trips.

of different layers. Here we argue that, if links are directed, dependencies
are twofold. Besides the ordinary tendency of links of different layers to
align as the result of `multiplexity', there is also a tendency to anti-align
as the result of what we call `multireciprocity', i.e. the fact that links in
one layer can be reciprocated by \emph{opposite} links in a different layer.
Multireciprocity generalizes the scalar definition of single-layer reciprocity
to that of a square matrix involving all pairs of layers. We introduce
multiplexity and multireciprocity matrices for both binary and weighted
multiplexes and validate their statistical significance against maximum-entropy
null models that filter out the effects of node heterogeneity. We then perform
a detailed empirical analysis of the World Trade Multiplex (WTM), representing
the import-export relationships between world countries in different
commodities. We show that the WTM exhibits strong multiplexity and
multireciprocity, an effect which is however largely encoded into the degree or
strength sequences of individual layers. The residual effects are still
significant and allow to classify pairs of commodities according to their
tendency to be traded together in the same direction and/or in opposite ones.
We also find that the multireciprocity of the WTM is significantly lower than
the usual reciprocity measured on the aggregate network. Moreover, layers with
low (high) internal reciprocity are embedded within sets of layers with
comparably low (high) mutual multireciprocity. This suggests that, in the WTM,
reciprocity is inherent to groups of related commodities rather than to
individual commodities. We discuss the implications for international trade
research focusing on product taxonomies, the product space, and
fitness/complexity metrics.

fluctuation amplitudes remain finite through nonlinear wave dissipation. The
spatially increasing speed of the resulting outflow results in a
diffusion-convection boundary whose position depends on particle momentum. It
replaces the escape boundary of static diffusion models. New effects like
overall Galactic mass and angular momentum loss as well as gas heating beyond
the disk appear. Also particle re-acceleration in the distant wind halo
suggests itself. The resulting magnetohydrodynamic flow properties and the
cosmic-ray transport properties are compared with observations. On the whole
they show remarkable agreement. General limitations and generalisations of the
basic model arise due to the expected simultaneous infall of matter from the
environment of the Galaxy. On an intergalactic scale the combined winds from
the Local Group galaxies should form a ``Local Group Bubble``. Its properties
remain to be studied in detail.

infectious diseases by timely recognizing emerging outbreaks. Seen from a
statistical perspective, this implies the use of appropriate methods for
monitoring time series of aggregated case reports. This paper presents the
tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package
surveillance. We introduce the functionality for the visualization, modelling
and monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modelling we focus
on univariate time series modelling based on generalized linear models (GLMs),
multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models
for location, shape and scale. This ranges from illustrating implementational
improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g, by
spline-modelling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look
at categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or
Dirichlet-Multinomial modelling. With respect to monitoring we consider
detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between
the observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihood-ratio based
cumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support
aberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow
of a public health institution. Altogether, the present article shows how well
surveillance can support automatic aberration detection in a public health
surveillance context.

i.e. the Multiscale Universal Interface (MUI), which is capable of facilitating
the coupling effort for a wide range of multiscale simulations. The library
adopts a header-only form with minimal external dependency and hence can be
easily dropped into existing codes. A data sampler concept is introduced,
combined with a hybrid dynamic/static typing mechanism, to create an easily
customizable framework for solver-independent data interpretation. The library
integrates MPI MPMD support and an asynchronous communication protocol to
handle inter-solver information exchange irrespective of the solvers' own MPI
awareness. Template metaprogramming is heavily employed to simultaneously
improve runtime performance and code flexibility. We validated the library by
solving three different multiscale problems, which also serve to demonstrate
the flexibility of the framework in handling heterogeneous models and solvers.
In the first example, a Couette flow was simulated using two concurrently
coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of different spatial
resolutions. In the second example, we coupled the deterministic SPH method
with the stochastic Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method to study the

to determine electron densities in the ionised gas regions. The CI lines,
observed with SPIRE, have been used to measure the densities in the neutral

below 10000 cm-3. Using the OI145/63um and SIII33/18um line ratios we find an
anti-correlation of the temperature with the gas density. Using various
fine-structure line ratios, we find that density stratification is common in
these active galaxies. On average, the electron densities increase with the
ionisation potential of the ions producing the NII, SIII and NeV emission. The
infrared emission lines arise partly in the Narrow Line Region (NLR)
photoionised by the AGN central engine, partly in HII regions photo ionised by
hot stars and partly in neutral gas in photo-dissociated regions (PDRs). We
attempt to separate the contributions to the line emission produced in these
different regions by comparing our emission line ratios to empirical and
theoretical values. In particular, we tried to separate the contribution of AGN
and star formation by using a combination of Spitzer and Herschel lines, and we
found that, besides the well known mid-IR line ratios, the mixed mid-IR/far-IR
line ratio of OIII88um/OIV26um can reliably discriminate the two emission
regimes, while the far-IR line ratio of CII157um/OI63um is only able to mildly
separate the two regimes. By comparing the observed CII157um/NII205um ratio
with photoionisation models, we also found that most of the CII emission in the

at four different heights as it approached the Sun. The \hi\, \lya\, line
profiles detected by UVCS are analyzed to determine the spectral parameters:
line intensity, width and Doppler shift with respect to the coronal background.
Two dimensional comet images of these parameters are reconstructed at the
different heights. A novel aspect of the observations of this sungrazing comet
data is that, whereas the emission from the most of the tail is blue--shifted,
that along one edge of the tail is red--shifted. We attribute these shifts to a
combination of solar wind speed and interaction with the magnetic field. In
order to use the comet to probe the density, temperature and speed of the
corona and solar wind through which it passes, as well as to determine the
outgassing rate of the comet, we develop a Monte Carlo simulation of the \hi\,
\lya\, emission of a comet moving through a coronal plasma. From the outgassing
rate, we estimate a nucleus diameter of about 9 meters. This rate steadily
increases as the comet approaches the Sun while the optical brightness
decreases by more than a factor of ten and suddenly recovers. This indicates
that the optical brightness is determined by the lifetimes of the grains,
sodium atoms and molecules produced by the comet.

curved spacetime is known to be tightly constrained, under certain standard
hypotheses, to the same terms as in flat spacetime up to finitely many
curvature dependent terms. These hypotheses include, in particular, locality,
covariance, scaling, microlocal regularity and continuous and analytic
dependence on the metric and coupling parameters. The analytic dependence
hypothesis is somewhat unnatural, because it requires that locally covariant
observables (which are simultaneously defined on all spacetimes) depend
continuously on an arbitrary metric, with the dependence strengthened to
analytic on analytic metrics. Moreover the fact that analytic metrics are
globally rigid makes the implementation of this requirement at the level of
local $*$-algebras of observables rather technically cumbersome. We show that
the conditions of locality, covariance, scaling and a naturally strengthened
microlocal spectral condition, are actually sufficient to constrain the allowed
finite renormalizations equally strongly, thus eliminating both the continuity
and the somewhat unnatural analyticity hypotheses. The key step in the proof
uses the Peetre-Slov\'ak theorem on the characterization of (in general

convolution algebra of a locally compact group. In the case where the group is
abelian, by Bochner's theorem a function of positive type is, up to
normalization, the Fourier transform of a probability measure. Therefore,
considering the group of translations on phase space, a suitably normalized
phase-space function of positive type can be regarded as a realization of a
classical state. Thus, it may be called a function of classical positive type.
Replacing the ordinary convolution on phase space with the twisted convolution,
one obtains a noncommutative algebra of functions whose positive functionals we
may call functions of quantum positive type. In fact, by a quantum version of
Bochner's theorem, a continuous function of quantum positive type is, up to
normalization, the (symplectic) Fourier transform of a Wigner quasi-probability
distribution; hence, it can be regarded as a phase-space realization of a
quantum state. Playing with functions of positive type, classical and quantum,
one is led in a natural way to consider a class of semigroups of operators, the

different model parameters are changed. By including the phenotypic
plasticity/dedifferentiation, in which a progenitor/differentiated cell can
transform back into a cancer stem cell, we show that the effective fitness of
mutant stem cells is not only determined by their proliferation and death rates
but also according to their dedifferentiation potential. By numerically solving
the model we derive the phase diagram of the advantageous and disadvantageous
phases of cancer stem cells in the space of proliferation and dedifferentiation
potentials. The result shows that at high enough dedifferentiation rates even a
previously disadvantageous mutant can take over the population of normal stem
cells. This observation has implications in different areas of cancer research
including experimental observations that imply metastatic cancer stem cell
types might have lower proliferation potential than other stem cell phenotypes
while showing much more phenotypic plasticity and can undergo clonal expansion.

brain. The emerging understanding of these roles has been informed by the
design of analog devices that have been important to neuroscience, among them
the neuroanalog computer developed by O. Schmitt in the 1930's. In the 1950's,
J. von Neumann, in a search for high performance computing using microwaves,
invented a logic machine based on similar devices, that can perform logic
functions including binary arithmetic. Described here is a novel embodiment of
his machine using nano-magnetics. The embodiment is based on properties of
ferromagnetic thin films that are governed by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation
for magnetization in a film. Electrical currents through point contacts on a
film create spin torque nano oscillators (STNO) that define the oscillator
elements of the system. These oscillators may communicate through directed
graphs of electrical connections or by radiation in the form of spin waves. It
is shown here how to construct a logic machine using STNO, that this machine
can perform several computations simultaneously using multiplexing of inputs,
that this system can evaluate iterated logic functions, and that spin waves can
communicate frequency, phase and binary information. Neural tissue and the
Schmitt, von Neumann and STNO devices share a common bifurcation structure,
although these systems operate on vastly different space and time scales. This
suggests that neural circuits may be capable of computational functionality
described here.

physical outcome of a peptidic phase-transition signaling the onset of type-2
diabetes mellitus in different mammalian species. In particular, experimentally
verified mutations on the amyloidogenic segment 20-29 in humans, cats and rats
are highly correlated with the molecular aggregation propensities. Through a
microcanonical analysis of the aggregation of IAPP_{20-29} isoforms, we show
that a minimalist one-bead hydrophobic-polar continuum model for protein
interactions properly quantifies those propensities from free-energy barriers.
Our results highlight the central role of sequence-dependent hydrophobic
mutations on hot spots for stabilization, and so for the engineering, of such
biological peptides.

widely-used and physically well-motivated, but do not appear to have been

prescription as to which boundary conditions should be selected in order to
obtain physically-relevant results pertaining to confined higher spin fields.
This lack of understanding is significant given that boundary-dependent
phenomena are ubiquitous across physics, a prominent example being the Casimir
effect. Here, we use the two-spinor calculus formalism to present a unified
treatment of boundary conditions routinely employed in the treatment of
spin-1/2 and spin-1 fields. We then use this unification to obtain a boundary
condition that can be applied to massless fields of any spin, including the
spin-2 graviton, and its supersymmetric partner the spin-3/2 gravitino.

social network. The spin variable represents only the individual opinion
(advice) that each trader gives to his nearest neighbors. In the model the
agents can be considered as cunning. For instance, although agent having
currently a maximal value of the spin advises his nearest neighbors to buy some
stocks he, perfidiously, will sell some stocks in the next Monte Carlo step or
will occupy a neutral position. In general, the trader has three possibilities:
he can buy some stocks if his opinion change within a single time step is
positive, sell some stocks if this change is negative, or remain inactive if
his opinion is unchanged. The predictions of our model, found by simulations,
well agree with the empirical universal distribution of interoccurrence times
between daily losses below negative thresholds following the Tsallis
