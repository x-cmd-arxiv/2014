  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1409.7289",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The need to estimate a particular quantile of a distribution is an important
problem which frequently arises in many computer vision and signal processing
applications. For example, our work was motivated by the requirements of many
semi-automatic surveillance analytics systems which detect abnormalities in
close-circuit television (CCTV) footage using statistical models of low-level
motion features. In this paper we specifically address the problem of
estimating the running quantile of a data stream when the memory for storing
observations is limited. We make several major contributions: (i) we highlight
the limitations of approaches previously described in the literature which make
them unsuitable for non-stationary streams, (ii) we describe a novel principle
for the utilization of the available storage space, (iii) we introduce two
novel algorithms which exploit the proposed principle in different ways, and
(iv) we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the proposed
algorithms and the existing methods in the literature on both synthetic data
sets and three large real-world streams acquired in the course of operation of
an existing commercial surveillance system. Our findings convincingly
demonstrate that both of the proposed methods are highly successful and vastly
outperform the existing alternatives. We show that the better of the two
algorithms (data-aligned histogram) exhibits far superior performance in
comparison with the previously described methods, achieving more than 10 times
lower estimate errors on real-world data, even when its available working
memory is an order of magnitude smaller.

pulsation is purely thermal in nature which suggests the pulsation is
originated from a hot polar cap with $T\sim3\times10^{6}$ K on the surface of a
rotating neutron star. On the other hand, the power-law component that
dominates the pulsar emission in the hard band is originated from off-pulse
phases, which possibly comes from a pulsar wind nebula. In re-analyzing the
Chandra data, we have confirmed the presence of bow-shock nebula which extends
from the pulsar to west by ~10 arcsec. The orientation of this nebular feature
suggests that the pulsar is probably moving eastward which is consistent with
the speculated proper motion by extrapolating from the nominal geometrical
center of the supernova remnant (SNR) G78.2+2.1 to the current pulsar position.
For G78.2+2.1, our deep XMM-Newton observation also enables a study of the
central region and part of the southeastern region with superior photon
statistics. The column absorption derived for the SNR is comparable with that
for PSR J2021+4026, which supports their association. The remnant emission in
both examined regions are in an non-equilibrium ionization state. Also, the
elapsed time of both regions after shock-heating is apparently shorter than the
Sedov age of G78.2+2.1. This might suggest the reverse shock has reached the
center not long ago. Apart from PSR J2021+4026 and G78.2+2.1, we have also
serendipitously detected an X-ray flash-like event XMM J202154.7+402855 from

all $\beta_i$-dependent terms are absorbed into the BLM-type scale(s) of the

Through superradiance of stellar black holes, it may also be the first
experiment to discover the QCD axion with decay constant above the GUT scale.
When an axion's Compton wavelength is comparable to the size of a black hole,
the axion binds to the black hole, forming a ""gravitational atom."" Through the
superradiance process, the number of axions occupying the bound levels grows
exponentially, extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole.
Axions transitioning between levels of the gravitational atom and axions
annihilating to gravitons can produce observable gravitational wave signals.
The signals are long-lasting, monochromatic, and can be distinguished from
ordinary astrophysical sources. We estimate up to O(1) transition events at
aLIGO for an axion between 10^-11 and 10^-10 eV and up to 10^4 annihilation
events for an axion between 10^-13 and 10^-11 eV. In the event of a null
search, aLIGO can constrain the axion mass for a range of rapidly spinning
black hole formation rates. Axion annihilations are also promising for much
lighter masses at future lower-frequency gravitational wave observatories; the
rates have large uncertainties, dominated by supermassive black hole spin
distributions. Our projections for aLIGO are robust against perturbations from
the black hole environment and account for our updated exclusion on the QCD
axion of 6*10^-13 eV < ma < 2*10^-11 eV suggested by stellar black hole spin

embedded in a demi-normal projective variety. Recall that a demi-normal variety
$X$ is a variety with properties $S_2$, $G_1$, and seminormality. Equivalently,
$X$ has Serre's $S_2$ property and there is an open subvariety $U$ with
complement of codimension at least 2 in $X$, such that the only singularities
of $U$ are (analytically) double normal crossings. The term demi-normal was
coined by Koll\'ar in \cite{Kol13}. As a consequence of this embedding theorem,
we prove a semi-smooth Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem for
quasi-projective varieties, the projective case having been settled in
\cite{Berq14}. The original form of this vanishing result appears in
\cite{GR70}. We prove an analogous result for semi-rational singularities. The
definition of semi-rationality requires that the choice of a semi-resolution is
immaterial. This also has been established in the projective case in

instance, the direct sum of two irreducible affine actions can still be

lemma characterizing the irreducibility of an affine isometric group action.
This enables us to describe for instance the irreducible affine isometric
actions of nilpotent groups. As another application, a short proof is provided
for the following result of Neretin: the restriction to a cocompact lattice of
an irreducible affine action of locally compact group remains irreducible. We
give a necessary and sufficient condition for a fixed unitary representation to
be the linear part of an irreducible affine action. In particular, when the
unitary representation is a multiple of the regular representation of a
discrete group G, we show how this question is related to the L2-Betti number
of G. After giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a direct sum of
irreducible affine actions to be irreducible, we show the following
super-rigidity result: if G is product of two or more locally compact groups,
then every irreducible affine action of any irreducible co-compact lattice in G
extends to an affine action of G, provided the linear part of this action does
not weakly contain the trivial representation.

polarized dust emission towards interstellar filaments and their backgrounds.
The polarization data provide insight on the structure of their magnetic field
(B). We present the polarization maps of three nearby star forming filament of
moderate column density (NH~10^22cm^-2): Musca, B211, and L1506. We use the
spatial information to separate Stokes I, Q, and U of the filaments from those
of their backgrounds, an essential step to measure the intrinsic polarization
fraction (p) and angle (psi) of each emission component. We find that the
polarization angles in the three filaments (psi_fil) are coherent along their
lengths and not the same as in their backgrounds (psi_bg). The differences
between psi_fil and psi_bg are 12deg, 6deg, and 54deg for Musca, B211, and
L1506, respectively. These differences for Musca and L1506 are larger than the
dispersions of psi, both along the filaments and in their backgrounds. The
observed changes of psi are direct evidence for variations of the orientation
of the plane of the sky (POS) projection of the B-field. As in previous
studies, we find a decrease of several percent of p with NH. We show that the
drop in p cannot be explained by random fluctuations of the orientation of B
within the filaments because they are too small (sigma_psi<10deg). We recognize
the degeneracy between dust alignment efficiency and the structure of B in
causing variations in p, but we argue that the decrease of p from the
backgrounds to the filaments results in part from depolarization associated
with the 3D structure of B: both its orientation in the POS and with respect to
the POS. We do not resolve the inner structure of the filaments, but at the
smallest scales accessible with Planck (~0.2pc), the observed changes of psi
and p hold information on the B-field structure within filaments.

Unfortunately, the mean-field systems have a degree of frequency error and the

derive a one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) approximation for
the marginal voltage density under a first order moment closure for coupled
networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with white noise inputs. The PDE has
substantially less frequency error than the mean-field system, and provides a
great deal more information, at the cost of analytical tractability. The
convergence properties of the mean-field system in the low noise limit are
elucidated. A novel method for the analysis of the stability of the
asynchronous tonic firing solution is also presented and implemented. Unlike
previous attempts at stability analysis with these network types, information
about the marginal densities of the adaptation variables is used. This method
can in principle be applied to other systems with nonlinear partial

momentum conservation. Revisiting the foundations of the quantum measurement
process offers the resolution. Prior to the macroscopic recording of no
interaction, a brief Critical Interval prevails, during which the particles and
the detector's pointer form a subtle entanglement which immediately dissolves.
It is this self-cancellation, henceforth ""Quantum Oblivion (QO),"" that lies at
the basis of some well-known intriguing quantum effects. Such is
Interaction-Free Measurement (IFM) [1] and its more paradoxical variants, like
Hardy's Paradox [2] and the Quantum Liar Paradox [3]. Even the Aharonov-Bohm
(AB) effect [4] and weak measurement [5] turn out to belong to this group. We
next study interventions within the Critical Interval that produce some other
peculiar effects. Finally we discuss some of the conceptual issues involved.
Under the time-resolution of the Critical Interval, some nonlocal phenomena
turn out to be local. Momentum is conserved due to the quantum uncertainties
inflicted by the particle-pointer interaction, which sets the experiment's

frame features a short initial transient in which error correction is
ineffective, followed by a slow decay of the information content consistent
with the known facts about discrete-time error correction in the limit of fast
operations. This behavior is explained in the two case studies through a
geometric description of the continuous transformation of the state space

computational complexity will no longer be a sufficient metric for comparing

be increasingly important. The problem of developing lower bounds for data
access complexity has been modeled using the formalism of Hong & Kung's
red/blue pebble game for computational directed acyclic graphs (CDAGs).
However, previously developed approaches to lower bounds analysis for the
red/blue pebble game are very limited in effectiveness when applied to CDAGs of
real programs, with computations comprised of multiple sub-computations with
differing DAG structure. We address this problem by developing an approach for
effectively composing lower bounds based on graph decomposition. We also
develop a static analysis algorithm to derive the asymptotic data-access lower

interpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different
""topological spin"" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct
particles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the
existence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particular
the ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximal
analytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr-Newman
spacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, ""zero-gravity"" means the limit $G\to
0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel
interpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be
capable of describing both the electron and the positron in ""external"" fields
in many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a
single position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were a
two-particle equation! A Dirac equation is formulated for a ring-like
bi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere in
the topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ring
bi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-Broglie-Bohm type law extracted
from the Dirac equation. As an application, the pertinent general-relativistic
zero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr-Newman
magnetic moment be identified with the so-called ""anomalous magnetic moment of
the physical electron,"" not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is
only a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.

outflow plasmas with speeds close to the coronal Alfv\'{e}n speed. Yet,
spectroscopic observations of such outflows, especially the downflows, are
extremely rare. With observations of the newly launched Interface Region

loop-top X-Ray source observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). We interpret this large redshift as the
signature of downward-moving reconnection outflow/hot retracting loops. Imaging
observations from both IRIS and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) also reveal the eruption and reconnection
processes. Fast downward-propagating blobs along these loops are also found
from cool emission lines (e.g., Si {\sc{iv}}, O {\sc{iv}}, C {\sc{ii}}, Mg

studied. In contrast to certain band-limited shearlets, compactly supported

capture gigantic conceptual space by learning an ultra-high dimensional topical

desideratum after enthusiasms on ""big data"", especially for fine-grained
downstream tasks such as online advertising, where good performances are
usually achieved by regression-based predictors built on millions if not
billions of input features. The conventional data-parallel approach for
training gigantic topic models turns out to be rather inefficient in utilizing
the power of parallelism, due to the heavy dependency on a centralized image of
""model"". Big model size also poses another challenge on the storage, where
available model size is bounded by the smallest RAM of nodes. To address these
issues, we explore another type of parallelism, namely model-parallelism, which
enables training of disjoint blocks of a big topic model in parallel. By
integrating data-parallelism with model-parallelism, we show that dependencies
between distributed elements can be handled seamlessly, achieving not only
faster convergence but also an ability to tackle significantly bigger model
size. We describe an architecture for model-parallel inference of LDA, and
present a variant of collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm tailored for it.

two-body wave function to the normalization of the total wave function. Writing
down explicitly the wave function for a resonance state obtained with a general
separable interaction, we formulate the compositeness in terms of the position
of the resonance pole, the residue of the scattering amplitude at the pole and
the derivative of the Green function of the free two-body scattering system. At
the same time, our formulation provides the elementariness expressed with the
resonance properties and the two-body effective interaction, and confirms the
sum rule showing that the summation of the compositeness and elementariness
gives unity. In this formulation the Weinberg's relation for the scattering
length and effective range can be derived in the weak binding limit. The
extension to the resonance states is performed with the Gamow vector, and a

chiral unitary approach.

  Amplification In Quantum Key Distribution",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Privacy amplification is a necessary step in all quantum key distribution
protocols, and error correction is needed in each except when signals of many
photons are used in the key communication in quantum noise approach. No
security analysis of error correcting code information leak to the attacker has
ever been provided, while an ad hoc formula is currently employed to account
for such leak in the key generation rate. It is also commonly believed that
privacy amplification allows the users to at least establish a short key of
arbitrarily close to perfect security. In this paper we show how the lack of
rigorous error correction analysis makes the otherwise valid privacy
amplification results invalid, and that there exists a limit on how close to
perfect a generated key can be obtained from privacy amplification. In
addition, there is a necessary tradeoff between key rate and security, and the
best theoretical values from current theories would not generate enough
near-uniform key bits to cover the message authentication key cost in
disturbance-information tradeoff protocols of the BB84 variety.

setting, which extract almost uniform random bits against quantum side
information collected from several initially independent classical random
sources. This is a natural generalization of seeded randomness extraction
against quantum side information and classical independent source extraction.
With new challenges such as potential entanglement in the side information, it
is not a prior clear under what conditions do quantum multi-source extractors
exist; the only previous work is [KK12], where the classical inner-product
two-source extractors of [CG88] and [DEOR04] are shown to be quantum secure in
the restricted Independent Adversary (IA) Model and entangled Bounded Storage
(BS) Model.
  In this paper we propose a new model called General Entangled (GE) Adversary
Model, which allows arbitrary entanglement in the side information and subsumes
both the IA model and the BS model. We proceed to show how to construct
GE-secure quantum multi-source extractors. To that end, we propose another
model called One-sided Adversary (OA) Model, which is weaker than all the above
models. Somewhat surprisingly, we establish equivalence between strong
OA-security and strong GE-security. As a result, all classical multi-source
extractors can either directly work, or be modified to work in the GE model at
the cost of one extra random source. Thus, our constructions essentially match
the best known constructions of classical multi-source extractors.
  We also apply our techniques to two important problems in cryptography and
distributed computing --- privacy amplification and network extractor. We show
that as long as the sources have certain amounts of conditional min-entropy in
our GE model (even with entangled quantum side information), we can design very
efficient privacy amplification protocols and network extractors.

object localization and tracking applications. Traditionally, CFs have been
designed in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT),
where correlation is efficiently implemented. However, existing CF designs do
not account for the fact that the multiplication of two DFTs in the frequency
domain corresponds to a circular correlation in the time/spatial domain.
Because this was previously unaccounted for, prior CF designs are not truly
optimal, as their optimization criteria do not accurately quantify their
optimization intention. In this paper, we introduce new zero-aliasing
constraints that completely eliminate this aliasing problem by ensuring that
the optimization criterion for a given CF corresponds to a linear correlation
rather than a circular correlation. This means that previous CF designs can be
significantly improved by this reformulation. We demonstrate the benefits of
this new CF design approach with several important CFs. We present experimental
results on diverse data sets and present solutions to the computational
challenges associated with computing these CFs. Code for the CFs described in

they can be potentially used to check whether the object is a Kerr black hole
of general relativity. However, in a previous study we have shown that the
relativistic features are usually subdominant with respect to the background
noise and the model-dependent properties of the hot spot, and eventually it is
at most possible to estimate the frequency of the innermost stable circular
orbit. In this case, tests of the Kerr metric are only possible in combination
with other measurements. In the present work, we consider a class of non-Kerr
spacetimes in which the hot spot orbit may be outside the equatorial plane.
These metrics are difficult to constrain from the study of accretion disks and
indeed current X-ray observations of stellar-mass and supermassive black hole
candidates cannot put interesting bounds. Here we show that near future
observations of SgrA$^*$ may do it. If the hot spot is sufficiently close to
the massive object, the image affected by Doppler blueshift is brighter than
the other one and this provides a specific observational signature in the hot
spot's centroid track. We conclude that accurate astrometric observations of
SgrA$^*$ with an instrument like GRAVITY should be able to test this class of
metrics, except in the more unlikely case of a small viewing angle.

synchrotron radiation since a huge amount of electrons exists. Although most of
radiation would be absorbed by synchrotron self-absorption, high-frequency end
of synchrotron emission can escape from a corona and appears at the sub-mm

nearby Seyferts is below the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array

can measure the non-thermal tail of the synchrotron radiation from a corona.

contexts by learning models jointly on multiple different, but related tasks.
Network data, which are a priori data with a rich relational structure, provide
an important context for applying MTL. In particular, the explicit relational
structure implies that network data is not i.i.d. data. Network data also often
comes with significant metadata (i.e., attributes) associated with each entity
(node). Moreover, due to the diversity and variation in network data (e.g.,
multi-relational links or multi-category entities), various tasks can be
performed and often a rich correlation exists between them. Learning algorithms
should exploit all of these additional sources of information for better
performance. In this work we take a metric-learning point of view for the MTL
problem in the network context. Our approach builds on structure preserving
metric learning (SPML). In particular SPML learns a Mahalanobis distance metric
for node attributes using network structure as supervision, so that the learned
distance function encodes the structure and can be used to predict link
patterns from attributes. SPML is described for single-task learning on single
network. Herein, we propose a multi-task version of SPML, abbreviated as
MT-SPML, which is able to learn across multiple related tasks on multiple
networks via shared intermediate parametrization. MT-SPML learns a specific
metric for each task and a common metric for all tasks. The task correlation is
carried through the common metric and the individual metrics encode task
specific information. When combined together, they are structure-preserving
with respect to individual tasks. MT-SPML works on general networks, thus is
suitable for a wide variety of problems. In experiments, we challenge MT-SPML
on two real-word problems, where MT-SPML achieves significant improvement.

size of OGs (DGs) is smaller by a factor of $\sim2$ (1.5) than that of
present-day early-type (late-type) galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelength.
We derive the average effective radii of OGs and DGs, corresponding to
$2.09\pm1.13$ kpc and $3.27\pm1.14$ kpc, respectively. Generally, The DGs are
heterogeneous, with mixed features including bulges, disks, and irregular
structures, with relatively high $M_{\rm 20}$, small size and low $G$, while
OGs are elliptical-like compact morphologies with lower $M_{\rm 20}$, larger
size and higher $G$, indicating the more concentrated and symmetric spatial
extent of stellar population distribution in OGs than DGs. The findings imply
that OGs and DGs have different evolutionary processes, and the minor merger
scenario is the most likely mechanism for the structural properties of OGs.
However, the size evolution of DGs is possibly due to the secular evolution of
galaxies.

to rely heavily on stone and wooden tools when they hunting or fighting against
other predators, which are very different from the hunting behaviors of other

wooden spears throwing, and throwing had play an important role in human
evolution process. But there is almost no work to study the why only human
chose to hunting by this way. Here we suppose that ancient human chose two-arm
brachiation as main arboreal locomotion mode because of their suitable body
weight. Human body traits include slim body, parallel arranged scapulas, long
thumb and powerful grip ability are all evolved as results of two arm
brachiation. The relevant adaptive evolution of the shoulder bone structure
make human arms with a large range of movement and the long thumb makes human
activities to be more accurate and controllable. These are two important body

$\Omega_X$, slightly departing from the case of a pure cosmological constant.
Afterwards, we show that our model predicts viable transition redshift
constraints, which agree with $\Lambda$CDM. To do so, we compute the
corresponding $z_{da}$ in terms of cosmographic outcomes and find that
$z_{da}\leq1$. Finally, we reproduce an effective $f(z)$ and show that this
class of models is fairly well compatible with present-time data. To do so, we
get numerical constraints employing Monte Carlo fits with the Union 2.1
supernova survey and with the Hubble measurement data set.

under gravity in a viscous fluid at low-Reynolds-number are investigated within
the point-particle model. Evolution of a benchmark initial configuration is
studied, in which the dumbbells are vertical and their centres are aligned
horizontally. Rigid dumbbells and pairs of separate beads starting from the
same positions tumble periodically while settling down. We find that elasticity
(which breaks time-reversal symmetry of the motion) significantly affects the
system's dynamics. This is remarkable taking into account that elastic forces
are always much smaller than gravity. We observe oscillating motion of the
elastic dumbbells, which tumble and change their length non-periodically.
Independently of the value of the spring constant, a horizontal hydrodynamic
repulsion appears between the dumbbells - their centres of mass move apart from
each other horizontally. The shift is fast for moderate values of the spring
constant k, and slows down when k tends to zero or to infinity; in these
limiting cases we recover the periodic dynamics reported in the literature. For
moderate values of the spring constant, and different initial configurations,
we observe the existence of a universal time-dependent solution to which the
system converges after an initial relaxation phase. The tumbling time and the
width of the trajectories in the centre-of-mass frame increase with time. In
addition to its fundamental significance, the benchmark solution presented here
is important to understand general features of systems with larger number of
elastic particles, at regular and random configurations.

topology and infected nodes, but not the rates of infection, is a challenging
combinatorial problem, and it is even more difficult in practice where the
underlying infection spreading model is usually unknown a priori. In this
paper, we are interested in finding a source estimator that is applicable to
various spreading models, including the Susceptible-Infected (SI),
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected
(SIRI), and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models. We show that under
the SI, SIR and SIRI spreading models and with mild technical assumptions, the
Jordan center is the infection source associated with the most likely infection
path in a tree network with a single infection source. This conclusion applies
for a wide range of spreading parameters, while it holds for regular trees
under the SIS model with homogeneous infection and recovery rates. Since the
Jordan center does not depend on the infection, recovery and reinfection rates,
it can be regarded as a universal source estimator. We also consider the case
where there are k>1 infection sources, generalize the Jordan center definition
to a k-Jordan center set, and show that this is an optimal infection source set
estimator in a tree network for the SI model. Simulation results on various
general synthetic networks and real world networks suggest that Jordan
center-based estimators consistently outperform the betweenness, closeness,
distance, degree, eigenvector, and pagerank centrality based heuristics, even
if the network is not a tree.

found, a proper theoretical understanding of the lepton flavor anatomy of a
given model would become necessary. Here I briefly review the current

aspects of several processes. Finally, I discuss two topics that have received

  Dissemination in Vehicular Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicular Networks enable a vast number of innovative applications, which
rely on the efficient exchange of information between vehicles. However,
efficient and reliable data dissemination is a particularly challenging task in
the context of vehicular networks due to the underlying properties of these
networks, limited availability of network infrastructure and variable
penetration rates for distinct communication technologies. This paper presents
a novel system and mechanism for information dissemination based on virtual
infrastructure selection in combination with multiple communication
technologies. The system has been evaluated using a simulation framework,
involving network simulation in conjugation with realistic vehicular mobility
traces. The presented simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed
mechanism to achieve maximum message penetration with reduced overhead.
Compared with a cellular-based only solution, our mechanism shows that the
judicious vehicle selection can lead to improved network utilization through
the offload of traffic to the short-range communication network.

machine learning. Similarity and metric learning methods learn such measures
automatically from data, but they do not scale well respect to the

efficiently similarity measure from high-dimensional sparse data. The core idea
is to parameterize the similarity measure as a convex combination of rank-one
matrices with specific sparsity structures. The parameters are then optimized
with an approximate Frank-Wolfe procedure to maximally satisfy relative
similarity constraints on the training data. Our algorithm greedily
incorporates one pair of features at a time into the similarity measure,
providing an efficient way to control the number of active features and thus
reduce overfitting. It enjoys very appealing convergence guarantees and its
time and memory complexity depends on the sparsity of the data instead of the
dimension of the feature space. Our experiments on real-world high-dimensional
datasets demonstrate its potential for classification, dimensionality reduction
and data exploration.

magnetic tunnel junction with a large-spin impurity, such as a magnetic

theoretically in the linear-response regime. The impurity is described by the
giant spin Hamiltonian, with both uniaxial and transverse magnetic anisotropy
taken into account. Owing to the presence of transverse component of magnetic
anisotropy, spin of a tunneling electron can be reversed during scattering on
the impurity, even in the low temperature regime. This reversal appears due to
exchange interaction of tunneling electrons with the magnetic impurity. We
calculate Seebeck and spin Seebeck coefficients, and analyze their dependence
on various parameters of the spin impurity and tunnel junction. In addition,
conventional and spin figures of merit, as well as the electronic contribution
to heat conductance are considered. We also show that pure spin current can be
driven by a spin bias applied to the junction with spin impurity, even if no
electron transfer between the electrodes can take place. The underlying
mechanism employs single-electrode tunneling processes (electrode-spin exchange

highlight the potential to identify uranium objects of varying thicknesses
greater than 5cm within real-time durations of several weeks. Increased

hinder the ability of both approaches to resolve objects of 2cm dimensions even

Brazil) in terms of price, engine size and emissions distributions. We argue
that choices and aggregate elasticities of substitution can be predicted using
this data, enabling to evaluate the effectiveness of potential fiscal and
technological change policies on fleet-year emissions reductions. We provide
tools to do so based on the distributive structure of prices and emissions in
segments of a diverse market, both for conventional as well as unconventional
engine technologies. We find that markets differ significantly between nations,
and that correlations between engine sizes, emissions and prices exist strongly
in some markets and not strongly in others. We furthermore find that markets
for unconventional engine technologies have patchy coverages of varying levels.
These findings are interpreted in terms of policy strategy.

is, it becomes customary to introduce it only in problems where there is a
negative cosmological constant. This practice is inherited from cosmological
approaches which consider the quantity $-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the constant pressure
due to a cosmological fluid. However, the notions of pressure and thermodynamic
volume in black hole thermodynamics are very different from their counterparts
in classical thermodynamics. From this point of view, there is \textit{a
priori} no compelling reason to not extend this notion of pressure and
associate a partial pressure with each external"" density $8\pi T_{t}{}^{t}$. In
this work, we associate a partial pressure with a variable mass parameter as

whether they are solutions to the Einstein field equations or not. We extend
the derivation to the case where the black hole is immersed in the field of a
quintessence force and to the multiforce case. Many applications and extensions
are considered, including applications to regular black holes derived in

implemented anew for each application. In this paper, we present JCloudScale, a
Java-based middleware that supports building elastic applications on top of a
public or private IaaS cloud. JCloudScale allows to easily bring applications
to the cloud, with minimal changes to the application code. We discuss the
general architecture of the middleware as well as its technical features, and
evaluate our system with regard to both, user acceptance (based on a user
study) and performance overhead. Our results indicate that JCloudScale indeed
allowed many participants to build IaaS applications more efficiently,
comparable to the convenience features provided by industrial
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. However, unlike PaaS, using JCloudScale
does not lead to a loss of control and vendor lock-in for the developer.

the unique optional solution of an appropriate Bank-El Karoui representation

an integral equation for the optimal investment boundary. In case the
underlying L\'evy process hits any real point with positive probability we show
that the integral equation for the investment boundary is uniquely satisfied by
the unique solution of another equation which is easier to handle. As a
remarkable by-product we prove the continuity of the optimal investment

selected s-process seed distributions. Here we present a detailed study of
p-process nucleosynthesis occuring in SNIa with s-process seeds at different

the dependence of p-nucleosynthesis on the s-seed distribution obtained from
different strengths of the 13C-pocket. Using a Galactic chemical evolution code

the range of light (A < 120) and heavy p-nuclei, at almost flat average
production factors (within a factor of about 3). We discussed in details

the age is crucial when studying stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems or
characterising stellar populations in the Galaxy. Asteroseismology is the
golden path to accurately obtain these characteristics. In this context, a key
question is how to make these methods less model-dependant. Aims. Building on
the work of Reese et al. (2012), we wish to extend the SOLA inversion technique
to new stellar global characteristics in addition to the mean density. The goal
is to provide a general framework in which to estimate these characteristics as
accurately as possible in low mass main sequence stars. Methods. First, we
describe our framework and discuss the reliability of the inversion technique
and the possible sources of error.We then apply this methodology to the
acoustic radius, an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative and the
mean density and compare it to estimates based on the average large and small
frequency separations. These inversions are carried out for several test cases
which include: various metallicities, different mixing-lengths, non-adiabatic
effects and turbulent pressure. Results. We observe that the SOLA method yields
accurate results in all test cases whereas results based on the large and small
frequency separations are less accurate and more sensitive to surface effects
and structural differences in the models. If we include the surface corrections
of Kjeldsen et al. (2008), we obtain results of comparable accuracy for the
mean density. Overall, the mean density and acoustic radius inversions are more
robust than the inversions for the age indicator. Moreover, the current
approach is limited to relatively young stars with radiative cores. Increasing
the number of observed frequencies improves the reliability and accuracy of the
method.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of multicasting two nested messages is studied over a class of
networks known as combination networks. A source multicasts two messages, a
common and a private message, to several receivers. A subset of the receivers
(called the public receivers) only demand the common message and the rest of
the receivers (called the private receivers) demand both the common and the
private message. Three encoding schemes are discussed that employ linear
superposition coding and their optimality is proved in special cases. The
standard linear superposition scheme is shown to be optimal for networks with
two public receivers and any number of private receivers. When the number of
public receivers increases, this scheme stops being optimal. Two improvements
are discussed: one using pre-encoding at the source, and one using a block
Markov encoding scheme. The rate-regions that are achieved by the two schemes
are characterized in terms of feasibility problems. Both inner-bounds are shown
to be the capacity region for networks with three (or fewer) public and any
number of private receivers. Although the inner bounds are not comparable in
general, it is shown through an example that the region achieved by the block
Markov encoding scheme may strictly include the region achieved by the
pre-encoding/linear superposition scheme. Optimality results are founded on the
general framework of Balister and Bollob\'as (2012) for sub-modularity of the
entropy function. An equivalent graphical representation is introduced and a
lemma is proved that might be of independent interest.
  Motivated by the connections between combination networks and broadcast
channels, a new block Markov encoding scheme is proposed for broadcast channels
with two nested messages. The rate-region that is obtained includes the
previously known rate-regions. It remains open whether this inclusion is
strict.

(LBNO) experiment is to study the L/E behaviour of the electron neutrino
appearance probability in order to determine the unknown phase $\delta_{CP}$.
In the standard neutrino 3-flavour mixing paradigm, this parameter encapsulates
a possibility of a CP violation in the lepton sector that in turn could help
explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In LBNO, the
measurement of $\delta_{CP}$ would rely on the observation of the electron
appearance probability in a broad energy range covering the 1$^{st}$ and
2$^{nd}$ maxima of the oscillation probability. An optimization of the energy
spectrum of the neutrino beam is necessary to find the best coverage of the
neutrino energies of interest. This in general is a complex task that requires
exploring a large parameter space describing hadron target and beamline
focusing elements. In this paper we will present a numerical approach of
finding a solution to this difficult optimization problem often encountered in
design of modern neutrino beamlines and we will show the improved LBNO
sensitivity to the presence of the leptonic CP violation attained after the
neutrino beam optimization.

cuprates is the nodal-antinodal dichotomy. While the nodal quasiparticles have
a Fermi liquid behaviour, the antinodal ones show non-Fermi liquid features and
an associated pseudogap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
electronic Raman scattering are two valuable tools which have shown universal
features which are rather material-independent, and presumably intrinsic to the
pseudogap phase. The doping and temperature dependence of the Fermi arcs and
the pseudogap observed by photoemission near the antinode correlates with the
non-Fermi liquid behaviour observed by Raman for the B$_{1g}$ mode. In
contrast, and similar to the nodal quasiparticles detected by photoemission,
the Raman B$_{2g}$ mode shows Fermi liquid features. We show that these two
experiments can be analysed, in the context of the $t$-$J$ model, by
self-energy effects in the proximity to a d-wave flux-phase order instability.
This approach supports a crossover origin for the pseudogap, and a scenario of
two competing phases. The B$_{2g}$ mode shows, in an underdoped case, a
depletion at intermediate energy which has attracted a renewed interest. We
study this depletion and discuss its origin and relation with the pseudogap.

entropy should be expressed as the logarithm of the phase volume (volume
entropy, also known as the Gibbs entropy) or as the logarithm of the density of
states (surface entropy, also known as the Boltzmann entropy). Rather than
postulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is
customary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy
expression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental
thermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for
quasi-static processes: $\delta Q/T$ is an exact differential, and (ii) the law
of ideal gases: $PV=k_B NT$. The first pillar implies that entropy must be some
function of the phase volume $\Omega$. The second pillar singles out the
logarithmic function among all possible functions. Hence the construction leads
uniquely to the expression $S= k_B \ln \Omega$, that is the volume entropy. As
a consequence any entropy expression other than that of Gibbs, e.g., the
Boltzmann entropy, can lead to inconsistencies with the two thermodynamic
pillars. We illustrate this with the prototypical example of a macroscopic
collection of non-interacting spins in a magnetic field, and show that the
Boltzmann entropy severely fails to predict the magnetization, even in the
thermodynamic limit. The uniqueness of the Gibbs entropy, as well as the
demonstrated potential harm of the Boltzmann entropy, provide compelling
reasons for discarding the latter at once.

The question is then how the dynamics given by the nonlocal model resembles the

Finally, we declare the inaccuracy of the PPP model, and reveal the general

by putting it in thermal contact with an individual quantum probe. If the
interaction time is sufficiently long so that the probe thermalizes, the
temperature can be read out directly from its steady state. Here we prove that
the optimal quantum probe, acting as a thermometer with maximal thermal
sensitivity, is an effective two-level atom with a maximally degenerate excited
state. When the total interaction time is insufficient to produce full
thermalization, we optimize the estimation protocol by breaking it down into
sequential stages of probe preparation, thermal contact and measurement. We
observe that frequently interrogated probes initialized in the ground state
achieve the best performance. For both fully and partly thermalized
thermometers, the sensitivity grows significantly with the number of levels,
though optimization over their energy spectrum remains always crucial.

such algorithms become exponential. This raises the question whether we can
always find a DAG decomposition of size polynomial in $n$ as it is the case for
tree width and all generalisations of tree width similar to DAG-width.
  We show that there is an infinite class of graphs such that every DAG
decomposition of optimal width has size super-polynomial in $n$ and, moreover,
there is no polynomial size DAG decomposition which would approximate an
optimal decomposition up to an additive constant.

mysterious molecules, which play surprisingly various roles in opposable
cellular processes, like autophagy, apoptosis, proliferation and
differentiation. Recently they have been also recognized as important
messengers in cellular signalling pathways. More importantly, sphingolipid
metabolism disorders were observed in various pathological conditions such as
cancer and neurodegeneration. Results: Existing formal models of sphingolipids
metabolism concentrates mostly on de novo ceramide synthesis or restrict their
focus to biochemical transformations of a particular subspecies. We propose
first comprehensive computational model of sphingolipid metabolism in human
tissue. In contrast to previous approaches we explicitly model
compartmentalization what allows emphasizing the differences among individual
organelles. Conclusions: Presented here model was validated by means of
recently proposed model analysis technics allowing for detection of most
sensitive and experimentally non-identifiable parameters and determination of
main sources of model variance. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of the
model for the study of molecular processes underlying Alzheimer's disease.

detected in 15 stars. Most of them have non-typical period ratio of the radial
modes. In the Petersen diagram, at a given period of the fundamental mode, they
are located significantly below or above the sequence formed by the majority of
RRd stars.
  Multi-periodic modulation is very frequent; two or three modulation periods
are detected in 8 stars. Modulation periods vary from ~20 to more than 300
days. Radial mode amplitudes can be modulated by a few to nearly hundred per
cent. Both radial modes may be modulated with the same period. More commonly
however, dominant modulation for the fundamental mode has different period than
dominant modulation for the first overtone. Quite often modulation of only one
mode is detected in the data. We find a clear feedback between pulsation
amplitude of the dominant mode and mean stellar brightness: lower the pulsation
amplitude, brighter the star. At phases of low pulsation amplitude, the mode
periods are prone to fast changes. All the stars share the common feature:
their pulsation properties are non-stationary. Amplitudes and phases of the
radial modes vary irregularly on a long time-scale of a few hundred or thousand
days. The short-term modulations are also irregular.
  One of the stars has switched the pulsation mode recently: from single-mode
fundamental mode pulsation to RRd state. In other star the non-radial mode with
characteristic ~0.61 period ratio to the first overtone is detected. This
non-radial mode is likely modulated with the same period as the radial modes.

crystals of the anisotropic ferromagnet MnBi are reported. The findings support
the importance of magneto-elastic effects in this material. X-ray diffraction
reveals a structural phase transition at the spin reorientation temperature
$T_{SR}$ = 90 K. The distortion is driven by magneto-elastic coupling, and upon
cooling transforms the structure from hexagonal to orthorhombic. Heat capacity
measurements show a thermal anomaly at the crystallographic transition, which
is suppressed rapidly by applied magnetic fields. Effects on the transport and
anisotropic magnetic properties of the single crystals are also presented.
Increasing anisotropy of the atomic displacement parameters for Bi with
increasing temperature above $T_{SR}$ is revealed by neutron diffraction
measurements. It is likely that this is directly related to the anisotropic
thermal expansion in MnBi, which plays a key role in the spin reorientation and
magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The identification of the true ground state
crystal structure reported here may be important for future experimental and
theoretical studies of this permanent magnet material, which have to date been

Here, we report a new class of SQEs based on excitons that are spatially
localized by defects in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide monolayers. The
optical emission from these SQEs shows narrow linewidths of ~0.13 meV, about
two orders of magnitude smaller than that of delocalized valley excitons.
Second-order correlation measurements reveal strong photon anti-bunching,
unambiguously establishing the single photon nature of the emission. The SQE
emission shows two non-degenerate transitions, which are cross-linearly
polarized. We assign this fine structure to two excitonic eigen-modes whose
degeneracy is lifted by a large ~0.71 meV coupling, likely due to the
electron-hole exchange interaction in presence of anisotropy. Magneto-optical
measurements also reveal an exciton g-factor of ~8.7, several times larger than
that of delocalized valley excitons. In addition to their fundamental
importance, establishing new SQEs in 2D quantum materials could give rise to
practical advantages in quantum information processing, such as efficient

that excitation of standing plasma waves at the interfaces between areas

that the formation of volume nanogratings induced by irradiation of femtosecond

strongly inclined (PA=155 deg.) compared to the east-west rotation of the main
disk. The nuclear molecular mass is estimated to 8e8 Msun with an average
N(H2)of 1.2e24 cm-2. Prominent, spatially extended (>350 pc) line wings are
found for HCN 3-2 with velocities +-750 km/s. Line ratios indicate that the
emission is emerging in dense gas n=1e4 - 5e5 cm-3 of elevated HCN abundance
X(HCN)=1e-8 to 1e-6. High X(HCN) also allows for the emission to originate in
gas of more moderate density. We tentatively detect nuclear emission from the
reactive ion HOC+ with HCO+/HOC+=10-20. The HCN v2=1f line emission is
consistent with the notion of a hot, dusty, warped inner disk of Mrk231 where
the v2=1f line is excited by bright mid-IR 14 micron continuum. We estimate the
vibrational temperature T_vib to 200-400 K. We propose that 50% of the main HCN
emission may have its excitation affected by the radiation field through IR
pumping of the vibrational ground state. The HCN emission in the line wings,
however, is more extended and thus likely not strongly affected by IR pumping.
Our results reveal that dense clouds survive (and/or are formed) in the AGN
outflow on scales of at least several hundred pc before evaporating or
collapsing. The elevated HCN abundance in the outflow is consistent with warm
chemistry possibly related to shocks and/or X-ray irradiated gas. An upper
limit to the mass and momentum flux is 4e8 Msun and 12L_AGN/c, respectively,

Kantorovich operators $S_w$ to seismic engineering. The mathematical theory of
these operators, both in the space of continuous functions and in Orlicz
spaces, show how it is possible to approximate/reconstruct multivariate
signals, such as images. In particular, to obtain applications for
thermographic images a mathematical algorithm is developed using MATLAB and
matrix calculus. The setting of Orlicz spaces is important since allow us to
reconstruct not necessarily continuous signals by means of $S_w$. The
reconstruction of thermographic images of buildings by our sampling Kantorovich
algorithm allow us to obtain models for the simulation of the behavior of
structures under seismic action. We analyze a real world case study in term of
structural analysis and we compare the behavior of the building under seismic
action using various models.

the general relativistic frame-dragging effect due to the rotation of the
Earth: the project name is GINGER (Gyroscopes IN GEneral Relativity), a
ground-based triaxial array of ring lasers aiming at measuring the Earth
rotation rate with an accuracy of 10^-14 rad/s. Such ambitious goal is now
within reach as large area ring lasers are very close to the necessary
sensitivity and stability. However, demanding constraints on the geometrical
stability of the laser optical path inside the ring cavity are required. Thus
we have started a detailed study of the geometry of an optical cavity, in order
to find a control strategy for its geometry which could meet the specifications
of the GINGER project. As the cavity perimeter has a stationary point for the
square configuration, we identify a set of transformations on the mirror
positions which allows us to adjust the laser beam steering to the shape of a
square. We show that the geometrical stability of a square cavity strongly
increases by implementing a suitable system to measure the mirror distances,
and that the geometry stabilization can be achieved by measuring the absolute
lengths of the two diagonals and the perimeter of the ring.

We assume two perfect fluid components, the matter component has a fixed
equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega$, while the torsion component has a
dynamical EoS. We obtain an effective scale factor allowing a graceful exit
inflation model with no need to slow roll technique. We perform a standard
cosmological study to examine the cosmic evolution. In addition, the effective
EoS shows consistent results confirming a smooth phase transition from
inflation to radiation dominant universe. We consider the case when the torsion
is made of a scalar field. This treatment enables us to induce a scalar field
sensitive to the spacetime symmetry with an effective potential constructed
from the quadratic $f(T)$ gravity. The model is parameterized by two parameters
($\alpha,\omega$) both derive the universe to exit out of de Sitter expansion.
The first is purely gravitational and works effectively at large Hubble regime
of the early stage allowing a slow roll potential. The second parameter
$\omega$ is a thermal-like correction coupled to the kinetic term and works
effectively at low Hubble regime of late stages. The slow roll analysis of the
obtained potential can perform tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index
parameters consistent with the recent Planck and BICEP2 data. Both cosmological
and scalar field analyses show consistent results.

considered. This may have some justification as regards string theory, but is
misguided as applied to five-dimensional theories with a large extra dimension.
Such theories smoothly embed general relativity, ensuring recovery of the
latter's observational support. When the embedding of spacetime is carried out
in accordance with Campbell's theorem, the resulting 5D theory naturally
explains the origin of classical matter and vacuum energy. Also, constraints on
the equations of motion near a high-energy surface or membrane in the 5D
manifold lead to quantization and quantum uncertainty. These are major returns
on the modest investment of one extra dimension. Instead of fruitless bickering
about whether it is possible to ""see"" the fifth dimension, it is suggested that
it be treated on par with other concepts of physics, such as time. The main
criterion for the acceptance of a fifth dimension (or not) should be its
usefulness.
