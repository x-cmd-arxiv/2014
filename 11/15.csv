to compute desired paths and ignore the specific requirements of users caused
by different physical strength, mobility and level of resistance to hazard. In
this paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) driven multi-path routing
algorithm to provide diverse paths for different categories of evacuees. This
algorithm borrows the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), which is a
flexible protocol that can rapidly solve optimal solution for any user-defined
goal function. Spatial information regarding the location and spread of hazards
is taken into consideration to avoid that evacuees be directed towards
hazardous zones. Furthermore, since previous emergency navigation algorithms
are normally insensitive to sudden changes in the hazard environment such as
abrupt congestion or injury of civilians, evacuees are dynamically assigned to
several groups to adapt their course of action with regard to their on-going
physical condition and environments. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed algorithm which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees produces better
results than the use of a single metric. Simulations also show that the use of
dynamic grouping to adjust the evacuees' category and routing algorithms with
regard for their on-going health conditions and mobility, can achieve higher
survival rates.

of certain wiring motifs compared to simple random-network models. This
structure is shaped, in part, by synaptic plasticity that promotes or
suppresses connections between neurons depending on their spiking activity.
Frequently, theoretical studies focus on how feedforward inputs drive
plasticity to create this network structure. We study the complementary
scenario of self-organized structure in a recurrent network, with spike
timing-dependent plasticity driven by spontaneous dynamics. We develop a
self-consistent theory that describes the evolution of network structure by
combining fast spiking covariance with a fast-slow theory for synaptic weight
dynamics. Through a finite-size expansion of network dynamics, we obtain a
low-dimensional set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of
two-synapse connectivity motifs. With this theory in hand, we explore how the
form of the plasticity rule drives the evolution of microcircuits in cortical
networks. When potentiation and depression are in approximate balance, synaptic
dynamics depend on the frequency of weighted divergent, convergent, and chain
motifs. For additive, Hebbian STDP, these motif interactions create
instabilities in synaptic dynamics that either promote or suppress the initial
network structure. Our work provides a consistent theoretical framework for
studying how spiking activity in recurrent networks interacts with synaptic
plasticity to determine network structure.

star-forming dwarf (SFD) galaxies detected by the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey

black body (MBB) function to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Stellar
and gas masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and metallicities are obtained
from the analysis of a set of ancillary data. Dust is detected in 49 out of 140
optically identified dwarfs covered by the HeViCS field; considering only
dwarfs brighter than $m_B$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. After
evaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the FIR-submm SEDs are
best-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $T_d$ = 22.4 K.
Assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five Herschel
bands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the MBB model. The excess is
inversely correlated with SFR and stellar masses. To study the variations in
the global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we compare
the Virgo SFDs to other Herschel surveys, such as KINGFISH, the Dwarf Galaxy
Survey (DGS), and the HeViCS bright galaxy catalogue (BGC). We explore the
relations between stellar mass and HI fraction, specific SFR, dust fraction,
gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. Highly HI-deficient
Virgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formation
activity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in cluster
dwarfs. However, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less than
that of the HI component. Since the Virgo SFDs are likely to be crossing the
cluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip the
more centrally concentrated dust distribution.

systematic. Yet for a given language or analysis feature, it often requires
tedious and error prone work to implement an analyzer and prove it sound. In
short, static analysis features and their proofs of soundness do not compose
well, causing a dearth of reuse in both implementation and metatheory.
  We solve the problem of systematically constructing static analyzers by
introducing Galois transformers: monad transformers that transport Galois
connection properties. In concert with a monadic interpreter, we define a
library of monad transformers that implement building blocks for classic
analysis parameters like context, path, and heap (in)sensitivity. Moreover,
these can be composed together independent of the language being analyzed.
  Significantly, a Galois transformer can be proved sound once and for all,
making it a reusable analysis component. As new analysis features and
abstractions are developed and mixed in, soundness proofs need not be
reconstructed, as the composition of a monad transformer stack is sound by
virtue of its constituents. Galois transformers provide a viable foundation for
reusable and composable metatheory for program analysis.
  Finally, these Galois transformers shift the level of abstraction in analysis
design and implementation to a level where non-specialists have the ability to
synthesize sound analyzers over a number of parameters.

optically thin accretion flows in spherical coordinates. By comparing the
vertically integrated advective cooling rate with the viscous heating rate, we
find that the former is generally less than 30% of the latter, which indicates
that the advective cooling itself cannot balance the viscous heating. As a
consequence, for radiatively inefficient flows with low accretion rates such as
$\dot M \la 10^{-3} \dot M_{Edd}$, where $\dot M_{Edd}$ is the Eddington
accretion rate, the viscous heating rate will be larger than the sum of the
advective cooling rate and the radiative cooling one. Thus, no thermal
equilibrium can be established under the no-outflow assumption. We therefore
argue that in such case outflows ought to occur and take away more than 70% of
the thermal energy generated by viscous dissipation. Similarly, for optically
thick flows with extremely large accretion rates such as $\dot M \ga 10 \dot
M_{Edd}$, outflows should also occur due to the limited advection and the low
efficiency of radiative cooling. Our results may help to understand the
mechanism of outflows found in observations and numerical simulations.

a typed, core functional language and contribute the first relatively complete
method for constructing counterexamples for PCF programs. The method is
relatively complete in the sense of Hoare logic; completeness is reduced to the
completeness of a first-order solver over the base types of PCF. In practice,
this means an SMT solver can be used for the effective, automated generation of
higher-order counterexamples for a large class of programs.
  We achieve this result by employing a novel form of symbolic execution for
higher-order programs. The remarkable aspect of this symbolic execution is that
even though symbolic higher-order inputs and values are considered, the path
condition remains a first-order formula. Our handling of symbolic function
application enables the reconstruction of higher-order counterexamples from
this first-order formula.
  After establishing our main theoretical results, we sketch how to apply the
approach to untyped, higher-order, stateful languages with first-class
contracts and show how counterexample generation can be used to detect contract
violations in this setting. To validate our approach, we implement a tool

class of stochastic processes. Particularly, the switching costs are modelled
by right-continuous with left-limits processes that are quasi-left-continuous
and can take both positive and negative values. We provide sufficient
conditions leading to a well known probabilistic representation of the value
function for the switching problem in terms of interconnected Snell envelopes.
We also prove the existence of an optimal strategy within a suitable class of

regress present on past and interpret the regression matrix $\hat{B}$ causally.
However, if there is an unmeasured time series $Z$ that influences $X$, then
this approach can lead to wrong causal conclusions, i.e., distinct from those
one would draw if one had additional information such as $Z$. In this paper we
take a different approach: We assume that $X$ together with some hidden $Z$
forms a first order vector autoregressive (VAR) process with transition matrix
$A$, and argue why it is more valid to interpret $A$ causally instead of
$\hat{B}$. Then we examine under which conditions the most important parts of
$A$ are identifiable or almost identifiable from only $X$. Essentially,
sufficient conditions are (1) non-Gaussian, independent noise or (2) no
influence from $X$ to $Z$. We present two estimation algorithms that are
tailored towards conditions (1) and (2), respectively, and evaluate them on
synthetic and real-world data. We discuss how to check the model using $X$.

Richardson's self-similar prediction, pointing to the intermittent nature of

the many different mechanisms involved; no single model captures all of these

is an important step in choosing which mechanisms need to be modeled for
particular types of cascading failure analysis. This work presents a dynamic
simulation model of both power networks and protection systems, which can
simulate a wider variety of cascading outage mechanisms, relative to existing
quasi-steady state (QSS) models. The model allows one to test the impact of
different load models and protections on cascading outage sizes. This paper
describes each module of the developed dynamic model and demonstrates how
different mechanisms interact. In order to test the model we simulated a batch
of randomly selected $N-2$ contingencies for several different static load
configurations, and found that the distribution of blackout sizes and event
lengths from the proposed dynamic simulator correlates well with historical
trends. The results also show that load models have significant impacts on the
cascading risks. This dynamic model was also compared against a QSS model based
on the dc power flow approximations; we find that the two models largely agree,
but produce substantially different results for later stages of cascading.

investigate two different intermittent regimes by varying the plasma beta

by the recurrent emergence of a large-scale coherent structure known as
two-channel flow, where the state of the system can be described by a single
Fourier mode. The second regime is dominated by the turbulence with sporadic
emergence of coherent structures with shapes that are reminiscent of a

far only approachable by deep learning architectures. Based on the seminal work

from random projections, we advance the state-of-the-art by proposing methods
that can efficiently train models with hundreds of millions of parameters, and
learn optimal representations from multiple kernels. We conduct extensive
empirical studies on problems from image recognition and automatic speech
recognition, and show that the performance of our kernel models matches that of
well-engineered deep neural nets (DNNs). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that a direct comparison between these two methods on
large-scale problems is reported. Our kernel methods have several appealing
properties: training with convex optimization, cost for training a single model
comparable to DNNs, and significantly reduced total cost due to fewer
hyperparameters to tune for model selection. Our contrastive study between
these two very different but equally competitive models sheds light on
fundamental questions such as how to learn good representations.

the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the new suite of MultiDark
cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density
profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. The MultiDark simulations
cover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15Msun and volumes upto 50Gpc**3. The
total number of dark matter halos in all the simulations exceeds 60 billion. We
find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make
~1% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo
concentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius
to the core radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density
profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the
core radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation.
Combining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show
that halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They start as rare
density peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial
infall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo.
Here, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the
concentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core
radius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion
becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region.
Now the concentration does not depend on halo mass. (3) Once the rate of
accretion slows down, halos move into the domain of declining
concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the
virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. We provide accurate
analytical fits to the numerical results for halo density profiles and
concentrations.

resolution and low spatial resolution. Conversely, multispectral images (MSIs)
usually have low spectral and high spatial resolutions. The problem of
inferring images which combine the high spectral and high spatial resolutions
of HSIs and MSIs, respectively, is a data fusion problem that has been the
focus of recent active research due to the increasing availability of HSIs and
MSIs retrieved from the same geographical area.
  We formulate this problem as the minimization of a convex objective function
containing two quadratic data-fitting terms and an edge-preserving regularizer.
The data-fitting terms account for blur, different resolutions, and additive
noise. The regularizer, a form of vector Total Variation, promotes
piecewise-smooth solutions with discontinuities aligned across the
hyperspectral bands.
  The downsampling operator accounting for the different spatial resolutions,
the non-quadratic and non-smooth nature of the regularizer, and the very large
size of the HSI to be estimated lead to a hard optimization problem. We deal
with these difficulties by exploiting the fact that HSIs generally ""live"" in a
low-dimensional subspace and by tailoring the Split Augmented Lagrangian
Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA), which is an instance of the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM), to this optimization problem, by means of a
convenient variable splitting. The spatial blur and the spectral linear
operators linked, respectively, with the HSI and MSI acquisition processes are
also estimated, and we obtain an effective algorithm that outperforms the
state-of-the-art, as illustrated in a series of experiments with simulated and

This paper makes two contributions to the inference of CNN video

  Signatures in Ultra-Wide Band Radar Imaging","14 pages,22 figures, Draft to be submitted to journal",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been found that radar returns of extended targets are not only sparse
but also exhibit a tendency to cluster into randomly located, variable sized
groups. However, the standard techniques of Compressive Sensing as applied in
radar imaging hardly considers the clustering tendency into account while
reconstructing the image from the compressed measurements. If the group
sparsity is taken into account, it is intuitive that one might obtain better
results both in terms of accuracy and time complexity as compared to the
conventional recovery techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). In
order to remedy this, techniques like Block OMP have been used in the existing
literature. An alternate approach is via reconstructing the signal by
transforming into the Hough Transform Domain where they become point-wise
sparse. However, these techniques essentially assume specific size and
structure of the groups and are not always effective if the exact
characteristics of the groups are not known, prior to reconstruction. In this
manuscript, a novel framework that we call locally adapting matching pursuit
(LAMP) have been proposed for efficient reconstruction of group sparse signals
from compressed measurements without assuming any specific size, location, or
structure of the groups. The recovery guarantee of the LAMP and its superiority
compared to the existing algorithms has been established with respect to
accuracy, time complexity and flexibility in group size. LAMP has been
successfully used on a real-world, experimental data set.

  with Bulletin of the World Health Organization",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Cause-of-death distributions are important for prioritising
interventions. We estimated proportions, risks, and numbers of deaths (with
uncertainty) for programme-relevant causes of neonatal death for 194 countries
for 2000-2013, differentiating between the early (days 0-6) and late (days
7-27) neonatal periods.
  Methods: For 65 high-quality VR countries, we used the observed early and
late neonatal proportional cause distributions. For the remaining 129
countries, we used multinomial logistic models to estimate the early and late
proportional cause distributions. We used separate models, with different
inputs, for low and high neonatal mortality countries. We applied these
cause-specific proportions to neonatal death estimates from the United Nations
by country/year to estimate cause-specific risks and numbers of deaths.
  Findings: Of the 2.76 million neonatal deaths in 2013, 0.99 (uncertainty:
0.70-1.31) million (35.7%) were estimated to be from preterm complications,
0.64 (uncertainty: 0.46-0.84) million (23.4%) from intrapartum-related
complications, and 0.43 (0.22-0.66) million (15.6%) from sepsis. Preterm
(40.8%) and intrapartum-related (27.0%) complications accounted for the
majority of early neonatal deaths while infections caused nearly half of late
neonatal deaths. In every region, preterm was the leading cause of neonatal
death, with the highest risks in Southern Asia (11.9 per 1000 livebirths) and
Sub-Saharan Africa (9.5).
  Conclusion: The neonatal cause-of-death distribution differs between the
early and late periods, and varies with NMR level and over time. To reduce
neonatal deaths, this knowledge must be incorporated into policy decisions. The
Every Newborn Action Plan provides stimulus for countries to update national
strategies and include high-impact interventions to address these causes.

from zero. In dimension one, we further assume that the trap distribution
decays sufficiently fast. Under these conditions, we show that the localisation
effects in the hybrid model are strongly dominated by the influence of the
parabolic Anderson model; the Bouchaud trap model plays at most a minor role.
Moreover, we distinguish regimes in which the Bouchaud trap model acts to
strengthen or weaken the localisation effects due to the parabolic Anderson
model, and also identify regimes in which the Bouchaud trap model has no
influence at all on localisation in the hybrid model.

that consists of several B-scans of the same location. The next step is the
batch alignment of the images using a sparse and low-rank decomposition based
technique. Finally the denoised image is created by median filtering of the
low-rank component of the processed data. Simultaneous decomposition and
alignment of the images result in better performance in comparison to simple
registration-based methods that are used in the literature for noise reduction

minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum.
In our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of

effect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the ""critical"" phase during
the evolution where quantum tunneling ""decides"" the right path to solution. In
a later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the
solution state. The predictions of the model accurately describe the
experimental data from the D-Wave Two quantum annealer at NASA Ames. In our
computational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of
success in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with
thermal hopping. Specifically, we provide an analysis of an optimization
problem with sixteen qubits, demonstrating eight qubit tunneling that increases
success probabilities. Furthermore, we report results for larger problems with
up to 200 qubits that contain the primitive as subproblems.

baryons and dark matter that clearly explains how it can shift the BAO scale in
the galaxy-galaxy correlation function. The shift occurs because the relative
velocity is non-zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the
correlation function asymmetrically about the BAO peak. We further show that in
configuration space the relative velocity has a localized, distinctive
signature in the three-point galaxy correlation function (3PCF). In particular,
we find that a multipole decomposition is a favorable way to isolate the
relative velocity in the 3PCF, and that there is a strong signature in the l=1
multipole for triangles with 2 sides around the BAO scale. Finally, we
investigate a further compression of the 3PCF to a function of only one
triangle side that preserves the localized nature of the relative velocity
signature while also nicely separating linear from non-linear bias. We expect
that this scheme will substantially lessen the computational burden of finding
the relative velocity in the 3PCF. The relative velocity's 3PCF signature can
be used to correct the shift induced in the galaxy-galaxy correlation function
so that no systematic error due to this effect is introduced into the BAO as
used for precision cosmology.

to identify dust-producing Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and massive
stars. The survey includes 37 dwarf spheroidal, 8 dwarf irregular, and 5

statistics on these rare phases of stellar evolution over the full metallicity
range. The photometry is >75% complete at the tip of the Red Giant Branch for

studied, the variability is dominated by changes in a power law continuum, both
in terms of changes in flux and power law index, which could be produced by
propagating fluctuations within the corona. Simulations are used to find unique
predictions for different physical models, and we then attempt to qualitatively
match the results from the simulations to the behaviour observed in the real
data. We are able to explain a large proportion of the variability in these
sources using simple models of spectral variability, but more complex models
may be needed for the remainder. We have begun the process of building up a
library of different principal components, so that spectral variability in AGN
can quickly be matched to physical processes. We show that PCA can be an
extremely powerful tool for distinguishing different patterns of variability in

bilayer states depending on its overall carrier density, $n$. We find the
insulator exhibits a resonance, which is characteristic of a bilayer solid. The

first examined: ribbons impulsively brighten, morphologically evolve, and
exponentially decay back to pre-flare levels. Upon closer inspection of H-alpha
flares, there is often a significant number of compact areas brightening in
concert with the flare eruption but are spatially separated from the evolving
flare ribbon. One class of these brightenings is known as sequential
chromospheric brightenings (SCBs). SCBs are often observed in the intimidate
vicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass ejections. In
the past decade there have been several previous investigations of SCBs. These
studies have exclusively relied upon H-alphaimages to discover and analyze
these ephemeral brightenings. This work employs the automated detection
algorithm of Kirk et al. (2011) to extract the physical qualities of SCBs in
observations of ground-based H-alpha images and complementary AIA images in
HeII, Civ, and 1700 \AA. The meta-data produced in this tracking process are
then culled using complementary Doppler velocities to isolate three
distinguishable types of SCBs. From a statistical analysis, we find that the
SCBs at the chromospheric H-alpha layer appear earlier, and last longer than
their corresponding signatures measured in AIA. From this multi-layer analysis,
we infer that SCBs are spatially constrained to the mid-chromosphere. We also
derive an energy budget to explain SCBs in which SCBs have a postulated energy
of not more than 0.01% of the total flare energy.

stem from different philosophical choices about how to learn from data or

physical quantities after the transition, but rather infinitely many. This is
entirely different from the case of $w > 1$ studied in \cite{Xue:2014}, where
$w$ approaches a constant value $w_c > 1$ as the universe contracts. In that
case a continuous transition through the big bang to yield a unique extension
was possible only for a discrete set of $w_c$ satisfying coprime conditions. We
also show that there exists another time variable, $N$, at the big bang
singularity itself, at $t=0$, where $w$, varies as a function of $N$. This
defines an {\em extended big bang state}. Within it, $H$ is infinity. In the
extended state, $w$ varies from a universe dominated by the cosmological
constant to $1$. After $w$ reaches $1$ then the big bang occurs and time $t >0$

decremental computation of betweenness centrality (BC), a graph parameter that
is widely used in the analysis of large complex networks. No nontrivial
decremental algorithm for either problem was known prior to our work. Our
method is a generalization of the decremental algorithm of Demetrescu and

precisely understood. Until recently, limitations in experimental methods have
made it challenging to test hypotheses about synaptic plasticity on a large
scale. However, as such data become available and these barriers are lifted, it
becomes necessary to develop analysis techniques to validate plasticity models.
Here, we present a highly extensible framework for modeling arbitrary synaptic
plasticity rules on spike train data in populations of interconnected neurons.
We treat synaptic weights as a (potentially nonlinear) dynamical system
embedded in a fully-Bayesian generalized linear model (GLM). In addition, we
provide an algorithm for inferring synaptic weight trajectories alongside the
parameters of the GLM and of the learning rules. Using this method, we perform
model comparison of two proposed variants of the well-known
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule, where nonlinear effects play a
substantial role. On synthetic data generated from the biophysical simulator
NEURON, we show that we can recover the weight trajectories, the pattern of

understand the features that make a video creative, and to address the problem
of automatic detection of creative content. Defining creative videos as those
that are novel and have aesthetic value, we conduct a crowdsourcing experiment
to create a dataset of over 3,800 micro-videos labelled as creative and
non-creative. We propose a set of computational features that we map to the
components of our definition of creativity, and conduct an analysis to
determine which of these features correlate most with creative video. Finally,
we evaluate a supervised approach to automatically detect creative video, with
promising results, showing that it is necessary to model both aesthetic value

to increase the charge-states of the trapped ions, thus providing storage times
on the order of minutes, allowing for decay-spectroscopy measurements. The

computation to label large datasets. Since the workers can be unreliable, it is
common in crowdsourcing to assign multiple workers to one task, and to
aggregate the labels in order to obtain results of high quality. In this paper,
we provide finite-sample exponential bounds on the error rate (in probability
and in expectation) of general aggregation rules under the Dawid-Skene
crowdsourcing model. The bounds are derived for multi-class labeling, and can
be used to analyze many aggregation methods, including majority voting,
weighted majority voting and the oracle Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule. We
show that the oracle MAP rule approximately optimizes our upper bound on the
mean error rate of weighted majority voting in certain setting. We propose an
iterative weighted majority voting (IWMV) method that optimizes the error rate
bound and approximates the oracle MAP rule. Its one step version has a provable
theoretical guarantee on the error rate. The IWMV method is intuitive and
computationally simple. Experimental results on simulated and real data show
that IWMV performs at least on par with the state-of-the-art methods, and it
has a much lower computational cost (around one hundred times faster) than the
state-of-the-art methods.

navigability of large-scale real-world social networks. However, the underlying
mechanism that drives real networks to be navigable is not yet well understood.
In this paper, we present a game theoretic model for the formation of navigable
small world networks. We model the network formation as a Distance-Reciprocity
Balanced (DRB) game in which people seek for both high reciprocity and
long-distance relationships. We show that the game has only two Nash
equilibria: One is the navigable small-world network, and the other is the
random network in which each node connects with each other node with equal
probability. We further show that the navigable small world is very stable ---
(a) no collusion of any size would benefit from deviating from it; and (b)
after an arbitrary deviations of a large random set of nodes, the network would
return to the navigable small world as soon as every node takes one
best-response step. In contrast, for the random network, a small group
collusion or random perturbations is guaranteed to move the network to the
navigable network as soon as every node takes one best-response step. Moreover,
we show that navigable small world has much better social welfare than the
random network, and provide the price-of-anarchy and price-of-stability results
of the game. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the system always
converges to the navigable network even when limited or no information about
other players' strategies is available, and the DRB game simulated on the
real-world network leads to navigability characteristic that is very close to
that of the real network. Our theoretical and empirical analyses provide
important new insight on the connection between distance, reciprocity and
navigability in social networks.

does not require appearance -- is hence more widely applicable than appearance
reliant methods, and invulnerable to related ambiguities such as textureless or

under diverse settings, along with comparatives with popular approaches based

less attention has been paid to the same effect in antiferromagnets. For the

in antiferromagnets, we perform spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance
measurements on Co20Fe60B20 4nm/Ir25Mn75 tIrMn nm/Pt 4 nm multilayers under a
spin Hall effect of Pt. The effective magnetic damping in Co20Fe60B20 is
modified by the spin current injected from the Pt layer via the IrMn layer. The
results indicate that the spin current interacts with IrMn magnetic moments and
exerts the anti-damping torque on the magnetic moments of Co20Fe60B20 through
the IrMn. It is also found that the reduction of the exchange bias in the
IrMn/Pt interface degrades the anti-damping torque exerted on the Co20Fe60B20
layer, suggesting the transmission of the spin torque becomes less efficient as
the interface exchange coupling degrades. Our work infers that the magnetic
moments in IrMn can be manipulated by spin torque similarly to the one in a

multi-patch training, introduced as part of this work. Multi-patch train- ing

achieves privacy by perturbing the public signals with additive noise, whose

Instead of the eigenvalue representation, the first two tensors, which
associate with the ""kinematic"" and ""dynamical"" cosmic web classification

parameters are defined as the rotational invariant coefficients of the
characteristic equation of the tensor. In the nonlinear local model (NLM) where

of characterizing the dynamics. Unlike the Zeldovich approximation (ZA), where
various morphologies do not change before approaching a one-dimensional

tensor and velocity shear would cause a filamentary final configuration of a
collapsing region, we show that the underdense perturbation are more subtle, as
the balance between the shear rate (tidal force) and the divergence (density)
could lead to different morphologies. Interestingly, this instability also sets
the basis for understanding some distinctions of the cosmic web identified
dynamically and kinematically. We show that the sheets with negative density
perturbation in the potential based algorithm would turn to filaments faster
than in the kinematic method, which could explain the distorted dynamical
filamentary structure observed in the simulation.

but with the inclusion of prompt reactions only. A one energy group
approximation is considered. The comparison of the two different theories is
made by using reaction intensities obtained in MCNPX simulations with a
simplified geometry for two scintillation detectors and a 252Cf-source enclosed
in a steel container. In addition, the variance to mean ratios, neutron, gamma
and total neutron-gamma, are evaluated experimentally for a weak 252Cf
neutron-gamma source in a steel container, a 137Cs random gamma source and a
22Na correlated gamma source. Due to the focus being on the possibility of
using neutron-gamma variance to mean theories for both reactor and safeguards
applications, we limited the present study to the general analytical
expressions for Feynman-Y formulas.

PCC6803 genome is
investigated to exhibit periodic and non-periodic correlation structures by
using the recurrence plot method and the phase space reconstruction technique.
The periodic correlation structures are generated by periodic transfer of
several substrings in long periodic or non-periodic nucleotide strings embedded
in the coding regions of genes. The non-periodic correlation structures are
generated by non-periodic transfer of several substrings covering or
overlapping with the coding regions of genes. In the periodic and non-periodic
transfer, some gaps divide the long nucleotide strings into the substrings and
prevent their global transfer. Most of the gaps are either the replacement of
one base or the insertion/reduction of one base. In the reconstructed phase
space, the points generated from two or three steps for the continuous
iterative transfer via the second maximal distance can be fitted by two lines.
It partly reveals an intrinsic dynamics in the transfer of nucleotide strings.
Due to the comparison of the relative positions and lengths, the substrings
concerned with the non-periodic correlation structures are almost identical to
the mobile elements annotated in the genome. The mobile elements are thus
endowed with the basic results on the correlation structures.

ejections (CMEs). This work is a new investigation of statistical relationships
between SEP peak intensities - deka-MeV protons and near-relativistic electrons
- and characteristic quantities of the associated solar activity. We consider
the speed of the CME and quantities describing the flare-related energy
release: peak flux and fluence of soft X-ray (SXR) emission, fluence of
microwave emission. The sample comprises 38 SEP events associated with strong
SXR bursts (classes M and X) in the western solar hemisphere between 1997 and
2006, and where the flare-related particle acceleration is accompanied by radio
bursts indicating electron escape to the interplanetary space. The main
distinction of the present statistical analysis from earlier work is that
besides the classical Pearson correlation coefficient the partial correlation
coefficients are calculated in order to disentangle the effects of correlations
between the solar parameters themselves. The classical correlation analysis
shows the usual picture of correlations with broad scatter between SEP peak
intensities and the different parameters of solar activity, and strong
correlations between the solar activity parameters themselves. The partial
correlation analysis shows that the only parameters that affect significantly
the SEP intensity are the CME speed and the SXR fluence. The SXR peak flux and
the microwave fluence have no additional contribution. We conclude that these
findings bring statistical evidence that both flare acceleration and CME shock
acceleration contribute to the deka-MeV proton and near-relativistic electron
populations in large SEP events.

standard multivariate maximum likelihood methods are affected by numerical
convergence issues and bad complexity, growing with the dimensionality of the

is broken down into several univariate ones, which are easier to solve.
Contrary to the multivariate maximum likelihood approach, the suggested
algorithm does not suffer heavily from the dimensionality of the model. The
method can be used for time series forecasting. In addition, simulation results
show that our approach performs at least as well as a maximum likelihood

special channel property in down- link massive MIMO systems, but involve high
complexity since complicated matrix inversion of large size is required. In
this paper, we propose a low-complexity linear precoding scheme based on the
Gauss-Seidel (GS) method. The proposed scheme can achieve the
capacity-approaching performance of the classical linear precoding schemes in
an iterative way without complicated matrix inversion, which can reduce the
overall complexity by one order of magnitude. The performance guarantee of the
proposed GS-based precoding is analyzed from the following three aspects. At
first, we prove that GS-based precoding satisfies the transmit power
constraint. Then, we prove that GS-based precoding enjoys a faster convergence
rate than the recently proposed Neumann-based precoding. At last, the
convergence rate achieved by GS-based precoding is quantified, which reveals
that GS-based precoding converges faster with the increasing number of BS
antennas. To further accelerate the convergence rate and reduce the complexity,
we propose a zone-based initial solution to GS-based precoding, which is much
closer to the final solution than the traditional initial solution. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms Neumann- based
precoding, and achieves the exact capacity-approaching performance of the
classical linear precoding schemes with only a small number of iterations both
in Rayleigh fading channels and spatially correlated channels.

networks. Consider the downlink of a cloud-radio access network (C-RAN), where
the cloud is only responsible for the scheduling policy and the synchronization
of the transmit frames across the connected base-stations (BS). The transmitted
frame of every BS consists of several time/frequency blocks, called power-zones
(PZ), maintained at fixed transmit power. The paper considers the problem of
scheduling users to PZs and BSs in a coordinated fashion across the network, by
maximizing a network-wide utility under the practical constraint that each user
cannot be served by more than one base-station, but can be served by one or
more power-zone within each base-station frame. The paper solves the problem
using a graph theoretical approach by introducing the scheduling graph in which
each vertex represents an association of users, PZs and BSs. The problem is
formulated as a maximum weight clique, in which the weight of each vertex is
the benefit of the association represented by that vertex. The paper further
presents heuristic algorithms with low computational complexity. Simulation
results show the performance of the proposed algorithms and suggest that the
heuristics perform near optimal in low shadowing environments

internal magnetic and thermal structures therein, thereby having seismological
applications in the solar atmosphere. We investigate the evolution of fast
magnetoacoustic pulses in randomly structured plasmas, in the context of
large-scale propagating waves in the solar atmosphere. We perform one
dimensional numerical simulations of fast wave pulses propagating perpendicular
to a constant magnetic field in a low-$\beta$ plasma with a random density
profile across the field. Both linear and nonlinear regimes are considered. We
study how the evolution of the pulse amplitude and width depends on their
initial values and the parameters of the random structuring. A randomly
structured plasma acts as a dispersive medium for a fast magnetoacoustic pulse,
causing amplitude attenuation and broadening of the pulse width. After the
passage of the main pulse, secondary propagating and standing fast waves appear
in the plasma. Width evolution of both linear and nonlinear pulses can be well
approximated by linear functions; however, narrow pulses may have zero or
negative broadening. This arises because a narrow pulse is prone to splitting,
while a broad pulse usually deviates less from their initial Gaussian shape and
form ripple structures on top of the main pulse. A linear pulse decays at
almost a constant rate, while a nonlinear pulse decays exponentially. A pulse
interacts most efficiently with a random medium which has a correlation length
of about half of its initial pulse width. The development of a detailed model
of a fast MHD pulse propagating in highly structured medium substantiates the
interpretation of EIT waves as fast magnetoacoustic waves. Evolution of a fast
pulse provides us with a novel method to diagnose the sub-resolution
filamentation of the solar atmosphere.

bisimilarity checking algorithm on infinite state systems which runs in
polynomial time. This result spots an instance in which branching bisimilarity

single unit quaternion, yielding a new perspective despite the equivalent
mathematics. This paper first demonstrates a useable map that allows
Bloch-sphere rotations to be represented as quaternionic multiplications,
simplifying the form of the dynamical equations. Left-multiplications generally
correspond to non-unitary transformations, providing a simpler (essentially
classical) analysis of time-reversal. But the quaternion viewpoint also reveals
a surprisingly large broken symmetry, as well as a potential way to restore it,
via a natural expansion of the state space that has parallels to second order
fermions. This expansion to ""second order qubits"" would imply either a larger
gauge freedom or a natural space of hidden variables.

digraph are considered. The minimum (or average) dwell time that guarantees the
asymptotic stability can be computed by calculating the maximum cycle ratio (or
maximum cycle mean) of a doubly weighted digraph where weights depend on the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of subsystem matrices. The graph-based method is
applied to systems with defective subsystem matrices using Jordan
decomposition. In the case of bimodal switched systems scaling algorithms that
minimizes the condition number can be used to give a better minimum (or
average) dwell time estimates.
