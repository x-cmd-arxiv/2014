have spin-dependent order parameters (OPs) with mixed parity which can also
have nodes in the pair potential as well as the energy spectra. These nodes are
distinct features that are not present in conventional superconductors. They
appear as points or lines in the momentum space where the latter can have
angular or radial geometries dictated by the dimensionality, the lattice
structure and the pairing interaction.
  In this work we study the nodes in time reversal symmetry (TRS) preserving
NCSs at the OP, the pair potential, and the energy spectrum levels. Nodes are
examined by using spin independent pairing interactions respecting the
rotational $C_{\infty v}$ symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling
(SOC). The pairing symmetries and the nodal topology are affected by the
relative strength of the pairing channels which is studied for the mixed
singlet-triplet, pure singlet, and pure triplet. Complementary to the angular
line nodes widely present in the literature, the $C_{\infty v}$ symmetry here
allows radial line nodes (RLNs) due to the nonlinear momentum dependence in the
OPs. The topology of the RLNs in the mixed case shows a distinctly different
characterization than the half-spin quantum vortex at the Dirac point. We apply
this NCS physics to the inversion symmetry broken exciton condensates (ECs) in
double quantum wells where the point and the RLNs can be found. On the other
hand, for a pure triplet condensate, two fully gapped and topologically
distinct regimes exist, separated by a QSHI-like zero energy superconducting
state with even number of Majorana modes. We also remark on how the point and
the RLNs can be manipulated, enabling an external control on the
topology.tions.

competitive ratio of the problem is $n-\omega(1)$, where n is the number of

well with the numerical calculations. At high magnetic regime, a self-similar

However, due to the delay spread in broadband systems and the distributed

frequency-selectivity and is robust against synchronization errors while not

of the tearing instability in a current layer as it is being formed. Such an
analysis is performed here in the context of nonlinear resistive MHD for a
generic time-dependent equilibrium representing a gradually forming current
sheet. It is shown that two onset regimes, single-island and multi-island, are
possible, depending on the rate of current sheet formation. A simple model is
used to compute the criterion for transition between these two regimes, as well
as the reconnection onset time and the current sheet parameters at that moment.
For typical solar corona parameters this model yields results consistent with
observations.

  cluttered images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic extraction methods typically assume that line segments are
pronounced, thin, few and far between, do not cross each other, and are noise
and clutter-free. Since these assumptions often fail in realistic scenarios,
many line segments are not detected or are fragmented. In more severe cases,
i.e., many who use the Hough Transform, extraction can fail entirely. In this
paper, we propose a method that tackles these issues. Its key aspect is the
combination of thresholded image derivatives obtained with filters of large and
small footprints, which we denote as contextual and local edges, respectively.
Contextual edges are robust to noise and we use them to select valid local
edges, i.e., local edges that are of the same type as contextual ones:
dark-to-bright transition of vice-versa. If the distance between valid local
edges does not exceed a maximum distance threshold, we enforce connectivity by
marking them and the pixels in between as edge points. This originates
connected edge maps that are robust and well localized. We use a powerful
two-sample statistical test to compute contextual edges, which we introduce
briefly, as they are unfamiliar to the image processing community. Finally, we
present experiments that illustrate, with synthetic and real images, how our
method is efficient in extracting complete segments of all lengths and widths
in several situations where current methods fail.

only improves the audience reach of the user but also boosts the perceived
social reputation and popularity. This has led to a scope for an underground
market that provides followers, likes, comments, etc. via a network of
fraudulent and compromised accounts and various collusion techniques.
  In this paper, we landscape the underground markets that provide Twitter
followers by studying their basic building blocks - merchants, customers and
phony followers. We charecterize the services provided by merchants to
understand their operational structure and market hierarchy. Twitter
underground markets can operationalize using a premium monetary scheme or other
incentivized freemium schemes. We find out that freemium market has an
oligopoly structure with few merchants being the market leaders. We also show
that merchant popularity does not have any correlation with the quality of
service provided by the merchant to its customers. Our findings also shed light
on the characteristics and quality of market customers and the phony followers
provided. We draw comparison between legitimate users and phony followers, and
find out key identifiers to separate such users. With the help of these
differentiating features, we build a supervised learning model to predict
suspicious following behaviour with an accuracy of 89.2%.

the existence of a linear functional such that the polynomials become

We developed algorithms based on two different techniques for determining the

Their application to a synthetic sample of coeval stars shows the intrinsic

less peaked and slightly shifted towards lower ages if compared with ages in

strongly affected by both spin-orbit coupling and, when present, by the nematic
order. These two effects have different physical origins, yet they can lead to
similar gap features in the electronic spectrum. Here we show how to
disentangle them experimentally in the iron superconductors with one Fe plane
per unit cell. Although the splitting of the low energy doublet at the
Brillouin zone center ($\Gamma$-point) can be due to either the spin-orbit
coupling or the nematic order, or both, the degeneracy of each of the doublet
states at the zone corner ($M$-point) is protected by the space group symmetry
even when spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. Therefore, any splitting
at $M$ must be due to lowering of the crystal symmetry, such as due to the
nematic order. We further analyze a microscopic tight-binding model with two
different contributions to the nematic order: $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ onsite energy
anisotropy and the $d_{xy}$ hopping anisotropy. We find that a precise
determination of the former, which has been widely used to characterize the
nematic phase, requires a simultaneous measurement of the splittings of the
$\Gamma$-point doublet and at the two low-energy $M$-point doublets. We also
discuss the impact of twin domains and show how our results shed new light on

a free parameter in the model. Our best fit model is able to reproduce the

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1409.4117",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Relationalism -- along the lines developed by Barbour and collaborators in
the past 3 decades -- can be considered an advance with 1/4 of the facets of
the canonical approach's Problem of Time as identified by Isham and Kuchar.
Indeed, almost all of the Problem of Time facets have classical counterparts,
since they arise from consequences of demanding background independence rather
than about combining GR and QM per se. Moreover the quantum version is harder,
while the classical counterpart provides some suggestions through being more
solvable. The suggestion then is to consider the effect of this advance on the
Problem of Time as a whole, as opposed to repeating the same classical portion
for a different redundancy group acting on the configuration space: shape
dynamics. There are indeed some knock-on effects because the facets are
notoriously not independent. The other facets do also however require distinct
insights. Finally, I comment on the above being `metric' background
independence, whereas quantum gravity usually assumes many other levels of
background structures. Whilst Isham already wrote about this over two decades
ago, it has largely not yet been incorporated into quantum gravity programs,
and could well be a good area to extend and re-envigour by use of relational
thinking.

nutrient conditions is known to depend on the mean growth rate only. However,
the joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth
rate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i)
revealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder
mechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size
and doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these
variables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to
elucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division
control mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We
found that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and
doubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the
shape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these
joint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells
do not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either
growth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results
emerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder
mechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the
so-called ""division hazard rate function"", which defines the probability rate
of dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for
the universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across
many microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms.
Additionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in
the relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can
be understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.

data reduction and also eliciting intrinsic structure of multi-dimensional
array data. It has been used in many applications, and some of them involve
incomplete data. To obtain HOSVD of the data with missing values, one can first
impute the missing entries through a certain tensor completion method and then
perform HOSVD to the reconstructed data. However, the two-step procedure can be
inefficient and does not make reliable decomposition.
  In this paper, we formulate an incomplete HOSVD problem and combine the two
steps into solving a single optimization problem, which simultaneously achieves
imputation of missing values and also tensor decomposition. We also present two
algorithms for solving the problem based on block coordinate update. Global
convergence of both algorithms is shown under mild assumptions. The convergence
of the second algorithm implies that of the popular higher-order orthogonality
iteration (HOOI) method, and thus we, for the first time, give global
convergence of HOOI.
  In addition, we compare the proposed methods to state-of-the-art ones for
solving incomplete HOSVD and also low-rank tensor completion problems and
demonstrate the superior performance of our methods over other compared ones.
Furthermore, we apply them to face recognition and MRI image reconstruction to
show their practical performance.

information in a way that is consistent with one's preexisting beliefs. It is
omnipresent in psychology, economics, and even scientific practices. Prior
theoretical research of this phenomenon has mainly focused on its economic
implications possibly missing its potential connections with broader notions of
cognitive science. Methodology/Principal Findings: We formulate a
(non-Bayesian) model for revising subjective probabilistic opinion of a
confirmationally-biased agent in the light of a persuasive opinion. The
revision rule ensures that the agent does not react to persuasion that is
either far from his current opinion or coincides with it. We demonstrate that
the model accounts for the basic phenomenology of the social judgment theory,
and allows to study various phenomena such as cognitive dissonance and
boomerang effect. The model also displays the order of presentation effect|when
consecutively exposed to two opinions, the preference is given to the last
opinion (recency) or the first opinion (primacy)|and relates recency to
confirmation bias. Finally, we study the model in the case of repeated
persuasion and analyze its convergence properties. Conclusions: The standard
Bayesian approach to probabilistic opinion revision is inadequate for
describing the observed phenomenology of persuasion process. The simple
non-Bayesian model proposed here does agree with this phenomenology and is
capable of reproducing a spectrum of effects observed in psychology:
primacy-recency phenomenon, boomerang effect and cognitive dissonance. We point
out several limitations of the model that should motivate its future
development.

has been extensively investigated in recent years. To achieve accurate and
reliable estimation of the human pose, it is well-recognized that the clothing
attributes are useful and should be utilized properly. Most previous

are therefore very costly. In this paper, we shall propose and explore a
\emph{latent} clothing attribute approach for HPE. Unlike previous approaches,
our approach models the clothing attributes as latent variables and thus
requires no explicit labeling for the clothing attributes. The inference of the
latent variables are accomplished by utilizing the framework of latent
structured support vector machines (LSSVM). We employ the strategy of
\emph{alternating direction} to train the LSSVM model: In each iteration, one
kind of variables (e.g., human pose or clothing attribute) are fixed and the
others are optimized. Our extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks
show the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed approach.

continuum. We give a detailed description of the model, which is then applied
to study the mechanism of short laser pulse melting of free standing Si films.
The effect of laser-induced pressure and temperature of the lattice on the
melting kinetics is investigated. Two competing melting mechanisms,
heterogeneous and homogeneous, were identified. Apart of classical
heterogeneous melting mechanism, the nucleation of the liquid phase
homogeneously inside the material significantly contributes to the melting
process. The simulations showed, that due to the open diamond structure of the
crystal, the laser-generated internal compressive stresses reduce the crystal
stability against the homogeneous melting. Consequently, the latter can take a
massive character within several picoseconds upon the laser heating. Due to
negative volume of melting of modeled Si material, -7.5%, the material
contracts upon the phase transition, relaxes the compressive stresses and the
subsequent melting proceeds heterogeneously until the excess of thermal energy
is consumed. The threshold fluence value, at which homogeneous nucleation of
liquid starts contributing to the classical heterogeneous propagation of the
solid-liquid interface, is found from the series of simulations at different
laser input fluences. On the example of Si, the laser melting kinetics of
semiconductors was found to be noticeably different from that of metals with

communicated by task-driven neural correlations that are significantly delayed
across secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor, and motor areas when decision

consistently vanish across all cortical areas.

planetary formation either by impacts of planetary bodies or disruption of
satellites or passing bodies, and satellites can be formed by accretion of disk
particles spreading across the Roche limit. Previous N-body simulation of lunar
accretion focused on the formation of single-satellite systems from disks with
large disk-to-planet mass ratios, while recent models of the formation of
multiple-satellite systems from disks with smaller mass ratios do not take
account of gravitational interaction between formed satellites. In the present
work, we investigate satellite accretion from particle disks with various
masses, using N-body simulation. In the case of accretion from somewhat less
massive disks than the case of lunar accretion, formed satellites are not
massive enough to clear out the disk, but can become massive enough to
gravitationally shepherd the disk outer edge and start outward migration due to
gravitational interaction with the disk. When the radial location of the 2:1
mean motion resonance of the satellite reaches outside the Roche limit, the
second satellite can be formed near the disk outer edge, and then the two
satellites continue outward migration while being locked in the resonance.
Co-orbital satellites are found to be occasionally formed on the orbit of the
first satellite. Our simulations also show that stochastic nature involved in
gravitational interaction and collision between aggregates in the tidal
environment can lead to diversity in the final mass and orbital architecture,
which would be expected in satellite systems of exoplanets.

interaction between LSMO layers is mediated by the intervening LNO, such that
the angle between the magnetization of neighboring LSMO layers varies in an
oscillatory manner with the thickness of the LNO layer. The magnetic field,
temperature, and spacer thickness dependence of the non-collinear structure are
inconsistent with the bilinear and biquadratic interactions that are used to
model the magnetic structure in conventional metallic multilayers. A model that
couples the LSMO layers to a helical spin state within the LNO fits the

between a spatially varying spin susceptibility within the LNO and interfacial
charge transfer that creates localized Ni2+ states. This provides a new
approach to engineering non-collinear spin textures in metallic oxide

with multiple dynamic leaders in both the discrete-time domain and the
continuous-time domain. The leaders' motions are described by $(n-1)$-order
polynomial trajectories. This setting makes practical sense because given some
critical points, the leaders' trajectories are usually planned by the
polynomial interpolations. In order to drive all followers into the convex hull
spanned by the leaders, a $PI^n$-type ($P$ and $I$ are short for {\it
Proportion} and {\it Integration}, respectively; $I^n$ implies that the
algorithm includes high-order integral terms) containment algorithm is
proposed. It is theoretically proved that the $PI^n$-type containment algorithm
is able to solve the containment problem of multi-agent systems where the
followers are described by any order integral dynamics. Compared with the
previous results on the multi-agent systems with dynamic leaders, the
distinguished features of this paper are that: (1) the containment problem is
studied not only in the continuous-time domain but also in the discrete-time
domain while most existing results only work in the continuous-time domain; (2)
to deal with the leaders with the $(n-1)$-order polynomial trajectories,
existing results require the follower's dynamics to be $n$-order integral while
the followers considered in this paper can be described by any-order integral;
and (3) the ""sign"" function is not employed in the proposed algorithm, which
avoids the chattering phenomenon. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the
practical value of the proposed approach, an application, the containment
control of multiple mobile robots is studied. Finally, two simulation examples
are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

automorphic forms on unitary groups of arbitrary signature, we prove an

exploit this similarity to describe the dynamics of life saturating the
universe on a cosmic scale, adapting the phase transition model to incorporate
probability distributions of expansion and resource consumption strategies.
Through a series of numerical solutions spanning several orders of magnitude in
the input assumption parameters, the resulting cosmological model is used to
address basic questions related to the intergalactic spreading of life, dealing
with issues such as timescales, observability, competition between strategies,
and first-mover advantage. Finally, we examine physical effects on the universe
itself, such as reheating and the backreaction on the evolution of the scale
factor, if such life is able to control and convert a significant fraction of
the available pressureless matter into radiation. We conclude that the
existence of life, if certain advanced technologies are practical, could have a
significant influence on the future large-scale evolution of the universe.

unveil why in the cuprates the Cooper pairs are so strongly bound to work out
the extraordinary high Tc. From one-to-one correspondence between numerical
simulation on a microscopic cuprate model and a simple two-component fermion
model, we show that hidden fermions emerge from the strong electron correlation

from a conventional pairing mediated by some bosonic glue, such as phonons in
conventional superconductors. The hidden fermions survive even above Tc and
generate the strange-metal pseudogap phase. This reveals an unprecedented
direct relationship between the pseudogap phase and superconductivity in the

iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding thresholds, with particular emphasis
on low-latency windowed decoding (WD). We consider transmission over both the
binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise
channel (BIAWGNC) and present results for a variety of $(J,K)$-regular SC-LDPC
code ensembles constructed over GF$(q)$ using protographs. Thresholds are
calculated using protograph versions of $q$-ary density evolution (for the BEC)
and $q$-ary extrinsic information transfer analysis (for the BIAWGNC). We show
that WD of $q$-ary SC-LDPC codes provides significant threshold gains compared
to corresponding (uncoupled) $q$-ary LDPC block code (LDPC-BC) ensembles when
the window size $W$ is large enough and that these gains increase as the finite
field size $q=2^m$ increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the new design
rules provide WD thresholds that are close to capacity, even when both $m$ and
$W$ are relatively small (thereby reducing decoding complexity and latency).
The analysis further shows that, compared to standard flooding-schedule
decoding, WD of $q$-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles results in significant
reductions in both decoding complexity and decoding latency, and that these
reductions increase as $m$ increases. For applications with a near-threshold
performance requirement and a constraint on decoding latency, we show that
using $q$-ary SC-LDPC code ensembles, with moderate $q>2$, instead of their
binary counterparts results in reduced decoding complexity.

to re-study the role of feedback in the AGN-host coevolution issue in terms of
their [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission line profile. The spectra of these objects
enable us to determine the AGN's accretion properties directly from their broad
H$\alpha$ emission. This is essential for getting rid of the ""circular
reasoning"" in our previous study of narrow emission-line galaxies, in which the
[OIII] emission line was used not only as a proxy of AGN's bolometric
luminosity, but also as a diagnostic of outflow. In addition, the measurement
of $D_n(4000)$ index is improved by removing an underlying AGN's continuum
according to the corresponding broad H$\alpha$ emission. With these
improvements, we confirm and reinforce the correlation between
$L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and stellar population age. More important is that this
correlation is found to be related to both [OIII] line blue asymmetry and bulk
blueshift velocity, which suggests a linkage between SMBH growth and host star
formation through the feedback process. The current sample of partially
obscured AGNs shows that the composite galaxies have younger host stellar
population, higher Eddington ratio, less significant [OIII] blue wing and
smaller bulk [OIII] line shift than do the Seyfert galaxies .

  Space","Extended version of NIPS 2014 paper",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density
estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation
in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel
density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE
is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What
""robustness"" means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward
and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the
traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the $L^2$ norm.
This yields a scaled and projected KDE (SPKDE). Because the squared $L^2$ norm
penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to
allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of
the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that
asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient
conditions on the contamination.

correlations. This includes broadcasting of quantum entanglement as well as
correlations that go beyond the notion of entanglement. It is quite well known
from the ""No-Broadcasting theorem"" that perfect broadcasting of quantum
correlation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of
partial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states
from a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of
broadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general
representation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a
cloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery
(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of
ranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be
possible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general
two qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go
beyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners.
Remarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such
correlations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines. Taking
two different types Buzek-Hillery quantum cloners (state dependent and state
independent) we analytically prove the impossibility of even partial
broadcasting of correlation. Lastly, we generalize this impossibility result
for any symmetric or asymmetric cloning machines as well. This result brings
out a fundamental difference between the correlation defined from the
perspective of entanglement and the correlation measure which claims to go
beyond entanglement.

Rabin cryptosystem without using the Jacobi symbol, message redundancy
technique or the needs of extra bits in order to specify the correct plaintext.
Our system involves only a single prime number as the decryption key and does
only one modular exponentiation. Consequently, this will practically reduce the
computational efforts during decryption process. We demonstrate that the
decryption is unique and proven to be equivalent to factoring.The scheme is
performs better when compared to a number of Rabin cryptosystem variants.

  arXiv:0901.4379 by other authors",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interference alignment (IA) techniques mostly attain their degrees of freedom
(DoF) benefits as the number of channel extensions tends to infinity.
Intuitively, the more interfering signals that need to be aligned, the larger
the number of dimensions needed to align them. This requirement poses a major
challenge for IA in practical systems. This work evaluates the necessary and
sufficient conditions on channel structure of a fully connected interference
network with time-varying fading to make perfect IA feasible within limited
number of channel extensions. We propose a method based on the obtained
conditions on the channel structure to achieve perfect IA. For the case of $3$
user interference channel, it is shown that only one condition on channel
coefficients is required to make perfect IA feasible at all receivers. IA
feasibility literature have mainly focused on network topology so far. In
contrast, derived channel aiding conditions in this work can be considered as
the perfect IA feasibility conditions on channel structure.

adequately represent the statistics that may be driving the observations. But
rich model classes may be too complex to admit estimators that converge to the
truth with convergence rates that can be uniformly bounded over the entire
collection of probability distributions comprising the model class, i.e. it may
be impossible to guarantee uniform consistency of such estimators as the sample
size increases. In such cases, it is conventional to settle for estimators with
guarantees on convergence rate where the performance can be bounded in a
model-dependent way, i.e. pointwise consistent estimators. But this viewpoint
has the serious drawback that estimator performance is a function of the
unknown model within the model class that is being estimated, and is therefore
unknown. Even if an estimator is consistent, how well it is doing at any given
time may not be clear, no matter what the sample size of the observations.
  Departing from the classical uniform/pointwise consistency dichotomy that
leads to this impasse, a new analysis framework is explored by studying rich
model classes that may only admit pointwise consistency guarantees, yet all the
information about the unknown model driving the observations that is needed to
gauge estimator accuracy can be inferred from the sample at hand. We expect
that this data-derived estimation framework will be broadly applicable to a
wide range of estimation problems by providing a methodology to deal with much
richer model classes. In this paper we analyze the lossless compression problem
in detail in this novel data-derived framework.

cluster weight in the partition function of the traditional site percolation.
To simulate the model on a square lattice, we combine the color-assignation and
the Swendsen-Wang methods together to design a highly efficient cluster
algorithm with a small critical slowing-down phenomenon. To verify whether or
not it is consistent with the bond random cluster model, we measure several
quantities such as the wrapping probability $R_e$, the percolation strength
$P_\infty$, and the magnetic susceptibility per site $\chi_p$ as well as two
exponents such as the thermal exponent $y_t$ and the fractal dimension $y_h$ of
the largest cluster. We find that for different exponents of cluster weight
q=1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4, the numerical estimation of the exponents $y_t$
and $y_h$ are consistent with the theoretical values. The universalities of the
site random cluster model and the bond random cluster model are completely
identical. For larger values of $q$, we find obvious signatures of the
first-order percolation transition by the histograms and the hysteresis loops
of the percolation strength and the energy per site. Our results are helpful
for the understanding of the percolation of traditional statistical models.

domain, division by zero is excluded. We introduce ""fracpairs"" as pairs subject
to laws consistent with the use of the pair as a fraction, but do not exclude
denominators to be zero. We investigate fracpairs over a reduced commutative
ring (a commutative ring that has no nonzero nilpotent elements) and provide
these with natural definitions for addition, multiplication, and additive and
multiplicative inverse. We find that modulo a simple congruence these fracpairs
constitute a ""common meadow"", which is a commutative monoid both for addition
and multiplication, extended with a weak additive inverse, a multiplicative
inverse except for zero, and an additional element ""a"" that is the image of the
multiplicative inverse on zero and that propagates through all operations.
Considering ""a"" as an error-value supports the intuition.
  The equivalence classes of fracpairs thus obtained are called common
cancellation fractions (cc-fractions), and cc-fractions over the integers
constitute a homomorphic pre-image of the common meadow Qa, the field Q of
rational numbers expanded with an a-totalized inverse. Moreover, the initial
common meadow is isomorphic to the initial algebra of cc-fractions over the
integer numbers. Next, we define canonical term algebras for cc-fractions over
the integers and some meadows that model the rational numbers expanded with a
totalized inverse, and provide some negative results concerning their
associated term rewriting properties. Then we consider reduced commutative
rings in which the sum of two squares plus one cannot be a zero divisor: by
extending the equivalence relation on fracpairs we obtain an initial algebra
that is isomorphic to Qa. Finally, we express negative conjectures concerning
alternative specifications for these (concrete) datatypes.

that, when they are violated, ecological bias cannot be avoided unless the a
suitable model for the effect of specific covariates is incorporated into

cannot be corrected even if the effect of covariates is incorporated into the

weak and certain transition probabilities are similar functions of a given
covariate, ecological inference methods may be unable to disentangle the
individual components from their aggregate. In any case, the value of the
covariates measured at the level of local units, when these are rather
extensive, do not provide enough information on the within unit heterogeneity.

$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ in proton-proton collisions at the
LHC by the CMS and LHCb experiments. The data samples were collected in 2011 at
a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and in 2012 at 8 TeV. The combined analysis
produces the first observation of the $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay, with a
statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best
measurement of its branching fraction so far. Furthermore, evidence for the
$B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is obtained with a statistical significance of three
standard deviations. The branching fraction measurements are statistically
compatible with SM predictions and impose stringent constraints on several
theories beyond the SM.

of the boundary mean curvature in the Hardy-Sobolev trace inequality on the
underlying domain. We prove existence of minimizers when the mean curvature is
negative at the singular point of the Hardy potential.

rise to a rich phase space hosting a multitude of correlated phenomena.
Magnetic atoms on surfaces probed through scanning tunnelling microscopy
provide an excellent platform to investigate coupled impurities, but typical
high Kondo temperatures prevent field-dependent studies from being performed,
rendering large parts of the phase space inaccessible. We present an integral
study of pairs of Co atoms on insulating Cu2N/Cu(100), which each have a Kondo
temperature of only 2.6 K. In order to cover the different regions of the phase
space, the pairs are designed to have interaction strengths similar to the
Kondo temperature. By applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field, we are
able to access a new phase in which the two coupled impurities are
simultaneously screened. Comparison of differential conductance spectra taken
on the atoms to simulated curves, calculated using a third order transport
model, allows us to independently determine the degree of Kondo screening in
each phase.

helix-like polymer, e.g., adhesion pili expressed by bacteria, that is capable
of describing the polymers force-extension response. With building blocks
representing individual subunits the model appropriately describes the complex
behavior of pili expressed by the gram-negative uropathogenic Escherichia coli
bacteria under the action of an external force. Numerical simulations show that
the dynamics of the model, which include both the effects of unwinding and
rewinding, are in good quantitative agreement with the characteristic
force-extension response as observed experimentally for type 1 and P pili. By
tuning the model, it is also possible to reproduce the force-extension response
in the presence of anti-shaft antibodies, which dramatically changes the
mechanical properties. Thus, the model and the results in this work give
enhanced understanding of how a pilus unwinds under action of external forces
and provide new perspective of the complex bacterial adhesion processes.

learning: 1) how to automatically identify the feature dimension of the learned
subspace (i.e., automatic subspace learning), and 2) how to learn the
underlying subspace in the presence of Gaussian noise (i.e., robust subspace
learning). We show that these two problems can be simultaneously solved by
proposing a new method (called principal coefficients embedding, PCE). For a
given data set $\mathbf{D}\in \mathds{R}^{m\times n}$, PCE recovers a clean
data set $\mathbf{D}_{0}\in \mathds{R}^{m\times n}$ from $\mathbf{D}$ and
simultaneously learns a global reconstruction relation $\mathbf{C}\in
\mathbf{R}^{n\times n}$ of $\mathbf{D}_{0}$. By preserving $\mathbf{C}$ into an
$m^{\prime}$-dimensional space, the proposed method obtains a projection matrix
that can capture the latent manifold structure of $\mathbf{D}_{0}$, where
$m^{\prime}\ll m$ is automatically determined by the rank of $\mathbf{C}$ with
theoretical guarantees. PCE has three advantages: 1) it can automatically
determine the feature dimension even though data are sampled from a union of
multiple linear subspaces in presence of the Gaussian noise, 2) Although the
objective function of PCE only considers the Gaussian noise, experimental
results show that it is robust to the non-Gaussian noise (\textit{e.g.}, random
pixel corruption) and real disguises, 3) Our method has a closed-form solution
and can be calculated very fast. Extensive experimental results show the
superiority of PCE on a range of databases with respect to the classification
accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

metallicity, mass loss and rotation are the main drivers of stellar evolution.
Binarity and magnetic field may also significantly affect the fate of massive
stars. Our goal is to investigate the evolution of single O stars in the
Galaxy. For that, we use a sample of 74 objects comprising all luminosity
classes and spectral types from O4 to O9.7. We rely on optical spectroscopy
obtained in the context of the MiMeS survey of massive stars. We perform
spectral modelling with the code CMFGEN. We determine the surface properties of
the sample stars, with special emphasis on abundances of carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen. Most of our sample stars have initial masses in the range 20 to 50
Msun. We show that nitrogen is more enriched and carbon/oxygen more depleted in
supergiants than in dwarfs, with giants showing intermediate degrees of mixing.
CNO abundances are observed in the range of values predicted by nucleosynthesis
through the CNO cycle. More massive stars, within a given luminosity class,
appear to be more chemically enriched than lower mass stars. We compare our
results with predictions of three types of evolutionary models and show that,
for two sets of models, 80% of our sample can be explained by stellar evolution
including rotation. The effect of magnetism on surface abundances is
unconstrained. Our study indicates that, in the 20-50 Msun mass range, the
surface chemical abundances of most single O stars in the Galaxy are fairly
well accounted for by stellar evolution of rotating stars.

of independent components analysis (ICA) have been demonstrated to yield
state-of-the-art results in several action recognition benchmarks. However,
existing approaches do not allow for the number of latent components (features)
to be automatically inferred from the data in an unsupervised manner. This is a
significant disadvantage of the state-of-the-art, as it results in considerable
burden imposed on researchers and practitioners, who must resort to tedious
cross-validation procedures to obtain the optimal number of latent features. To
resolve these issues, in this paper we introduce a convolutional nonparametric
Bayesian sparse ICA architecture for overcomplete feature learning from
high-dimensional data. Our method utilizes an Indian buffet process prior to
facilitate inference of the appropriate number of latent features under a
hybrid variational inference algorithm, scalable to massive datasets. As we
show, our model can be naturally used to obtain deep unsupervised hierarchical
feature extractors, by greedily stacking successive model layers, similar to
existing approaches. In addition, inference for this model is completely
heuristics-free; thus, it obviates the need of tedious parameter tuning, which
is a major challenge most deep learning approaches are faced with. We evaluate
our method on several action recognition benchmarks, and exhibit its advantages
over the state-of-the-art.

was applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the Nearby Supernova

features, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by two
important modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivatives
of spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines and
discards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through the
use of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input data
matrix. These allow us to define a stable PC parameter space which can be used
to characterize synthetic SN Ia spectra by means of real SN features. Using
PLS, we demonstrate that the information from important previously known
spectral indicators (namely the pseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of Si II 5972 /
Si II 6355 and the line velocity of S II 5640 / Si II 6355) at a given epoch,
is contained within the PC space and can be determined through a linear
combination of the most important PCs. We also show that the PC space
encompasses photometric features like B or V magnitudes, B-V color and SALT2
parameters c and x1. The observed colors and magnitudes, that are heavily
affected by extinction, cannot be reconstructed using this technique alone. All

instantaneous and continuous behaviour. It develops the flow-based approach of
the hybrid process algebra HYPE by replacing non-urgent events with events with
exponentially-distributed durations and also introduces random resets. The
random resets allow for general stochasticity, and in particular allow for the
use of event durations drawn from distributions other than the exponential
distribution. To account for stochasticity, the semantics of stochastic HYPE
target piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), via intermediate
transition-driven stochastic hybrid automata (TDSHA) in contrast to the hybrid
automata used as semantic target for HYPE. Stochastic HYPE models have a
specific structure where the controller of a system is separate from the
continuous aspect of this system providing separation of concerns and
supporting reasoning. A novel equivalence is defined which captures when two
models have the same stochastic behaviour (as in stochastic bisimulation),
instantaneous behaviour (as in classical bisimulation) and continuous
behaviour. These techniques are illustrated via an assembly line example.

exhibited strong quasi-periodic flare-like events (on timescales of tens of
seconds) in some characteristic states, the so-called heartbeat state. From the
theoretical point of view, these oscillations may be modeled by the process of
accretion disk instability, driven by the dominant radiation pressure and
enhanced heating of the plasma. Although the mean accretion rate in this source
is probably below the Eddington limit, the oscillations will still have large
amplitudes. As the observations show, the source can exhibit strong wind
outflow during the soft state. This wind may help to partially or even
completely stabilize the heartbeat. Using our hydrodynamical code GLADIS, we
modeled the evolution of an accretion disk responsible for X-ray emission of
the source. We accounted for a variable wind outflow from the disk surface. We
examined the data archive from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites to find
the observed limitations on the wind physical properties, such as its velocity
and ionization state. We also investigated the long-term evolution of this
source, which lasted over about 600 days of observations, using the data
collected by the Swift and RXTE satellites. During this long period, the
oscillations pattern and the observable wind properties changed systematically.
We found that this source probably exhibits observable outbursts of appropriate
timescales and amplitudes as a result of the disk instability. Our model
requires a substantial wind component to explain the proper variability
pattern, and even complete suppression of flares in some states. The wind
mass-loss rate extracted from the data agrees quantitatively well with our
scenario.

  Systems","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this manuscript we tackle the problem of semi-distributed user selection
with distributed linear precoding for sum rate maximization in multiuser
multicell systems. A set of adjacent base stations (BS) form a cluster in order
to perform coordinated transmission to cell-edge users, and coordination is
carried out through a central processing unit (CU). However, the message
exchange between BSs and the CU is limited to scheduling control signaling and
no user data or channel state information (CSI) exchange is allowed. In the
considered multicell coordinated approach, each BS has its own set of cell-edge
users and transmits only to one intended user while interference to
non-intended users at other BSs is suppressed by signal steering (precoding).
We use two distributed linear precoding schemes, Distributed Zero Forcing (DZF)
and Distributed Virtual Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (DVSINR).
Considering multiple users per cell and the backhaul limitations, the BSs rely
on local CSI to solve the user selection problem. First we investigate how the
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime and the number of antennas at the BSs affect
the effective channel gain (the magnitude of the channels after precoding) and
its relationship with multiuser diversity. Considering that user selection must
be based on the type of implemented precoding, we develop metrics of
compatibility (estimations of the effective channel gains) that can be computed
from local CSI at each BS and reported to the CU for scheduling decisions.
Based on such metrics, we design user selection algorithms that can find a set
of users that potentially maximizes the sum rate. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of the proposed metrics and algorithms for different
configurations of users and antennas at the base stations.

voltage tethers interacting with the solar wind protons. The sail attitude can
be controlled and attitude maneuvers are possible by tether voltage modulation
synchronous with the sail rotation. Especially, the sail can be inclined with
respect to the solar wind direction to obtain transverse thrust to change the
osculating orbit angular momentum. Such an inclination has to be maintained by
a continual control voltage modulation. Consequently, the tether voltage
available for the thrust is less than the maximum voltage provided by the power
system. Using a spherical pendulum as a model for a single rotating tether, we
derive analytical estimations for the control efficiency for two separate sail
control modes. One is a continuous control modulation that corresponds to
strictly planar tether tip motion. The other is an on-off modulation with the
tether tip moving along a closed loop on a saddle surface. The novel on-off
mode is introduced here to both amplify the transverse thrust and reduce the
power consumption. During the rotation cycle, the maximum voltage is applied to
the tether only over two thrusting arcs when most of the transverse thrust is
produced. In addition to the transverse thrust, we obtain the thrusting angle
and electric power consumption for the two control modes. It is concluded that
while the thrusting angle is about half of the sail inclination for the
continuous modulation it approximately equals to the inclination angle for the
on-off modulation. The efficiency of the on-off mode is emphasized when power
consumption is considered, and the on-off mode can be used to improve the
propulsive acceleration through the reduced power system mass.

Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) does not hold in many applications where
compressed sensing is successfully used. This includes fields like Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computerized Tomography, Electron Microscopy, Radio
Interferometry and Fluorescence Microscopy. We demonstrate that for natural
compressed sensing matrices involving a level based reconstruction basis (e.g.
wavelets), the number of measurements required to recover all $s$-sparse
signals for reasonable $s$ is excessive. In particular, uniform recovery of all
$s$-sparse signals is quite unrealistic. This realisation shows that the RIP is
insufficient for explaining the success of compressed sensing in various
practical applications. The second purpose of the paper is to introduce a new
framework based on a generalised RIP-like definition that fits the applications
where compressed sensing is used. We show that the shortcomings that show that
uniform recovery is unreasonable no longer apply if we instead ask for
structured recovery that is uniform only within each of the levels. To examine
this phenomenon, a new tool, termed the 'Restricted Isometry Property in
Levels' is described and analysed. Furthermore, we show that with certain
conditions on the Restricted Isometry Property in Levels, a form of uniform
recovery within each level is possible. Finally, we conclude the paper by
providing examples that demonstrate the optimality of the results obtained.

ejection,in NOAA AR 11990 from 2014 Feb 24 to 25. Before the confined are
onset, EUV brightening beneath the filament was detected. As the are began, a
twisted helical flux rope (FR) wrapping around the filament moved upward and
then stopped, and in the meantime an obvious X-ray source below it was
observed. Prior to the ejective X4.9 flare, some pre-existing loop structures
in the active region interacted with each other, which produced a brightening
region beneath the filament. Meanwhile, a small flaring loop appeared below the
interaction region and some new helical lines connecting the far ends of the
loop structures was gradually formed and continually added into the former
twisted FR. Then, due to the resulting imbalance between the magnetic pressure
and tension, the new FR together with the filament erupted outward. Our
observations coincide well with tether-cutting model, suggesting that the two
flares probably have the same triggering mechanism, i.e., tether-cutting
reconnection. To our knowledge, this is the first direct observation of
tether-cutting reconnection occurring between the pre-existing loops in active
region. In the ejective flare case, the erupting filament exhibited an
omega-like kinked structure and underwent an exponential rise after a slow-rise
phase, indicating the kink instability might be also responsible for the
eruption initiation.

incomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features.
To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the
classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of
minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown
labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates
training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic
framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and
item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover
the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix.
The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation
(FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely
used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that
our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline
and the state-of-the-art methods.

between the power losses calculated from the radiation reaction and that from
Larmor's formula, is succinctly understood when a proper distinction is made
between quantities expressed in terms of a ""real time"" and those expressed in
terms of a retarded time. It is explicitly shown that an accelerated charge,
taken to be a sphere of vanishingly small radius $r_{\rm o} $, experiences at
any time a self-force proportional to the acceleration it had at a time $r_{\rm
o} /c$ earlier, while the rate of work done on the charge is obtained by a
scalar product of the self-force with the instantaneous (present) value of its
velocity. Now if the retarded value of acceleration is expressed in terms of
the present values of acceleration, then we get the rate of work done according
to the radiation reaction equation, however if we instead express the present
value of velocity in terms of its time-retarded value, then we get back the
familiar Larmor's radiation formula. From this simple relation between the two
we show that they differ because Larmor's formula, in contrast with the
radiation reaction, is written not in terms of the real-time values of
quantities specifying the charge motion but is instead expressed in terms of
the time-retarded values. Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the difference
in the two formulas for radiative power loss exactly matches the difference in
the temporal rate of the change of energy in the self-fields between the
retarded and real times. From this it becomes obvious that the ad hoc
introduction of an acceleration-dependent energy term, usually referred to in
the prevalent literature as Schott-term, in order to make the two formulas
comply with each other, is redundant.

outputs segmentation maps by one pass of forward propagation. It has the
property of translation invariance like patch-by-patch scanning but with much

any sizes without warping them to a standard size. These attractive properties
make it extendable to other general image segmentation problems. Based on FCNN,
a multi-stage deep learning is proposed to integrate appearance and motion cues

pretrained stage-by-stage and then jointly optimized. Different combination
methods are investigated. The effectiveness of our approach and component-wise

RLNC with probabilistic forwarding, which is the approach taken in the
literature, may significantly impact RLNC's performance. Therefore, we take the
novel approach to combine RLNC with a deterministic broadcasting algorithm in

""packet generation level"". Since managing packet generations is a key issue in
RLNC, we propose a distributed scheme, which is also suitable for mobile

S^0_tau, L^0_tau and the rho^0(770)-f_0(980) spin mixing parameters. The spin
mixing mechanism allows to extract D-wave observables from the CERN data.
Analysis of the full D-wave subsystem for transversity tau=u reveals rho^0(770)
mixing in the amplitudes |D^U_u|^2 and |D^N_u|^2 and a violation of a cosine
condition by the amplitudes D^2U_u and D^2N_u. We determine spin mixing and
S-matrix helicity amplitudes from which we calculate pipi phase-shifts
delta^0_S and delta_P below KKbar threshold. The spin mixing and the violation
of the cosine condition arise from a non-standard pure dephasing interaction of
the produced final S-matrix state rho_f(S) with a quantum state rho(E) of a
quantum environment to produce the observed state rho_f(O). Our analysis
determines that the number of interacting degrees of freedom of the environment
is M=4. We identify the four eigenstates |e_k> that define the density matrix
rho(E) with the four neutrino mass eigenstates |m_k> with m_4 due to light
sterile neutrino. We call the quantum states rho(E) dark neutrinos and propose
to identify them with the particles of a distinct component of dark matter.
Dephasing interactions are not rare events but they require high statistics
experiments with polarized targets for their detection. Our amplitude analysis
illustrates this new kind of search for dark matter.

distributions with a single knee around $\sim$10$^{36}$-10$^{37}$ erg/s, while
SFXTs are found to be systematically sub-luminous and their distributions are
shifted at significantly lower luminosities (a factor of $\sim$10-100). As the
luminosity states in which these sources spend most of their time are typically
below the sensitivity limit of large field of view hard X-ray imagers, we
conclude that soft X-ray monitorings carried out with high sensitivity

appropriate external optical field, a dark dipole soliton is formed. Moreover,
when the scaled detuning is set to an appropriate value, a double monopole dark

classic facility location problem proposed by Eisenstat, Mathieu, and Schabanel
to model the dynamics of evolving social/infrastructure networks. The
generalization lies in that the distance metric between clients and facilities
changes over time. This leads to a trade-off between optimizing the classic
objective function and the ""stability"" of the solution: there is a switching
cost charged every time a client changes the facility to which it is connected.
While the standard linear program (LP) relaxation for the classic problem
naturally extends to this problem, traditional LP-rounding techniques do not,
as they are often sensitive to small changes in the metric resulting in
frequent switches.
  We present a new LP-rounding algorithm for facility location problems, which
yields the first constant approximation algorithm for the dynamic facility
location problem. Our algorithm installs competing exponential clocks on the
clients and facilities, and connect every client by the path that repeatedly
follows the smallest clock in the neighborhood. The use of exponential clocks
gives rise to several properties that distinguish our approach from previous
LP-roundings for facility location problems. In particular, we use \emph{no
clustering} and we allow clients to connect through paths of \emph{arbitrary
lengths}. In fact, the clustering-free nature of our algorithm is crucial for
applying our LP-rounding approach to the dynamic problem.

in the X-ray spectra of typical Seyfert galaxies, the situation is unclear in
the case of Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s)---an extreme subset which
are generally thought to harbor less massive black holes with higher accretion
rates. In this paper, the ensemble property of the Fe K$\alpha$ line in NLS1s
is investigated by stacking the X-ray spectra of a large sample of 51 NLS1s
observed with {\it XMM-Newton}. The composite X-ray spectrum reveals a
prominent, broad emission feature over 4--7 keV, characteristic of the broad Fe
K$\alpha$ line. In addition, there is an indication for a possible
superimposing narrow (unresolved) line, either emission or absorption,
corresponding to Fe XXVI or Fe XXV, respectively. The profile of the broad
emission feature can well be fitted with relativistic broad-line models, with
the line energy consistent either with 6.4 keV (i.e., neutral Fe) or with 6.67
keV (i.e., highly ionized Fe), in the case of the narrow line being emission
and absorption, respectively. Interestingly, there are tentative indications
for low or intermediate values of the average spins of the black holes
($a<0.84$), as inferred from the profile of the composite broad line. If the
observed feature is indeed a broad line rather than resulting from partial
covering absorption, our results suggest that a relativistic Fe line may in

trap light into thin-film solar cells for improving the conversion efficiency.
In most schemes, the textured active layers are involved into light trapping
structures that can provide perfect optical benefits but also bring undesirable
degradation of electrical performance. Here we propose a novel approach to
design high-performance thin-film solar cells. In our strategy, a flat active
layer is adopted for avoiding electrical degradation, and an optimization
algorithm is applied to seek for an optimized light trapping structure for the
best optical benefit. As an example, we show that the efficiency of a flat
a-Si:H thin-film solar cell can be promoted close to the certified highest
value. It is also pointed out that, by choosing appropriate dielectric
materials with high refractive index (>3) and high transmissivity in wavelength

enhanced.

low-rank-cum-Markov approximation (LMA) of the GP model that is novel in
leveraging the dual computational advantages stemming from complementing a
low-rank approximate representation of the full-rank GP based on a support set
of inputs with a Markov approximation of the resulting residual process; the
latter approximation is guaranteed to be closest in the Kullback-Leibler
distance criterion subject to some constraint and is considerably more refined
than that of existing sparse GP models utilizing low-rank representations due
to its more relaxed conditional independence assumption (especially with larger
data). As a result, our LMA method can trade off between the size of the
support set and the order of the Markov property to (a) incur lower
computational cost than such sparse GP models while achieving predictive
performance comparable to them and (b) accurately represent features/patterns
of any scale. Interestingly, varying the Markov order produces a spectrum of
LMAs with PIC approximation and full-rank GP at the two extremes. An advantage
of our LMA method is that it is amenable to parallelization on multiple
machines/cores, thereby gaining greater scalability. Empirical evaluation on
three real-world datasets in clusters of up to 32 computing nodes shows that
our centralized and parallel LMA methods are significantly more time-efficient
and scalable than state-of-the-art sparse and full-rank GP regression methods

reliable method to obtain true indeterministic random numbers that are of vital
importance to cryptographic communication and large-scale computer modeling.
However, in realistic scenarios, the raw output of a quantum random-number
generator is inevitably tainted by classical technical noise. The integrity of
the device can be compromised if this noise is tampered with, or even
controlled by some malicious party. To safeguard against this, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate an approach that produces side-information
independent randomness that is quantified by min-entropy conditioned on this
classical noise. We present a method for maximizing the conditional min-entropy
of the number sequence generated from a given quantum-to-classical-noise ratio.
The detected photocurrent in our experiment is shown to have a real-time
random-number generation rate of 14 (Mbit/s)/MHz. The spectral response of the
detection system shows the potential to deliver more than 70 Gbit/s of random
numbers in our experimental setup.

(HN3) and etc, are compounds of great fundamental and applied importance. Their
high-pressure behavior is important because of their abundance in giant planets
and because of the hopes of discoverying high-energy-density materials. Here,
we have performed a systematic investi- gation on the structural stability of
N-H system in a pressure range up to 800 GPa through evolutionary structure
prediction simulations. Surprisingly, we found that high pressure stabilizes a
series of previously unreported compounds with peculiar structural and
electronic properties, such as the N4H, N3H, N2H and NH phases composed of
nitrogen backbones, the N9H4 phase containing two dimensional metallic nitrogen
planes and novel N8H, NH2, N3H7, NH4 and NH5 molecular phases. Another surprise
is that NH3 becomes thermodynamically unstable above ~460 GPa. We found that
high-pressure chemistry is much more diverse that hydrocarbon chemistry at
normal conditions, leading to expectations that N-H-O and N-H-O-S systems under
pressure are likely to possess richer chemistry than the known organic
chemistry. This, in turn, opens a possibility of nitrogen-based life at high
pressure. The predicted phase diagram of the N-H system also provides a
reference for synthesis of high-energy-density materials.

  years of the Professors Man'ko",,,,"math-ph math.MP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present several ideas in direction of physical interpretation of $q$- and
$f$-oscillators as a nonlinear oscillators. First we show that an arbitrary one
dimensional integrable system in action-angle variables can be naturally
represented as a classical and quantum $f$-oscillator. As an example, the
semi-relativistic oscillator as a descriptive of the Landau levels for
relativistic electron in magnetic field is solved as an $f$-oscillator. By
using dispersion relation for $q$-oscillator we solve the linear
q-Schr\""odinger equation and corresponding nonlinear complex q-Burgers
equation. The same dispersion allows us to construct integrable q-NLS model as
a deformation of cubic NLS in terms of recursion operator of NLS hierarchy.
Peculiar property of the model is to be completely integrable at any order of
expansion in deformation parameter around $q=1$. As another variation on the
theme, we consider hydrodynamic flow in bounded domain. For the flow bounded by
two concentric circles we formulate the two circle theorem and construct
solution as the q-periodic flow by non-symmetric $q$-calculus. Then we
generalize this theorem to the flow in the wedge domain bounded by two arcs.
This two circular-wedge theorem determines images of the flow by extension of
$q$-calculus to two bases: the real one, corresponding to circular arcs and the
complex one, with $q$ as a primitive root of unity. As an application, the
vortex motion in annular domain as a nonlinear oscillator in the form of
classical and quantum f-oscillator is studied. Extending idea of q-oscillator
to two bases with the golden ratio, we describe Fibonacci numbers as a special
type of $q$-numbers with matrix Binet formula. We derive the corresponding
golden quantum oscillator, nonlinear coherent states and Fock-Bargman
representation.

Specifically, we focus on design-time verification of RMASs against rich

decidability results under the ""state-bounded"" assumption, i.e., in each single

showing decidability in presence of dense, linear orders, and facets defined on

are reformulated as non-rigid relations working on the active domain of the

relativistic jets. Localized stochastic particle acceleration, spatial
diffusion, and synchrotron as well as synchrotron self-Compton emission are
considered in a leptonic model. To account for inhomogeneity, we use a 2D
axi-symmetric cylindrical geometry for both relativistic electrons and magnetic
field. In this first phase of our work, we focus on steady-state spectra that
develop from a time-dependent model. We demonstrate that small isolated
acceleration region in a much larger emission volume are sufficient to
accelerate particles to high energy. Diffusive escape from these small regions
provides a natural explanation for the spectral form of the jet emission. The
location of the acceleration regions within the jet is found to affect the
cooling break of the spectrum in this diffusive model. Diffusion-caused
energy-dependent inhomogeneity in the jets predicts that the SSC spectrum is
harder than the synchrotron spectrum. There can also be a spectral hardening
towards the high-energy section of the synchrotron spectrum, if particle escape
is relatively slow. These two spectral hardening effects indicate that the jet
inhomogeneity might be a natural explanation for the unexpected hard
{\gamma}-ray spectra observed in some blazars.

simple harmonic oscillator is shown to give Henon's Isochrone. The statistical
mechanics of a micro-canonical ensemble of isochrone oscillators shows that the
temperature reaches a maximum as a function of the energy and then declines to
zero at the escape energy. In that declining region adding heat (energy)
decreases the temperature, as occurs in star clusters. We then define the
internal temperature of an ensemble of binary stars all at the same (negative)
energy and show that they too get cooler when heated and hotter when cooled.
When the internal temperature of a binary is less that the temperature of the
stars it interacts with, then on average heat will flow into it, making it less
bound and of still lower temperature. Conversely hard binaries have higher
internal temperatures than the local stars, so they lose energy and become
hotter and yet more strongly bound, a process invoked by Michel Henon in his
explanation of star-cluster evolution. Finally we give an isochronal variation
of Newton's exactly soluble N-body problem.

1964 by Michel Henon and graduate student Carl Heiles at Princeton University:
""The applicability of the third integral of motion: Some numerical experiments""
in the field of galactic dynamics. Instead of repeating here the lecture of the
paper, we advise the reader interested in dynamical systems to study this
""must"" reading.

  Improved abstract and two figures in this version",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theory of star cluster dynamics was a major topic in H\'enon's early
research career. Here we summarise his contributions under three headings: (i)
the Monte Carlo method, (ii) homological evolution of star clusters, and (iii)
escape from star clusters. In each case we also trace some aspects of how
H\'enon's contributions have been developed or applied in subsequent decades up
to the present. We also propose that H\'enon's work be commemorated by adopting
the names ""H\'enon units"" and ""H\'enon's Principle"".

of orbits depended only on energy. He named this potential the isochrone, and
discovered that it provided a good representation of data for globular
clusters. He sought an explanation in terms of resonant relaxation. The role
that resonant relaxation might play in globular clusters is still an open
question, but the isochrone potential is guaranteed a role in dynamical
astronomy because it is the most general potential in which closed-form
expressions for angle-action coordinates are available. I explain how this
property makes the isochrone invaluable for the powerful technique of torus
mapping. I also describe flattened isochrone models, which enable us to explore
a powerful general method of generating self-consistent stellar systems.

  design",,,,,"cs.CY physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an integrated, three dimensional, model of urban canopy, building
energy and radiosity, for early stage urban designs and test it on four urban
morphologies. All sub-models share a common descriptions of the urban
morphology, similar to 3D urban design master plans and have simple parameters.
The canopy model is a multilayer model, with a new discrete layer approach that
does not rely on simplified geometry such as canyon or regular arrays. The
building energy model is a simplified RC equivalent model, with no hypotheses
on internal zoning or wall composition. We use the CitySim software for the
radiosity model. We study the effects of convexity, the number of buildings and
building height, at constant density and thermal characteristics. Our results
suggest that careful three dimensional morphology design can reduce heat demand
by a factor of 2, especially by improving insolation of lower levels. The most
energy efficient morphology in our simulations has both the highest
surface/volume ratio and the biggest impact on the urban climate.

density, flux, and mean speed of the vehicles. However, the diagrams relating
these variables (the fundamental and speed diagrams) show some peculiarities
not yet fully reproduced nor explained by mathematical models. In this paper,
resting on the methods of kinetic theory, we introduce a new traffic model
which takes into account the heterogeneous nature of the flow of vehicles along
a road. In more detail, the model considers traffic as a mixture of two or more
populations of vehicles (e.g., cars and trucks) with different microscopic
characteristics, in particular different lengths and/or maximum speeds. With
this approach we gain some insights into the scattering of the data in the
regime of congested traffic clearly shown by actual measurements.

that electron emission from the core level band is delayed by $\Delta \tau

We show that this relative time offset in electron emission is caused by the
screening of the streaking laser field by conduction electrons.
