Galaxy. The solar siblings can be identified by accurate measurements of
metallicity, stellar age and elemental abundances for solar neighbourhood
stars. The solar siblings candidates were kinematically selected based on their
proper motions, parallaxes and colours. Stellar parameters were determined
through a purely spectroscopic approach and partly physical method,
respectively. Comparing synthetic with observed spectra, elemental abundances
were computed based on the stellar parameters obtained using a partly physical
method. A chemical tagging technique was used to identify the solar siblings.
We present stellar parameters, stellar ages, and detailed elemental abundances
for Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni for 32 solar sibling candidates. Our
abundances analysis shows that four stars are chemically homogenous together
with the Sun. Technique of chemical tagging gives us a high probability that
they might be from the same open cluster. Only one candidate HIP 40317 which
has solar metallicity and age could be a solar sibling. We performed
simulations of the Sun's birth cluster in analytical Galactic model and found
that most of the radial velocities of the solar siblings lie in the range $-10
\leq \mathrm{V_r}\leq 10$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, which is smaller than the
radial velocity of HIP 40317 $(\mathrm{V_r} = 34.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}})$, under

stellar oscillations. The toroidal oscillation of the star propagates into the
magnetosphere, which provides additional voltage due to unipolar induction,
changes Goldreich-Julian charge density from the traditional value due to
rotation, and hence, influences particle acceleration. We present a general
solution of the effect of oscillations within the framework of the inner vacuum
gap model, and consider three different inner gap modes controlled by curvature
radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and two photon annihilation,
respectively. With different pulsar parameters and oscillation amplitudes, one
of three modes would play a dominant role in defining the gap properties. When
the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a critical value, mode changing would
occur. Oscillations also lead to change of the size of the polar cap. As
applications, we show the inner gap properties under oscillations in both
normal pulsars and anomalous X-ray pulsars / soft gamma-ray repeaters
(AXPs/SGRs). We interpret the onset of radio emission after glitches/flares in
AXPs/SGRs as due to oscilation-driven magnetic activities in these objects,
within the framework of both the magnetar model and the solid quark star model.
Within the magnetar model, radio activation may be caused by the enlargement of
the effective polar cap angle and the radio emission beam due to oscillation;
whereas within the solid quark star angle, it may be caused by activation of
the pulsar inner gap from below the radio emission death line due to an
oscillation-induced voltage enhancement. The model can also explain the
glitch-induced radio profile change observed in PSR J1119-6127.

journals in the natural and social sciences we show that research careers
exhibit the broad distributions of individual achievement characteristic of
systems in which cumulative advantage plays a key role. While most researchers
are personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process,
little is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual
researchers. We analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set
of researchers publishing in high-impact journals. For each researcher cohort
we calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around
0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective,
these observed values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for
personal income in developing countries. Investigating possible sources of this
inequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that act at the level of the
individual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad
productivity and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the
average time interval between a researcher's successive publications in top
journals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after controlling
for the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the
citation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher's publication
record. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there
is more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with
each subsequent publication. This pattern highlights the difficulty of
repeatedly publishing high-impact research and the intriguing possibility that
confirmation bias plays a role in the evaluation of scientific careers.

bacteria is a non-monotonic function of the concentration, $c$, of
high-molecular-weight linear polymers in aqueous solution, showing peaked
$v(c)$ curves. Pores in the polymer solution were suggested as the explanation.
Quantifying this picture led to a theory that predicted peaked $v(c)$ curves.
Using new, high-throughput methods for characterising motility, we have
measured $v$, and the angular frequency of cell-body rotation, $\Omega$, of
motile Escherichia coli as a function of polymer concentration in
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Ficoll solutions of different molecular weights.
We find that non-monotonic $v(c)$ curves are typically due to low-molecular
weight impurities. After purification by dialysis, the measured $v(c)$ and
$\Omega(c)$ relations for all but the highest molecular weight PVP can be
described in detail by Newtonian hydrodynamics. There is clear evidence for
non-Newtonian effects in the highest molecular weight PVP solution.

inflamed mucosal surfaces with high affinity and delivers them to cells via
receptor mediated endocytosis. A typical hTf is folded into two homologous
lobes; each lobe is further divided into two similar sized domains. Three
different crystal structures of hTf delineate large conformational changes
involved in iron binding/dissociation. However, whether the release process
follows the same trend at serum (~7.4) and endosomal (~5.6) pH remains
unanswered. The specialized role of the two lobes and if communication between
them leads to efficient and controlled release is also debated. Here, we study
the dynamics of the full structure as well as the separate lobes in different
closed, partially open, and open conformations under the nearly neutral pH
conditions in the blood serum and the more acidic one in the endosome. The
results corroborate experimental observations and underscore the distinguishing
effect of pH on the dynamics of hTf. Furthermore, in a total of 2 {\mu}s
molecular dynamics simulation of different forms of hTf, residue fluctuations
elucidate the cross talk between the two lobes correlated by the peptide linker
bridging the two lobes at serum pH, while their correlated motions is lost
under endosomal conditions. At serum pH, the presence of even a single iron on
either lobe leads C-lobe fluctuations to subside, making it the target for
recognition by human cells or hostile bacteria seeking iron sequestration. The
N-lobe, on the other hand, has a propensity to open, making iron readily
available when needed at regions of serum pH. At endosomal pH, both lobes
readily open, making irons available for delivery. The interplay between the
relative mobility of the lobes renders efficient mechanism for the recognition
and release of hTf at the cell surface, and therefore its recycling in the
organism.

ultracold fermionic gas in a synthetic non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential, that
consists of both a magnetic field and a homogeneous spin-orbit coupling. This
gauge potential deforms the Landau levels (LLs) with respect to the Abelian
case and exchanges their ordering as a function of the spin-orbit coupling. In
view of experimental realizations, we show that a harmonic potential combined
with a Zeeman term, gives rise to an angular momentum term, which can be used
to test the stability of the correlated states obtained through interactions.
We derive the Haldane pseudopotentials (HPs) describing the interspecies
contact interaction within a lowest LL approximation. Unlike ordinary
fractional quantum Hall systems and ultracold bosons with short-range
interactions in the same gauge potential, the HPs for sufficiently strong
non-Abelian fields show an unconventional non-monotonic behaviour in the
relative angular momentum. Exploiting this property, we study the occurrence of
new incompressible ground states as a function of the total angular momentum.
In the first deformed Landau level (DLL) we obtain Laughlin and Jain states.
Instead, in the second DLL three classes of stabilized states appear: Laughlin
states, a series of intermediate strongly correlated states and finally
vortices of the integer quantum Hall state. Remarkably, in the intermediate
regime, the non-monotonic HPs of the second DLL induce two-particle
correlations which are reminiscent of paired states such as the Haffnian state.
Via exact diagonalization in the disk geometry, we compute experimentally
relevant observables such as density profiles and correlations, and we study
the entanglement spectra as a further tool to characterize the obtained
strongly correlated states.

transformations catalysed by the metal cluster. One of the most prevalent
pathways includes three consecutive stages: formation of polyyne carbon chains
from carbon nanotube, dissociation of the carbon chains into single and pairs
of adatoms adsorbed on the nickel cluster, and ejection of these adatoms
leading to the cutting of nanotube. Significant variations in the atom ejection
rate are discovered depending on the process stage and nanotube diameter. The

fundamental knowledge for the development of new methodologies for control and

the recently proposed K-mouflage model as an example to demonstrate the
numerical implementation of our linear perturbation equations. K-mouflage is a
new mechanism to suppress the fifth force between matter particles induced by
the scalar coupling, but in the linear regime the fifth force is unsuppressed
and can change the clustering of different matter species in different ways. We
show how the CMB, lensing potential and matter power spectra are affected by
the fifth force, and find ranges of K-mouflage parameters whose effects could
be seen observationally. We also find that the scalar coupling can have the
nontrivial effect of shifting the amplitude of the power spectra of the lensing

this context, we have investigated alternative scenarios where hadronic
emission processes are important, using a newly developed (lepto-)hadronic
numerical code to systematically explore the physical parameters of the
emission region that reproduces the observed spectra while avoiding the extreme
values encountered in pure SSC models. Assuming a fixed Doppler factor
$\delta=30$, two principal parameter regimes are identified, where the
high-energy emission is due to: 1) proton-synchrotron radiation, with magnetic
fields $B \sim 1-100\ \textrm{G}$ and maximum proton energies $E_{p;max}

insulating layer, we explore the range and extent to which Kondo hole
incoherence can penetrate into adjacent layers. We consider three cases of
neighboring layers: band insulator, Kondo insulator and simple metal. The
disorder-induced spectral weight transfer, used here for quantification of the
proximity effect, decays algebraically with distance from the boundary layer.
Further, we show that the spectral weight transfer is highly dependent on the
frequency range considered as well as the presence of interactions in the clean
adjacent layers. The changes in the low frequency spectrum are very similar
when the adjacent layers are either metallic or Kondo insulating, and hence are
independent of interactions. In stark contrast, a distinct picture emerges for
the spectral weight transfers across large energy scales. The spectral weight
transfer over all energy scales is much higher when the adjacent layers are
non-interacting as compared to when they are strongly interacting Kondo
insulators. Thus, over all scales, interactions screen the disorder effects
significantly. We discuss the possibility of a crossover from non-Fermi liquid

M point cones are strongly anisotropic. An effective k.p Hamiltonian is derived
to describe the anisotropic band splitting and spin polarization near the Dirac

extreme ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC5907 ULX1, known to have a peak
X-ray luminosity of ~5e40 erg/s. These XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations,
separated by only ~4 days, revealed an extreme level of short-term flux
variability. In the first epoch, NGC5907 ULX1 was undetected by NuSTAR, and
only weakly detected (if at all) with XMM-Newton, while in the second NGC5907
ULX1 was clearly detected at high luminosity by both missions. This implies an
increase in flux of ~2 orders of magnitude or more during this ~4 day window.
We argue that this is likely due to a rapid rise in the mass accretion rate,
rather than to a transition from an extremely obscured to an unobscured state.
During the second epoch we observed the broadband 0.3-20.0 keV X-ray luminosity
to be (1.55+/-0.06)e40 erg/s, similar to the majority of the archival X-ray
observations. The broadband X-ray spectrum obtained from the second epoch is
inconsistent with the low/hard accretion state observed in Galactic black hole
binaries, but is well modeled with a simple accretion disk model incorporating
the effects of photon advection. This strongly suggests that, when bright,
NGC5907 ULX1 is a high-Eddington accretor.

ejecta mass and energy, given the gamma--ray opacity. Previous work has shown
that the principal light curve peaks for SN~IIb with small amounts of hydrogen
and for hydrogen/helium--deficient SN~Ib/c are often rather similar near
maximum light, suggesting similar ejecta masses and kinetic energies, but that
late--time light curves show a wide dispersion, suggesting a dispersion in
ejecta masses and kinetic energies. It was also shown that SN~IIb and SN~Ib/c

revisit these topics by collecting and analyzing well--sampled single--band and
quasi--bolometric light curves from the literature. We find that the late--time

We also show that the observed properties, the photospheric velocity at peak,
the rise time, and the late decay time, can be used to determine the mean

considerably smaller than common estimates. We discuss how the small effective

ground-truth-answers and the worker-abilities by optimizing an objective
function, for instance, by maximizing the data likelihood based on an assumed
underlying model. A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature to
address this inference problem. As far as we know, none of the objective
functions in existing methods is convex. In machine learning and applied
statistics, a convex function such as the objective function of support vector
machines (SVMs) is generally preferred, since it can leverage the
high-performance algorithms and rigorous guarantees established in the
extensive literature on convex optimization. One may thus wonder if there
exists a meaningful convex objective function for the inference problem in
human computation. In this paper, we investigate this convexity issue for human
computation. We take an axiomatic approach by formulating a set of axioms that
impose two mild and natural assumptions on the objective function for the
inference. Under these axioms, we show that it is unfortunately impossible to
ensure convexity of the inference problem. On the other hand, we show that
interestingly, in the absence of a requirement to model ""spammers"", one can
construct reasonable objective functions for crowdsourcing that guarantee
convex inference.

to Ft values consistent with conservation of the vector current (CVC). Only one
set of calculations satisfactorily meets this condition. The resultant average
Ft value, when combined with the muon liftime, yields the up-down quark-mixing

These structures consist of a 350 nm thick, 700 nm wide doubly-clamped
Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam that is periodically patterned with an array of air holes
to which a defect region is introduced. The periodic patterning simultaneously
creates a photonic bandgap for 980 nm band photons and a phononic bandgap for 4
GHz phonons, with the defect region serving to co-localize optical and
mechanical modes within their respective bandgaps. These optical and mechanical
modes interact dispersively with a coupling rate $g_{0}/2\pi\approx$100 kHz,
which describes the shift in cavity mode optical frequency due to the
zero-point motion of the mechanical mode. Optical sidebands generated by
interaction with the mechanical mode lie outside of the optical cavity
linewidth, enabling possible use of this system in applications requiring
sideband-resolved operation. Along with a review of the basic device design,
fabrication, and measurement procedures, we present new results on improved
optical quality factors (up to $4\times10^5$) through optimized lithography,
measurements of devices after HF acid surface treatment, and temperature
dependent measurements of mechanical damping between 6~K and 300~K. A
frequency-mechanical quality factor product $\left(f{\times}Q_m\right)$ as high
as $\approx2.6\times10^{13}$ Hz is measured.

degeneracies among the WIMP's nature, its couplings to standard model
particles, its mass, and the number of equivalent (additional) neutrinos, Delta
N_nu. These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the
effective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary
BBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper
BBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and
N_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons
and/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP
that only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of
^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day
baryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta
N_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit
m_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV
(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers
Delta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully
thermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1). This result is consistent with
the CMB constraint, N_eff = 3.30 +- 0.27, limiting ""new physics"" between BBN
and recombination. Combining BBN and CMB data gives Delta N_nu = 0.35 +- 0.16
and N_eff = 3.40 +- 0.16; while BBN and the CMB combined require Delta N_nu > 0
at ~98% confidence, they disfavor Delta N_nu > 1 at > 99% confidence. Allowing
a neutrino-coupled light WIMP extends the allowed range slightly downward for
Delta N_nu and slightly upward for N_eff simultaneously, leaving best-fit
values unchanged.

logarithmic corrections to an $R+R^2$ model. These examples emphasise that

consistent with the virial velocity of the region and the diffuse gas velocity
dispersion, but significantly larger than the velocity dispersion of the dense,
star-forming cores, which have a sub-virial velocity dispersion of 0.5 km/s.
Since the NGC 1333 cluster is dynamically young and deeply embedded, this
measurement provides a strong constraint on the initial velocity dispersion of
newly-formed stars. We propose that the difference in velocity dispersion
between stars and dense cores may be due to the influence of a 70 micro-Gauss
magnetic field acting on the dense cores, or be the signature of a cluster with
initial sub-structure undergoing global collapse.

at the center of our Galaxy, the frequency of Coulomb collisions is so low that
the plasma is two-temperature, with the ions substantially hotter than the
electrons. This paradigm assumes that Coulomb collisions are the only channel
for transferring the ion energy to the electrons. In this work, the second of a
series, we assess the efficiency of electron heating by ion velocity-space
instabilities in collisionless accretion flows. The instabilities are seeded by
the pressure anisotropy induced by magnetic field amplification, coupled to the
adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. Using two-dimensional
(2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we showed in Paper I that if the
electron-to-ion temperature ratio is < 0.2, the ion cyclotron instability is
the dominant mode for values of ion beta_i ~ 5-30 (here, beta_i is the ratio of
ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure), as appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows. In this work, we employ analytical theory and
1D PIC simulations (with the box aligned with the fastest growing wavevector of
the ion cyclotron mode) to fully characterize how the electron heating
efficiency during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability depends on the
electron-to-proton temperature ratio, the plasma beta, the Alfven speed, the
amplification rate of the mean field (in units of the ion Larmor frequency) and
the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Our findings can be incorporated as a
physically-grounded sub-grid model into global fluid simulations of
low-luminosity accretion flows, thus helping to assess the validity of the
two-temperature assumption.

emitters fall on the ""main sequence"" of star-forming galaxies with SFR
decreasing at lower masses and redshifts. However, the slope of our relation is
flatter than that found for most other samples, a result of the metallicity
dependence of the [O II] star formation rate indicator. The mass specific SFR
is higher for lower mass objects, supporting the idea that massive galaxies
formed more quickly and efficiently than their lower mass counterparts. This is
confirmed by the fact that the equivalent widths of the [O II] emission lines
trend smaller with larger stellar mass. Examination of the morphologies of the

then probes Lya, CII, SiII, and CIV absorption in the CGM transverse to the DLA

predominantly in large, quiescent structures extending beyond the scale of the
DLA host dark matter halos rather than in ongoing galactic winds. The Lya
equivalent width in the DLA-CGM is anticorrelated with $R_{\perp}$ at >98%
confidence, suggesting that DLAs arise close to the centers of their host halos
rather than on their outskirts. Finally, the average Lya, CII and CIV
equivalent widths are consistent with those measured around z~2 Lyman Break

its host star using high-resolution spectroscopy. During such observations, the
radial component of the planet's orbital velocity changes, resulting in a
significant Doppler shift which allows its spectral features to be extracted.
Aims: In this work, we aim to detect TiO in the optical transmission spectrum
of HD 209458b. Gaseous TiO has been suggested as the cause of the thermal
inversion layer invoked to explain the dayside spectrum of this planet. Method:
We used archival data from the 8.2m Subaru Telescope taken with the High
Dispersion Spectrograph of a transit of HD209458b in 2002. We created model
transmission spectra which include absorption by TiO, and cross-correlated them
with the residual spectral data after removal of the dominating stellar
absorption features. We subsequently co-added the correlation signal in time,
taking into account the change in Doppler shift due to the orbit of the planet.
Results: We detect no significant cross-correlation signal due to TiO, though
artificial injection of our template spectra into the data indicates a
sensitivity down to a volume mixing ratio of ~10E-10. However,
cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS spectrum of Barnard's star
yields only a weak wavelength-dependent correlation, even though Barnard's star
is an M4V dwarf which exhibits clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO line
list poorly match the real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions of
~100,000. Similar line lists are also used in the PHOENIX and Kurucz stellar
atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also
correlate poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard's star and five other
M-dwarfs. We conclude that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is currently
critically hampering this high-resolution retrieval technique.

the Higgs potential is dominated by a positive quadratic term destabilized by a
tadpole arising from the coupling to an ""auxiliary"" Higgs sector. The auxiliary
Higgs sector can be either perturbative or strongly coupled, similar to
technicolor models. Since electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by a tadpole,
the cubic and quartic Higgs couplings can naturally be significantly smaller
than their values in the standard model. The theoretical motivation for these
models is that they can explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass in supersymmetry without
fine-tuning. The auxiliary Higgs sector contains additional Higgs states that
cannot decouple from standard model particles, so these models predict a rich
phenomenology of Higgs physics beyond the standard model. In this paper we
analyze a large number of direct and indirect constraints on these models. We
present the current constraints after the 8 TeV run of the LHC, and give
projections for the sensitivity of the upcoming 14 TeV run. We find that the
strongest constraints come from the direct searches $A^0 \to Zh$, $A^0 \to
t\bar{t}$, with weaker constraints from Higgs coupling fits. For
strongly-coupled models, additional constraints come from $\rho^+ \to WZ$ where
$\rho^+$ is a vector resonance. Our overall conclusion is that a significant
parameter space for such models is currently open, allowing values of the Higgs
cubic coupling down to 0.4 times the standard model value for weakly coupled
models and vanishing cubic coupling for strongly coupled models. The upcoming
14 TeV run of the LHC will stringently test this scenario and we identify

estimating the effects of natural versus anthropogenic factors for climate
change. Solar wind causing geomagnetic disturbances is another solar activity
agent whose role in climate change is not yet fully estimated but is a subject
of intense research. For the purposes of climate modeling, it is essential to
evaluate both the past and the future variations of solar irradiance and
geomagnetic activity which are ultimately due to the variations of solar
magnetic fields. Direct measurements of solar magnetic fields are available for
a limited period, but can be reconstructed from geomagnetic activity records.
Here we present a reconstruction of total solar irradiance based on geomagnetic
data, and a forecast of the future irradiance and geomagnetic activity relevant
for the expected climate change.

progress in object detection from 2D images, we build action models using rich
feature hierarchies derived from shape and kinematic cues. We incorporate
appearance and motion in two ways. First, starting from image region proposals
we select those that are motion salient and thus are more likely to contain the
action. This leads to a significant reduction in the number of regions being
processed and allows for faster computations. Second, we extract
spatio-temporal feature representations to build strong classifiers using
Convolutional Neural Networks. We link our predictions to produce detections
consistent in time, which we call action tubes. We show that our approach
outperforms other techniques in the task of action detection.

charge-separated layered structure, i.e., with alternating cation- and

the layered structure to temporal variations in applied potential is not well
understood. We used in situ, real-time X-ray reflectivity (XR) to study the
potential-dependent electric double layer (EDL) structure of an
imidazolium-based RTIL on charged epitaxial graphene during potential cycling

interfacial structure is bistable in which the EDL structure at any
intermediate potential can be described by the combination of two
extreme-potential structures whose proportions vary depending on the polarity
and magnitude of the applied potential. This picture is supported by the EDL
structures obtained by fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at
various static potentials. The potential-driven transition between the two
structures is characterized by an increasing width but with an approximately
fixed hysteresis magnitude as a function of temperature. The results are
consistent with the coexistence of distinct anion and cation adsorbed
structures separated by an energy barrier (~0.15 eV).

this fluidization process is intermittent for a range of acoustic pressures and
hysteretic when the pressure is cycled. Such a first-order-like unjamming
transition is reproduced in numerical simulations in which the acoustic

are best observed in nearby, and so best resolved, groups and clusters, making
our sample ideal for their detection. Out of the 65 groups and clusters in our
sample for which we have abundance profiles, 8 of them have certain central
abundance drops, with possible central abundance drops in another 6. All
sources with central abundance drops have X-ray cavities, and all bar one
exception have a central cooling time <=1 Gyr. These central abundance drops
can be generated if the iron injected by stellar mass loss processes in the
core of these sources is in grains, which then become incorporated in the
central dusty filaments. These, in turn, are dragged outwards by the bubbling
feedback process in these sources. We find that data quality significantly
affects the detection of central abundance drops, inasmuch as a higher number
of counts in the central 20 kpc of a source makes it easier to detect a central
abundance drop, as long as these counts are more than ~13000. On the other
hand, the magnitude of the central abundance drop does not depend on the number
of these counts, though the statistical significance of the measured drop does.
Finally, in line with the scenario briefly outlined above, we find that, for
most sources, the location of X-ray cavities acts as an upper limit to the
location of the peak in the radial metallicity distribution.

technique, the Adaptive Local Iterative Filtering (ALIF) method, which uses the
IFs strategy together with an adaptive and data driven filter length selection
to achieve the decomposition. Furthermore we design smooth filters with compact
support from solutions of Fokker-Planck equations (FP filters) that can be used
within both IFs and ALIF methods. These filters fulfill the derived sufficient
conditions for the convergence of the IFs algorithm. Numerical examples are
given to demonstrate the performance and stability of IFs and ALIF techniques
with FP filters. In addition, in order to have a complete and truly local
analysis toolbox for non-linear and non-stationary signals, we propose a new
definition for the instantaneous frequency which depends exclusively on local
properties of a signal.

found that the change in eccentricity of MS gives a change at high frequency
region in the emitted spectra. We found that disk parameters are dependent on
eccentricity of MS. Our semi-analytic results show that qualitatively an
increase in eccentricity of MS has same behavior as decrease in mass accretion
rate. Numerical work has been carried out to see the viscous time evolution of
the accretion disk around MS. In numerical model we showed that if the
eccentricity of the object is high the matter will diffuse slowly during its
viscous evolution. This gives a clue that how spin-up or spin-down can change
the time evolution of the accretion disk using a simple Newtonian approach. The
change in spectra can be used to determine the eccentricity of MS and thus

community is considered as a tightly interconnected group of actors; therefore,
it does not borrow any assumption from balance theory and merely uses the
well-known assumption in the community detection literature. We found that if
one detects the communities based on only positive relations (by ignoring the
negative ones), the majority of negative relations are already placed between
the communities. In other words, negative ties do not have a major role in
detecting communities of studied signed networks. Moreover, regarding the
internal negative ties, we proved that most unbalanced communities are
maximally balanced, and hence they cannot be partitioned into k nonempty
sub-clusters with higher balancedness (k >= 2). Furthermore, we showed that
although the mediator triad ++- (hostile-mediator-hostile) is underrepresented,
it constitutes a considerable portion of triadic relations among communities.
Hence, mediator triads should not be ignored by community detection and
clustering algorithms. As a result, if one uses a clustering algorithm that
operates merely based on social balance, mesoscopic structure of signed
networks significantly remains hidden.

continuous parametrisation of the possibly discontinuous limiting solution.
This reduces the construction of the limiting profiles to an algebraic problem.
A model two state-dependent delay differential equation is studied in detail

Sophisticated boundary value techniques are used to numerically compute the
bifurcation diagram of the state-dependent DDE when the perturbation parameter
is close to zero. This confirms that the solutions and bifurcations constructed
in the singular case persist when the perturbation parameter is nonzero, and
hence demonstrates that the solutions constructed using our singular solution
definition are useful and relevant to the singularly perturbed problem. Fold
and cusp bifurcations are found very close to the parameter values predicted by
the singular solution theory, and we also find period-doubling bifurcations as

two-dimensional two fluid (gas + particle) hydrodynamical calculations with
three-dimensional Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer simulations, and study the
observational signatures of gaps opened by one or several planets, making
qualitative comparisons with observations. We find that a single planet as
small as 0.2 MJ can produce a deep gap at millimeter (mm) wavelengths and
almost no features at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, while multiple planets
can open up a few *10 AU wide common gap at both wavelengths. Both the contrast
ratio of the gaps and the wavelength dependence of the gap sizes are broadly
consistent with data. We also confirm previous results that NIR gap sizes may
be smaller than mm gap sizes due to dust-gas coupling and radiative transfer
effects. When viewed at a moderate inclination angle, a physically circular
on-centered gap could appear to be off-centered from the star due to shadowing.
Planet-induced spiral arms are more apparent at NIR than at mm wavelengths.
Overall, our results suggest that the planet-opening-gap scenario is a
promising way to explain the origin of the transitional disks. Finally,
inspired by the recent ALMA release of the image of the HL Tau disk, we show
that multiple narrow gaps, well separated by bright rings, can be opened by 0.2
MJ planets soon after their formation in a relatively massive disk.

rate and any statistic of rod rotations can be obtained as a weighted average
over the joint PDF. To look for a lower-dimensional projection to simplify the
problem, we explore conditional averages of the mean-squared tumbling rate. The
conditional dependence of the mean-squared tumbling rate on the magnitude of
both the vorticity and the strain rate is strong, as expected, and similar.
There is also a strong dependence on the orientation between the rod and the
vorticity, since a rod aligned with the vorticity vector tumbles due to strain
but not vorticity. When conditioned on the alignment of the rod with the
eigenvectors of the strain rate, the largest tumbling rate is obtained when the
rod is oriented at a certain angle to the eigenvector that corresponds to the
smallest eigenvalue, because this particular orientation maximizes the
contribution from both the vorticity and strain.

$\hat{\textbf{N}}$). We use a nematic with negative dielectric anisotropy with
the electric field applied perpendicularly to $\hat{\textbf{N}}$. The field
changes the dielectric tensor at optical frequencies (optic tensor) due to the
following mechanisms: (a) nanosecond creation of the biaxial orientational
order; (b) uniaxial modification of the orientational order that occurs over
timescales of tens of nanoseconds, and (c) the quenching of director
fluctuations with a wide range of characteristic times up to milliseconds. We
develop a model to describe the dynamics of all three mechanisms. We design the
experimental conditions to selectively suppress the contributions from
fluctuations quenching (c) and from the biaxial order effect (a) and thus,
separate the contributions of the three mechanisms in the electro-optic
response. As a result, the experimental data can be well fitted with the model.
The analysis provides a detailed physical picture of how the liquid crystal
responds to a strong electric field on a timescale of nanoseconds. This work
provides a useful guide in the current search of the biaxial nematic phase.
Namely, the temperature dependence of the biaxial susceptibility allows one to
estimate the temperature of the potential uniaxial-to-biaxial phase transition.
An analysis of the fluctuations quenching indicates that on a timescale of
nanoseconds, the classic model with constant viscoelastic material parameters
might reach its limit of validity. The effect of nanosecond electric
modification of the order parameter (NEMOP) can be used in applications in
which one needs to achieve ultrafast (nanosecond) changes of optical

observations are one-bit measurements of some underlying matrix M, and in
particular the observed samples consist only of ones and no zeros. This problem
is motivated by modern applications such as recommender systems and social
networks where only ""likes"" or ""friendships"" are observed. The problem of
learning from only positive and unlabeled examples, called PU
(positive-unlabeled) learning, has been studied in the context of binary
classification. We consider the PU matrix completion problem, where an
underlying real-valued matrix M is first quantized to generate one-bit
observations and then a subset of positive entries is revealed. Under the
assumption that M has bounded nuclear norm, we provide recovery guarantees for
two different observation models: 1) M parameterizes a distribution that
generates a binary matrix, 2) M is thresholded to obtain a binary matrix. For
the first case, we propose a ""shifted matrix completion"" method that recovers M
using only a subset of indices corresponding to ones, while for the second
case, we propose a ""biased matrix completion"" method that recovers the
(thresholded) binary matrix. Both methods yield strong error bounds --- if M is
n by n, the Frobenius error is bounded as O(1/((1-rho)n), where 1-rho denotes
the fraction of ones observed. This implies a sample complexity of O(n\log n)
ones to achieve a small error, when M is dense and n is large. We extend our
methods and guarantees to the inductive matrix completion problem, where rows
and columns of M have associated features. We provide efficient and scalable
optimization procedures for both the methods and demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed methods for link prediction (on real-world networks consisting
of over 2 million nodes and 90 million links) and semi-supervised clustering

hadronization at a local point in $(\eta,\phi)$ space, such as the

molecules is presented. It combines the advantages of variational calculations
and perturbation theory. The vibrational problem is solved by diagonalizing a
Hamiltonian matrix, which is partitioned into two sub-blocks. The first,
smaller sub-block includes matrix elements with the largest contribution to the
energy levels targeted in the calculations. The second, larger sub-block
comprises those basis states which have little effect on these energy levels.
Numerical perturbation theory, implemented as a Jacobi rotation, is used to
compute the contributions from the matrix elements of the second sub-block.
Only the first sub-block needs to be stored in memory and diagonalized.
Calculations of the vibrational-rotational energy levels also employ a
partitioning of the Hamiltonian matrix into sub-blocks, each of which
corresponds either to a single vibrational state or a set of resonating
vibrational states, with all associated rotational levels. Physically, this
partitioning is efficient when the Coriolis coupling between different
vibrational states is small. Numerical perturbation theory is used to include
the cross-contributions from different vibrational states. Separate individual
sub-blocks are then diagonalized, replacing the diagonalization of a large
Hamiltonian matrix with a number of small matrix diagonalizations. Numerical
examples show that the proposed hybrid variational-perturbation method greatly
speeds up the variational procedure without significant loss of precision for
both vibrational-rotational energy levels and transition intensities. The
hybrid scheme can be used for accurate nuclear motion calculations on molecules
with up to 15 atoms on currently available computers.

$\Omega$ is an unstable limit cycle of the drift and the focus is very close to
the limit cycle. We find a new phenomenon of oscillatory decay of the peaks of
the survival probability of the Brownian motion in $\Omega$. We compute
explicitly the complex-valued second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(\Omega$) of the
Fokker-Planck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions and show that it is
responsible for the peaks. Specifically, we demonstrate that the dominant
oscillation frequency equals $1/{\mathfrak{I}}m\{\lambda_2(\Omega)\}$ and is
independent of the relative noise strength. We apply the analysis to a
canonical system and compare the density of exit points on $\partial \Omega$ to
that obtained from stochastic simulations. We find that this density is
concentrated in a small portion of the boundary, thus rendering the exit a
narrow escape problem. Unlike the case in the classical activated escape
problem, the principal eigenvalue does not necessarily decay exponentially as
the relative noise strength decays. The oscillatory narrow escape problem
arises in a mathematical model of neural networks with synaptic depression. We
identify oscillation peaks in the density of the time the network spends in a
specific state. This observation explains the oscillations of stochastic
trajectories around a focus prior to escape and also the non-Poissonian escape
times. This phenomenon has been observed and reported in the neural network
literature.

results on two of the best examples of jet-driven outflows traced by cold and

able to locate the region where the outflow occurs. This appears to be
coincident with bright radio features and regions where the interaction between
radio plasma jet and ISM is known to occur, thus strongly supporting the idea
of jet-driven outflows. We have also imaged the distribution of the outflowing
gas. The results clearly show the effect that expanding radio jets and lobes
have on the ISM. This appears to be in good agreement with what predicted from
numerical simulations. Furthermore, the results show that cold gas is
associated with these powerful phenomena and can be formed - likely via
efficient cooling - even after a strong interaction and fast shocks. The
discovery of similar fast outflows of cold gas in weak radio sources is further
increasing the relevance that the effect of the radio plasma can have on the
surrounding medium and on the host galaxy.

increases the wetting temperature or even makes the surface hydrophobic. Since
for macroscopically corrugated surfaces the solid texture does indeed amplify
wetting there must exist a crossover between two length-scale regimes that are
distinguished by opposite response on surface roughening. This demonstrates how

with discretization of particle velocity space, which combines the advantages

(UGKS) method, such as the simplified flux evaluation scheme, flexible mesh
adaption and the asymptotic preserving properties. However, DUGKS is proposed
for near incompressible fluid flows, the existing compressible effect may cause
some serious errors in simulating incompressible problems. To diminish the
compressible effect, in this paper a novel DUGKS model with external force is
developed for incompressible fluid flows by modifying the approximation of
Maxwellian distribution. Meanwhile, due to the pressure boundary scheme, which
is wildly used in many applications, has not been constructed for DUGKS, the
non-equilibrium extrapolation (NEQ) scheme for both velocity and pressure
boundary conditions is introduced. To illustrate the potential of the proposed
model, numerical simulations of steady and unsteady flows are performed. The
results indicate that the proposed model can reduce the compressible effect
efficiently against the original DUGKS model, and the NEQ scheme fits well with
our model as they are both of second-order accuracy. We also implement the
proposed model in simulating the three dimensional problem: cubical lid-driven
flow. The comparisons of numerical solutions and benchmarks are presented in
terms of data and topology. And the motion pattern of the fluid particles in a
specific area is characterized for the steady-state cubical lid-driven flows.

report a trion (charged exciton) binding energy of 190 meV in few-layer
phosphorene at room temperature, which is nearly one to two orders of magnitude
larger than those in 2D TMD semiconductors (20-30 meV) and quasi-2D quantum

severely hurdled by their intrinsically small optical cross-sections.
Phosphorene offers an elegant way to overcome this hurdle by enabling quasi-1D
excitonic and trionic behaviors in a large 2D area, allowing optoelectronic
integration. We experimentally validated the quasi-1D nature of excitonic and
trionic dynamics in phospherene by demonstrating completely linearly polarized
light emission from excitons and trions. The implications of the
extraordinarily large trion binding energy in a higher-than-one-dimensional

observe the fundamental many-body interactions in the quasi-1D region. The
strong photoluminescence emission in phosphorene has been electrically tuned

retracting it once it is in contact with preys. A strong adhesion between the

ensure a successful capture. To determine the mechanism responsible for this
strong bond, the viscosity of the mucus produced at the chameleon's tongue pad
is measured by using the viscous drag exerted on rolling beads by a thin layer
of mucus. The viscosity of this secretion is found to be about 400 times larger
than the one of human saliva. With a dynamical model for viscous adhesion
describing the motion of the compliant tongue and of the prey during the
retraction phase, the evolution of the maximum prey size with respect to the
chameleon body length is derived. This evolution is successfully compared with
in vivo observations for various chameleon species and shows that the size of
the captured preys is not limited by viscous adhesion thanks to the high mucus
viscosity and the large contact area between the prey and the tongue.

derivatives in the equation of motion of the scalar field that governs the
fifth force in a given modified gravity theory. To test the validity of this
approximation, we analyse the case of $f(R)$ gravity beyond this quasi-static
limit, by considering effects, if any, these terms have in the matter and
velocity divergence cosmic fields. To this end, we use the adaptive mesh
refinement code ECOSMOG to study three variants ($|f_{R}|= 10^{-4}[$F4$],
10^{-5}[$F5$]$ and $10^{-6}[$F6$]$) of the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model,
each of which refers to a different magnitude for the scalar field that
generates the fifth force. We find that for F4 and F5, which show stronger
deviations from standard gravity, a low-resolution simulation is enough to
conclude that time derivatives make a negligible contribution to the matter
distribution. The F6 model shows a larger deviation from the quasi-static
approximation, but one that diminishes when re-simulated at higher resolution.
We therefore come to the conclusion that the quasi-static approximation is
valid for the most practical applications in $f(R)$ cosmologies.

readily combined into an ""area angle"" that can quickly track the severity of
multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds
for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred
through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would
monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur
to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of
power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in

is a nonlinear effect and its analysis is the main objective of this article.
We consider a model that captures the main mechanisms observed in high

the temperature, we carry out a linearized stability analysis around a base
state of uniform shearing solutions, and quantitatively assess the effects of
the various mechanisms affecting the problem: thermal softening, momentum
diffusion and thermal diffusion. Then, we turn to the nonlinear model, and

Industrial Average on a typical trading day are modeled with Lorentzian
functions. The resonant-like structures are characterized by the values of the
basic ratio: the average lifetime of the individual states associated with a
given structural form divided by the average interval between adjacent states.
Values of the ratio are determined for three structural forms characterized by
the average intervals: 50 to 100 seconds (the fine structure), approximately10
minutes, and approximately1 hour (the intermediate structures I and II). During
the trading day the values of the basic ratio associated with the fine
structure of the index are found to lie in the narrow range from 0.49 to 0.52.
This finding is characteristic of the highly statistical nature of many-body
systems typified by daily trading. It is therefore proposed that the value of
this ratio, determined in the first hour-or-so on a given day, be used to
provide information concerning the likely performance of the fine, statistical
component of the index for the remainder of the trading day. For the
intermediate structures the basic ratios are approximately 0.6 and therefore
they too can be analyzed as individual states.
  Keywords: Analytical economics; Lorentzian analyses of statistical structures
in the Dow Jones Industrial Average; basic parameters of economic indices.

frequency amplitude and phase in narrow band devices such as a Superconducting
RF (SRF) cavity driven by constant power output devices i.e. magnetrons. The
ability to use low cost high efficiency magnetrons for accelerator RF power
systems, with tight vector regulation, presents a substantial cost savings in
both construction and operating costs compared to current RF power system
technology. An operating CW system at 2.45 GHz has been experimentally
developed. Vector control of an injection locked magnetron has been extensively
tested and characterized with a SRF cavity as the load. Amplitude dynamic range
of 30 dB, amplitude stability of 0.3% r.m.s, and phase stability of 0.26
degrees r.m.s. has been demonstrated.
