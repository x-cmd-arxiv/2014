aims to generate flavor structure around TeV scale. While the original Little
Flavor only included the quark sector, here we build the lepton part of the
Little Flavor model and explore its phenomenology. The model produces the
neutrino mixing matrix and Majorana masses of the Standard Model neutrinos
through coupling to heavy lepton partners and Little Higgses. We combine the
usual right-handed seesaw mechanism with global symmetry protection to suppress
the Standard Model neutrino masses, and identify the TeV partners of leptons as
right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The lepton masses and mixing matrix are
calculated perturbatively in the theory.
  The TeV new gauge bosons have suppressed decay width in dilepton channels.
Even assuming the Standard Model couplings, the branching ratios to normal
dilepton channels are largely reduced in the model, to evade the bound from
current $Z'$ search. It also opens up the new search channels for exotic gauge
bosons, especially Z' -> MET + multi L+jets. The multiple lepton partners will
create new chain decay signals in flavor related processes in colliders, which
also give rise to flavor anomalies. The lepton flavor violation process can be
highly suppressed in charged lepton sector and happens only through neutrinos.

  First we prove that if $R^-$ is $\alpha$-subcritical for some $\alpha \in

the spectra and can be probed with lasers. The most direct advantage of our
proposal comes from the low degeneracy of clock levels and the simplicity of
atomic structure in combination with negligible quadrupolar shift. We
demonstrate that such clocks can have projected fractional accuracies below the

radiation, Zeeman, AC-Stark and quadrupolar shifts. Notice that
usually-employed hyperfine clock transitions lie in the microwave spectral
region. Our proposal moves such transitions to the optical domain. As the
hyperfine transition frequencies depend on the fine-structure constant,
electron-to-proton mass ratio, and nuclear magnetic moment, our proposal
expands the range of experimental schemes for probing space and time variations

of crowdsourcing at scale involves adjusting many variables, a very important
one being the number of workers needed per human intelligence task (HIT). We
consider the crowdsourcing task of learning the answer to simple
multiple-choice HITs, which are representative of many relevance experiments.
In order to provide statistically significant results, one often needs to ask
multiple workers to answer the same HIT. A stopping rule is an algorithm that,
given a HIT, decides for any given set of worker answers if the system should
stop and output an answer or iterate and ask one more worker. Knowing the
historic performance of a worker in the form of a quality score can be
beneficial in such a scenario. In this paper we investigate how to devise
better stopping rules given such quality scores. We also suggest adaptive
exploration as a promising approach for scalable and automatic creation of
ground truth. We conduct a data analysis on an industrial crowdsourcing
platform, and use the observations from this analysis to design new stopping
rules that use the workers' quality scores in a non-trivial manner. We then
perform a simulation based on a real-world workload, showing that our algorithm
performs better than the more naive approaches.

ways to determine a d-level quantum state or distinguish such states. It
entails designing constrained elementary measurements extracted from maximal
abelian subsets of a unitary basis U for the operator algebra B(H) of a Hilbert
space H of finite dimension d > 3 or, after choosing an orthonormal basis for
H, for the *-algebra Md of complex matrices of order d > 3. Illustrations are
given for the techniques. It is shown that the Schwinger basis U of unitary
operators can give for d, a product of primes p and a, the ideal number d^2 of
rank one projectors that have a few quantum mechanical overlaps (or, for that
matter, a few angles between the corresponding unit vectors). We also give a
combination of the tensor product and constrained elementary measurement
techniques to deal with all d. A comparison is drawn for different forms of
unitary bases for the Hilbert space and also for different Hilbert space
factors of the tensor product. In the process we also study the equivalence
relation on unitary bases defined by R. F. Werner [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34

bases, find an invariant for equivalence classes in terms of certain commuting
systems, called fan representations, and, relate it to mutually unbiased bases
and Hadamard matrices. Illustrations are given in the context of latin squares
and projective representations as well.

term or, more generally, by a differential inclusion with velocity set
$F(t,x)$. Certain properties of state trajectories can be derived when, in
addition to other hypotheses, it is assumed that $F(t,x)$ is merely measurable
w.r.t. the time variable $t$. But sometimes a refined analysis requires the
imposition of stronger hypotheses regarding the $t$ dependence of $F(t,x)$.
Stronger forms of necessary conditions for state trajectories that minimize a
cost can derived, for example, if it is hypothesized that $F(t,x)$ is Lipschitz
continuous w.r.t. $t$. It has recently become apparent that interesting
addition properties of state trajectories can still be derived, when the
Lipschitz continuity hypothesis is replaced by the weaker requirement that
$F(t,x)$ has bounded variation w.r.t. $t$. This paper introduces a new concept
of multifunctions $F(t,x)$ that have bounded variation w.r.t. $t$ near a given
state trajectory, of special relevance to control system analysis. Properties
of such multifunctions are derived and their significance is illustrated by an
application to sensitivity analysis.

with A* often runs into problems. Although some ""work arounds"" have been

pinpoint its origin. In this paper, we argue that the origins of this problem

also use cost-based evaluation functions (i.e., f(n) is a cost estimate). We
show that cost-based evaluation functions become ill-behaved whenever there is
a wide variance in action costs; something that is all too common in planning
domains. The general solution to this malady is what we call a surrogatesearch,
where a surrogate evaluation function that doesn't directly track the cost
objective, and is resistant to cost-variance, is used. We will discuss some
compelling choices for surrogate evaluation functions that are based on size
rather that cost. Of particular practical interest is a cost-sensitive version
of size-based evaluation function -- where the heuristic estimates the size of
cheap paths, as it provides attractive quality vs. speed tradeoffs

Evidently, general cognitive competences are a product of a prolonged and

development is a primary key to understanding the emergence of intelligent
behavior. This paper develops the theoretical foundations for a model that
generalizes the process of cognitive development. The model aims to provide a
realistic scheme for the synthesis of scalable cognitive systems with an
open-ended range of capabilities. Major concepts and theories of human
cognitive development are introduced and briefly explored focusing on the
enactive approach to cognition and the concept of sense-making. The initial
scheme of human cognitive development is then generalized by introducing the
philosophy of individuation and the abstract mechanism of transduction. The
theory of individuation provides the ground for the necessary paradigmatic
shift from cognitive systems as given products to cognitive development as a
formative process of self-organization. Next, the conceptual model is specified
as a scalable scheme of networks of agents. The mechanisms of individuation are
formulated in context independent information theoretical terms. Finally, the
paper discusses two concrete aspects of the generative model -- mechanisms of
transduction and value modulating systems. These are topics of further research
towards a computationally realizable model.

linear decomposition of any given signal in a set of atoms, collected into a
so-called dictionary. Relevant sparse representations are obtained by relaxing
the orthogonality condition of the atoms, yielding overcomplete dictionaries
with an extended number of atoms. More generally than the linear decomposition,
overcomplete kernel dictionaries provide an elegant nonlinear extension by
defining the atoms through a mapping kernel function (e.g., the gaussian
kernel). Models based on such kernel dictionaries are used in neural networks,
gaussian processes and online learning with kernels.
  The quality of an overcomplete dictionary is evaluated with a diversity
measure the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel measures.
In this paper, we develop a framework to examine overcomplete kernel
dictionaries with the entropy from information theory. Indeed, a higher value
of the entropy is associated to a further uniform spread of the atoms over the
space. For each of the aforementioned diversity measures, we derive lower
bounds on the entropy. Several definitions of the entropy are examined, with an
extensive analysis in both the input space and the mapped feature space.

relation observed between the ionizing continuum and the line emission. To
investigate this relation, we have conducted a series of multiwavelength

reasonable assumption, objects like queues and stacks cannot emulate the
missing registers. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, initialization,
shown to have no computational consequences when registers are readily

no registers are allowed. Finally, we show that without registers, the number

remaining from the ""Big Bang"" was made in 1948. This derived from the seminal
dissertation work of Ralph A. Alpher. He was a doctoral student of George A.
Gamow and developed several critical advances in cosmology in late 1946, 1947,
and 1948. Alpher developed the ideas of ""hot"" big bang cosmology to a high
degree of physical precision, and was the first to present the idea that
radiation, not matter, predominated the early universal adiabatic expansion
first suggested by A. Friedmann in the early 1920s. Alpher and Herman predicted
the residual relic black-body temperature in 1948 and 1949 at around 5 K.
However, to this day, this prediction, and other seminal ideas in big bang
cosmology, have often been attributed erroneously to the better-known George A.
Gamow. This article reviews some of the more egregious and even farcical errors
in the scholarly literature about Ralph A. Alpher and his place in the history
of big bang cosmology. Two such errors are that (a) Alpher was a fictive
person; or (b) that like the French mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki, Alpher was
a ""conglomerate"" of theoreticians.

surrounding DG Tau B. The $^{12}$CO(2-1) line observations, on the other hand,
revealed emission associated with the disk and the asymmetric outflow related
with this source. Velocity asymmetries about the flow axis are found over the
entire length of the flow. The amplitude of the velocity differences is of the
order of 1 -- 2 km s$^{-1}$ over distances of about 300 -- 400 AU. We interpret
them as a result of outflow rotation. The sense of the outflow and disk
rotation is the same. Infalling gas from a rotating molecular core cannot
explain the observed velocity gradient within the flow. Magneto-centrifugal
disk winds or photoevaporated disk winds can produce the observed rotational
speeds if they are ejected from a keplerian disk at radii of several tens of
AU. Nevertheless, these slow winds ejected from large radii are not very
massive, and cannot account for the observed linear momentum and angular
momentum rates of the molecular flow. Thus, the observed flow is probably
entrained material from the parent cloud. DG Tau B is a good laboratory to
model in detail the entrainment process and see if it can account for the
observed angular momentum.

performed experiments that cover a broad range of orientations of the driving
force (gravity) with respect to the columns (or rows) in the square array of
posts. We observe that as the forcing angle increases particles initially
locked to move parallel to the columns in the array begin to move across the
columns of obstacles and migrate at angles different from zero. We measure the
probability that a particle would move across a column of obstacles, and define
the critical angle {\theta}c as the forcing angle at which this probability is
1/2. We show that critical angle depends both on particle size and shape, thus
enabling both size- and shape-based separations. Finally, we show that using
the diameter of the inscribed sphere as the characteristic size of the
particles the corresponding critical angle becomes independent of particle
shape and the relationship between them is linear. This linear and possibly
universal behavior of the critical angle as a function of the diameter of the
inscribed sphere could provide guidance in the design and optimization of g-DLD

generated by a Lagrangian plus actuators, and a discrete component where leg
transfer takes place. The discrete component typically consists of a locally
embedded co-dimension one submanifold in the continuous state space of the
robot, called the switching surface, and a reset map that provides a new
initial condition when a solution of the continuous component intersects the
switching surface. The aim of this paper is to identify a low-dimensional
submanifold of the switching surface, which, when it can be rendered invariant
by the closed-loop dynamics, leads to asymptotically stable periodic gaits. The
paper begins this process by studying the well-known 3D Linear Inverted
Pendulum (LIP) model, where analytical results are much easier to obtain. A key
contribution here is the notion of \textit{self-synchronization}, which refers
to the periods of the pendular motions in the sagittal and frontal planes
tending to a common period. The notion of invariance resulting from the study
of the 3D LIP model is then extended to a 9-DOF 3D biped. A numerical study is
performed to illustrate that asymptotically stable walking may be obtained.

intensity of chromospheric shocks also displays a long term (about 20~min)
variations. NST's high spatial resolution \ha\ data allowed us to conclude that
in this sunspot umbral flashes (UFs) appeared in the form of narrow bright
lanes stretched along the light bridges and around clusters of umbral bright
points. Time series also suggested that UFs preferred to appear on the
sunspot-center side of light bridges, which may indicate the existence of a
compact sub-photospheric driver of sunspot oscillations. The sunspot's umbra as
seen in the IRIS chromospheric and transition region data appears bright above
the locations of light bridges and the areas where the dark umbra is dotted
with clusters of umbral dots. Co-spatial and co-temporal data from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory showed that
the same locations were associated with bright footpoints of coronal loops
suggesting that the light bridges may play an important role in heating the
coronal sunspot loops. Finally, the power spectra analysis showed that the
intensity of chromospheric and transition region oscillations significantly
vary across the umbra and with height, suggesting that umbral non-uniformities
and the structure of sunspot magnetic fields may play a role in wave
propagation and heating of umbral loops.

probabilistic, noisy and uncertain data, there has been an increasing interest
in designing algorithms for geometric or combinatorial optimization problems
over such data. In this paper, we initiate the study of constructing
$\epsilon$-kernel coresets for uncertain points. We consider uncertainty in the
existential model where each point's location is fixed but only occurs with a
certain probability, and the locational model where each point has a
probability distribution describing its location. An $\epsilon$-kernel coreset
approximates the width of a point set in any direction. We consider
approximating the expected width (an \expkernel), as well as the probability
distribution on the width (an \probkernel) for any direction. We show that
there exists a set of $O(1/\epsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ deterministic points which
approximate the expected width under the existential and locational models, and
we provide efficient algorithms for constructing such coresets. We show,
however, it is not always possible to find a subset of the original uncertain
points which provides such an approximation. However, if the existential
probability of each point is lower bounded by a constant, an exp-kernel\ (or an
fpow-kernel) is still possible. We also construct an quant-kernel coreset in
linear time. Finally, combining with known techniques, we show a few
applications to approximating the extent of uncertain functions, maintaining
extent measures for stochastic moving points and some shape fitting problems
under uncertainty.

novel approach that (1) consistently combines photometric (broadband) and
spectroscopic (equivalent widths of emission lines) data, and (2) uses
physically motivated SFHs with non-uniform variations of the star formation

confirmed LMSFGs (7.3 < log M*/Msun < 8.0) at 0.3 < z_spec < 0.9 in the
Extended-Chandra Deep Field-South field (E-CDF-S). Among them, 24 were selected
with photometric stellar mass log M*/Msun < 8.0, 0.3 < z_phot < 1.0, and NB816

sample of 43 more massive spectroscopically confirmed galaxies (8.0 < log

derived for both samples place our targets on the standard main sequence of

appears to form 90% of the median stellar mass inferred for the sample in the
0.5-1.8 Gyr immediately preceding the observation. These results suggest a

  Methods for Stochastic Variational Inequalities",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally, stochastic approximation schemes for SVIs have relied on
strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian properties of the underlying map. In
contrast, we consider monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems
where the strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian assumptions on the mappings are
weakened. In the first part of the paper, to address such shortcomings, a
regularized smoothed SA (RSSA) scheme is developed wherein the stepsize,
smoothing, and regularization parameters are diminishing sequences updated
after every iteration. Under suitable assumptions on the sequences, we show
that the algorithm generates iterates that converge to a solution in an almost
sure sense, extending the results in [16] to the non-Lipschitzian regime.
Motivated by the need to develop non-asymptotic rate statements, in the second
part of the paper, we develop a variant of the RSSA scheme, denoted by
aRSSA$_r$, in which we employ a weighted iterate-averaging, parametrized by a
scalar $r$ where $r = 1$ provides us with the standard averaging scheme. We
make several contributions in this context: First, we show that the gap
function associated with the sequences by the aRSSA$_r$ scheme tends to zero
when the parameter sequences are chosen appropriately. Second, we show that the
gap function associated with the averaged sequence diminishes to zero at the
optimal rate $\cal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ after $K$ steps when smoothing and
regularization are suppressed and $r < 1$, thus improving the rate statement
for the standard averaging which admits a rate of $\cal{O}(\ln(K)/\sqrt{K})$.
Third, we develop a window-based variant of this scheme that also displays the
optimal rate for $r < 1$. Notably, we prove the superiority of the scheme with
$r < 1$ with its counterpart with $r=1$ in terms of the constant factor of the
error bound when the size of the averaging window is sufficiently large.

which violates the rotational symmetry, the Nambu-Goldstone bosons become
massive and massless bosons are concealed. We present a model where the massive
boson becomes a massless boson as a result of the perturbative fluctuation. In
our model the ${\bf Z}_2$-symmetry associated with the chirality is also
broken. The transition occurs as a (weak) first-order transition at the
critical point. The ground state at absolute zero will flow into the state with
more massless bosons due to fluctuation effects at finite temperature.

optimize multi-cell solar systems; namely multi-junction and split spectrum
cells. The new approach consists of combining the CS with the Nelder-Mead
method. More precisely, instead of using single solutions as nests for the CS,
we use the concept of a simplex which is used in the Nelder-Mead algorithm.
This makes it possible to use the flip operation introduces in the Nelder-Mead
algorithm instead of the Levy flight which is a standard part of the CS. In
this way, the hybridized algorithm becomes more robust and less sensitive to
parameter tuning which exists in CS. The goal of our work was to optimize the
performance of multi-cell solar systems. Although the underlying problem
consists of the minimization of a function of a relatively small number of
parameters, the difficulty comes from the fact that the evaluation of the
function is complex and only a small number of evaluations is possible. In our
test, we show that the new method has a better performance when compared to
similar but more compex hybridizations of Nelder-Mead algorithm using genetic
algorithms or particle swarm optimization on standard benchmark functions.
Finally, we show that the new method outperforms some standard meta-heuristics

for protecting the ST-SD transmission against the eavesdropper with the aid of
both single-relay and multi-relay selection. To be specific, only the ""best"" SR
is chosen in the single-relay selection for assisting the secondary
transmission, whereas the multi-relay selection invokes multiple SRs for
simultaneously forwarding the ST's transmission to the SD. We analyze both the
intercept probability and outage probability of the proposed single-relay and
multi-relay selection schemes for the secondary transmission relying on
realistic spectrum sensing. We also evaluate the performance of classic direct
transmission and artificial noise based methods for the purpose of comparison
with the proposed relay selection schemes. It is shown that as the intercept
probability requirement is relaxed, the outage performance of the direct
transmission, the artificial noise based and the relay selection schemes
improves, and vice versa. This implies a trade-off between the security and
reliability of the secondary transmission in the presence of eavesdropping
attacks, which is referred to as the security-reliability trade-off (SRT).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SRTs of the single-relay and multi-relay
selection schemes are generally better than that of classic direct
transmission. Moreover, as the number of SRs increases, the SRTs of the

gravity estimates for a large amount of survey data with the help of the small

regression model for the estimation of the surface gravity supervised by 1,374
LAMOST giant stars with Kepler seismic surface gravity. The new approach can
reduce the uncertainty of the estimates down to about 0.1 dex, which is better
than the LAMOST pipeline by at least a factor of 2, for the spectra with

LAMOST pipeline, the revised logg values provide a significantly improved match
to the expected distribution of red clump and RGB stars from stellar
isochrones. Moreover, even the red bump stars, which extend to only about 0.1
dex in logg, can be discriminated from the new estimated surface gravity. The
method is then applied to about 350,000 LAMOST metal-rich giant stars to
provide improved surface gravity estimates. In general, the uncertainty of the

accordingly coveted by adversaries. When highly sensitive data is involved, an
organization may resort to air-gap isolation, in which there is no networking
connection between the inner network and the external world. While infiltrating
an air-gapped network has been proven feasible in recent years (e.g., Stuxnet),
data exfiltration from an air-gapped network is still considered to be one of
the most challenging phases of an advanced cyber-attack. In this paper we
present ""AirHopper"", a bifurcated malware that bridges the air-gap between an
isolated network and nearby infected mobile phones using FM signals. While it
is known that software can intentionally create radio emissions from a video
display unit, this is the first time that mobile phones are considered in an
attack model as the intended receivers of maliciously crafted radio signals. We
examine the attack model and its limitations, and discuss implementation
considerations such as stealth and modulation methods. Finally, we evaluate
AirHopper and demonstrate how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from
physically isolated computer to mobile phones at a distance of 1-7 meters, with
effective bandwidth of 13-60 Bps (Bytes per second).

architecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by
making it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In
machine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by
computing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies
error signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the
neuron's axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely
choreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be
impossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for
deep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random
synaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful
information from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In
essence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism
performs as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems
and describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration
provides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals
generated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held
assumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.

networks (TWRNs) in the presence of synchronization errors between the two
sources. The unpredictable synchronization error leads to time domain offset
and signal arriving order (SAO) ambiguity when two signals sent from two
sources are superimposed at the relay. A two-step channel estimation algorithm
is first proposed, in which the linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE)
estimator is used to obtain initial channel estimates based on pilot symbols
and a linear minimum error probability (LMEP) estimator is then developed to
update these estimates. Optimal training sequences and power allocation at the
relay are designed to further improve the performance for LMMSE based initial
channel estimation. To tackle the SAO ambiguity problem, the generalized
likelihood ratio testing (GLRT) method is applied and an upper bound on the SAO
detection error probability is derived. By using the SAO information, a scaled
LMEP estimation algorithm is proposed to compensate the performance degradation
caused by SAO detection error. Simulation results show that the proposed
estimation algorithms can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by
asynchronous transmissions in TWRNs, thus significantly outperforming the
existing channel estimation algorithms.

a dataset including measurements from the LHC has been performed. The
determinations have been carried out according to the NNPDF methodology,
leading to a fit minimising parametrisation bias and with an accurate account
of PDF uncertainty. In this thesis the importance of QCD measurements at the
LHC to PDF extraction are discussed, and we summarise some of the technical
difficulties in their inclusion into PDF fits. A number of methods are
presented that permit the efficient inclusion of these observables into PDF
determinations. Firstly a Bayesian reweighting procedure taking advantage of
the Monte Carlo representation of PDF uncertainties in NNPDF sets is discussed,
which is demonstrated by a study of the impact of early W production asymmetry
measurements from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb upon an earlier PDF set. A package for
the fast computation of observables in an automated NLO framework is presented,
providing an interface between Monte Carlo event generators and NLO
interpolation tools. Finally, a method of combining PDF evolution with
interpolating codes for hadronic observable computation is described. This
method largely overcomes the computational difficulties in performing fast
perturbative QCD predictions for collider observables. The method has been
applied to the determination of PDFs from a global dataset including vector
boson production data from LHCb, ATLAS and CMS along with inclusive jet data
from ATLAS. Finally, the method of closure testing is introduced, and the
method is applied to the study of the NNPDF methodology. A number of
improvements are found in the minimisation and stopping procedures, which are
adopted for the development of the next NNPDF release, NNPDF3.0.

of using randomization to improve the performance of the heuristic, we
repetitively generate a number of solutions by using a combination of different
