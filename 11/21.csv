used to create a homogeneous database of magnetic field measurements. However,
no systematic comparison of FORS field measurements to those obtained with
other instruments has been undertaken so far. AIMS. We exploit the FORS archive
of circular spectropolarimetric data to examine in a general way how reliable
and accurate field detections obtained with FORS are. METHODS. We examine the
observations of Ap and Bp stars, on the grounds that almost all of the
unambiguous detections of magnetic fields in the FORS1 archive are in these
kinds of stars. We assess the overall quality of the FORS1 magnetic data by
examining the consistency of field detections with what is known from previous
measurements obtained with other instruments, and we look at patterns of
internal consistency. RESULTS. FORS1 magnetic measurements are fully consistent
with those made with other instruments, and the internal consistency of the
data is excellent. However, it is important to recognise that each choice of
grism and wavelength window constitutes a distinct instrumental measuring
system, and that simultaneous field measurements in different instrumental
systems may produce field strength values that differ up to 20 %, or more.
Furthermore, we found that field measurements using hydrogen lines only yield
results that meaningfully reflect the field strength as sampled specifically by
lines of hydrogen for stars with effective temperatures above about 9000 K.
CONCLUSIONS. In general the magnetic field measurements of Ap and Bp stars
obtained with FORS1 are of excellent quality, accuracy and precision, and FORS1
provides an extremely useful example that offers valuable lessons for field
measurements with other low- resolution Cassegrain spectropolarimeters.

self-organization is in the atomic scale resolution while a time resolution is

due to introduction of two novel concepts, atomic fragments (fraton) regarded
as interacting pseudo-particles and structural clusters that are central for
the proposed construction of the model Hamiltonian as a bilinear expansion in
structural clusters. Both novelties provide a self-organization of even

turning on the lattice potential is non-adiabatic. To confirm this behavior, we
compute the timescales for relaxation in this system, and find that
equilibration times are comparable with the known heating rates. The similarity

different implementations of the perturbative series and on independent

that result from this double scale variation is crucial since some of the

that double scale variation might also lead to an overestimate of the

each moment and to discard series that are artificially spoiled by specific
choices of the renormalization scales. We also apply the new method to an

launched (i) at CERN with the Future Circular Colliders (FCC), of which an e+e-
collider is a potential first step (FCC-ee, formerly caller TLEP) and (ii) in
China with the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). Hosted in a tunnel
of at least 50 km (CEPC) or 80-100 km (FCC), both projects can deliver very
high luminosity from the Z peak to HZ threshold (CEPC) and even to the top pair
threshold and above (FCC-ee). At the ZH production optimum, around 240 GeV, the
FCC-ee (CEPC) will be able to deliver 10 (5) ab-1 integrated luminosity in 5
(10) years with 4 (2) interaction points: hence to produce millions of Higgs
bosons through the Higgsstrahlung process and vector boson fusion processes.
This sample opens the possibility of subper- cent precision absolute
measurements of the Higgs boson couplings to fermions and to gauge-bosons, and
of the Higgs boson width. These precision measurements are potentially
sensitive to multi-TeV range new physics interacting with the scalar sector.
The ZH production mechanism also gives access to the invisible or exotic
branching ratios down to the per mil level, and with a more limited precision
to the triple Higgs coupling. For the FCC-ee, the luminosity expected at the
top pair production threshold (sqrt(s) ~ 340-350 GeV) further improves some of
these accuracies significantly, and is sensitive to the Higgs boson coupling to
the top quark.

manipulation experiments, so that polymer features are tested at a nanometric
scale. Yet devising mathematical models to get further insight beyond the
commonly studied force--elongation relation is typically hard. Here we draw
from techniques developed in the context of disordered systems to solve models
for single and double--stranded DNA stretching in the limit of a long polymeric
chain. Since we directly derive the marginals for the molecule local
orientation, our approach allows us to readily calculate the experimental
elongation as well as other observables at wish. As an example, we evaluate the
correlation length as a function of the stretching force. Furthermore, we are
able to fit successfully our solution to real experimental data. Although the
model is admittedly phenomenological, our findings are very sound. For
single--stranded DNA our solution yields the correct (monomer) scale and, yet
more importantly, the right persistence length of the molecule. In the
double--stranded case, our model reproduces the well-known overstretching
transition and correctly captures the ratio between native DNA and
overstretched DNA. Also in this case the model yields a persistence length in
good agreement with consensus, and it gives interesting insights into the
bending stiffness of the native and overstretched molecule, respectively.

in which the main photospheric polarities are seen to rotate one around the
other during several solar rotations. We first show that differential rotation
is not at the origin of this large change in the tilt angle. A possible origin
of this distortion is the nonlinear development of a kink-instability at the
base of the convective zone; this would imply the formation of a non-planar
flux tube which, while emerging across the photosphere, would show a rotation
of its photospheric polarities as observed. A characteristic of the flux tubes
deformed by this mechanism is that their magnetic twist and writhe should have
the same sign. From the observed evolution of the tilt of the bipoles, we
derive the sign of the writhe of the flux tube forming each AR; while we
compute the sign of the twist from transverse field measurements. Comparing the
handedness of the magnetic twist and writhe, we find that the presence of
kink-unstable flux tubes is coherent with no more than 35\% of the 20 cases for
which the sign of the twist can be unambiguously determined. Since at most only
a fraction of the tilt evolution can be explained by this process, we discuss
the role that other mechanisms may play in the inferred deformation. We find
that 36\% of the 22 cases may result from the action of the Coriolis force as
the flux tube travels through the convection zone. Furthermore, because several
bipoles overpass in their rotation the mean toroidal (East-West) direction or
rotate away from it, we propose that a possible explanation for the deformation
of all these flux tubes may lie in the interaction with large-scale vortical
motions of the plasma in the convection zone, including also photospheric or
shallow sub-photospheric large scale flows.

fermion field and a $U(1)$ gauge field on the dual fermionic sector in the
charged gravity bulk with hyperscaling violation. We analytically study the
features of the ultraviolet and infrared Green's functions of the dual
fermionic system and we show that as the dipole coupling and the hyperscaling
violation exponent are varied, the fluid possess Fermi, marginal Fermi,
non-Fermi liquid phases and also an additional Mott insulating phase. We find
that the increase of the hyperscaling violation exponent which effectively
reduces the dimensionality of the system makes it harder for the Mott gap to be
formed. We also show that the observed duality between zeros and poles in the
presence of a dipole moment coupling still persists in theories with
hyperscaling violation.

calculating phonon lifetimes and inelastic neutron scattering spectra in solids

in four transitions of CS, using a non-LTE radiative transfer code, indicates
that the core is centrally condensed, with the density decreasing with radius
as $r^{-1.8}$, and that the turbulent velocity increases towards the center.
The dust observations also indicate that the core is highly centrally condensed
and that the average column density is 1.1 g cm$^{-2}$, value slightly above
the theoretical threshold required for the formation of high mass stars. A fit
to the spectral energy distribution of the emission from the core indicates a
dust temperature of $17\pm2$ K, confirming that the core is cold. Spitzer
images show that the core is seen in silhouette from 3.6 to 24.0 $\mu$m and
that is surrounded by an envelope of emission, presumably tracing an externally
excited photo-dissociated region. We found two embedded sources within a region
of 20"" centered at the peak of the core, one of which is young, has a
luminosity of $66~L_\odot$ and is accreting mass with a high accretion rate, of

indicates that the extra space dimensions may remain curled up into very small
space. In this paper, we study quantum mechanical scattering in presence of
extra compact space dimension in the hope of devising a method to get a clue to
the presence of extra space dimension. We consider a simplified model of
scattering, in which a beam of free particles is scattered due to a one
dimensional Dirac-delta potential in presence of an extra compact space
dimension. We find that the incident, reflected and transmitted probability
current densities of the particles contain the information of the extra
dimension. Thus, by measuring experimentally the reflected and transmitted
probability current densities of the particles, we may confirm the presence of
extra dimension. We also show that the idea of compactification of the extra
dimensions gives rise to the quantization of the energy values of the free
particles. So, by measuring the quantized energy values of the scattered free
particles, we may again confirm the presence of extra dimensions. We also
discuss briefly, how the extra compact space dimensions can be detected if the

methods have been developed to guarantee a $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on regret for
subdifferentiable convex loss functions with bounded subgradients, by using a
reduction to linear loss functions. This suggests that linear loss functions
tend to be the hardest ones to learn against, regardless of the underlying
decision spaces. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion looking
at the interplay between the set of possible moves for both the decision maker
and the adversarial environment. This allows us to highlight sharp distinctive
behaviors about the learnability of piecewise linear loss functions. On the one
hand, when the decision set of the decision maker is a polyhedron, we establish
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on regret for a large class of piecewise linear
loss functions with important applications in online linear optimization,
repeated zero-sum Stackelberg games, online prediction with side information,
and online two-stage optimization. On the other hand, we exhibit $o(\sqrt{T})$
learning rates, achieved by the Follow-The-Leader algorithm, in online linear
optimization when the boundary of the decision maker's decision set is curved
and when $0$ does not lie in the convex hull of the environment's decision set.
Hence, the curvature of the decision maker's decision set is a determining
factor for the optimal learning rate. These results hold in a completely
adversarial setting.

the allowed range of the spectral index and flux normalization for various

existing analyses so far assume the flavor composition of the neutrinos at an
astrophysical source to be (1:2:0), it seems rather unnatural to assume only
one type of source, once we recognize the possibility of at least two physical
sources. Bearing this in mind, we entertain the possibility of a two-component
source for the analysis of IceCube data. It appears that our two component
hypothesis explains some key features of the data better than a
single-component scenario, i.e it addresses the apparent energy gap between 400
TeV to about 1 PeV and easily accommodates the observed track to shower ratio.
Given the extreme importance of the flavor composition for the correct
interpretation of the underlying astrophysical processes as well as for the
ramification for particle physics, this two-component flux should be tested as
more data is accumulated.

basic and general simplicial evolution scheme. The linearized regime features a
vertex displacement (`diffeomorphism') symmetry for which we derive an abelian

a simple method to explicitly count the gauge and `graviton' degrees of freedom

each move in the dynamics. It is shown that the 1-4 move generates four `lapse

the only non-trivial equation of motion; and the 4-1 move removes four `lapse

V in 1986, is one of the most central results in the study of graph minors. It
has found numerous applications in algorithmic graph structure theory, for
instance in bidimensionality theory, and it is the basis for several other
structure theorems developed in the graph minors project.
  In the mid-90s, Reed and Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (see [Reed
97, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas 01]), independently, conjectured an
analogous theorem for directed graphs, i.e. the existence of a function f : N
-> N such that every digraph of directed tree-width at least f(k) contains a
directed grid of order k. In an unpublished manuscript from 2001, Johnson,
Robertson, Seymour and Thomas give a proof of this conjecture for planar
digraphs. But for over a decade, this was the most general case proved for the
Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas conjecture.
  Only very recently, this result has been extended to all classes of digraphs
excluding a fixed undirected graph as a minor (see [Kawarabayashi, Kreutzer
14]). In this paper, nearly two decades after the conjecture was made, we are
finally able to confirm the Reed, Johnson, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas
conjecture in full generality and to prove the directed grid theorem.
  As consequence of our results we are able to improve results in Reed et al.
in 1996 [Reed, Robertson, Seymour, Thomas 96] (see also [Open Problem Garden])
on disjoint cycles of length at least l and in [Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi,
Kreutzer 14] on quarter-integral disjoint paths. We expect many more
algorithmic results to follow from the grid theorem.

merging galaxy cores collide, gas infall produces a compact, optically thick
nuclear disk with densities exceeding $10^{-10}$ g cm$^3$. The disk rapidly
accretes higher angular momentum gas from its surroundings reaching $\sim 5$ pc
and a mass of $\gtrsim 10^9$ $M_{\odot}$ in only a few $10^4$ yr. Outside
$\gtrsim 2$ pc it fragments into massive clumps. Instead, supersonic turbulence
prevents fragmentation in the inner parsec region, which remains warm ($\sim
3000-6000$ K) and develops strong non-axisymmetric modes that cause prominent
radial gas inflows ($> 10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), forming an ultra-dense
massive disky core. Angular momentum transport by non-axisymmetric modes should
continue below our spatial resolution limit, quickly turning the disky core
into a supermassive protostar which can collapse directly into a massive black
hole of mass $10^8-10^9$ $M_{\odot}$ via the relativistic radial instability.
Such a ""cold direct collapse""' explains naturally the early emergence of high-z
QSOs. Its telltale signature would be a burst of gravitational waves in the
frequency range $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ Hz, possibly detectable by the planned

innermost regions of the disk is collisionless and two-temperature, with the
ions hotter than the electrons. Yet, whether a collisionless
faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature
accretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron
heating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of
multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale compression
- embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the
field. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to
the adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for
ion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5-30 appropriate for the midplane of
low-luminosity accretion flows, mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton
temperature ratio is > 0.2, whereas if it is < 0.2 the ion cyclotron
instability triggers the growth of strong Alfven-like waves, that pitch-angle
scatter the ions to maintain marginal stability. We develop an analytical model
of electron heating during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability, which
we validate with PIC simulations. We find that for cold electrons (beta_e <
m_e/m_i), the electron energy gain is controlled by the magnitude of the
E-cross-B velocity induced by the ion cyclotron waves. This term is independent
of the initial electron temperature, so it provides a solid energy floor even
for electrons starting with extremely low temperatures. On the other hand, the
electron energy gain for beta_e > m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the
magnetic moment in the growing fields of the instability - is proportional to
the initial electron temperature. Our results have implications for
two-temperature accretion flows as well as the solar wind and intracluster
plasmas. [abridged]

galaxies (SFGs) since a redshift z~5.5 using 2435 (4531) galaxies with highly
reliable (reliable) spectroscopic redshifts in the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey
(VUDS). It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a
large redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies
with spectroscopic redshifts. The log(SFR) - log(M_star) relation for SFGs
remains roughly linear all the way up to z=5 but the SFR steadily increases at
fixed mass with increasing redshift. We find that for stellar masses M_star>3.2
x 10^9 M_sun the SFR increases by a factor ~13 between z=0.4 and z=2.3. We
extend this relation up to z=5, finding an additional increase in SFR by a
factor 1.7 from z=2.3 to z=4.8 for masses M_star > 10^10 M_sun. We observe a
turn-off in the SFR-M_star relation at the highest mass end up to a redshift
z~3.5. We interpret this turn-off as the signature of a strong on-going
quenching mechanism and rapid mass growth. The sSFR increases strongly up to
z~2 but it grows much less rapidly in 2<z<5. We find that the shape of the sSFR
evolution is not well reproduced by cold gas accretion-driven models or the
latest hydrodynamical models. Below z~2 these models have a flatter evolution
(1+z)^{Phi} with Phi=2-2.25 compared to the data which evolves more rapidly
with Phi=2.8+-0.2. Above z~2, the reverse is happening with the data evolving
more slowly with Phi=1.2+-0.1. The observed sSFR evolution over a large
redshift range 0<z<5 and our finding of a non linear main sequence at high mass
both indicate that the evolution of SFR and M_star is not solely driven by gas
accretion. The results presented in this paper emphasize the need to invoke a
more complex mix of physical processes {abridge}

measurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population of
galaxies at $z$~3 should evolve into the massive and bright ($M_r$<-21.5)

physical parameters - such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR) and dust
optical depth - requires spectral synthesis modelling. We analyse the
reliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly adopted
`classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentially
declining functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-line
contribution. Improved modelling techniques and data quality now allow us to
use a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formation
histories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebular
emission (Pacifici et al. 2012). We present a Bayesian analysis of the spectra
and multi-wavelength photometry of 1048 galaxies from the 3D-HST survey in the
redshift range 0.7<z<2.8 and in the stellar mass range 9<log(M/Mo)<12. We find
that, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are systematically
overestimated (~0.1 dex) and SFRs are systematically underestimated (~0.6 dex)
relative to our more sophisticated approach. We also find that the simultaneous
fit of photometric fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break a
degeneracy between SFR and optical depth of the dust, reducing the
uncertainties on these parameters. Finally, we show how the biases of classical
approaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and SFR for
star-forming galaxies (the `Star-Formation Main Sequence'). We conclude that
the normalization, slope and scatter of this relation strongly depend on the
adopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified approach
cannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and SFR.

damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z \approx 2$ using new wide-band
$250-500$ MHz receivers onboard the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The
integrated HI 21cm optical depths are $0.85 \pm 0.16$ km/s (TXS1755+578) and
$2.95 \pm 0.15$ km/s (TXS1850+402). For the $z=1.9698$ DLA towards TXS1755+578,
the difference in HI 21cm and CI profiles and the weakness of the radio core
suggest that the HI 21cm absorption arises towards radio components in the jet,
and that the optical and radio sightlines are not the same. This precludes an
estimate of the DLA spin temperature. For the $z = 1.9888$ DLA towards
TXS1850+402, the absorber covering factor is likely to be close to unity, as
the background source is extremely compact, with all the 5 GHz emission arising
from a region of size $\leq 1.4$ mas. This yields a DLA spin temperature of
${\rm T_s} = (372 \pm 18) \times (f/1.0)$ K, lower than typical ${\rm T_s}$
values in high-$z$ DLAs. This low spin temperature and the relatively high
metallicity of the $z = 1.9888$ DLA ([Zn/H] $= (-0.68 \pm 0.04)$) are
consistent with the anti-correlation between metallicity and spin temperature
that has been earlier found in damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems.

galaxies are the result of their intrinsic emission combined with absorption
along the line of sight produced by the inter-galactic medium (IGM). Here we
analyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Ly_alpha) and its
dispersion along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5<z<5.5 in the
VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We fit model spectra combined with a range of
IGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral fitting algorithm
GOSSIP+. We use these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each
galaxy for several redshift slices from z=2.5 to z=5.5. We find that the mean
IGM transmission defined as Tr(Ly_alpha)=e^{-tau} (with tau the HI optical
depth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55% and 46% at redshifts 2.75, 3,22, 3.70, 4.23, 4.77,
respectively. We compare these results to measurements obtained from quasars
lines of sight and find that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in
excellent agreement with quasar values up to redshift z~4. We find tentative
evidence for a higher IGM transmission at z>= 4 compared to results from QSOs,
but a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents to draw firm
conclusions if the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z>4
takes a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V)>0.15. Most importantly, we
find a large dispersion of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards
distant galaxies with 68% of the distribution within 10 to 17% of the median
value in delta z=0.5 bins, similar to what is found on the LOS towards QSOs. We
demonstrate the importance of taking into account this large range of IGM
transmission when selecting high redshift galaxies based on their colour
properties (e.g. LBG or photometric redshift selection) or otherwise face a
significant incompleteness in selecting high redshift galaxy populations.

annealing devices we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be
expected for Ising spin glass problems. We find that even though a better
scaling compared to simulated classical annealing can be achieved for QMC
simulations, this advantage is due to time discretization and measurements
which are not possible on a physical quantum annealing device. QMC simulations
in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not
show superiority. Our results imply that care has to be taken when using QMC
simulations to assess quantum speedup potential and are consistent with recent
arguments that no quantum speedup should be expected for two-dimensional spin

the influence of modified gravity, voids at all scales tend to be measurably
emptier with correspondingly higher compensation walls. The velocity profiles
reflect this, showing increased outflows inside voids and increased inflows

widely interpreted as the ultimate proof of the impossibility to describe
Bell's polarization states of two entangled particles in terms of a local and

to choose the settings of their measurements. In this paper we note, however,
that Bell's theorem relies crucially on a fourth implicit theoretical
assumption, in addition to the explicit hypotheses of locality, physical
realism and 'free will'. Namely, we note that the proof of Bell's inequalities
for generic models of hidden variables implicitly assumes that there exists an
absolute reference frame of angular coordinates, with respect to which we can
define the polarization properties of the hidden configurations of the pair of
particles. This implicit additional assumption, however, is not required by any
fundamental physical principle and, indeed, it may be incorrect if the hidden
configuration of the pair of entangled particles breaks the rotational symmetry
along an otherwise arbitrary direction. We explicitly show that by giving up to
this additional implicit assumption it is possible to build a local and
realistic model of hidden variables for Bell's polarization states, which
complies with the demands of 'free-will' and fully reproduces the quantum
mechanical predictions. The model presented here offers a new insight into the
notion of quantum entanglement and the role of measurements in the dynamics of

phenomena that do not occur in the previous variants. Our contribution is
two-fold. First, we provide a topological characterization of networks that

is widely considered to play some role in massive-star core collapse. Models of
rotating massive stars naturally develop very strong shear at composition
boundaries, a necessary condition for MRI instability, and the MRI is subject
to triply-diffusive destabilizing effects in radiative regions. We have used
the MESA stellar evolution code to compute magnetic effects due to the
Spruit-Taylor mechanism and the MRI, separately and together, in a sample of
massive star models. We find that the MRI can be active in the later stages of
massive star evolution, leading to mixing effects that are not captured in
models that neglect the MRI. The MRI and related magneto-rotational effects can
move models of given ZAMS mass across ""boundaries"" from degenerate CO cores to
degenerate O/Ne/Mg cores and from degenerate O/Ne/Mg cores to iron cores, thus
affecting the final evolution and the physics of core collapse. The MRI acting
alone can slow the rotation of the inner core in general agreement with the
observed ""initial"" rotation rates of pulsars. The MRI analysis suggests that
localized fields ~10^{12} G may exist at the boundary of the iron core. With
both the ST and MRI mechanisms active in the 20 solar mass model, we find that

solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs
~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^{1/4} lower bound of Aaronson).
Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed,
any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an
O(N^{1-1/2t})-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of
Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum
query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear.

classification decisions for all sentences of a math word problem by utilizing
the correlation among all sentences along with the correlation between the
question sentence and other sentences, and sentence text. The proposed model is
compared with i) a SVM classifier which makes independent classification
decisions for individual sentences by only using the sentence text and ii) a
novel SVM classifier that considers the correlation between the question
sentence and other sentences along with the sentence text. An extensive set of
experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the joint probabilistic
classification model for identifying relevant and irrelevant sentences as well
as the novel SVM classifier that utilizes the correlation between the question
sentence and other sentences. Furthermore, empirical results and analysis show
that i) it is highly beneficial not to remove stopwords and ii) utilizing part
of speech tagging does not make a significant improvement although it has been
shown to be effective for the related task of math word problem type

nonnegative parameter $a \in (0,+\infty)$, similar to $l_p$ with $p \in (0,1]$,
and is known to satisfy unbiasedness, sparsity and Lipschitz continuity
properties. We first consider the constrained minimization problem and discuss
the exact recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal solution based on the null space
property (NSP). We then prove the stable recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal
solution if the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies a restricted isometry property
(RIP). Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in
computing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS. The
inner loop concerns an $l_1$ minimization problem on which we employ the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For the unconstrained

first order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the
optimal value $a=1$, and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes
of sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine
transform matrices (DCT). We find that for both classes of sensing matrices,
the performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with $l_1$ minimization) always
ranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive
to the conditioning of the sensing matrix $A$. DCATL1 is also competitive in

oxide surfaces is not well understood due to the experimental challenges of
preparing surface structures and characterizing reaction pathways. To remedy
this problem, we propose the metal organic framework MOF-74 as an ideal model
system to study water reactions. Its crystalline structure is well
characterized; the metal oxide node mimics surfaces with exposed cations; and
it degrades in water. Combining in situ IR spectroscopy and first-principles
calculations, we explored the MOF-74/water interaction as a function of vapor
pressure and temperature. Here, we show that, while adsorption is reversible
below the water condensation pressure (~19.7 Torr) at room temperature, a
reaction takes place at ~150 centigrades even at low water vapor pressures.
This important finding is unambiguously demonstrated by a clear spectroscopic
signature for the direct reaction using D2O, which is not present using H2O due
to strong phonon coupling. Specifically, a sharp absorption band appears at 970
cm-1 when D2O is introduced at above 150 centigrades, which we attribute to an
O-D bending vibration on the phenolate linker. Although H2O undergoes a similar
dissociation reaction, the corresponding O-H mode is too strongly coupled to
MOF vibrations to detect. In contrast, the O-D mode falls in the phonon gap of
the MOF and remains localized.

cylinder wakes in two dimensions, we observe dynamical similarity of the
frequency of vortex shedding by a cylindrical obstacle. The universality of the

disorder and 2 types of correlated disorders (random dimer arrangements), and
for 2 types of initial conditions: displacement excitations and velocity
excitations. For strongly precompressed chains, the dynamics depend strongly on
the initial condition. For displacement excitations, the long-time behavior of
the second moment $\tilde{m}_2$ has oscillations that depend on the type of
disorder, with a complex trend that differs markedly from a power law and which
is particularly evident for an Anderson disorder. For velocity excitations, we
find a scaling $\tilde{m}_2\sim t^{\gamma}$ (for a constant $\gamma$) for all 3
types of disorder. For weakly precompressed (strongly nonlinear) chains,
$\tilde{m}_2$ and the inverse participation ratio $P^{-1}$ satisfy
$\tilde{m}_2\sim t^{\gamma}$ and $P^{-1}\sim t^{-\eta}$, and the dynamics is
superdiffusive for all examined cases. When precompression is strong, the IPR
decreases slowly for all 3 types of disorder, and we observe a partial
localization around the core and the leading edge of the wave. For an Anderson
disorder, displacement perturbations lead to localization of energy primarily
in the core, and velocity perturbations cause the energy to be divided between
the core and the leading edge. This localization phenomenon does not occur in
the sonic-vacuum regime, which yields the surprising result that the energy is
no longer contained in strongly nonlinear waves but instead is spread across
many sites. In this regime, the exponents are very similar in all cases.

the extended phase space of the charged anti-de Sitter black holes. With
different fixed parameters, the Maxwell's equal area law holds not only in the
pressure-thermodynamic volume oscillatory line, but also in the charge-electric
potential and temperature-entropy oscillatory lines. The conventional Clapeyron
equation is generalized and two extra equations are found. Moreover, we show
that the coexistence curve of the small and large charged black holes is charge
independent in the reduced parameter space for any dimension of spacetime. The
highly accurate fitting formula for the coexistence curve is also presented.
Using this fitting formula of the coexistence curve, we find that the Clapeyron
equations are highly consistent with the calculated values. The fitting formula
is also very useful for further study on the thermodynamic property of the
system varying along the coexistence curve.

into vesicles, which are subsequently fused into the tubular vesicle. Under the
chemical reaction, the bicelle-to-vesicle transition occurs at smaller sizes

enhancement of this transition is due to embedded hydrophobic particles that

team. In the National Hockey League (NHL), the market for scouting is set by
the NHLs Central Scouting Service which develops a ranking of draft eligible
players. In addition to the Central Scouting rankings, NHL teams use their own
internal scouting to augment their knowledge of eligible players and develop
their own rankings. Using a novel statistical approach we show in this paper
that the additional information possessed by teams provides better rankings
than those of Central Scouting. Using data from the 1998 to 2002 NHL drafts, we
estimate that the average yearly gain per team from their internal scouting is
between \$1.8MM and \$5.2MM. These values are consistent across the three
measures of player productivity that we consider: cumulative Games Played,
cumulative Time On Ice and cumulative Goals Versus Threshold where we have
aggregated these metrics across the first seven years post draft. We used this
time frame since teams generally retain rights to their draft picks for seven
years. Further, we find that no individual team outperformed the others in
terms of draft performance. One byproduct of our analysis is the development of
a Draft Value Pick Chart to assess the worth of an individual selection.

the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the original Loss-DiVincenzo proposal

gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a
switchable exchange interaction that is employed in the two-qubit CZ gate. The
speed of the two-qubit CZ operations is controlled electrically via the
detuning energy and we find that over 100 two-qubit gates can be performed
within a two-qubit coherence time of 8 \textmu s, thereby satisfying the

the adoption of this elegant and convenient solution to Einstein's equations
does not tell us much about the equation of state, p=w rho, in terms of the
total energy density rho and pressure p of the cosmic fluid. LCDM and the
R_h=ct Universe are both FRW cosmologies that partition rho into (at least)
three components, matter rho_m, radiation rho_r, and a poorly understood dark
energy rho_de, though the latter goes one step further by also invoking the
constraint w=-1/3. This condition is required by the simultaneous application
of the Cosmological principle and Weyl's postulate. Model selection tools in
one-on-one comparisons favor R_h=ct with a likelihood of ~90% versus only ~10%
for LCDM. Nonetheless, the predictions of LCDM often come quite close to those
of R_h=ct, suggesting that its parameters are optimized to mimic the w=-1/3
equation of state. In this paper, we demonstrate that the equation of state in
R_h=ct helps us to understand why the optimized fraction Omega_m=rho_m/rho in
LCDM must be ~0.27, an otherwise seemingly random variable. We show that when
one forces LCDM to satisfy the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho, the
value of the Hubble radius today, c/H_0, can equal its measured value ct_0 only
with Omega_m~0.27 when the equation of state for dark energy is w_de=-1. This
peculiar value of Omega_m therefore appears to be a direct consequence of
trying to fit the data with the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho in a
Universe whose principal constraint is instead R_h=ct or, equivalently, w=-1/3.

to transform from SGS to half-metallic phase under pressure, which is
attributed to unique electronic-structure features. The saturation

Curie temperature (TC) is found to exceed 400 K. Carrier concentration (up to
250 K) and electrical conductivity are observed to be nearly temperature

to be 185 S/cm at 5 K. Considering the SGS properties and high TC, this

the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population etiology

methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to PERCH data. The

safety and the shelf life of perishable foods. Growth is affected by several
environmental factors such as temperature, acidity level and salt
concentration. In this study, we develop two models to describe bacterial
growth for multiple populations under both equal and different environmental
conditions. First, a semi-parametric model based on the Gompertz equation is
proposed. Assuming that the parameters of the Gompertz equation may vary in
relation to the running conditions under which the experiment is performed, we
use feedforward neural networks to model the influence of these environmental
factors on the growth parameters. Second, we propose a more general model which
does not assume any underlying parametric form for the growth function. Thus,
we consider a neural network as a primary growth model which includes the
influencing environmental factors as inputs to the network. One of the main
disadvantages of neural networks models is that they are often very difficult
to tune, which complicates fitting procedures. Here, we show that a simple
Bayesian approach to fitting these models can be implemented via the software
package WinBugs. Our approach is illustrated using real experimental Listeria

appropriate power allocations to guarantee system performance. What's more, how
to evaluate the performance limits in this new scenario is also needed to
consider. To this end, this paper investigates the performance limits of
wireless communication in HSRs scenario. Since the hybrid information
transmitted between train and base station usually has diverse quality of
service (QoS) requirements, QoS-based achievable rate region is utilized to
characterize the transmission performance in this paper. It is proved that
traditional ergodic capacity and outage capacity with unique QoS requirement
can be regarded as two extreme cases of the achievable rate region proposed in
this paper. The corresponding optimal power allocation strategy is also given
to achieve the maximal boundary of achievable rate region. Compared with
conventional strategies, the advantages of the proposed strategy are validated
in terms of green communication, namely minimizing average transmit power.
Besides, the hybrid information transmission in a non-uniform generalized
motion scenario is analyzed to confirm the robust performance of proposed
strategy. The performance loss caused by non-uniform motion compared with that
in uniform motion is also indicated, where a deterministic worst case for
instantaneous speed realization is proposed to serve as the lower bound for
system performance.

B2V star HD 184927 has been obtained in the context of the Magnetism in Massive
Stars (MiMeS) Large Program with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and dimaPol liquid crystal spectropolarimeter at
1.8-m telescope of Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. We model the optical and
UV spectrum obtained from the IUE archive to infer the stellar physical
parameters. Using magnetic field measurements we derive an improved rotational
period of 9.53102+-0.0007d. We infer the longitudinal magnetic field from lines
of H, He and various metals, revealing large differences between the apparent
field strength variations determined from different elements. Magnetic Doppler
Imaging using He and O lines yields strongly nonuniform surface distributions
of these elements. We demonstrate that the diversity of longitudinal field
variations can be understood as due to the combination of element-specific
surface abundance distributions in combination with a surface magnetic field
that is comprised of dipolar and quadrupolar components. We have reanalyzed IUE
high resolution spectra, confirming strong modulation of wind-sensitive Civ and
Siv resonance lines. However, we are unable to detect any modulation of the
H$\alpha$ profile attributable to a stellar magnetosphere. We conclude that HD
184927 hosts a centrifugal magnetosphere, albeit one that is undetectable at
optical wavelengths. The magnetic braking timescale of HD 184927 is computed to
be $\tau_J = 0.96$ or $5.8$ Myr. These values are consistent with the slow
rotation and estimated age of the star.

sample of galax- ies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS),
with particular focus on the relationships between the properties of the spiral
pattern in the stellar disc and the global struc- ture and environment of the
parent galaxies. Following Paper I we have used a combination of Spitzer Space
Telescope mid-infrared imaging and visible multi-colour imaging to isolate the
spiral pattern in the underlying stellar discs, and we examine the systematic
behaviours of the observed amplitudes and shapes (pitch angles) of these
spirals. In general, spiral morphology is found to correlate only weakly at
best with morphological parameters such as stellar mass, gas fraction,
disc/bulge ratio, and vflat. In contrast to weak correlations with galaxy
structure a strong link is found between the strength of the spiral arms and
tidal forcing from nearby companion galaxies. This appears to support the
longstanding suggestion that either a tidal interaction or strong bar is a
necessary condition for driving grand-design spiral structure. The pitch angles
of the stellar arms are only loosely correlated with the pitch angles of the
corresponding arms traced in gas and young stars. We find that the strength of
the shock in the gas and the contrast in the star formation rate are strongly
correlated with the stellar spiral amplitude.

services, as an approach complementary to conventional credit or reputation

the IDF scheme is max-min fair and can score close to 1 on the Jain's fairness

brain, coordinated motion of animal flocks, and stability of the power grid.
These synchronization phenomena are often modeled through networks of
phase-coupled oscillating nodes. Heterogeneity in the node dynamics, however,
may prevent such networks from achieving the required level of synchronization.
In order to guarantee synchronization, external inputs can be used to pin a
subset of nodes to a reference frequency, while the remaining nodes are steered
toward synchronization via local coupling. In this paper, we present a
submodular optimization framework for selecting a set of nodes to act as
external inputs in order to achieve synchronization from almost any initial
network state. We derive threshold-based sufficient conditions for
synchronization, and then prove that these conditions are equivalent to
connectivity of a class of augmented network graphs. Based on this connection,
we map the sufficient conditions for synchronization to constraints on
submodular functions, leading to efficient algorithms with provable optimality
bounds for selecting input nodes. We illustrate our approach via numerical
studies of synchronization in networks from power systems, wireless networks,
and neuronal networks.

relaxation is observed in a static field after ramping from the
zero-field-cooled state up to $200 - 300$ Oe. SANS measurements are employed to
track the microscopic spin reconfiguration throughout both the hysteresis loop
and the related relaxation. Comparing the SANS data to inhomogeneous mean-field
calculations performed on a box of one million unit cells provides a real-space
picture of the spin configuration. We discover that the avalanche is being
driven by released Zeeman energy, which heats the sample and creates positive
feedback, continuing the avalanche. The combination of SANS and mean-field

replaced by one with a depletion of intermediate cluster sizes for much of the

with molecular weight distribution. Pore-size distribution and overall porosity
of the synthesized films prepared with irradiated and unirradiated PEO powder

powders is found be in the range of 0.01 - 1000 micrometer. It is known that,
variation in irradiation dose either generates particles of lower dimension
through bond breakage i.e scission or higher dimension through cross-linkage.
PEO films exhibit strong dependence of irradiation effect on pore size
distribution and porosity. PEO films synthesized using both unirradiated and
irradiated powders exhibit pore dimension in the range of 20 - 500 nm. The
overall porosity of PEO films studied through BET adsorption technique
initially increases with dose upto 3 kGy followed by linear decrease upto 30
kGy. Films cast with unirradiated PEO powder show multimodal pore size
distribution, but perturbation with irradiation changes the modality to uni-or
bimodal nature. The mentioned outcome of irradiation viz. particle and pore
size variation is also correlated with PEO microstructures.The article
demonstrates that, selective irradiation is capable of tailoring the pore-size
within a definite regime thereby reducing the multimodal trait. The reported
study may be relevant towards applications such as catalysis, sensing and
filtration, where pore size distribution plays a crucial role.

discs, where the short-lived dust particles are replenished through collisions
between planetesimals. Most destructive collisions occur when the orbits of
smaller bodies are dynamically stirred up, either by the gravitational effect
of locally formed Pluto-sized planetesimals (self-stirring scenario), or via
secular perturbation caused by an inner giant planet (planetary stirring). The
relative importance of these scenarios in debris systems is unknown. Here we
present new Herschel Space Observatory imagery of 11 discs selected from the
most massive and extended known debris systems. All discs were found to be
extended at far-infrared wavelengths, five of them being resolved for the first
time. We evaluated the feasibility of the self-stirring scenario by comparing
the measured disc sizes with the predictions of the model calculated for the
ages of our targets. We concluded that the self-stirring explanation works for
seven discs. However, in four cases, the predicted pace of outward propagation
of the stirring front, assuming reasonable initial disc masses, was far too low
to explain the radial extent of the cold dust. Therefore, for HD 9672, HD
16743, HD 21997, and HD 95086, another explanation is needed. We performed a
similar analysis for {\ss} Pic and HR 8799, reaching the same conclusion. We
argue that planetary stirring is a promising possibility to explain the disk
properties in these systems. In HR 8799 and HD 95086 we may already know the
potential perturber, since their known outer giant planets could be responsible
for the stirring process. Our study demonstrates that among the largest and
most massive debris discs self-stirring may not be the only active scenario,
and potentially planetary stirring is responsible for destructive collisions
and debris dust production in a number of systems.

and ultimately, the crystal will break by forming large nonaffine defects. Even
for the initial stage of this process, only little effort has been devoted to
the understanding of the breaking process on the scale of the individual
particle size for thermalized mixed crystals. Here, we explore the
shear-induced breaking for an equimolar two-dimensional binary model crystal
with a high interaction asymmetry between the two different species such that
the initial crystal has an intersecting square sublattice of the two
constituents. Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we show that the
combination of shear and thermal fluctuations leads to a characteristic
hierarchical breaking scenario where initially, the more strongly coupled
particles are thermally distorted, paving the way for the weakly coupled
particles to escape from their cage. This in turn leads to mobile defects which
may finally merge, proliferating a cascade of defects, which triggers the final
breakage of the crystal. This scenario is in marked contrast to the breakage of
one-component crystals close to melting. Moreover, we explore the orientational
dependence of the initial shear direction relative to the crystal orientation
and compare this to the usual melting scenario without shear. Our results are
verifiable in real-space experiments of superparamagnetic colloidal mixtures at
a pending air-water interface in an external magnetic field where the shear can
be induced by an external laser field.

However, it is hindered by the availability of carbon nanotubes samples only as
bundles or isolated with surfactants. Octadecylamine functionalized carbon
nanotubes are mostly of a single diameter and can be stably dispersed in 1,
2-dichloroethane and chloroform without surfactants. Here we perform high
pressure Raman spectroscopy on these tubes and obtain their experimental G-mode
pressure coefficients for individual tubes and bundles. The G-plus pressure
coefficient for bundles is only about half of that for individual tubes in 1,
2-dichloroethane and is about two-thirds in chloroform. The G-minus pressure
coefficient for bundles is about one-third of G-plus in 1, 2-dichloroethane and
about the same in chloroform. These results for the first time provide
unambiguous experimental evidence of the significant effect of bundling on
carbon nanotubes' G-mode pressure coefficients, identifying it as one of the
major reasons for the lack of consensus on what the values should be in the
literature.

radius of curvature of the magnetic field line, the gyration radius, and the

particle by considering self-consistently the radiative losses, and provide the
radiated spectrum produced by a particle when an electric acceleration is
balanced by its radiative losses, as it is assumed to happen in the outer gaps
of pulsar's magnetospheres. We compute the average spectrum radiated throughout
the particle trajectory finding that the slope of the spectrum before the peak
depends on the location and size of the emission region. We show how this

parameterized by treewidth, a parameter that is bounded only on sparse graphs.
When parameterized by the more general parameter clique-width, Hamiltonian
Cycle becomes W[1]-hard, as shown by Fomin et al. [5]. S{\ae}ther and Telle
address this problem in their paper [13] by introducing a new parameter,
split-matching-width, which lies between treewidth and clique-width in terms of
generality. They show that even though graphs of restricted
split-matching-width might be dense, solving problems such as Hamiltonian Cycle
can be done in FPT time.
  Recently, it was shown that Hamiltonian Cycle parameterized by treewidth is
in EPT [1, 6], meaning it can be solved in $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(k)}$-time. In this
paper, using tools from [6], we show that also parameterized by
split-matching-width Hamiltonian Cycle is EPT. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first EPT algorithm for any ""globally constrained"" graph problem
parameterized by a non-trivial and non-sparse structural parameter. To
accomplish this, we also give an algorithm constructing a branch decomposition
approximating the minimum split-matching-width to within a constant factor.
Combined, these results show that the algorithms in [13] for Edge Dominating
Set, Chromatic Number and Max Cut all can be improved. We also show that for
Hamiltonian Cycle and Max Cut the resulting algorithms are asymptotically
optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

localized $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defect and the effect of the kink's internal
mode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a kink hits the defect from
the gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the kink coming from the
opposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a
principal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon
kink studied earlier, it is found that the $\phi^4$ kink approaching the defect
from the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case
it must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by
the loss region. It is found that for the kink with IM the critical velocity is
smaller, meaning that the kink bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss
region. This feature, namely the ""increased transparency"" of the defect as
regards the motion of the kink in the presence of IM is the second key finding
of the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered
recently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both
principal findings of the present work. A simpler, analytically tractable
single degree of freedom collective variable method is used to calculate
analytically the kink phase shift and the kink critical velocity sufficient to
pass through the defect. Comparison with the numerical results suggests that
the collective variable method is able to predict these parameters with a high
accuracy.

Results. X dopants in a-C:H:X materials can affect the sp3/sp2 ratio (X = Si, O
and N), lead to blue photoluminescence (undoped or X = N), induce
ferromagnetic-like behaviour (X = N and S) or simply be incorporated (depleted)

would entail a $2\sigma$ detection. We confirm quantitatively that clusters of

study Ramsey-type variants of problems related to K\""onig's lemma, such as
restrictions of K\""onig's lemma, Boolean satisfiability problems, and graph

is strictly easier than the original problem (as Flood showed with weak
K\""onig's lemma) and that sometimes the Ramsey-type variant of a problem is
equivalent to the original problem. We show that the Ramsey-type variant of
weak K\""onig's lemma is robust in the sense of Montalban: it is equivalent to
several perturbations of itself. We also clarify the relationship between
Ramsey-type weak K\""onig's lemma and algorithmic randomness by showing that
Ramsey-type weak weak K\""onig's lemma is equivalent to the problem of finding

carbon into dust shows rather wide variations and that carbon undergoes rather
rapid recycling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Small hydrocarbon grains are
processed in photo-dissociation regions by UV photons, by ion and electron
collisions in interstellar shock waves and by cosmic rays. A significant
fraction of hydrocarbon dust must therefore be re-formed by accretion in the
dense, molecular ISM. A new dust model (Jones et al., Astron. Astrophys., 2013,
558, A62) shows that variations in the dust observables in the diffuse
interstellar medium (nH = 1000 cm^3), can be explained by systematic and
environmentally-driven changes in the small hydrocarbon grain population. Here
we explore the consequences of gas-phase carbon accretion onto the surfaces of
grains in the transition regions between the diffuse ISM and molecular clouds
(e.g., Jones, Astron. Astrophys., 2013, 555, A39). We find that significant
carbonaceous dust re-processing and/or mantle accretion can occur in the outer
regions of molecular clouds and that this dust will have significantly
different optical properties from the dust in the adjacent diffuse ISM. We
conclude that the (re-)processing and cycling of carbon into and out of dust is
perhaps the key to advancing our understanding of dust evolution in the ISM.

challenging problems of small-probability estimation. The particularity of
these studies is that the small probability to estimate is formulated in terms
of the distribution of a Markov chain, instead of that of a random vector in
more classical cases. Thus, it is not straightforward to adapt classical
statistical methods, for estimating small probabilities involving random
vectors, to these neutron-transport problems. A recent interacting-particle
method for small-probability estimation, relying on the Hastings-Metropolis

Then, the practical implementation of the resulting method for

may play an important role in atmospheric heating. In the partially ionized
solar chromosphere, collisions between ions and neutrals are an efficient
dissipative mechanism for Alfven waves with frequencies near the ion-neutral
collision frequency. The collision frequency is proportional to the ion-neutral
collision cross section for momentum transfer. Here, we investigate Alfven wave
damping as a function of height in a simplified chromospheric model and compare
the results for two sets of collision cross sections, namely those of the
classic hard-sphere model and those based on recent quantum-mechanical
computations. We find important differences between the results for the two
sets of cross sections. There is a critical interval of wavelengths for which
impulsively excited Alfven waves are overdamped as a result of the strong
ion-neutral dissipation. The critical wavelengths are in the range from 1 km to
50 km for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 1 m to 1 km for the
quantum-mechanical cross sections. Equivalently, for periodically driven Alfven
waves there is an optimal frequency for which the damping is most effective.
The optimal frequency varies from 1 Hz to 10^2 Hz for the hard-sphere cross
sections, and from 10^2 Hz to 10^4 Hz for the quantum-mechanical cross
sections. Future observations at sufficiently high spatial or temporal
resolution may show the importance of high-frequency Alfven waves for
chromospheric heating. For instance, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) may be able to detect the critical wavelengths and optimal
frequencies and so to test the effective collision cross section in the
chromospheric plasma.

controllability of time-varying linear systems (or networks) in terms of input
novelty. The motivation for such an approach comes from the study of
biophysical sensory networks in the brain, wherein responsiveness to both
energy and salience (or novelty) are presumably critical for mediating behavior
and function. Here, we use an inner product to define the angular separation of
the current input with respect to the past input history. Then, by constraining
input energy, we define a non-convex optimal control problem to obtain the
minimally novel input that effects a given state transfer. We provide
analytical conditions for existence and uniqueness in continuous-time, as well
as an explicit closed-form expression for the solution. In discrete time, we
show that a relaxed convex optimization formulation provides the global optimal
solution of the original non-convex problem. Finally, we show how the minimum
novelty control can be used as a metric to study control properties of large
scale recurrent neuronal networks and other complex linear systems. In
particular, we highlight unique aspects of a system's controllability that are
captured through the novelty-based metric. The result suggests that a
multifaceted approach, combining energy-based analysis with other specific
metrics, may be useful for obtaining more complete controllability
characterizations.

this rewriting explains the previously observed association of the canonical

back to the presence of imaginary roots and to the unfaithfulness of the spinor

birthplaces of supermassive black holes. In such a halo, an initially
isothermal collapse will occur, leading to high accretion rates of
$\sim0.1$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. During the collapse, the gas in the interior
will turn into a molecular state, and form an accretion disk due to the
conservation of angular momentum. We consider here the structure of such an
accretion disk and the role of viscous heating in the presence of high
accretion rates for a central star of $10$, $100$ and $10^4$~M$_\odot$. Our
results show that the temperature in the disk increases considerably due to
viscous heating, leading to a transition from the molecular to the atomic
cooling phase. We found that the atomic cooling regime may extend out to
several $100$~AU for a $10^4$~M$_\odot$ central star and provides substantial
support to stabilize the disk. It therefore favors the formation of a massive
central object. The comparison of clump migration and contraction time scales
shows that stellar feedback from these clumps may occur during the later stages
of the evolution. Overall, viscous heating provides an important pathway to
obtain an atomic gas phase within the center of the halo, and helps in the
formation of very massive objects. The latter may collapse to form a massive
black hole of about $\geq 10^4$~M$_\odot$.

a number of hyperparameters of the data size order. To overcome this
difficulty, we design a new maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of the
hyperparameters, and solve the related optimization problem with a novel
iterative scheme based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. In presence
of outliers, tests on simulated data and on a real system show a substantial
performance improvement compared to currently used kernel-based methods for

Rosenfeld density functional in order to study the interfacial structure of
these liquids which with respect to their thermodynamic bulk state are
considered to be deep inside their liquid phase. We find that already
considerably below the packing fraction of bulk freezing of these liquids,
inside the nanopits a three-dimensional-like density localization sets in. If
the sizes of the pits are commensurate with the packing requirements, we
observe high density spots separated from each other in all spatial directions
by liquid of comparatively very low density. The number, shape, size, and
density of these high density spots depend sensitively on the depth and width
of the pits. Outside the pits, only layering is observed; above the pit
openings these layers are distorted with the distortion reaching up to a few
molecular diameters. We discuss quantitatively how this density localization is
affected by the geometrical features of the pits and how it evolves upon
increasing the bulk packing fraction. Our results are transferable to colloidal
systems and pit dimensions corresponding to several diameters of the colloidal
particles. For such systems the predicted unfolding of these structural changes
can be studied experimentally on much larger length scales and more directly

whose bulk density ranges from 1.0 g/cm3 to 2.4 g/cm3, is a rubble pile and
requires a cohesive strength of at least 44 Pa to 74 Pa to keep from failing
due to its fast spin period. Since their technique for giving failure
conditions required the averaged stress over the whole volume, it discarded
information about the asteroid's failure mode and internal stress condition.
This paper develops a finite element model and revisits the stress and failure
analysis of 1950 DA. For the modeling, we do not consider material-hardening
and softening. Under the assumption of an associated flow rule and uniform
material distribution, we identify the deformation process of 1950 DA when its
constant cohesion reaches the lowest value that keeps its current shape. The
results show that to avoid structural failure the internal core requires a
cohesive strength of at least 75 Pa - 85 Pa. It suggests that for the failure
mode of this body, the internal core first fails structurally, followed by the
surface region. This implies that if cohesion is constant over the whole
volume, the equatorial ridge of 1950 DA results from a material flow going
outward along the equatorial plane in the internal core, but not from a
landslide as has been hypothesized. This has additional implications for the
likely density of the interior of the body.

  2014",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we propose several modelling strategies to tackle evolving
data in different contexts. In the framework of static clustering, we start by
introducing a soft kernel spectral clustering (SKSC) algorithm, which can
better deal with overlapping clusters with respect to kernel spectral
clustering (KSC) and provides more interpretable outcomes. Afterwards, a whole
strategy based upon KSC for community detection of static networks is proposed,
where the extraction of a high quality training sub-graph, the choice of the
kernel function, the model selection and the applicability to large-scale data
are key aspects. This paves the way for the development of a novel clustering
algorithm for the analysis of evolving networks called kernel spectral
clustering with memory effect (MKSC), where the temporal smoothness between
clustering results in successive time steps is incorporated at the level of the
primal optimization problem, by properly modifying the KSC formulation. Later
on, an application of KSC to fault detection of an industrial machine is
presented. Here, a smart pre-processing of the data by means of a proper
windowing operation is necessary to catch the ongoing degradation process
affecting the machine. In this way, in a genuinely unsupervised manner, it is
possible to raise an early warning when necessary, in an online fashion.
Finally, we propose a new algorithm called incremental kernel spectral
clustering (IKSC) for online learning of non-stationary data. This ambitious
challenge is faced by taking advantage of the out-of-sample property of kernel
spectral clustering (KSC) to adapt the initial model, in order to tackle
merging, splitting or drifting of clusters across time. Real-world applications
considered in this thesis include image segmentation, time-series clustering,
community detection of static and evolving networks.

projectivized Clifford algebra $\mathbf{P}(\mathbb{R}^*_{n,0,1})$ (euclidean

We compare euclidean PGA and the popular 2-up model CGA (conformal geometric

this domain they exhibit the same formal feature set. We thereby establish that
euclidean PGA is the smallest structure-preserving euclidean GA. We compare the
two algebras in more detail, with respect to a number of practical criteria,
including implementation of kinematics and rigid body mechanics. We then extend
the comparison to include euclidean sphere primitives. We conclude that
euclidean PGA provides a natural transition, both scientifically and
pedagogically, between vector space models and the more complex and powerful
CGA.

has its origin in switching theory, the theory of modeling the switching
circuits from the digital electrical engineering. The attribute boolean vaguely
refers to the Boole algebra with two elements; autonomous means that there is
no input; determinism means the existence of a unique state function; and
regular indicates the existence of a function
$\Phi:\{0,1\}^{n}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{n},\Phi=(\Phi_{1},...,\Phi_{n})$ whose
coordinates iterate independently on each other. Time is discrete or
continuous.
  The flows are these that result by analogy with the dynamical systems.
  The 'nice' discrete time and real time functions that the (boolean)
asynchronous systems work with are called signals and periodicity is a very
important feature in Nature.
  In the first two Chapters we give the most important concepts concerning the
signals and periodicity. The periodicity properties are used to characterize
the eventually constant signals in Chapter 3 and the constant signals in
Chapter 4. Chapters 5,...,8 are dedicated to the eventually periodic points,
eventually periodic signals, periodic points and periodic signals. Chapter 9
shows constructions that, given an (eventually) periodic point, by changing
some values of the signal, change the periodicity properties of the point.
  The book addresses to researchers in systems theory and computer science, but
it is also interesting to those that study periodicity itself. From this last
perspective, the binary signals may be thought of as functions with finitely
many values.
