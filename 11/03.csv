articles. We attempt to answer four questions. First, how often are older
articles cited and how has this changed over time. Second, how does the impact
of older articles vary across different research fields. Third, is the change
in the impact of older articles accelerating or slowing down. Fourth, are these
trends different for much older articles.
  To answer these questions, we studied citations from articles published in
1990-2013. We computed the fraction of citations to older articles from
articles published each year as the measure of impact. We considered articles
that were published at least 10 years before the citing article as older
articles. We computed these numbers for 261 subject categories and 9 broad
areas of research. Finally, we repeated the computation for two other
definitions of older articles, 15 years and older and 20 years and older.
  There are three conclusions from our study. First, the impact of older
articles has grown substantially over 1990-2013. In 2013, 36% of citations were
to articles that are at least 10 years old; this fraction has grown 28% since
1990. The fraction of older citations increased over 1990-2013 for 7 out of 9
broad areas and 231 out of 261 subject categories. Second, the increase over
the second half (2002-2013) was double the increase in the first half
(1990-2001).
  Third, the trend of a growing impact of older articles also holds for even
older articles. In 2013, 21% of citations were to articles >= 15 years old with
an increase of 30% since 1990 and 13% of citations were to articles >= 20 years
old with an increase of 36%.
  Now that finding and reading relevant older articles is about as easy as
finding and reading recently published articles, significant advances aren't
getting lost on the shelves and are influencing work worldwide for years after.

particles where nonequilibrium processes produce large velocity gradients - are
common in many physical, chemical and biological contexts. The velocity or
stress at the edge of the boundary layer determines the exterior fluid flow
and, hence, the many-body interparticle hydrodynamic interaction. Here, we
present a method to compute the many-body hydrodynamic interaction between $N$
spherical active particles induced by their exterior microhydrodynamic flow.
First, we use a boundary integral representation of the Stokes equation to
eliminate bulk fluid degrees of freedom. Then, we expand the boundary
velocities and tractions of the integral representation in an
infinite-dimensional basis of tensorial spherical harmonics and, on enforcing
boundary conditions in a weak sense on the surface of each particle, obtain a
system of linear algebraic equations for the unknown expansion coefficients.
The truncation of the infinite series, fixed by the degree of accuracy
required, yields a finite linear system that can be solved accurately and
efficiently by iterative methods. The solution linearly relates the unknown
rigid body motion to the known values of the expansion coefficients, motivating
the introduction of propulsion matrices. These matrices completely characterize
hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions just as mobility matrices
completely characterize hydrodynamic interactions in passive suspensions. The
reduction in the dimensionality of the problem, from a three-dimensional
partial differential equation to a two-dimensional integral equation, allows
for dynamic simulations of hundreds of thousands of active particles on

maximum likelihood estimators for problems of this form, which are applicable
to a number of different observation noise or corruption models. Several
specific implications are examined, including scenarios where observations are
corrupted by additive Gaussian noise or additive heavier-tailed (Laplace)

(V1) represent a saliency map of the visual field to exogenously guide
attention. This hypothesis has so far provided only qualitative predictions and
their confirmations. We report this hypothesis' first quantitative prediction,
derived without free parameters, and its confirmation by human behavioral data.
The hypothesis provides a direct link between V1 neural responses to a visual
location and the saliency of that location to guide attention exogenously. In a
visual input containing many bars, one of them saliently different from all the
other bars which are identical to each other, saliency at the singleton's
location can be measured by the shortness of the reaction time in a visual
search task to find the singleton. The hypothesis predicts quantitatively the
whole distribution of the reaction times to find a singleton unique in color,
orientation, and motion direction from the reaction times to find other types
of singletons. The predicted distribution matches the experimentally observed
distribution in all six human observers. A requirement for this successful
prediction is a data-motivated assumption that V1 lacks neurons tuned
simultaneously to color, orientation, and motion direction of visual inputs.
Since evidence suggests that extrastriate cortices do have such neurons, we
discuss the possibility that the extrastriate cortices play no role in guiding
exogenous attention so that they can be devoted to other functional roles like
visual decoding or endogenous attention.

the BCC by modeling the uncertainty of the channel. For the compound BCC, it is
only known that the actual channel realization belongs to a pre-specified
uncertainty set of channels and that it is constant during the whole

a rate pair within the compound BCC capacity region. Therefore, the question
whether small variations of the uncertainty set lead to large losses of the

give rise to a set of sampling for multivariate bandlimited functions when the

derivatives. Along with explicit estimates of corresponding frame bounds, we
derive the explicit density bound and show that, as $k$ increases, it grows
linearly in $k+1$ with the constant of proportionality $1/\mathrm{e}$. Seeking
larger gap conditions, we also prove a multivariate perturbation result for
nonuniform samples that are sufficiently close to sets of sampling, e.g. to
uniform samples taken at $k+1$ times the Nyquist rate.
  Additionally, in the univariate setting, we consider a related problem of
so-called nonuniform bunched sampling, where in each sampling interval $s+1$
bunched measurements of a function are taken and the sampling intervals are
permitted to be of different length. We derive an explicit density condition
which grows linearly in $s+1$ for large $s$, with the constant of
proportionality depending on the width of the bunches. The width of the bunches
is allowed to be arbitrarily small, and moreover, for sufficiently narrow
bunches and sufficiently large $s$, we obtain the same result as in the case of
univariate sampling with $s$ derivatives.

curvature of one dimensional interfaces in various space-time discrete regimes.
The algorithm can be viewed as a time-splitting scheme for the Allen-Cahn
equation which is a typical model for the motion of materials phase boundaries.
Our results extend the existing statements which are applicable mostly in
semi-discrete (continuous in space and discrete in time) settings. The
motivations of this work are twofolds: to investigate the interaction between
multiple small parameters in nonlinear singularly perturbed problems, and to
understand the anisotropy in curvature for interfaces in spatially discrete
environments. In the current work, the small parameters are the the spatial and
temporal discretization step sizes $\triangle x = h$ and $\triangle t = \tau$.
We have identified the limiting description of the interfacial velocity in the
(i) sub-critical ($h \ll \tau$), (ii) critical ($h = O(\tau)$), and (iii)
super-critical ($h \gg \tau$) regimes. The first case gives the classical
isotropic motion by mean curvature, while the second produces intricate pinning
and de-pinning phenomena and anisotropy in the velocity function of the
interface. The last case produces no motion (complete pinning).

methods is to build a small sketch of the input and use it in lieu of the full
kernel matrix in the machine learning task of interest. Here, we describe a
version of this approach that comes with running time guarantees as well as
improved guarantees on its statistical performance. By extending the notion of
\emph{statistical leverage scores} to the setting of kernel ridge regression,
our main statistical result is to identify an importance sampling distribution
that reduces the size of the sketch (i.e., the required number of columns to be
sampled) to the \emph{effective dimensionality} of the problem. This quantity
is often much smaller than previous bounds that depend on the \emph{maximal
degrees of freedom}. Our main algorithmic result is to present a fast algorithm
to compute approximations to these scores. This algorithm runs in time that is
linear in the number of samples---more precisely, the running time is
$O(np^2)$, where the parameter $p$ depends only on the trace of the kernel
matrix and the regularization parameter---and it can be applied to the matrix
of feature vectors, without having to form the full kernel matrix. This is
obtained via a variant of length-squared sampling that we adapt to the kernel
setting in a way that is of independent interest. Lastly, we provide empirical
results illustrating our theory, and we discuss how this new notion of the
statistical leverage of a data point captures in a fine way the difficulty of
the original statistical learning problem.

assuming the stellar initial mass function (IMF) to be invariant and fully
sampled allowing fractions of massive stars to contribute even in dwarf
galaxies with very low star formation rates (SFRs). Recent observations show
the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) of stars, i.e. the
galaxy-wide IMF, to become systematically top-heavy with increasing SFR. This
has been predicted by the IGIMF theory, which is here used to develop the
analytical theory of the chemical evolution of galaxies. This theory is
non-linear and requires the iterative solution of implicit integral equations
due to the dependence of the IGIMF on the metallicity and on the SFR. It is
shown that the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies emerges naturally,
although at low masses the theoretical predictions overestimate the
observations by 0.3--0.4 dex. A good agreement with the observation can be
obtained only if gas flows are taken into account. In particular, we are able
to reproduce the mass--metallicity relation observed by Lee et al. (2006) with
modest amounts of infall and with an outflow rate which decreases as a function
of the galactic mass. The outflow rates required to fit the data are
considerably smaller than required in models with invariant IMFs.

due to integration over infinite interval of the function containing two

First of the methods is based on the idea suggested by D.Levin in 1982 ---
evaluation of the integral is converted to finding a particular slowly

well-known numerical instability of Levin's collocation method, an alternative
type of collocation is used; it is based on a barycentric Lagrange

corrector problem is pivotal to compute the macroscale effective coefficients
from the microscale information. To solve this corrector problem in the
periodic setting, Moulinec and Suquet introduced in the mid-nineties a
numerical strategy based on the reformulation of that problem as an integral
equation (known as the Lippmann--Schwinger equation), which is then suitably
discretized. This results in an iterative, matrix-free method, which is of
particular interest for complex microstructures. Since the seminal work of
Moulinec and Suquet, several variants of their scheme have been proposed.
  The aim of this contribution is twofold. First, we provide an overview of
these methods, recast in the language of the applied mathematics community.
These methods are presented as asymptotically consistent Galerkin
discretizations of the Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The bilinear form arising
in the weak form of this integral equation is indeed the sum of a local and a
non-local term. We show that most of the variants proposed in the literature
correspond to alternative approximations of this non-local term. Second, we
propose a mathematical analysis of the discretized problem. In particular, we
prove under mild hypotheses the convergence of these numerical schemes with
respect to the grid-size. We also provide a priori error estimates on the
solution.
  The article closes on a three-dimensional numerical application within the
framework of linear elasticity.

consumption time is short compared to the Hubble time. This accretion
presumably comes from a combination of infalling satellite debris, cold flows,
and condensation of hot halo gas at the cool disk interface, perhaps aided by a
galactic fountain. In general, the accretion will have a different specific
angular momentum than the part of the disk that receives it, even if the gas
comes from the nearby halo. Then the gas disk expands or shrinks over time.
Here we show that condensation of halo gas at a rate proportional to the star
formation rate in the fountain model will preserve an initial shape, such as an
exponential, with a shrinking scale length, leaving behind a stellar disk with
a slightly steeper profile of younger stars near the center. This process is
slow for most galaxies, producing imperceptible radial speeds, and it may be
dominated by other torques, but it could be important for Blue Compact Dwarfs,
which tend to have large, irregular gas reservoirs and steep blue profiles in

characterize the radio variability, and study the significance of correlations
between the radio and gamma-ray bands. We find that the radio variability of
many sources can be described using a simple power law power spectral density,
and that when taking into account the red-noise characteristics of the light
curves, cases with significant correlation are rare. We note that while
significant correlations are found in few individual objects, radio variations
are most often delayed with respect to the gamma-ray variations. This suggests
that the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission. Because
strong flares in most known gamma-ray-loud blazars are infrequent, longer light
curves are required to settle the issue of the strength of radio-gamma
cross-correlations and establish confidently possible delays between the two.
For this reason continuous multiwavelength monitoring over a longer time period

be reduced by using robust optimization to design the blade geometry or by

tolerances, and incorporates this framework into existing robust geometry

The single-point optimal geometry is found to depend on the manufacturing

frame of the blackbody radiation ($K$-frame). The difference between the
friction forces in the different frames is connected with the change of the

In this method, the Feshbach projection is realized with help of so-called the
extended closure relation held in the complex scaling method, and a complicated
coupled-channel problem is reduced to a simple single-channel problem which one
can treat easily. First, we confirm that the ccCSM+Feshbach method completely
reproduces results of a full coupled-channel calculation in case of two-body

Obtained binding energy of $K^-pp$ is well converged around 27 MeV, with an

photodetector operation is associated with the cascaded radiative electron
transitions from the valence band in GLs to the conduction band in the

spectral dependences of the responsivity and detectivity for the vertical
cascade interband GL- photodetectors (I-GLPDs) with different number of GLs and
doping levels at different bias voltages in a wide temperature range. We show
the possibility of an effective manipulation of the spectral characteristics by
the applied voltage. The spectral characteristics depend also on the GL doping
level that opens up the prospects of using I-GLPDs in the multi-color systems.
The advantages of I-GLPDs under consideration are associated with their
sensitivity to the normal incident radiation, weak temperature dependence of
the dark current as well as high speed of operation. The comparison of the
proposed I-GLDs with the quantum-well intersubband photodectors demonstrates
the superiority of the former, including a better detectivity at room

  We have implemented intraprocedural lazy basic block versioning in a
JavaScript JIT compiler. This approach is compared with a classical flow-based
type analysis. Lazy basic block versioning performs as well or better on all
benchmarks. On average, 71% of type tests are eliminated, yielding speedups of
up to 50%. We also show that our implementation generates more efficient
machine code than TraceMonkey, a tracing JIT compiler for JavaScript, on
several benchmarks. The combination of implementation simplicity, low
algorithmic complexity and good run time performance makes basic block
versioning attractive for baseline JIT compilers.

radio AGN (S_1.4 GHz > 50 mJy) observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT). HI absorption is detected in 32 galaxies, showing a broad
variety of widths, shapes and kinematical properties. We characterize the HI
spectra of the individual detections using the busy function (Westmeier et al.
2014).
  With the goal of identifying different morphological structures of HI, we
study the kinematical and radio source properties of the detections as function
of their width. Narrow lines (FWHM < 100 km/s) mostly lie at the systemic
velocity and are likely produced by regularly rotating HI disks or clouds. More
HI disks can be present among galaxies with lines of intermediate widths (100
km/s < FWHM < 200 km/s), however the HI in these sources is more unsettled.
  We study the asymmetry parameter and blueshift/redshift distribution of the
lines. We argue that if a profile is broad, it is also asymmetric and shifted
relative to the systemic velocity because it is tracing unsettled HI gas.
Besides three of the broadest (up to FW20 = 825 km/s) detections, which are
associated with gas-rich mergers, we find three new cases of blueshifted broad
wings (with FW20 >= 500 km/s). These detections are good candidates for being
HI outflows. The detection rate of HI outflows is 5 percent in the total radio
AGN sample. This fraction represents a lower limit, however it could suggests
that, if outflows are a characteristic phenomenon of all radio sources, they
would have a short depletion timescale compared to the lifetime of the AGN.
  Blueshifted and broad/asymmetric lines are more often present among young,
compact sources, suggesting that in these AGN the HI is likely to be unsettled.
This may arise due to jet-cloud interactions, as young radio sources clear
their way through the rich ambient gaseous medium.

distinct modes of instability, which we label Mode 1 and Mode 2. Mode 1 is
closely related to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability modified by vegetation drag,
whereas Mode 2 is unrelated to Kelvin-Helmholtz and arises from an interaction
between the flow in the vegetated and unvegetated layers. The vegetation
damping, according to our model, leads to a finite threshold flow for both
these modes. Experimental observations for the onset and frequency of waving
compare well with model predictions for the instability onset criteria and the
imaginary part of the complex growth rate respectively, but experiments lie in
a parameter regime where the two modes can not be distinguished. % The
inclusion of vegetation drag differentiates our mechanism from the previous

inter-satellite antennas when snapshot switches, we can reassign the ISLs and
add available ISLs for a better following snapshot. Results show that our

renormalized Polyakov loop in the deconfined phase. These terms are previously
found to appear naturally for ${\mathcal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills~(SYM) on a
sphere at strong coupling, through the gauge/gravity duality. Here we extend
the investigation to the weak coupling regime, and for general large-$N$ gauge
theories. Employing the matrix model description, we find some novel behavior
in the deconfined phase, which is not noticed in the literature. Due to the
non-uniform eigenvalue distribution of the holonomy around the time circle, the
deviation of the Polyakov loop from one starts from $1/T^3$ instead of $1/T^2$.
Such a power is fixed by the space dimension and do not change with different
theories. This statement is also true when perturbative corrections to the
single-particle partition functions are included. The corrections to the
Polyakov loop and higher moments of the distribution function combine to give a
universal term, $T/4$, in the free energy. These differences between the weak
and strong coupling regime could be easily explained if a strong/weak coupling
phase transition occurs in the deconfined phase of large-$N$ gauge theories on
a compact manifold.

the radiation pressure of a forming star can halt spherical infall, preventing
its further growth when it reaches 10 M$_{\odot}$. Two major theoretical models
on the further growth of stellar mass were proposed. One model suggests the
mergence of less massive stellar objects, and the other is still through
accretion but with the help of disk. Inflow motions are the key evidence of how
forming stars further gain mass to build up massive stars. Recent development
in technology has boosted the search of inflow motion. A number of high-mass
collapse candidates were obtained with single dish observations, mostly showed
blue profile. The infalling signatures seem to be more common in regions with
developed radiation pressure than in younger cores, which opposes the
theoretical prediction and is also very different from that of low mass star
formation. Interferometer studies so far confirm such tendency with more
obvious blue profile or inverse P Cygni profile. Results seem to favor the
accretion model. However, the evolution tendency of the infall motion in
massive star forming cores needs to be further explored. Direct evidence for
monolithic or competitive collapse processes is still lack. ALMA will enable us
to probe more detail of gravity process.

first principles investigation on the structural and electronic properties of
twisted silicon nanowires, in their pristine and hydrogenated forms. The
results indicated that wires with pentagonal and hexagonal cross sections are
the thinnest stable silicon nanostructures. Additionally, all wires followed a
Hooke's law behavior for small twisting deformations. Hydrogenation leads to
spontaneous twisting, but with angular spring constants considerably smaller
than the ones for the respective pristine forms. We observed considerable
changes on the nanowire electronic properties upon twisting, which allows to
envision the possibility of correlating the torsional angular deformation with
the nanowire electronic transport. This could ultimately allow a direct access
to measurements on interatomic forces at molecular level.

outcome is possible. In this study, we allowed a WD with a near Chandrasekhar
mass of $1.4M_\odot$ to evolve over tens of thousands of nova cycles,
accumulating mass secularly while undergoing periodic nova eruptions. We
present the mass accretion limits within which a SNIa can possibly occur. The
results showed, for each parameter combination within the permitted limits,
tens of thousands of virtually identical nova cycles where the accreted mass
exceeded the ejected mass, i.e. the WD grew slowly but steadily in mass.
Finally, the WD became unstable, the maximal temperature rose by nearly two
orders of magnitude, heavy element production was enhanced by orders of
magnitude and the nuclear and neutrino luminosities became enormous. We also
found that this mechanism leading to WD collapse is robust, with WDs in the
range $1.0 - 1.38M_\odot$, and an accretion rate of $5*10^{-7}M_\odot/yr$, all
growing steadily in mass. These simulations of the onset of a SNIa event make
observationally testable predictions about the light curves of pre-SN stars,

cut of an ideal triangulation of an unpunctured marked Riemann surface with
boundary. A cut can be regarded as a grading on the Jacobian algebra of the
quiver with potential (Q,W) associated with the triangulation.
  Fixing a set $\epsilon$ of generators of the fundamental group of the

$w^\epsilon(d)$ up to homeomorphism of the surface. Surface algebras are gentle
and of global dimension $\leq 2$, and any surface algebras coming from the same
surface $(S,M)$ are cluster equivalent, in the sense of Amiot and Oppermann. To
prove that the weight is a derived invariant we strongly use Amiot Oppermann's

network algorithms that produce an approximation to the ground state of a local
Hamiltonian by simulating an evolution in imaginary time. Specifically, we
consider the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm applied to
infinite systems in 1D and 2D, where the ground state is encoded, respectively,
in a matrix product state (MPS) and in a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS).
An important ingredient of the TEBD algorithm (and a main computational
bottleneck, especially with PEPS in 2D) is the computation of the so-called
environment, which is used to determine how to optimally truncate the bond
indices of the tensor network so that their dimension is kept constant. In
current algorithms, the environment is computed at each step of the imaginary
time evolution, to account for the changes that the time evolution introduces
in the many-body state represented by the tensor network. Our key insight is
that close to convergence, most of the changes in the environment are due to a
change in the choice of gauge in the bond indices of the tensor network, and
not in the many-body state. Indeed, a consistent choice of gauge in the bond
indices confirms that the environment is essentially the same over many time
steps and can thus be re-used, leading to very substantial computational
savings. We demonstrate the resulting approach in 1D and 2D by computing the
ground state of the quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic field.

imagery. This method preserves the geometrical structure of data while
representing it in low dimensional space. Adaptive regularization parameter
based on temperature schedule in simulated annealing method also has been used
in this paper for the sparseness term. Proposed algorithm is applied on
synthetic and real datasets. Synthetic data is generated based on endmembers
from USGS spectral library. AVIRIS Cuprite dataset is used as real dataset for
evaluation of proposed method. Results are quantified based on spectral angle
distance (SAD) and abundance angle distance (AAD) measures. Results in
comparison with other methods show that the proposed method can unmix data more
effectively. Specifically for the Cuprite dataset, performance of the proposed
method is approximately 10% better than the VCA and Sparse NMF in terms of root
mean square of SAD.

some non-degeneracy condition on the interaction potentials, we show that the

rate at which the energy of the middle rotor decreases. As it is not directly
connected to the heat baths, its energy can only be dissipated through the two
outer rotors. But when the middle rotor spins very rapidly, it fails to
interact effectively with its neighbors due to the rapid oscillations of the

and multilevel constellations. Coherent optical communication systems result in
a four-dimensional (4D) signal space, which naturally leads to 4D-CM
transceivers. A practically attractive design paradigm is to use a bit-wise
decoder, where the detection process is (suboptimally) separated into two
steps: soft-decision demapping followed by binary decoding. In this paper,
bit-wise decoders are studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint. 4D
constellations with up to 4096 constellation points are considered. Metrics to

The mutual information is shown to fail at predicting the post-FEC BER of
bit-wise decoders and the so-called generalized mutual information is shown to
be a much more robust metric. For the suboptimal scheme under consideration, it
is also shown that constellations that transmit and receive information in each
polarization and quadrature independently (e.g., PM-QPSK, PM-16QAM, and
PM-64QAM) outperform the best 4D constellations designed for uncoded
transmission. Theoretical gains are as high as 4 dB, which are then validated
via numerical simulations of low-density parity check codes.

components, under the basis of observed industrial feedback data. Usually,
lifetime is modelled as a continuous random variable, for instance
exponentially or Weibull distributed. However, in some cases, the features of
the piece of equipment under investigation rather suggest the use of discrete
probabilistic models. This happens for an equipment which only operates on
cycles or on demand. In these cases, the lifetime is rather measured in number
of cycles or number of demands before failure, therefore, in theory, discrete
models should be more appropriate. This article aims at bringing some light to
the practical interest for the reliability engineer in using two discrete
models among the most popular: the Inverse Polya distribution (IPD), based on a
Polya urn scheme, and the so-called Weibull-1 (W1) model. It is showed that,
for different reasons, the practical use of both models should be restricted to
specific industrial situations. In particular, when nothing is a priori known
over the nature of ageing and/or data are heavily right-censored, they can
remain of limited interest with respect to more flexible continuous lifetime
models such as the usual Weibull distribution. Nonetheless, the intuitive
meaning given to the IPD distribution favors its use by engineers in low
(decelerated) ageing situations.

models focused on the quantum percolation threshold, i.e., the analogue to the

are actually present. Thus, models in the delocalized regime may still be
substantially disordered, hence analyzing their transport properties is a
nontrivial task which we pursue in the paper at hand. Using a method based on
quantum typicality to numerically perform linear response theory we find that
conductivity and mean free paths are in good accord with results from very
simple heuristic considerations. Furthermore we find that depending on the
percentage of actually present hopping terms, the transport properties may or
may not be described by a Drude model. An investigation of the Einstein

from inner shell is expected to be negligible in the low collision energy

by one order of magnitude the emission of Auger electrons by the scattered

field theory, for the study of integrable defects in 1+1 classical field
theory. The main idea is the coexistence of two Poisson brackets, one for each
spacetime coordinate. The Poisson bracket corresponding to the time coordinate
is the usual one describing the time evolution of the system. Taking the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation as an example, we introduce the new
bracket associated to the space coordinate. We show that, in the absence of any
defect, the two brackets yield completely equivalent Hamiltonian descriptions
of the model. However, in the presence of a defect described by a frozen
B\""acklund transformation, the advantage of using the new bracket becomes
evident. It allows us to reinterpret the defect conditions as canonical
transformations. As a consequence, we are also able to implement the method of
the classical r matrix and to prove Liouville integrability of the system with
such a defect. The use of the new Poisson bracket completely bypasses all the
known problems associated with the presence of a defect in the discussion of
Liouville integrability. A by-product of the approach is the reinterpretation
of the defect Lagrangian used in the Lagrangian description of integrable
defects as the generating function of the canonical transformation representing
the defect conditions.

the crystal structure transforms to a structure incommensurately modulated

correlated state can be reliably distributed through a noisy channel for
quantum information processing. The concept of quantum steering recently
defined in a rigorous manner is relevant to study it under certain
circumstances and we here address quantum steerability of Gaussian states to
this aim. In particular, we attempt to reformulate the criterion for Gaussian
steering in terms of local and global purities and show that it is sufficient
and necessary for the case of steering a 1-mode system by a $N$-mode system. It
subsequently enables us to reinforce a strong monogamy relation under which
only one party can steer a local system of 1-mode. Moreover, we show that only
a negative partial-transpose state can manifest quantum steerability by
Gaussian measurements in relation to the Peres conjecture. We also discuss our
formulation for the case of distributing a two-mode squeezed state via one-way
quantum channels making dissipation and amplification effects, respectively.
Finally, we extend our approach to include non-Gaussian measurements, more
precisely, all orders of higher-order squeezing measurements, and find that
this broad set of non-Gaussian measurements is not useful to demonstrate
steering for Gaussian states beyond Gaussian measurements.

an active learning approach that converges more quickly (in wall-clock time)
than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) benchmarks. The central challenge in
probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of
models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal
likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical
integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample
inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques
offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been
hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for
probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative,
permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations.
Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative
to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and
real-world examples.

with the active participation of a creative agent, but not entirely within that
agent's control. While a system cannot be made to perform serendipitously on
demand, we argue that its $\mathit{serendipity\ potential}$ can be increased by
means of a suitable system architecture and other design choices. We distil a
unified description of serendipitous occurrences from historical theorisations
of serendipity and creativity. This takes the form of a framework with six
phases: $\mathit{perception}$, $\mathit{attention}$, $\mathit{interest}$,
$\mathit{explanation}$, $\mathit{bridge}$, and $\mathit{valuation}$. We then
use this framework to organise a survey of literature in cognitive science,
philosophy, and computing, which yields practical definitions of the six
phases, along with heuristics for implementation. We use the resulting model to
evaluate the serendipity potential of four existing systems developed by
others, and two systems previously developed by two of the authors. Most
existing research that considers serendipity in a computing context deals with
serendipity as a service; here we relate theories of serendipity to the
development of autonomous systems and computational creativity practice. We
argue that serendipity is not teleologically blind, and outline representative
directions for future applications of our model. We conclude that it is
feasible to equip computational systems with the potential for serendipity, and
that this could be beneficial in varied computational creativity/AI
applications, particularly those designed to operate responsively in real-world
contexts.

variance test for the EPR paradox, and admits a computable and experimentally
friendly lower bound only depending on the second moments of the state, which
reduces to a recently proposed quantifier of steerability by Gaussian
measurements. We further show that Gaussian states are extremal with respect to
our measure, minimizing it among all continuous variable states with fixed
second moments. As a byproduct of our analysis, we generalize and relate
well-known EPR-steering criteria. Finally an operational interpretation is
provided, as the proposed measure is shown to quantify the optimal guaranteed

the MMSE plus a covariance induced due to the interference, quantified by a

the channels and the precoding matrices. We also derive new relations for the

a fixed-point equation as a function of the channel and the input constellation

functionals with some form of bar recursion, which realizes the negative
translation of either countable or countable dependent choice. In this work we
present the many variants of bar recursion used in this context as
instantiations of a general, parametrised recursor, and give a uniform proof
that under certain conditions this recursor realizes a corresponding family of
parametrised dependent choice principles. From this proof, the soundness of
most of the existing bar recursive realizability interpretations of choice,
including those based on the Berardi-Bezem-Coquand functional, modified
realizability and the more recent products of selection functions of Escard\'o
and Oliva, follows as a simple corollary. We achieve not only a uniform
framework in which familiar realizability interpretations of choice can be
compared, but show that these represent just simple instances of a large family
of potential interpretations of dependent choice principles.

finite temperature is the dominant decay mechanism near the critical scattering

whose properties determine the corresponding decay rate or lifetime of the

the transition state of condensates with short-range scattering interaction as
well as with anisotropic and long-range dipolar interaction in a variational

different modes, and the structure of the reaction channel to any desired
order. We discuss the physical interpretation of the transition state as a
certain density distribution of the atomic cloud and the behavior of the single
normal form contributions in dependence on the s-wave scattering length.
Moreover, we investigate the convergence of the local normal form when using
extended Gaussian variational approaches, and present the condensate's decay

with empirical improvement of accuracy in the skewonless case, we explore the

the Type I skewon part is constrained to < a few x 10^(-35) in the weak
field/weak EEP violation limit. Type II skewon part is not constrained in the
first order. However, in the second order it induces birefringence; the
nonbirefringence observations constrain the Type II skewon part to 10^(-19).
Nevertheless, an additional nonmetric induced second-order contribution to the
principal part constitutive tensor compensates the Type II skewon birefringence
and makes it nonbirefringent. This second-order contribution is just the extra
piece to the core-metric principal constitutive tensor induced by the
antisymmetric tensor. From the Tamm-Rubilar tensor density and the dispersion
relation for the spacetime medium with the asymmetric-metric-induced
constitutive tensor, we know that it is nonbirefringent. The antisymmetric
metric induced constitutive tensor has a pseudoscalar part in the
decomposition. The variation of his part is constrained by observation on
cosmic polarization rotation to < 0.03, and gives one constraint on the
6-degree-of-freedom antisymmetric metric. Further studies of these 6 degrees of
freedom experimental and theoretically are desired.

employ the light cone sum rule (LCSR) with a chiral current correlator to
estimate, at twist-2 next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy, their shapes in
small and intermediate kinematical region. Then a simultaneous fit to a
Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) parametrization is performed of the sum rule
predictions and the corresponding lattice QCD (LQCD) results available at some
high $q^2$'s. The same approach is applied for the tensor form factor, except
that at large $q^2$ we use as input the LQCD data on the corresponding $B\to K$
form factor in combination with a $SU_F(3)$ symmetry breaking ansatz. Employing
the fitted BCL parameterizations, we evaluate, as an illustrative example,
several of the observables of the charged decay modes
$B^-\to\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$, including the dilepton invariant mass distribution
and branching ratio. For the dielectron and dimuon modes, the branching ratios
are estimated at
$\mathcal{B}(B^-\to\pi^-e^+e^-)=(2.263^{+0.227}_{-0.192})\times10^{-8}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(B^-\to\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-)=(2.259^{+0.226}_{-0.191}) \times10^{-8}$.
The latter shows an excellent agreement with the recent experimental

from possible new physics. We arrive at, for the ditau mode,
$\mathcal{B}(B^-\to\pi^-\tau^+\tau^-)=(1.017^{+0.118}_{-0.139})\times10^{-8}$,

occurs between the Majorana bound states at the ends of each wire, the normal

The results reveal that the dynamics of entanglement is a symmetry function

is superior to the antiferromagnetic case for restrain decoherence when using

  thesis, University of Virginia, 2013",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing complex software systems is costly, time-consuming and
error-prone. Model- driven development (MDD) promises to improve software
productivity, timeliness, quality and cost through the transformation of
abstract application models to code-level implementations. However, it remains
unreasonably difficult to build the modeling languages and translators required
for software synthesis. This difficulty, in turns, limits the applicability of
MDD, and makes it hard to achieve reliability in MDD tools. This dissertation
research seeks to reduce the cost, broaden the applicability, and increase the
quality of model-driven development systems by embedding modeling languages
within established formal languages and by using the analyzers provided with
such languages for synthesis purposes to reduce the need for hand coding of
translators. This dissertation, in particular, explores the proposed approach
using relational logic as expressed in Alloy as the general specification
language, and the Alloy Analyzer as the general-purpose analyzer. Synthesis is
thus driven by finite-domain constraint satisfaction. One important aspect of
this work is its focus on partial specifications of particular aspects of the
system, such as application architectures and target platforms, and synthesis
of partial code bases from such specifications. Contributions of this work
include novel insights, methods and tools for (1) synthesizing architectural
models from abstract application models; (2) synthesizing partial,
platform-specific application frameworks from application architectures; and
(3) synthesizing object-relational mapping tradeoff spaces and database schemas
for database-backed object-oriented applications.

which may be relevant to different states of activity inferred from long-term
radiocarbon data. This paper is aimed to probe the dynamo hysteresis predicted
by the recent mean-field models of Kitchatinov \& Olemskoy (2010) with direct
numerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional simulations of large-scale
dynamos in a shearing box with helically forced turbulence. As initial
condition, we either take a weak random magnetic field or we start from a
snapshot of an earlier simulation. Two quasi-stable states are found to coexist
in a certain range of parameters close to the onset of the large-scale dynamo.
The simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial
conditions. When either the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number
is increased between successive runs above the critical value for onset of the
dynamo, the field strength jumps to a finite value. However, when the
fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreased again, the
field strength stays at a similar value (strong field branch) even below the
original onset. We also observe intermittent decaying phases away from the
strong field branch close to the point where large-scale dynamo action is just
possible. The dynamo hysteresis seen previously in mean-field models is thus
reproduced by 3D simulations. Its possible relation to distinct modes of solar
activity such as grand minima is discussed.

genomic compaction and regulation, which remains largely unkown despite a
growing structural knowledge of the complex. Here, we propose a framework for
the extraction of a nanoscale histone-DNA force-field from a collection of
high-resolution structures, which may be adapted to a larger class of
protein-DNA complexes. We apply the procedure on a large crystallographic
database extended by snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations. The
comparison of the structural models first shows that, at the sites of
histone-DNA contact, the DNA base-pairs are locally shifted outwards,
consistent with locally repulsive forces exerted by the histones. In a second
step, we show that the various force profiles of the analyzed structures derive
locally from a unique, sequence-independent, quadratic repulsive force field,
while the sequence preferences are entirely due to the internal DNA mechanics.
We thus obtain the first knowledge-derived nanoscale potential for the
histone-DNA interaction in the nucleosome. The conformations obtained by
relaxation of nucleosomal DNA with high-affinity sequences in this potential
accurately reproduce experimental values of binding preferences. We finally
address the more generic binding mechanisms relevant to the 80% genomic
sequences incorporated in nucleosomes, by computing the conformation of
nucleosomal DNA with sequence-averaged properties. This conformation is found
to differ from those found in crystals, and the analysis suggests that
repulsive histone forces are related to a local stretch tension in nucleosomal
DNA, mostly between successive contact points. This tension could play a role
in the stability of the complex.

characteristics of the survey. The data reduction is also intended to improve
the standard source detection on individual observations, by cataloguing faint
sources by stacking their exposure images. We reprocessed the XMM-OM data of
the survey and stacked the exposures from consecutive observations using the
standard SAS tools to process the data obtained during single observations.
Average measurements of detections with SAS good quality flags from individual

Sources were validated through the cross-identification within the EIS and
COMBO-17 surveys. Photometric data of 1129 CDFS sources are provided in the

other surveys are also included. The stacking extends the detection limits by
~1 mag in the three UV bands, contributing 30% of the catalogued UV sources.

broad ensemble of twisted conformations. We obtain, for two short sequences, a
free energy landscape with multiple wells corresponding to the most convenient

circular structures in which the base pair fluctuations move the system from
one well to the next thus causing the local unwinding of the helix. The latter
is more pronounced in the shorter sequence whose cyclization causes a higher
bending stress. The entropic reductions associated to the formation of the
ordered helicoidal structure are estimated.

with sizable quantum yield even upon pumping the first exciton, S11. The decay
of the photogenerated charge-carrier population is well described by a model
for geminate recombination in 1D, suggesting an initial charge carrier
separation of the same order of the exciton correlation length.

projected space densities of quasars to measure the bias and halo masses of a
quasar sample split into obscured and unobscured populations, the first
application of this method to distinct quasar subclasses. Several recent
studies of the angular clustering of obscured quasars have shown that these
objects likely reside in higher-mass halos compared to their unobscured
counterparts. This has important implications for models of the structure and
geometry of quasars, their role in growing supermassive black holes, and mutual
quasar/host galaxy evolution. However, the magnitude and significance of this
difference has varied from study to study. Using data from \planck, \wise, and
SDSS, we follow up on these results using the independent method of CMB lensing
cross-correlations. The region and sample are identical to that used for recent
angular clustering measurements, allowing for a direct comparison of the
CMB-lensing and angular clustering methods. At $z \sim 1$, we find that the
bias of obscured quasars is $b_q = 2.57 \pm 0.24$, while that of unobscured
quasars is $b_q = 1.89 \pm 0.19$. This corresponds to halo masses of $\log (M_h

M_{\odot} h^{-1}) = 12.71_{-0.13}^{+0.15}$ (unobscured). These results agree
well with with those from angular clustering (well within $1\sigma$), and
confirm that obscured quasars reside in host halos $\sim$3 times as massive as
halos hosting unobscured quasars. This implies that quasars spend a significant
portion of their lifetime in an obscured state, possibly more than one half of

mechanisms that drive the evolution of star-planet and planet-moon systems.
Tidal dissipation in planets is intrinsically related to their internal
structure. In particular, fluid and solid layers behave differently under tidal
forcing. Therefore, their respective dissipation reservoirs have to be
compared. In this work, we compute separately the contributions of the
potential dense rocky/icy core and of the convective fluid envelope of gaseous
giant planets, as a function of core size and mass. We demonstrate that in
general both mechanisms must be taken into account.

Hamiltonian systems by means of an extended phase space. A suitably defined new
Hamiltonian on the extended phase space leads to equations of motion that can
be numerically integrated by standard symplectic leapfrog (splitting) methods.
When the leapfrog is combined with coordinate mixing transformations, the
resulting algorithm shows good long term stability and error behaviour. We
extend the method to non-Hamiltonian problems as well, and investigate optimal
methods of projecting the extended phase space back to original dimension.
Finally, we apply the methods to a Hamiltonian problem of geodesics in a curved
space, and a non-Hamiltonian problem of a forced non-linear oscillator. We
compare the performance of the methods to a general purpose differential
equation solver LSODE, and the implicit midpoint method, a symplectic one-step
method. We find the extended phase space methods to compare favorably to both
for the Hamiltonian problem, and to the implicit midpoint method in the case of
the non-linear oscillator.

the context of string theory. It is a map between a quantum field theory and a
string theory living in one or more extra dimensions. Holography provides new
tools to study strongly-coupled quantum field theories. It has important
applications in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and condensed matter (CM) systems,
which are usually complicated and strongly coupled. Quantum critical CM
theories have scaling symmetries and can be connected to higher-dimensional
scale invariant space-times. The Effective Holographic Theory paradigm may be
used to describe the low-energy (IR) holographic dynamics of quantum critical
systems by the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. We find the magnetic
critical scaling solutions of an EMD theory containing an extra parity-odd term
$F\wedge F$. Previous studies in the absence of magnetic fields have shown the
existence of quantum critical lines separated by quantum critical points. We
find this is also true in the presence of a magnetic field. The critical
solutions are characterized by the triplet of critical exponents
($\theta,z,\zeta$), the first two describing the geometry, while the latter
describes the charge density.

Furthermore, it dives into the theories of Income Determination, garnishing it
with areas of diversities in the use of Accounting Information while review of
theories of recent growths and developments in Accounting are not left out. The
method of research adopted is exploratory review of existing accounting
literature. It is observed that the emergence of these theories exist to
minimize fraud, errors, misappropriations and pilfering of Corporate assets. It
is recommended that implementation prescriptions of these theories by
International Financial Reporting Standard Committee and Practicing Accountants
should be adhered to and simplified so as to avoid confusing and scandalous

with definite momentum $\vec{p} \neq 0$. The amplitude of the survival
probability of these particles is calculated using its integral representation.
We found decay curves of such particles for the quantum mechanical models
considered. These model studies show that late time deviations of the survival
probability of these particles from the exponential form of the decay law, that
is the transition times region between exponential and non-expo\-nen\-tial form
of the survival probability, should occur much earlier than it follows from the
classical standard approach resolving itself into replacing time $t$ by
$t/\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor) in the formula
for the survival probability and that the survival probabilities should tend to
zero as $t\rightarrow \infty$ much slower than one would expect using classical
time dilation relation. Here we show also that for some physically admissible
models of unstable states the computed decay curves of the moving particles
have fluctuating form at relatively short times including times of order of the
lifetime.
