reduction of the centrifugal force makes it contract. This perturbs each fluid
element, raising the local pressure and originating deviations from beta
equilibrium, inducing reactions that release heat (rotochemical heating). This
effect has previously been studied by Fern\'andez & Reisenegger (2005) for
non-superfluid neutron stars and by Petrovich & Reisenegger (2010) for
superfluid millisecond pulsars. Both studies found that pulsars reach a
quasi-steady state in which the compression driving the matter out of beta
equilibrium is balanced by the reactions trying to restore the equilibrium. We
extend previous studies by considering the effect of density-dependence and
anisotropy of the superfluid energy gaps, for the case in which the dominant
reactions are the modified Urca processes, the protons are non-superconducting,
and the neutron superfluidity is parametrized by models proposed in the
literature. By comparing our predictions with the surface temperature of the
millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 and upper limits for twenty-one classical
pulsars, we find the millisecond pulsar can be only explained by the models
with the effectively largest energy gaps (type B models), the classical pulsars
require with the gap models that vanish for some angle (type C) and two
different envelope compositions. Thus, no single model for neutron
superfluidity can simultaneously account for the thermal emission of all
available observations of non-accreting neutron stars, possibly due to our
neglect of proton superconductivity.

which was established in earlier papers. The action of the first-order linear
low-pass filter corresponds to an operation in the complex plane that we refer
to as ""singularity splitting"", in which any given singularity of an inner

that same circle, thus leading to corresponding DP Fourier series with better

defined within the unit disk of the complex plane, in terms of the first-order
one. The construction of infinite-order filters, which always result in
$C^{\infty}$ real functions over the unit circle, and in corresponding DP
Fourier series which are absolutely and uniformly convergent to these

unobserved individual specific heterogeneity in a high dimensional setting. The
setting allows the number of time varying regressors to be larger than the
sample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require
that the overall contribution of the time varying variables after eliminating
the individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small
number of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This
restriction allows the problem of estimation to proceed as a variable selection
problem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed
effects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time
varying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may
be non-zero for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures
that give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the
canonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of
endogenous variables in panel data instrumental variables models with fixed
effects and many instruments. An input to developing the properties of our
proposed procedures is the use of a variant of the Lasso estimator that allows
for a grouped data structure where data across groups are independent and
dependence within groups is unrestricted. We provide formal conditions within
this structure under which the proposed Lasso variant selects a sparse model

recovery of semantic label of each pixel. We base our investigation on a simple

and equally significant domains of research efforts and interests. The first
research domain relates to the problem of graph determination. That is, the
underlying graph is unknown and needs to be inferred from the data. The second
research domain dominates the applications in spatial epidemiology. In this
context GGMs are typically referred to as Gaussian Markov random fields
(GMRFs). Here the underlying graph is assumed to be known: the vertices
correspond to geographical areas, while the edges are associated with areas
that are considered to be neighbors of each other (e.g., if they share a
border). We introduce multi-way Gaussian graphical models that unify the
statistical approaches to inference for spatiotemporal epidemiology with the
literature on general GGMs. The novelty of the proposed work consists of the
addition of the G-Wishart distribution to the substantial collection of
statistical tools used to model multivariate areal data. As opposed to fixed
graphs that describe geography, there is an inherent uncertainty related to
graph determination across the other dimensions of the data. Our new class of

  The category of comodules over the trivial coring (A,A) is isomorphic to the
category of A-modules, so the question above englobes that of when two algebras
are homotopically Morita equivalent. We discuss this special case in the first
part of the paper, extending previously known results. To approach the general
question, we introduce the notion of a 'braided bimodule' and show that
adjunctions between A-Mod and B-Mod that lift to adjunctions between
(A,C)-Comod and (B,D)-Comod correspond precisely to braided bimodules between
(A,C) and (B,D). We then give criteria, in terms of homotopic descent, for when
a braided bimodule induces a Quillen equivalence. In particular, we obtain
criteria for when a morphism of corings induces a Quillen equivalence,
providing a homotopic generalization of results by Hovey and Strickland on
Morita equivalences of Hopf algebroids. To illustrate the general theory, we

designing multi-channel MAC protocols. It aids nodes in their decision making
processes by compensating for their missing information via information sharing
through other neighboring nodes. This approach was recently shown to
significantly boost the throughput of multi-channel MAC protocols. However, a
critical issue for ad hoc communication devices, i.e., energy efficiency, has
yet to be addressed. In this paper, we address this issue by developing simple
solutions which (1) reduce the energy consumption (2) without compromising the
throughput performance, and meanwhile (3) maximize cost efficiency. We propose
two energy-efficient strategies: in-situ energy conscious DISH which uses
existing nodes only, and altruistic DISH which needs additional nodes called
altruists. We compare five protocols with respect to the strategies and
identify altruistic DISH to be the right choice in general: it (1) conserves
40-80% of energy, (2) maintains the throughput advantage gained from the DISH
approach, and (3) more than doubles the cost efficiency compared to protocols
without applying the strategy. On the other hand, our study shows that in-situ
energy conscious DISH is suitable only in certain limited scenarios.

pre-maxima stage the spectra showed narrow (FWHM ~ 400 - 550 km/s and strong

development of strong and broad ~ 1000 km/s emission lines of HI, HeI, OI, and

seen. V5558 Sgr has been shown to be a rare hybrid nova showing a transition

electron density and emission measure during the early optically thick phase

substructures related to merging events in a high fraction of galaxy clusters.
Clusters can be roughly grouped into two categories -- relaxed and non-relaxed
-- and a proper characterisation of the dynamical state of these systems is of
crucial importance both for astrophysical and cosmological studies.
  In this paper we investigate the use of a number of morphological parameters
(Gini, $M_{20}$, Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Ellipticity and Gini of
the second order moment, $G_{M}$) introduced to automatically classify clusters
as relaxed or dynamically disturbed systems. We apply our method to a sample of
clusters at different redshifts extracted from the {\it Chandra} archive and we
investigate possible correlations between morphological parameters and other
X-ray gas properties. We conclude that a combination of the adopted parameters
is a very useful tool to properly characterise the X-ray cluster morphology.
  According to our results three parameters -- Gini, $M_{20}$ and Concentration
-- are very promising for identifying cluster mergers. The Gini coefficient is
a particularly powerful tool, especially at high redshift, being independent
from the choice of the position of the cluster centre. We find that high Gini
($>$ 0.65), high Concentration ($>$ 1.55) and low $M_{20}$ ($<$ -2.0) values
are associated with relaxed clusters, while low Gini ($<$ 0.4), low
Concentration ($<$ 1.0) and high $M_{20}$ ($>$ -1.4) characterise dynamically
perturbed systems. We also estimate the X-ray cluster morphological parameters
in the case of {\it radio loud} clusters. In excellent agreement with previous
analyses we confirm that diffuse intracluster radio sources are associated with
major mergers.

For a cylindrical particle such growth may also lead to failure by buckling if
the expansion is constrained in the axial direction due to other particles or
supporting structures. To mitigate this problem, the possibility of reducing
axial growth is investigated theoretically by studying simple modifications of
the solid cylinder geometry. First, an annular cylinder is considered with
lithiation either from the inside or from the outside. In both cases, the
reduction of axial growth is not found to be significant. Next, explicit
physical constraints are studied by addition of a non-growing elasto-plastic
material: first, an outer annular constraint on a solid silicon cylinder, and
second a rod-like inner constraint for an annular silicon cylinder. In both
cases, it is found that axial growth can be reduced if the yield stress of the
constraining material is significantly higher than that of silicon and/or the
thickness of the constraint is relatively high. Phase diagrams are presented
for both the outer and the inner constraint cases to identify desirable
operating zones. Finally, to interpret the phase diagrams and isolate the key
physical principles two different simplified models are presented and are shown
to recover important qualitative trends of the numerical simulation results.

oscillate or slosh. Such effects can be observed when a glass of water is
handled carelessly and the fluid sloshes or even spills over the rims of the
container. However, beer does not slosh as readily as water, which suggests
that foam could be used to damp sloshing. In this work, we study experimentally
the effect on sloshing of a liquid foam placed on top of a liquid bath. We
generate a monodisperse two-dimensional liquid foam in a rectangular container
and track the motion of the foam. The influence of the foam on the sloshing
dynamics is experimentally characterized: only a few layers of bubbles are
sufficient to significantly damp the oscillations. We rationalize our
experimental findings with a model that describes the foam contribution to the
damping coefficient through viscous dissipation on the walls of the container.
Then we extend our study to confined three-dimensional liquid foam and observe
that the behavior of 2D and confined 3D systems are very similar. Thus we
conclude that only the bubbles close to the walls have a significant impact on
the dissipation of energy. The possibility to damp liquid sloshing using foam
is promising in numerous industrial applications such as the transport of
liquefied gas in tankers or for propellants in rocket engines.

wave function factorized in hyperspherical coordinates. Inspired by this result
we propose an interpolation ansatz for the wave function for arbitrary

demonstrate that the triply degenerate spectrum at infinite coupling strength

be broken down to a doubly degenerate or non-degenerate ground state by any

compatibility with the holographic-style gravitational equations which govern
the dynamics of both the cosmological apparent horizon and the entire Universe,
and possible solutions are proposed to the existent confusions regarding the
apparent-horizon temperature and the cosmic entropy evolution. We start from
the generic Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology of general
relativity (GR) to establish a framework for the gravitational thermodynamics.
The Cai-Kim Clausius equation for the isochoric process of an instantaneous
apparent horizon indicates that, the Universe and its horizon entropies encode
the \emph{positive heat out} thermodynamic sign convention, which encourages us
to adjust the traditional positive-heat-in Gibbs equation into the
positive-heat-out version $dE_m=-T_mdS_m-P_mdV$. It turns out that the standard
and the generalized second laws (GSLs) of nondecreasing entropies are always
respected by the event-horizon system as long as the expanding Universe is
dominated by nonexotic matter $-1\leq w_m\leq 1$, while for the
apparent-horizon simple open system the two second laws hold if $-1\leq
w_m<-1/3$; also, the artificial local equilibrium assumption is abandoned in
the GSL. All constraints regarding entropy evolution are expressed by the
equation of state parameter, which show that from a thermodynamic perspective
the phantom dark energy is less favored than the cosmological constant and the
quintessence. Finally, the whole framework is extended from GR and $\Lambda$CDM
to modified gravities with field equations $R_{\mu\nu}-Rg_{\mu\nu}/2=8\pi
G_{\text{eff}} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(eff)}}$. Furthermore, this paper argues that
the Cai-Kim temperature is more suitable than Hayward, and the
Bekenstein-Hawking and Wald entropies cannot unconditionally apply to the event
and particle horizons.

to its extremely short transit time from Sun to 1 AU of less than 21 h. In-situ
data from STEREO-A revealed the arrival of a fast forward shock with a speed of
more than 2200 km s$^{-1}$ followed by a magnetic structure moving with almost
1900 km s$^{-1}$. We investigate the propagation behavior of the CME shock and
magnetic structure with the aim to reproduce the short transit time and high
impact speed as derived from in-situ data. We carefully measure the 3D
kinematics of the CME using the graduated cylindrical shell model, and obtain a
maximum speed of 2580$\pm$280 km s$^{-1}$ for the CME shock and of 2270$\pm$420
km s$^{-1}$ for its magnetic structure. Based on the 3D kinematics, the
drag-based model (DBM) reproduces the observational data reasonably well. To
successfully simulate the CME shock, we find that the ambient flow speed should
be of average value close to the slow solar wind speed (450 km s$^{-1}$), and
the initial shock speed at a distance of 30 $R_{\odot}$ should not exceed
$\approx$2300 km s$^{-1}$, otherwise it would arrive much too early at
STEREO-A. The model results indicate that an extremely low aerodynamic drag
force is exerted on the shock, smaller by one order of magnitude compared to
the average. As a consequence, the CME hardly decelerates in interplanetary
space and maintains its high initial speed. The low aerodynamic drag can only
be reproduced when reducing the density of the ambient solar wind flow, in
which the massive CME propagates, to $\rho_{\rm sw}$=1-2 cm$^{-3}$ at the
distance of 1 AU. This result is consistent with the preconditioning of
interplanetary space owing to a previous CME.

Transportation Systems (ITS) can play an important role in combating such

One of the goals of ITSs, in fact, is that of controlling traffic flows,
measuring traffic states, providing vehicles with routes that globally pursue
low pollution conditions. How such systems measure and enforce given traffic
states has been at the center of multiple research efforts in the past few
years. Although many different solutions have been proposed, very limited
effort has been devoted to exploring the potential of social network analysis
in such context. Social networks, in general, provide direct feedback from
people and, as such, potentially very valuable information. A post that tells,
for example, how a person feels about pollution at a given time in a given
location, could be put to good use by an environment aware ITS aiming at
minimizing contaminant emissions in residential areas. This work verifies the
feasibility of using pollution related social network feeds into ITS
operations. In particular, it concentrates on understanding how reliable such
information is, producing an analysis that confronts over 1,500,000 posts and

visible and, near infrared (IR) regime, while the mid-IR emittance is around
20%. The high broadband absorption in the solar spectrum is realized by the
excitation of surface plasmon and magnetic polariton resonances, while the low
mid-IR emittance is due to the highly reflective nature of the metallic
components. Further directional and polarized reflectance measurements show
wide-angle and polarization-insensitive high absorption within solar spectrum.
Temperature-dependent spectroscopic characterization indicates that the optical
properties barely change at elevated temperatures up to 350{\deg}C. The
solar-to-heat conversion efficiency with the fabricated metamaterial solar
absorber is predicted to be 78% at 100{\deg}C without optical concentration or
80% at 400{\deg}C with 25 suns, and could be further improved with better

been studied on a room-dry 15 x 15x 3 cm slab of Berea sandstone. Changes in
the arrival time of the P-wave probe as it passes through the perturbation
created by the traveling S-wave pump were recorded. Waveforms were time gated
to simulate a semi-infinite medium. The shear wave phase relative to the P-wave
probe signal was varied with resultant changes in the P-wave probe arrival time
of up to 100 ns, corresponding to a change in elastic properties of 0.2%. In
order to estimate the strain in our sample, ae also measured the particle
velocity at the sample surface to scale a finite difference linear elastic
simulation to estimate the complex strain field in the sample, on the order of
$10^{-6}$, induced by the S-wave pump. We derived a fourth order elastic model
to relate the changes in elasticity to the pump strain components. We recover
quadratic and cubic nonlinear parameters: $\tilde{\beta}=-872$,
$\tilde{\delta}=-1.1\times10^{10}$, respectively, at room-temperature and when
particle motions of the pump and probe waves are aligned. Temperature
fluctuations are correlated to changes in the recovered values of
$\tilde{\beta}$ and $\tilde{\delta}$ and we find that the nonlinear parameter
changes when the particle motions are orthogonal. No evidence of slow dynamics
was seen in our measurements.

counterpart. The variation of the distribution function is associated to a
non-collisional kinetic term of quantum-gravitational origin which is
proportional to the ratio $\Gamma/H$, where $\Gamma$ is the gravitational
particle production rate and H is the Hubble parameter. For $\Gamma << H$ the
process is negligible and as should be expected it also vanishes (regardless of
the value of $\Gamma$) in the absence of gravitation. The resulting
non-equilibrium distribution function has the same functional form of
equilibrium with the evolution laws corrected by the particle production

samples of a ground-truth measure. We investigate approaches to clustering
based on minimizing objective functionals defined on proximity graphs of the
given sample. Our focus is on functionals based on graph cuts like the Cheeger
and ratio cuts. We show that minimizers of the these cuts converge as the
sample size increases to a minimizer of a corresponding continuum cut (which
partitions the ground truth measure). Moreover, we obtain sharp conditions on
how the connectivity radius can be scaled with respect to the number of sample
points for the consistency to hold. We provide results for two-way and for
multiway cuts. Furthermore we provide numerical experiments that illustrate the
results and explore the optimality of scaling in dimension two.

information through the power spectrum of density perturbations. Additional
information can be gained from higher-order statistics like the bispectrum,
especially to break the degeneracy between the linear halo bias $b_1$ and the
amplitude of fluctuations $\sigma_8$. We propose new simple, computationally
inexpensive bispectrum statistics that are near optimal for the specific
applications like bias determination. Corresponding to the Legendre
decomposition of nonlinear halo bias and gravitational coupling at second
order, these statistics are given by the cross-spectra of the density with
three quadratic fields: the squared density, a tidal term, and a shift term.
For halos and galaxies the first two have associated nonlinear bias terms $b_2$
and $b_{s^2}$, respectively, while the shift term has none in the absence of
velocity bias (valid in the $k \rightarrow 0$ limit). Thus the linear bias
$b_1$ is best determined by the shift cross-spectrum, while the squared density
and tidal cross-spectra mostly tighten constraints on $b_2$ and $b_{s^2}$ once
$b_1$ is known. Since the form of the cross-spectra is derived from optimal
maximum-likelihood estimation, they contain the full bispectrum information on
bias parameters. Perturbative analytical predictions for their expectation
values and covariances agree with simulations on large scales, $k\lesssim
0.09h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z=0.55$ with Gaussian $R=20h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$

Surprisingly, the magnitude of the in-plane component of the CDW wave vector in

Instead, the angle of the CDW in the basal plane rotates, from 11.9 deg at x=0

coexistence between incommensurate (IC) and NC phases, indicating heterogeneous

directly measurable jet kinematics. Dynamically, their description requires
understanding several elusive properties of nuclear QCD, such as nuclear forces
at very short distances, as well as medium modification of parton distributions
in nuclei. In the present work, we develop a model for nuclear parton
distributions at large $x$ in which the nuclear dynamics at short distance
scales are described by two- and three-nucleon short range correlations (SRCs).
Nuclear modifications are accounted for using the color screening model, and an
improved description of the EMC effect is reached by using a structure function
parametrization that includes higher-twist contributions. We apply QCD
evolution at the leading order to obtain nuclear parton distributions in the
kinematic regime of the LHC, and based on the obtained distributions calculate
the cross section for dijet production. We find not only that superfast quarks
can be observed at the LHC, but also that they provide sensitivity to the
practically unexplored three-nucleon SRCs in nuclei. Additionally, the LHC can
extend our knowledge of the EMC effect to large $Q^2$ where higher-twist
effects are negligible.

motion to explain magnetic flux concentrations at the solar surface. A similar
process has recently also been seen in simplified (e.g., isothermal) models of
flux concentrations from the negative effective magnetic pressure instability.
We study the effects of partial ionization near the radiative surface on the
formation of such magnetic flux concentrations. We first obtain one-dimensional
(1D) equilibrium solutions using either a Kramers-like opacity or the ${\rm
H}^{-}$ opacity. The resulting atmospheres are then used as initial conditions
in two-dimensional (2D) models where flows are driven by an imposed gradient
force resembling a localized negative pressure in the form of a blob. To
isolate the effects of partial ionization and radiation, we ignore turbulence
and convection. In 1D models, due to partial ionization, an unstable
stratification forms always near the surface. We show that the extrema in the
specific entropy profiles correspond to the extrema in degree of ionization. In
the 2D models without partial ionization, flux concentrations form close to the
height where the blob is placed. In models with partial ionization, such flux
concentrations form at the surface much above the blob. This is due to the
corresponding unstable layer in specific entropy. With ${\rm H}^{-}$ opacity,
flux concentrations are weaker due to the stably stratified deeper parts. We
demonstrate that, together with density stratification, the imposed source of
negative pressure drives the formation of flux concentrations. We find that the
inclusion of partial ionization affects entropy profiles causing the strong
flux concentrations to form closer to the surface. We speculate that turbulence
is needed to limit the strength of flux concentrations and homogenize the
specific entropy to a more nearly marginal stratification.

implications, we consider a number of effective dimension-six operators that
are purely leptonic or couple leptons to the standard-model gauge and Higgs
bosons and evaluate constraints on the scale of MFV associated with these
operators from the latest experimental information. Specifically, we employ the
most recent measurements of neutrino mixing parameters as well as the currently
available data on flavor-violating radiative and three-body decays of charged
leptons, mu -> e conversion in nuclei, the anomalous magnetic moments of
charged leptons, and their electric dipole moments. The most stringent
lower-limit on the MFV scale comes from the present experimental bound on mu ->
e gamma and can reach 500 TeV or higher, depending on the details of the seesaw
scheme. With our numerical results, we illustrate some important differences
among the seesaw types. In particular, we show that in types I and III there
are features which can bring about potentially remarkable effects which do not
occur in type II. In addition, we comment on how one of the new effective
operators can induce flavor-changing dilepton decays of the Higgs boson, which
may be probed in upcoming searches at the LHC.

primordial black holes in the most consistent case of the model. This situation
could be aleviated if, as recently argued, the BICEP2 data do not correspond to

tube moving along its axis become unstable. We employ the dispersion relations
of MHD modes derived from the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations. We
assume real wave numbers and complex angular wave frequencies, namely complex
wave phase velocities. The dispersion relations are solved numerically at fixed
input parameters (taken from observational data) and various mass flow
velocities. It is shown that the stability of the modes depends upon four
parameters, the density contrast between the flux tube and its environment, the
ratio of the background magnetic fields in the two media, the twist of the
magnetic field lines inside the tube, and the value of the Alfv\'en Mach number
(the ratio of the tube velocity to Alfv\'en speed inside the flux tube). For a
twisted magnetic flux tube at a density contrast of $0.88$, background magnetic
field ratio of $1.58$, and a normalised magnetic field twist of $0.2$, the
critical speed for the kink ($m = -3$) mode (where $m$ is the azimuthal mode
number) is $678$ km\,s$^{-1}$ just as it is observed. The growth rate for this
harmonic at KH wavelength of $18.5$ Mm and ejecta width of $4.1$ Mm is equal to
$0.037$ s$^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. KH instability of the $m =
-3$ mode may also explain why the KH vortices are seen only at the one side of
arising CME. The good agreement between observational and computational data
shows that the imaged KH instability on CME can be explained in terms of
emerging KH instability of the $m = -3$ MHD mode in twisted magnetic flux tube
moving along its axis.

sufficient conditions for such noise-benefits and demonstrates the speed-up in

analyses the effects of data and model corruption on the more general Bayesian

of boosted dark matter. We focus on a scenario with two dark matter particles
of a large mass difference, where the heavier candidate is secluded and
interacts with the standard model particles only at loops, escaping existing
direct and indirect detection bounds. Yet its pair annihilation in the galactic
center or in the Sun may produce boosted stable particles, which could be
detected as visible Cherenkov light in large volume neutrino detectors. In such
models with multiple candidates, self-interaction of dark matter particles is
naturally utilized in the {\it assisted freeze-out} mechanism and is
corroborated by various cosmological studies such as N-body simulations of
structure formation, observations of dwarf galaxies, and the small scale
problem. We show that self-interaction of the secluded (heavier) dark matter
greatly enhances the capture rate in the Sun and results in promising signals
at current and future experiments. We perform a detailed analysis of the
boosted dark matter events for Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande and PINGU,
including notable effects such as evaporation due to self-interaction and
energy loss in the Sun.

distributions (GPDs), it is desirable to compute them using a framework that
can potentially connect empirical information with basic features of the
Standard Model. We sketch an approach to such computations, based upon a
rainbow-ladder (RL) truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations and
exemplified via the pion's valence dressed-quark GPD, $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,\xi,t)$.
Our analysis focuses primarily on $\xi=0$, although we also capitalise on the
symmetry-preserving nature of the RL truncation by connecting $H_\pi^{\rm
v}(x,\xi=\pm 1,t)$ with the pion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude.
We explain that the impulse-approximation used hitherto to define the pion's
valence dressed-quark GPD is generally invalid owing to omission of
contributions from the gluons which bind dressed-quarks into the pion. A simple
correction enables us to identify a practicable improvement to the
approximation for $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,0,t)$, expressed as the Radon transform of a
single amplitude. Therewith we obtain results for $H_\pi^{\rm v}(x,0,t)$ and
the associated impact-parameter dependent distribution, $q_\pi^{\rm
v}(x,|\vec{b}_\perp|)$, which provide a qualitatively sound picture of the
pion's dressed-quark structure at an hadronic scale. We evolve the
distributions to a scale $\zeta=2\,$GeV, so as to facilitate comparisons in
future with results from experiment or other nonperturbative methods.

difficult to observe, because their overdensity is only slightly greater than

observational data, and these were used as a tool for estimating the mass of
galaxy clusters. Here we expand and refine that observational detection method.
We study two pancakes on scales of 10 Mpc, identified from spectroscopically
observed galaxies near the Coma cluster, and compare with twenty numerical
pancakes.
  We find that the observed structures have velocity dispersion about 100
km/sec, which is relatively low compared to typical groups and filaments. These
velocity dispersions are consistent with those found for the numerical
pancakes. We also confirm that the identified structures are in fact
two-dimensional structures. Finally, we estimate the stellar to total mass of
the observational pancakes to be $2 \times 10^{-4}$, within one order of
magnitude, which is smaller than that of clusters of galaxies.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most state-of-the-art action feature extractors involve differential
operators, which act as highpass filters and tend to attenuate low frequency
action information. This attenuation introduces bias to the resulting features
and generates ill-conditioned feature matrices. The Gaussian Pyramid has been
used as a feature enhancing technique that encodes scale-invariant
characteristics into the feature space in an attempt to deal with this
attenuation. However, at the core of the Gaussian Pyramid is a convolutional
smoothing operation, which makes it incapable of generating new features at
coarse scales. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel feature
enhancing technique called Multi-skIp Feature Stacking (MIFS), which stacks
features extracted using a family of differential filters parameterized with
multiple time skips and encodes shift-invariance into the frequency space. MIFS
compensates for information lost from using differential operators by
recapturing information at coarse scales. This recaptured information allows us
to match actions at different speeds and ranges of motion. We prove that MIFS
enhances the learnability of differential-based features exponentially. The
resulting feature matrices from MIFS have much smaller conditional numbers and
variances than those from conventional methods. Experimental results show
significantly improved performance on challenging action recognition and event
detection tasks. Specifically, our method exceeds the state-of-the-arts on
Hollywood2, UCF101 and UCF50 datasets and is comparable to state-of-the-arts on
HMDB51 and Olympics Sports datasets. MIFS can also be used as a speedup
strategy for feature extraction with minimal or no accuracy cost.

experiments, we identify a ""sudden"" magnetization canting induced by laser
excitation, which displays magnetic hysteresis absent in static

magnetoresistivity. The fs magnetization canting switches direction with
magnetic state and laser frequency, which distinguishes it from nonlinear

givens by much of the community. For example, it is widely held that
interstellar dust is made up of only three components, i.e., astronomical
silicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our
understanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret
astronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a
reasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling
have been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it
is now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of
the dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the
three pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust
analogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites,
interplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the
interpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the
view that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed
too naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are
rather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and
we must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will
be scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current
observational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints. It is
concluded from this analysis that we really do need to re-assess many of the
fundamental assumptions relating to what we think we really do know about
interstellar dust. In particular, it is clear that unravelling the nature dust
evolution in the interstellar medium is perhaps the key to significantly
advancing our current understanding of interstellar dust. ...

an ensemble of collisional N-body simulations are accurate, even though
individual simulations are not. A way to test this hypothesis is to make a
direct comparison of an ensemble of solutions obtained by conventional methods
with an ensemble of true solutions. In order to make this possible, we wrote an
N-body code called Brutus, that uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic. In
combination with the Bulirsch--Stoer method, Brutus is able to obtain converged
solutions, which are true up to a specified number of digits. We perform
simulations of democratic 3-body systems, where after a sequence of resonances
and ejections, a final configuration is reached consisting of a permanent
binary and an escaping star. We do this with conventional double-precision
methods, and with Brutus; both have the same set of initial conditions and
initial realisations. The ensemble of solutions from the conventional
simulations is compared directly to that of the converged simulations, both as
an ensemble and on an individual basis to determine the distribution of the
errors. We find that on average at least half of the conventional simulations
diverge from the converged solution, such that the two solutions are
microscopically incomparable. For the solutions which have not diverged
significantly, we observe that if the integrator has a bias in energy and
angular momentum, this propagates to a bias in the statistical properties of
the binaries. In the case when the conventional solution has diverged onto an
entirely different trajectory in phase-space, we find that the errors are
centred around zero and symmetric; the error due to divergence is unbiased, as
long as the time-step parameter, eta <= 2^(-5) and when simulations which
violate energy conservation by more than 10% are excluded.

probability. Furthermore, [Coja-Oghlan and Efthymiou, 2011] present some
evidence that one cannot hope to easily improve a similar, almost 40 years old
bound for sparse random graphs. Therefore, our results are unlikely to be
easily improved.
  We use a novel approach to obtain a recurrence corresponding to the variance
of each estimator. Then we upper bound the variance using the corresponding
recurrence. This leads us to obtain a polynomial upper bound on the critical
ratio. As an aside, we also obtain an alternate derivation of the closed form
expression for the $k$-th moment of a binomial random variable using our
techniques. The previous derivation [Knoblauch (2008)] was based on the moment
generating function of a binomial random variable.

spatial distribution of resolved stellar populations in the outskirts of NGC
2915, a blue compact dwarf with an extended HI disc. These observations reveal
an elliptical distribution of red giant branch stars, and a clumpy distribution
of main-sequence stars that correlate with the HI gas distribution. We
constrain the upper-end initial mass function (IMF) and determine the star
formation law (SFL) in this field, using the observed main-sequence stars and
an assumed constant star formation rate. Previously published H{\alpha}
observations of the field, which show one faint HII region, are used to provide
further constraints on the IMF. We find that the main-sequence luminosity
function analysis alone results in a best-fitting IMF with a power-law slope
{\alpha}=-2.85 and upper-mass limit M$_\rm{u}$ = 60 M$_\odot$. However, if we
assume that all H{\alpha} emission is confined to HII regions then the
upper-mass limit is restricted to M$_\rm{u}$ $\le$20 M$_\odot$. For the
luminosity function fit to be correct we have to discount the H{\alpha}
observations implying significant diffuse ionized gas or escaping ionizing
photons. Combining the HST photometry with HI imaging we find the SFL has a
power law index $N=1.53 \pm 0.21$. Applying these results to the entire outer
HI disc indicates that it contributes 11--28% of the total recent star
formation in NGC 2915, depending on whether the IMF is constant within the disc
or varies from the centre to the outer region.

therapy. The development of resistance is commonly attributed to genetic
heterogeneity. However, heterogeneity of drug penetration of the tumor
microenvironment both on the microscopic level within solid tumors as well as
on the macroscopic level across metastases may also contribute to acquired drug
resistance. Here we use mathematical models to investigate the effect of drug
heterogeneity on the probability of escape from treatment and time to
resistance. Specifically we address scenarios with sufficiently efficient
therapies that suppress growth of all preexisting genetic variants in the
compartment with highest drug concentration. To study the joint effect of drug
heterogeneity, growth rate, and evolution of resistance we analyze a multitype
stochastic branching process describing growth of cancer cells in two
compartments with different drug concentration and limited migration between
compartments. We show that resistance is more likely to arise first in the low
drug compartment and from there populate the high drug compartment. Moreover,
we show that only below a threshold rate of cell migration does spatial
heterogeneity accelerate resistance evolution, otherwise deterring drug
resistance with excessively high migration rates. Our results provide new
insights into understanding why cancers tend to quickly become resistant, and
that cell migration and the presence of sanctuary sites with little drug
exposure are essential to this end.

many tick species parasitize mammals, immature ticks are often found on wild

ticks hinder studies of tick ecology and tick-borne disease transmission,
including any potential role for birds. In Panama, we found immature ticks on
227 out of 3,498 birds representing 93 host species, about 1/8th of the entire
Panamanian terrestrial avifauna. Tick parasitism rates did not vary with
temperature or rainfall, but parasitism rates did vary with host ecological
traits: non-migratory residents, forest dwelling birds, bark insectivores,
terrestrial foragers and lowland species were most likely to be infested with
ticks. Using a molecular library developed from adult ticks specifically for
this study, we identified 130 immature ticks obtained from wild birds,
corresponding to eleven tick species, indicating that a substantial portion of
the Panamanian avifauna is parasitized by a variety of tick species.
Furthermore, we found evidence that immature ticks show taxonomic or ecological
specificity to avian hosts. Finally, our data indicate that Panamanian birds
are not parasitized regularly by the tick species responsible for most known
tick-borne diseases. However, they are frequent hosts of other tick species
known to carry a variety of rickettsial parasites of unknown pathogenicity.
Given the broad interaction between tick and avian biodiversity in the
Neotropics, future work on emerging tropical tick-borne disease should
explicitly consider wild birds as vertebrate hosts.

(2010) to consider turbulence-compliant wall interactions. Under this
formulation, the turbulent velocity field is expressed as a linear
superposition of propagating modes, identified via a gain-based decomposition
of the Navier-Stokes equations. Compliant surfaces, modeled as a complex
wall-admittance linking pressure and velocity, affect the gain and structure of
these modes. With minimal computation, this framework accurately predicts the
emergence of the quasi-2D propagating waves observed in recent direct numerical
simulations. Further, the analysis also enables the rational design of
compliant surfaces, with properties optimized to suppress flow structures
energetic in wall turbulence. It is shown that walls with unphysical negative
damping are required to interact favorably with modes resembling the energetic
near-wall cycle, which could explain why previous studies have met with limited
success. Positive-damping walls are effective for modes resembling the
so-called very large-scale motions (VLSMs), indicating that compliant surfaces
may be better suited for application at higher Reynolds number. Unfortunately,
walls that suppress structures energetic in natural turbulence are also
predicted to have detrimental effects elsewhere in spectral space. Consistent
with previous experiments and simulations, slow-moving spanwise-constant
structures are particularly susceptible to further amplification. Mitigating
these adverse effects will be central to the development of compliant coatings

squared mass splittings $\ll 0.1\ \mathrm{eV^2}$, has been successfully built
up over the last 15 years using solar, atmospheric, long baseline accelerator
and reactor neutrino experiments. However, this well-established picture might
suffer from anomalous results reported at very short baselines in some of these
experiments. If not experimental artifacts, such results could possibly be
interpreted as the existence of at least an additional fourth sterile neutrino
species, mixing with the known active flavors with an associated mass splitting
$\ll 0.1\ \mathrm{eV^2}$, and being insensitive to standard weak interactions.
Precision measurements at very short baselines (5 to 15 m) with intense MeV
electronic antineutrino emitters can be used to probe these anomalies. In this
article, the expected antineutrino signal and backgrounds of a generic
experiment which consists of deploying an intense beta minus radioactive source
inside or in the vicinity of a large liquid scintillator detector are studied.
The technical challenges to perform such an experiment are identified, along
with quantifying the possible source and detector induced systematics, and
their impact on the sensitivity to the observation of neutrino oscillations at
short baselines.

eEDM upper limit, which strongly constrains the allowed magnitude of

out: if both the CP-odd Higgs-photon-photon ($Z$ boson) and the CP-odd
Higgs-electron-positron couplings are turned on, a cancellation may occur
either between the contributions of a CP-mixing Higgs boson, with the other
Higgs bosons being decoupled, or between the contributions of a CP-even and a
CP-odd Higgs bosons. With the assistance of the cancellation mechanisms, a
large CP-phase in Higgs couplings with viable electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG)

heterotic supergravity. We consider supersymmetric compactifications to
four-dimensional maximally symmetric space, commonly referred to as the
Strominger system. The compact part of space-time $X$ is a six-dimensional
manifold of what we refer to as a heterotic $SU(3)$-structure. We show that
this system can be put in terms of a holomorphic operator $\bar D$ on a bundle
$\mathcal{Q}=T^*X\oplus\mathrm{End}(TX)\oplus\mathrm{End}(V)\oplus TX$, defined
by a series of extensions. We proceed to compute the infinitesimal deformation
space of this structure, given by $T\mathcal{M}=H^{(0,1)}(\mathcal{Q})$, which
constitutes the infinitesimal spectrum of the four-dimensional theory. In doing
so, we find an over counting of moduli by $H^{(0,1)}(\mathrm{End}(TX))$, which
can be reinterpreted as $\mathcal{O}(\alpha')$ field redefinitions. We next
consider non-maximally symmetric domain wall compactifications of the form
$M_{10}=M_3\times Y$, where $M_3$ is three-dimensional Minkowski space, and
$Y=\mathbb{R}\times X$ is a seven-dimensional non-compact manifold with a
$G_2$-structure. Here $X$ is a six dimensional compact space of half-flat
$SU(3)$-structure, non-trivially fibered over $\mathbb{R}$. By focusing on
coset compactifications, we show that the compact space $X$ can be endowed with
non-trivial torsion, which can be used in a combination with $\alpha'$-effects
to stabilise all geometric moduli. The domain wall can further be lifted to a
maximally symmetric AdS vacuum by inclusion of non-perturbative effects.
Finally, we consider domain wall compactifications where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau.
We show that by considering such compactifications, one can evade the usual
no-go theorems for flux in Calabi-Yau compactifications, allowing flux to be
used as a tool in such compactifications, even when $X$ is K\""ahler.

Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) version of Lattice Boltzmann Kinetic Model(LBKM)

progress of combustion is dynamically coupled into the system by adding a
chemical term to the LB kinetic equation. Beside describing the evolutions of
the conserved quantities, the density, momentum and energy, which are what the
Navier-Stokes model describes, the MRT-LBKM presents also a coarse-grained
description on the evolutions of some non-conserved quantities. The current
model works for both subsonic and supersonic flows with or without chemical
reaction. In this model both the specific-heat ratio and the Prandtl number are
flexible, the TNE effects are naturally presented in each simulation step. The
model is verified and validated via well-known benchmark tests. As an initial
application, various non-equilibrium behaviours, including the complex
interplays between various HNEs, between various TNEs and between the HNE and
TNE, around the detonation wave in the unsteady and steady one-dimensional
detonation processes are preliminarily probed. It is found that the system
viscosity (or heat conductivity) decreases the local TNE, but increase the
global TNE around the detonation wave, that even locally, the system viscosity
(or heat conductivity) results in two kinds of competing trends, to increase
and to decrease the TNE effects. The physical reason is that the viscosity (or
heat conductivity) takes part in both the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic
responses.

However, automatically identifying discourse relations is difficult, because it
requires understanding the semantics of the linked arguments. A more subtle
challenge is that it is not enough to represent the meaning of each argument of
a discourse relation, because the relation may depend on links between
lower-level components, such as entity mentions. Our solution computes
distributional meaning representations by composition up the syntactic parse
tree. A key difference from previous work on compositional distributional
semantics is that we also compute representations for entity mentions, using a
novel downward compositional pass. Discourse relations are predicted from the
distributional representations of the arguments, and also of their coreferent
entity mentions. The resulting system obtains substantial improvements over the
previous state-of-the-art in predicting implicit discourse relations in the

not evolve strongly with redshift, we identify a strong Malmquist bias in GRB

matrices under arbitrary sign changes of the entries using properties of the
roots of polynomials in number fields. The square root rank is an upper bound
on the positive semidefinite rank of a matrix, and corresponds the special case
where all matrices in the factorization are rank-one.

introducing a notion of microformal or ""thick"" morphisms. They are formal
canonical relations of a special form, constructed with the help of formal
power expansions in cotangent directions. The result is a formal category so
that its composition law is also specified by a formal power series. A
microformal morphism acts on functions by an operation of pullback, which is in
general a nonlinear transformation. More precisely, it is a formal mapping of
formal manifolds of even functions (bosonic fields), which has the property
that its derivative for every function is a ring homomorphism. This suggests an
abstract notion of a ""nonlinear algebra homomorphism"" and the corresponding
extension of the classical ""algebraic-functional"" duality. There is a parallel
fermionic version.
  The obtained formalism provides a general construction of
$L_{\infty}$-morphisms for functions on homotopy Poisson ($P_{\infty}$-) or
homotopy Schouten ($S_{\infty}$-) manifolds as pullbacks by Poisson microformal
morphisms. We also show that the notion of the adjoint can be generalized to
nonlinear operators as a microformal morphism. By applying this to
$L_{\infty}$-algebroids, we show that an $L_{\infty}$-morphism of
$L_{\infty}$-algebroids induces an $L_{\infty}$-morphism of the ""homotopy
Lie--Poisson"" brackets for functions on the dual vector bundles. We apply this
construction to higher Koszul brackets on differential forms and to triangular
$L_{\infty}$-bialgebroids. We also develop a quantum version (for the bosonic
case), whose relation with the classical version is like that of the
Schr\""odinger equation with the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We show that the
nonlinear pullbacks by microformal morphisms are the limits at $\hbar\to 0$ of
certain ""quantum pullbacks"", which are defined as special form Fourier integral

associated with physical irreversibility and further theorized that the erasure
of information is fundamentally a dissipative process. Landauer posited that a
fundamental energy cost is incurred by the erasure of information contained in
the memory of a computation device. His theory states that to erase one binary
bit of information from a physical memory element in contact with a heat bath
at a given temperature, at least kT ln(2) of heat must be dissipated from the
memory into the environment, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the
temperature. Although this connection between information theory and
thermodynamics has proven to be very useful for establishing boundary limits
for physical processes, Landauer principle has been a subject of some debate.
Despite the theoretical controversy and fundamental importance of Landauer
erasure in information technology, this phenomenon has not been experimentally
explored using any practical physical implementation for digital information.
Here, we report an investigation of the thermodynamic limits of the memory
erasure process using nanoscale magnetic memory bits, by far the most
ubiquitous digital storage technology today. Through sensitive, temperature
dependent magnetometry measurements, we observed that the amount of dissipated
energy is consistent with the Landauer limit during an adiabatic erasure
process in nanoscale, single domain magnetic thin film islands. This result
confirms the connection between information thermodynamics and physical systems
and also provides a foundation for the development of practical information
processing technologies that approach the fundamental limit of energy
dissipation.

for $\delta$ in the vicinity of $\pi$, where the system is almost transparent
and less localized, and iii) right in the middle of regime II, for $\delta$
very close to $\pi$, the formation of a band gap, which becomes ever more
conspicuous as $n$ increases. In regime II, both the average Landauer
resistance and the transmission coefficient show an oscillatory behavior with
$n$ and $\delta$. These characteristics of the system are found analytically,
some of them exactly and some others approximately. The agreement between

and evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that emit intense light believed
to come from an accretion disk near a super-massive black hole (Rees 1984,
Lynden-Bell 1969). To understand the zoo of different AGN classes, it has been
suggested that all AGN are the same type of object viewed from different angles
(Antonucci 1993). This model -- called AGN unification -- has been successful
in predicting e.g. the existence of hidden broad optical lines in the spectrum
of many narrow-line AGN. But this model is not unchallenged (Tran 2001) and it
is an open problem whether more than viewing angle separates the so-called
Type-1 and Type-2 AGN. Here we report the first large-scale study that finds
strong differences in the galaxy neighbours to Type-1 and Type-2 AGN with data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (York et al. 2000) Data Release 7

al 2011). We find strong differences in the colour and AGN activity of the
neighbours to Type-1 and Type-2 AGN and in how the fraction of AGN residing in
spiral hosts changes depending on the presence of a neighbour or not. These
findings suggest that an evolutionary link between the two major AGN types
might exist.

compact massive galaxies are rare in the local universe. The most common
interpretation of this phenomenon is that massive galaxies have grown in size
by a factor of about five since redshift z=2. An alternative explanation is
that recently quenched massive galaxies are larger (a ""progenitor bias""). In
this paper we explore the importance of progenitor bias by looking for
systematic differences in the stellar populations of compact early-type
galaxies in the DEEP2 survey as a function of size. Our analysis is based on
applying the statistical technique of bootstrap resampling to constrain
differences in the median ages of our samples and to begin to characterize the
distribution of stellar populations in our co-added spectra. The light-weighted
ages of compact early-type galaxies at redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.4 are compared to
those of a control sample of larger galaxies at similar redshifts. We find that
massive compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of red color and high
bulge-to-total ratio are younger than similarly selected larger galaxies,
suggesting that size growth in these objects is not driven mainly by progenitor
bias, and that individual galaxies grow as their stellar populations age.
However, compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of image smoothness
and high bulge-to-total ratio are older than a control sample of larger
galaxies. Progenitor bias will play a significant role in defining the apparent
size changes of early-type galaxies if they are selected on the basis of the
smoothness of their light distributions.

messengers coupling it to the quarks and leptons. Consistent thermal models
require the dark matter to have masses of 100's GeV and have $\gsim 1$
couplings to the Standard Model (SM), implying that radiative corrections to
the SM Drell-Yan rate can be sizeable. We consider the case of Majorana, Dirac,
and pseudo-Dirac dark matter and show that there are regions of parameter space
where the non-existence of a monocline, which starts at roughly twice the dark
matter mass, $m_{\ell\ell} \sim 2 m_\chi$, places the strongest constraint on
the model. We make predictions for the sensitivities at the high luminosity 14
TeV LHC as well as a future 100 TeV proton-proton collider. We find that our
dilepton signal is most sensitive when the mediator and the dark matter are
nearly degenerate and conventional MET-based searches are least sensitive.

accelerated by the net force exerted on them, which results from both driving

acceleration which generates intrinsic rotation. Experiments were performed on
EAST and J-TEXT for ohmic plasmas with net counter- and co-current toroidal
acceleration generated by density ramping up and ramping down. Additionally on
EAST, net co-current toroidal acceleration was also formed by LHCD or ICRF. For
the current experimental results, toroidal acceleration was between - 50 km/s^2
in counter-current direction and 70 km/s^2 in co-current direction. According
to toroidal momentum equation, toroidal electric field (E\-(\g(f))),
electron-ion toroidal friction, and toroidal viscous force etc. may play roles
in the evolution of toroidal rotation. To evaluate contribution of each term,
we first analyze characteristics of E\-(\g(f)). E\-(\g(f)) is one of the
co-current toroidal forces that acts on the plasma as a whole and persists for
the entire discharge period. It was shown to drive the co-current toroidal
acceleration at a magnitude of 10^3 km/s^2, which was much larger than the
experimental toroidal acceleration observed on EAST and J-TEXT. So E\-(\g(f))
is one of co-current forces producing cocurrent intrinsic toroidal acceleration
and rotation. Meanwhile, it indicates that there must be a strong
counter-current toroidal acceleration resulting from counter-current toroidal
forces. Electron-ion toroidal friction is one of the counter-current toroidal
forces because global electrons move in the counter-current direction in order
to produce a toroidal plasma current.

However, the wireless channel allows for much richer interaction between nodes.
One such scenario is in a multi-channel environment, where transmitter-receiver
pairs may make incorrect decisions (e.g., in selecting channels) but idle
neighbors could help by sharing information to prevent undesirable consequences
(e.g., data collisions). This represents a Distributed Information SHaring
(DISH) mechanism for cooperation and suggests new ways of designing cooperative
protocols. However, what is lacking is a theoretical understanding of this new
notion of cooperation. In this paper, we view cooperation as a network resource
and evaluate the availability of cooperation via a metric, $p_{co}$, the
probability of obtaining cooperation. First, we analytically evaluate $p_{co}$
in the context of multi-channel multi-hop wireless networks. Second, we verify
our analysis via simulations and the results show that our analysis accurately
characterizes the behavior of $p_{co}$ as a function of underlying network
parameters. This step also yields important insights into DISH with respect to
network dynamics. Third, we investigate the correlation between $p_{co}$ and
network performance in terms of collision rate, packet delay, and throughput.
The results indicate a near-linear relationship, which may significantly
simplify performance analysis for cooperative networks and suggests that
$p_{co}$ be used as an appropriate performance indicator itself. Throughout
this work, we utilize, as appropriate, three different DISH contexts ---
model-based DISH, ideal DISH, and real DISH --- to explore $p_{co}$.

A recently proposed method is based on the Vlasov description and uniformly
redistributes the initial distribution along contours of the asymptotic
effective Hamiltonian, which is defined by the obtained quasistationary state
and is determined self-consistently. The method, to which we refer as the
rearrangement formula, was suggested to give precise prediction under limited
situations. Restricting initial states consisting of spatially homogeneous part
and small perturbation, we numerically reveal two conditions that the
rearrangement formula prefers: One is no Landau damping condition for
unperturbed homogeneous part, and the other comes from the Casimir invariants.
Mechanisms of these conditions are discussed. Clarifying these conditions, we

Way, for 350 ks and detected emission up to $\sim$30 keV. The remnant's X-ray
morphology does not change significantly across the energy range from 3 to 20
keV. A combined fit between NuSTAR and CHANDRA shows that the spectrum steepens
with energy. The spectral shape can be well fitted with synchrotron emission
from a power-law electron energy distribution with an exponential cutoff with
no additional features. It can also be described by a purely phenomenological
model such as a broken power-law or a power-law with an exponential cutoff,
though these descriptions lack physical motivation. Using a fixed radio flux at
1 GHz of 1.17 Jy for the synchrotron model, we get a column density of N$_{\rm
H}$ = $(7.23\pm0.07) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a spectral index of
$\alpha=0.633\pm0.003$, and a roll-off frequency of $\nu_{\rm
rolloff}=(3.07\pm0.18) \times 10^{17}$ Hz. This can be explained by particle
acceleration, to a maximum energy set by the finite remnant age, in a magnetic
field of about 10 $\mu$G, for which our roll-off implies a maximum energy of
about 100 TeV for both electrons and ions. Much higher magnetic-field strengths
would produce an electron spectrum that was cut off by radiative losses, giving
a much higher roll-off frequency that is independent of magnetic-field
strength. In this case, ions could be accelerated to much higher energies. A
search for $^{44}$Ti emission in the 67.9 keV line results in an upper limit of
$1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ $\,\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$
assuming a line width of 4.0 keV (1 sigma).

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In parameterized complexity, it is a natural idea to consider different
generalizations of classic problems. Usually, such generalization are obtained
by introducing a ""relaxation"" variable, where the original problem corresponds
to setting this variable to a constant value. For instance, the problem of
packing sets of size at most $p$ into a given universe generalizes the Maximum
Matching problem, which is recovered by taking $p=2$. Most often, the
complexity of the problem increases with the relaxation variable, but very
recently Abasi et al. have given a surprising example of a problem ---
$r$-Simple $k$-Path --- that can be solved by a randomized algorithm with
running time $O^*(2^{O(k \frac{\log r}{r})})$. That is, the complexity of the
problem decreases with $r$. In this paper we pursue further the direction
sketched by Abasi et al. Our main contribution is a derandomization tool that
provides a deterministic counterpart of the main technical result of Abasi et
al.: the $O^*(2^{O(k \frac{\log r}{r})})$ algorithm for $(r,k)$-Monomial
Detection, which is the problem of finding a monomial of total degree $k$ and
individual degrees at most $r$ in a polynomial given as an arithmetic circuit.
Our technique works for a large class of circuits, and in particular it can be
used to derandomize the result of Abasi et al. for $r$-Simple $k$-Path. On our
way to this result we introduce the notion of representative sets for
multisets, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we give two more
examples of problems that were already studied in the literature, where the
same relaxation phenomenon happens. The first one is a natural relaxation of
the Set Packing problem, where we allow the packed sets to overlap at each
element at most $r$ times. The second one is Degree Bounded Spanning Tree,
where we seek for a spanning tree of the graph with a small maximum degree.

flux; and that a sufficient condition for the existence of a stationary growth

have been comprehensive efforts to understand its origin. Both splittings of
spin doublets and pseudospin doublets play critical roles in the evolution of
magic numbers in exotic nuclei discovered by modern spectroscopic studies with
radioactive ion beam facilities. Since the PSS was recognized as a relativistic
symmetry in 1990s, many special features, including the spin symmetry (SS) for

Review, we focus on the recent progress on the PSS and SS in various systems
and potentials, including extensions of the PSS study from stable to exotic
nuclei, from non-confining to confining potentials, from local to non-local
potentials, from central to tensor potentials, from bound to resonant states,
from nucleon to anti-nucleon spectra, from nucleon to hyperon spectra, and from
spherical to deformed nuclei. Open issues in this field are also discussed in

cosmological dark sector might be collisional. An attractive feature of such a
possibility is that, it can reconcile dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) in
terms of a single component, accommodated in the context of a polytropic-DM
fluid. Accordingly, we explore the time evolution and the dynamical
characteristics of a spatially-flat cosmological model, in which, in principle,
there is no DE at all. Instead, in this model, the DM itself possesses some
sort of fluid-like properties, i.e., the fundamental units of the Universe
matter-energy content are the volume elements of a DM fluid, performing
polytropic flows. In this case, the energy of this fluid's internal motions is
also taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. This
form of energy can compensate for the extra energy needed to compromise spatial
flatness, namely, to justify that, today, the total-energy density parameter is
exactly unity. The polytropic cosmological model, depends on only one free
parameter, the corresponding exponent, \Gamma. What makes this model
particularly interesting, is that, for \Gamma < 0.541, the (conventional)
pressure becomes negative enough, so that the Universe accelerates its
expansion at cosmological redshifts below a transition value. Several physical
reasons impose further constraints on the value of \Gamma, which, eventually,
is settled down to the range -0.089 < \Gamma < 0. Such a cosmological model
does not suffer either from the age problem or from the coincidence problem. At
the same time, this model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements
performed with the aid of the supernovae Type Ia standard candles, and most
naturally interprets, not only when, but also, why the Universe transits from
deceleration to acceleration, thus arising as a mighty contestant for a DE
model.

$p_{co}$ can be used as an appropriate performance indicator itself. Finally,

plasmas such as dc magnetron discharges and HiPIMS systems, where secondary
electrons enter the plasma after being accelerated in the cathode fall and
encounter a nearly uniform bulk. An analytic calculation of the distribution
function of hot electrons is presented; these are described as an initially
monoenergetic beam that slows down by Coulomb collisions with a Maxwellian
distribution of bulk (cold) electrons, and by inelastic collisions with
neutrals. Although this analytical solution is based on a steady-state
assumption, a comparison of the characteristic time-scales suggests that it may
be applicable to a variety of practical time-dependent discharges, and it may
be used to introduce kinetic effects into models based on the hypothesis of
Maxwellian electrons. The results are verified for parameters appropriate to
HiPIMS discharges, by means of time-dependent and fully-kinetic numerical
calculations.

also the mass distributions of isolated and accreting neutron stars. We show
that the observations of these stars can be reasonably well explained by
assuming the presence of the powerful direct Urca process of neutrino emission
in the inner cores of massive stars, introducing a slight broadening of the
direct Urca threshold (for instance, by proton superfluidity), and by tuning
mass distributions of isolated and accreted neutron stars.

complement a result of Lakeland stating that a cofinite Fuchsian group has a DF

for neutron-star--black-hole binary coalescence has been shown to increase the
astrophysical reach with respect to search methods where spins are neglected
completely, under astrophysically reasonable assumptions about black-hole
spins. However, theoretical considerations and population synthesis models
suggest that many of these binaries may have a significant misalignment between
the black-hole spin and the orbital angular momentum, which could lead to
precession of the orbital plane during the inspiral and a consequent loss in
detection efficiency if precession is ignored. This work explores the effect of
spin misalignment on a search pipeline that completely neglects spin effects
and on a recently-developed pipeline that only includes aligned-spin effects.
Using synthetic but realistic data, which could reasonably represent the first
scientific runs of advanced-LIGO detectors, the relative sensitivities of both
pipelines are shown for different assumptions about black-hole spin magnitude
and alignment with the orbital angular momentum. Despite the inclusion of
aligned-spin effects, the loss in signal-to-noise ratio due to precession can
be as large as $40\%$, but this has a limited impact on the overall detection
rate: even if precession is a predominant feature of neutron-star--black-hole
binaries, an aligned-spin search pipeline can still detect at least half of the
signals compared to an idealized generic precessing search pipeline.

the local element distribution and producing efficient optical waveguides. In
this work it is shown that the transient plasma distribution induced during
laser irradiation is a reliable monitor for predicting the final refractive
index distribution of the waveguide caused by ion migration. By performing
in-situ plasma emission microscopy during the writing process inside a
La-phosphate glass it is found that the long axis of the plasma distribution
determines the axis of ion migration, being responsible for the local
refractive index increase. This observation is also valid when strong positive
or negative spherical aberration is induced, greatly deforming the focal volume
and inverting the index profile. Even subtle changes in the writing conditions,
such as an inversion of the writing direction (quill writing effect), show up
in the form of a modified plasma distribution, which manifests as a modified
index distribution. Finally, it is shown that the superior control over the
waveguide properties employing the slit shaping technique is caused by the more
confined plasma distribution produced. The underlying reasons for this

the exciton-polariton condensate. Exciton-polaritons (or polaritons for short)
are bosonic quasiparticles that exist inside semiconductor microcavities,
consisting of a superposition of an exciton and a cavity photon. Above a
threshold density the polaritons macroscopically occupy the same quantum state,
forming a condensate. The lifetime of the polaritons are typically comparable
to or shorter than thermalization times, making them possess an inherently
non-equilibrium nature. Nevertheless, they display many of the features that
would be expected of equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The
non-equilibrium nature of the system raises fundamental questions of what it
means for a system to be a BEC, and introduces new physics beyond that seen in
other macroscopically coherent systems. In this review we focus upon several
physical phenomena exhibited by exciton-polariton condensates. In particular we
examine topics such as the difference between a polariton BEC, a polariton
laser, and a photon laser, as well as physical phenomena such as superfluidity,
vortex formation, BKT (Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) and BCS
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) physics. We also discuss the physics and
applications of engineered polariton structures.

several numerical approaches previously proposed to model equilibrium

Numerical solutions are compared to analytic predictions, enabling a

indicate that static finite element approaches are highly sensitive to initial

is the consequence of a steady decrease in the intrinsic spread of cluster RRL

weighted mean visual apparent magnitude of 44 cluster RRLs is
$\left<V\right>=13.329\pm0.001$ (standard error of the mean) $\pm$0.177

to fix the zero-point of the empirical PL and PW relations. Using the entire
sample (FU$+$FO) we found weighted mean true distance moduli of
11.35$\pm$0.03$\pm$0.05 mag and 11.32$\pm$0.02$\pm$0.07 mag. Distances were
also evaluated using predicted metallicity dependent PLZ and PWZ relations. We
found weighted mean true distance moduli of 11.283$\pm$0.010$\pm$0.018 mag (NIR
PLZ) and 11.272$\pm$0.005$\pm$0.019 mag (optical--NIR and NIR PWZ). The above
weighted mean true distance moduli agree within 1$\sigma$. The same result is
found from distances based on PWZ relations in which the color index is
independent of the adopted magnitude (11.272$\pm$0.004$\pm$0.013 mag). These
distances agree quite well with the geometric distance provided by

analytic work and numerical simulations showing that a substantial level of
magnetic field diffusion at high densities has to occur in order to form
rotationally supported disks. Furthermore, newly formed accretion disks are
threaded by the magnetic field dragged from the parent core during the
gravitational collapse. These disks are expected to rotate with a sub-Keplerian
speed because they are partially supported by magnetic tension against the
gravity of the central star. We discuss how sub-Keplerian rotation makes it
difficult to eject disk winds and accelerates the process of planet migration.
Moreover, magnetic fields modify the Toomre criterion for gravitational
instability via two opposing effects: magnetic tension and pressure increase
the disk local stability, but sub-Keplerian rotation makes the disk more
unstable. In general, magnetized disks are more stable than their nonmagnetic
counterparts; thus, they can be more massive and less prone to the formation of
giant planets by gravitational instability.

independent set in a graph. It is easy to (greedily) construct a maximal
independent set. However, it is NP-hard to construct a globally-optimal
(maximum) independent set. In general, constructing a locally-optimal structure
is somewhat more difficult than constructing an arbitrary structure, and
constructing a globally-optimal structure is more difficult than constructing a
locally-optimal structure. The same situation arises with listing. The
differences between the problems become obscured when we move from listing to
counting because nearly everything is #P-complete. However, we highlight an
interesting phenomenon that arises in approximate counting, where the situation
is apparently reversed. Specifically, we show that counting maximal independent
sets is complete for #P with respect to approximation-preserving reductions,
whereas counting all independent sets, or counting maximum independent sets is
complete for an apparently smaller class, $\mathrm{\#RH}\Pi_1$ which has a
prominent role in the complexity of approximate counting. Motivated by the
difficulty of approximately counting maximal independent sets in bipartite
graphs, we also study the problem of approximately counting other
locally-optimal structures that arise in algorithmic applications, particularly
problems involving minimal separators and minimal edge separators. Minimal
separators have applications via fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms for
constructing triangulations and phylogenetic trees. Although exact
(exponential-time) algorithms exist for listing these structures, we show that
the counting problems are #P-complete with respect to both exact and

In a previous work we presented a compliant skin system based on capacitive
technology consisting of triangular modules interconnected to form a system of
sensors that can be deployed on non-flat surfaces. This solution has been
successfully adopted to cover various humanoid robots. The main limitation of
this and all the approaches based on capacitive technology is that they require
to embed a deformable dielectric layer (usually made using an elastomer)
covered by a conductive layer. This complicates the production process
considerably, introduces hysteresis and limits the durability of the sensors
due to ageing and mechanical stress.
  In this paper we describe a novel solution in which the dielectric is made
using a thin layer of 3D fabric which is glued to conductive and protective
layers using techniques adopted in the clothing industry. As such, the sensor
is easier to produce and has better mechanical properties. Furthermore, the
sensor proposed in this paper embeds transducers for thermal compensation of
the pressure measurements. We report experimental analysis that demonstrates
that the sensor has good properties in terms of sensitivity and resolution.
Remarkably we show that the sensor has very low hysteresis and effectively
allows compensating drifts due to temperature variations.

older than the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance and has been given
several names before its final 'Baldwin effect' label. A condition for this
effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic plasticity
or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a population. This
gives the necessary time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and
the adaptive trait can be eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential
paper published in the late 1980s showed the Baldwin effect to happen in
computer simulations, and claimed that it was crucial to solve a difficult
adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various
disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary
emergence of high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language
almost hopeless. Here, we use analytical and computational approaches to show
that a standard population genetics treatment can easily crack what the
scientific community has granted as an unsolvable adaptive problem without

that the following simple strategies are always optimal: for Interval
Patrolling, the simple strategy partitions the fence into subintervals, one for

a number r, place the r fastest agents equidistantly around the circle, and

left-right squarks mixing, the conventional knowledge is that the Higgs Boson
mass around 125 GeV leads to top squark masses ${\cal O}(10)$ TeV, far beyond
the reach of colliders. Here, we pointed out that this conclusion is subject to
several theoretical uncertainties. We find that electroweak symmetry breaking
and evaluation of Higgs mass at a scale far away from the true electroweak
symmetry breaking scale introduce a large uncertainty in Higgs mass
calculation. We show that the electroweak symmetry breaking at the scale near
the true vacuum expectation value of Higgs field can increase the Higgs Boson
mass about 4-5 GeV and can lower the bounds on squarks and slepton masses to 1
TeV. Here we pointed out that the Higgs mass even with inclusion of radiative
corrections can vary with electroweak symmetry breaking scale. We calculate it
at two loop level and show that it varies substantially. We argue that Higgs
mass like other coupling parameters can vary with energy scale and the Higgs
potential with all orders loop corrections is scale invariant. This uncertainty
to the Higgs mass calculation due to electroweak symmetry breaking around the
supersymmetry breaking scale, normally taken as $\sqrt{m_{\tilde t_L} m_{\tilde
t_R}}$, to minimize the 1-loop radiative corrections can be removed if one
considers all significant radiative contributions to make Higgs potential
renormalization group evolution scale invariant and evaluates electroweak
symmetry breaking at the scale near the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. A
large parameter space becomes allowed when one considers electroweak symmetry
breaking at its true scale not only for producing correct values of the Higgs
masses, but also for providing successful breaking of this symmetry in more
parameter spaces.

from the analysis of the shape of magnetoconductivity curves for the relatively
low conductivity when the Fermi level lies in the monotonic part of the energy
spectrum of the valence band behaves itself analogously to that observed in
narrow HgTe quantum wells of electron-type conductivity. It increases in
magnitude with the increasing conductivity and decreasing temperature following
the $1/T$ law. Such a behavior corresponds to the inelasticity of
electron-electron interaction as the main mechanism of the phase relaxation and
agrees well with the theoretical predictions. For the higher conductivity,
despite the fact that the dephasing time remains inversely proportional to the
temperature, it strongly decreases with the increasing conductivity. It is
presumed that a nonmonotonic character of the hole energy spectrum could be the

method outperforms the uniform node sampling for estimating heavy tails of
degree distributions, while the opposite tendency is observed in the range of
small degrees. In order to take advantages of both sampling methods, we devise
the hybrid method that successfully recovers the whole range of degree
distributions. Our tail-scope method shows how structural heterogeneities of
large-scale complex networks can be used to effectively reveal the network
structure only with limited local information.

synchronization in star graphs. We show that in the thermodynamic limit the

across the membrane. The charges on the capacitor exert a force on the membrane
that leads to electrostriction, i.e. a thinning of the membrane. Since the
force is quadratic in voltage, negative and positive voltage have an identical
influence on the physics of symmetric membranes. However, this is not the case
for a membrane with an asymmetry leading to a permanent electric polarization.
Positive and negative voltages of identical magnitude lead to different
properties. Such an asymmetry can originate from a lipid composition that is
different on the two monolayers of the membrane, or from membrane curvature.
The latter effect is called 'flexoelectricity'. As a consequence of permanent
polarization, the membrane capacitor is discharged at a voltage different from
zero. This leads to interesting electrical phenomena such as outward or inward
rectification of membrane permeability.
  Here, we introduce a generalized theoretical framework, that treats
capacitance, polarization, flexoelectricity and piezoelectricity in the same

perspective, the known higher-derivative theories of 3D massive gravity, like
Topologically Massive Gravity and New Massive Gravity, can be extended to a

energy for the massive spin-2 mode. We discuss the construction of several of
these improved models in detail and derive the necessary constraints needed to
remove any unphysical degree of freedom. We also comment on the AdS/LCFT

is replaced by a logarithmic mode. Most of the results have been published

how to enhance the magnitude of the electric polarization through chemical
substitution of the $A$-site while retaining long-range magnetic order. We find
that the electric polarization can be enhanced by up to 150\% in compounds
which maximize the difference in the ionic size of the $A$ and $A^{\prime}$

distortions (described by symmetry-adapted modes) of the nine compounds, we
identify the atomic scale features that are strongly correlated with the ionic

each compound exhibits a purely electronic remnant polarization, even in the
absence of a displacive polar mode. The analysis and design strategies
presented here can be further extended to additional members of this family

octahedrally-coordinated PdTe2 chains along the crystallographic b axis.
Measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific
heat on the Ta4Pd3Te16 crystals, grown via a self-flux method, consistently
demonstrate bulk superconductivity at 4.6 K. Further analyses of the data
indicate significant electron-electron interaction, which allows electronic
Cooper pairing in the present system.

channels, which has received increasing attention due to its high energy
efficiency and low computational complexity for wireless communications. In
this paper, we present two contributions on time-reversal (TR) wireless
beamforming for single-user indoor wideband MISO systems. First, we provide
novel analyses of a baseband TR system using two commonly used indoor
propagation channel models. We derive closed-form approximations for the
inter-symbol interference (ISI) with these channel models in order to
characterize the influence of propagation conditions (such as the power-delay
profile, delay spread, and bandwidth) on TR performance metrics. In particular,
we analyze spatial focusing and time compression performance of TR beamforming,
and their impact on the bit error rate (BER). As a second contribution, we
introduce an equalized TR (ETR) technique that mitigates the ISI of
conventional TR. The proposed ETR utilizes a zero-forcing pre-equalizer at the
transmitter in a cascade configuration with the TR pre-filter. Unlike previous
approaches to ISI mitigation in TR systems, we derive theoretical performance
bounds for ETR and show that it greatly enhances the BER performance of
conventional TR with minimal impact to its beamforming capabilities. By means
of numerical simulations, we verify our closed-form approximations and show
that the proposed ETR technique outperforms conventional TR with respect to the
BER under any SNR.

(EoS) parameter $w_{\rm de}$ in order to evaluate the effects of the dark
energy component on structure formation in the universe. We first calculate the
evolution of density perturbations in the linear regime for both phantom and
quintessence behavior of the HDE model and compare the results with standard
Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) and $\Lambda$CDM models. We then calculate the
evolution of two characterizing parameters in the spherical collapse model,
i.e., the linear density threshold $\delta_{\rm c}$ and the virial overdensity
parameter $\Delta_{\rm vir}$. We show that in HDE cosmologies the growth factor
$g(a)$ and the linear overdensity parameter $\delta_{\rm c}$ fall behind the
values for a $\Lambda$CDM universe while the virial overdensity $\Delta_{\rm
vir}$ is larger in HDE models than in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that
the ratio between the radius of the spherical perturbations at the
virialization and turn-around time is smaller in HDE cosmologies than that
predicted in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Hence the growth of structures starts
earlier in HDE models than in $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies and more concentrated
objects can form in this case. It has been shown that the non-vanishing surface
pressure leads to smaller virial radius and larger virial overdensity
$\Delta_{\rm vir}$. We compare the predicted number of halos in HDE cosmologies
and find out that in general this value is smaller than for $\Lambda$CDM models
at higher redshifts and we compare different mass function prescriptions.
Finally, we compare the results of the HDE models with observations.

inertial particles and to general relativity, we come back to the definition of
Lie group of Lorentz matrices and its Lie algebra and we study how this group
acts on the Minskowski space. We thus define the notion of tangent boost along
a worldline. This notion very general notion gives a useful tool both in
special relativity (for non inertial particles or/and for non rectilinear
coordinates) and in general relativity. We also introduce a matrix of the Lie
algebra which, together with the tangent boost, gives the whole dynamical
description of the considered system (acceleration and Thomas rotation). After
studying the properties of Lie algebra matrices and of their reduced forms, we
show that the Lie group of special Lorentz matrices has four one-parameter
subgroups. These tools lead us to introduce the Thomas rotation in a quite
general way. At the end of the paper, we present some examples using these
tools and we consider the case of an electron rotating on a circular orbit
around an atom nucleus. We then discuss the twin paradox and we show that when
the one who made a journey into space in a high-speed rocket returns home he is
not only younger than the twin who stayed on Earth but he is also disorientated
because his gyroscope has turned with respect to earth referential frame.

canonical intermediate inflation, our non-canonical model is compatible with
the observational results of Planck 2015. Also, we estimate the equilateral
non-Gaussianity parameter which is in well agreement with the prediction of
Planck 2015. Then, we obtain an approximation for the energy scale at the
initial time of inflation and show that it can be of order of the Planck energy
scale, i.e. ${M_P} \sim {10^{18}}\,{\rm{GeV}}$. We will see that after a short
period of time, inflation enters in the slow-roll regime that its energy scale
is of order ${M_P}/100 \sim \;{10^{16}}{\rm{GeV}}$ and the horizon exit takes
place in this energy scale. We also examine an idea in our non-canonical model
to overcome the central drawback of intermediate inflation which is the fact
that inflation never ends. We solve this problem without disturbing
significantly the nature of the intermediate inflation until the time of
horizon exit.

during the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization survey of the Q/U Imaging
Experiment (QUIET), operating at 43 GHz (Q-band) and 95 GHz (W-band). We
examine sources selected at 20 GHz from the public, $>$40 mJy catalog of the
Australia Telescope (AT20G) survey. There are $\sim$480 such sources within
QUIET's four low-foreground survey patches, including the nearby radio galaxies
Centaurus A and Pictor A. The median error on our polarized flux density
measurements is 30--40 mJy per Stokes parameter. At S/N $> 3$ significance, we
detect linear polarization for seven sources in Q-band and six in W-band; only
$1.3 \pm 1.1$ detections per frequency band are expected by chance. For sources
without a detection of polarized emission, we find that half of the sources
have polarization amplitudes below 90 mJy (Q-band) and 106 mJy (W-band), at 95%
confidence. Finally, we compare our polarization measurements to intensity and
polarization measurements of the same sources from the literature. For the four
sources with WMAP and Planck intensity measurements $>1$ Jy, the polarization
fraction are above 1% in both QUIET bands. At high significance, we compute
polarization fractions as much as 10--20% for some sources, but the effects of
source variability may cut that level in half for contemporaneous comparisons.
Our results indicate that simple models---ones that scale a fixed polarization
fraction with frequency---are inadequate to model the behavior of these sources
and their contributions to polarization maps.

treatment, with slow growth often being associated with decreased
susceptibility. Yet in many cases the connection between antibiotic
susceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for
ribosome-targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay
exists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within
this class faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other
antibiotics the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be
explained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and
binding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth-dependent
susceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the
`reversibility' of antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a
spectrum-classification of antibiotic growth-dependent efficacy that appears to
correspond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these
limits the model predicts universal, parameter-free limiting forms for growth
inhibition curves. The model also leads to non-trivial predictions for the drug
susceptibility of a translation-mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify
experimentally. Drug action and bacterial metabolism are mechanistically
complex; nevertheless this study illustrates how coarse-grained models can be
used to integrate pathogen physiology into drug design and treatment
strategies.
