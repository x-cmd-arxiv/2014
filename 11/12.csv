of recognizing a new visual concept (e.g., chair, dog) by learning from only
very few positive instances taught by parent(s) or others, and this recognition
capability can be gradually further improved by exploring and/or interacting
with the real instances in the physical world. Inspired by these observations,
we propose a computational model for slightly-supervised object detection,
based on prior knowledge modelling, exemplar learning and learning with video
contexts. The prior knowledge is modeled with a pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). When very few instances of a new concept are given, an
initial concept detector is built by exemplar learning over the deep features
from the pre-trained CNN. Simulating the baby's interaction with physical
world, the well-designed tracking solution is then used to discover more
diverse instances from the massive online unlabeled videos. Once a positive
instance is detected/identified with high score in each video, more variable
instances possibly from different view-angles and/or different distances are
tracked and accumulated. Then the concept detector can be fine-tuned based on
these new instances. This process can be repeated again and again till we
obtain a very mature concept detector. Extensive experiments on Pascal
VOC-07/10/12 object detection datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. It can beat the state-of-the-art full-training based
performances by learning from very few samples for each object category, along
with about 20,000 unlabeled videos.

time-division multiple access (TDMA) of the shared medium without requiring
clock synchronization amongst the wireless sensors, or indeed the presence of a
central (coordinator) node. All such methods are based on the principle of
reactive listening of periodic ""fire"" or ""pulse"" broadcasts: each node updates
the time of its fire message broadcasts based on received fire messages from
some of the remaining nodes sharing the given spectrum. In this paper, we
present a novel framework to estimate the required iterations for convergence
to fair TDMA scheduling. Our estimates are fundamentally different from
previous conjectures or bounds found in the literature as, for the first time,
convergence to TDMA is defined in a stochastic sense. Our analytic results
apply to the Desync algorithm and to pulse-coupled oscillator algorithms with
inhibitory coupling. The experimental evaluation via iMote2 TinyOS nodes (based
on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard) as well as via computer simulations demonstrates
that, for the vast majority of settings, our stochastic model is within one
standard deviation from the experimentally-observed convergence iterations. The
proposed estimates are thus shown to characterize the desynchronization
convergence iterations significantly better than existing conjectures or
bounds. Therefore, they contribute towards the analytic understanding of how a
desynchronization-based system is expected to evolve from random initial
conditions to the desynchronized steady state.

unity changes the next-to-leading order correction that the calculation is

there may be no routes between some source-destination pairs, or packets may
get stuck in a routing loop as the protocol operates to establish new routes.
In this article, we address these weaknesses by describing mechanisms to choose
alternate next hops.
  Our first contribution is to model the scenario as the following {\sc tree
augmentation} problem. Consider a mixed graph where some edges are directed and
some undirected. The directed edges form a spanning tree pointing towards the
common destination node. Each directed edge represents the unique next hop in
the routing protocol. Our goal is to direct the undirected edges so that the
resulting graph remains acyclic and the number of nodes with outdegree two or
more is maximized. These nodes represent those with alternative next hops in
their routing paths.
  We show that {\sc tree augmentation} is NP-hard in general and present a
simple $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm. We also study 3 special cases. We
give exact polynomial-time algorithms for when the input spanning tree consists
of exactly 2 directed paths or when the input graph has bounded treewidth. For
planar graphs, we present a polynomial-time approximation scheme when the input
tree is a breadth-first search tree. To the best of our knowledge, {\sc tree

Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) 400\,kV accelerator deep underground in the Gran
Sasso laboratory, Italy, is reported. The ion beam induced $\gamma$-ray

of the $E_{\rm p}$ = 186\,keV resonance in a direct experiment. An experimental
lower limit of 0.12\,$\times$\,10$^{-6}$\,eV has been obtained for the
resonance strength. Informed by the feasibility study, a dedicated experimental
setup for the $^{22}$Ne(p,$\gamma$)$^{23}$Na experiment has been developed. The
new setup has been characterized by a study of the temperature and pressure
profiles. The beam heating effect that reduces the effective neon gas density
due to the heating by the incident proton beam has been studied using the
resonance scan technique, and the size of this effect has been determined for a
neon gas target.

and provide the general formula for the energy shortage probability. We also
give some examples as benchmarks. Then, we continue to derive a closed-form
expression for infinite-horizon transmission, which is a lower bound for the
energy shortage probability of any finite-horizon transmission. These results
are proposed for both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels.
Moreover, we show that even under \emph{random energy arrival}, one can
transmit at a fixed rate equal to capacity in the AWGN channels with negligible
aggregate shortage time. We achieve this result using our practical
transmission schemes, proposed for finite-horizon. Also, comprehensive
numerical simulations are performed in AWGN and fading channels with no Channel
State Information (CSI) available at the transmitter, which corroborate our
theoretical findings. Furthermore, we improve the performance of our
transmission schemes in the fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter by
optimizing the transmission initiation threshold.

lower energies, and we investigate whether or not reacceleration can explain
the observed variation of radio spectral indices. We explicitely calculate the
momentum diffusion coefficient for 3 types of turbulence expected downstream of
the forward shock: fast-mode waves, small-scale non-resonant modes, and
large-scale modes arising from turbulent dynamo activity. Noting that
low-energy particles are efficiently coupled to the quasi-thermal plasma, a
simplified cosmic-ray transport equation can be formulated and is numerically
solved. Only fast-mode waves can provide momentum diffusion fast enough to
significantly modify the spectra of particles. Using a synchrotron emissivity
that accurately reflects a highly turbulent magnetic field, we calculate the
radio spectral index and find that soft spectra with index $\alpha\lesssim
-0.6$ can be maintained over more than 2 decades in radio frequency, even if
the electrons experience reacceleration for only one acceleration time. A
spectral hardening is possible but considerably more frequency-dependent. The
spectral modification imposed by stochastic reacceleration downstream of the
forward shock depends only weakly on the initial spectrum provided by, e.g.,
diffusive shock acceleration at the shock itself.

decay of tritium or other isotope is to measure the shape of the electron
spectrum near the endpoint. It has been known for 30 years that a similar
distortion of the ""visible energy"" remaining after electron capture is caused
by neutrino mass. There has been a resurgence of interest in using this method
with 163-Ho. Recent theoretical analyses offer reassurance that there are no
significant theoretical uncertainties. We show that the situation is, however,
more complicated, and that the spectrum shape is presently not well enough
understood to permit a sensitive determination of the neutrino mass in this
way. The theoretical analyses consider only single vacancy states in the
daughter 163-Dy atom. It is necessary to consider configurations with more than
one vacancy that can be populated owing to the change in nuclear charge. The
shakeup and shakeoff theory of Carlson and Nestor is used as a basis for
estimating the population of double-vacancy states. A spectrum of satellites
associated with each primary vacancy created by electron capture is presented.
The theory of the calorimetric spectrum is more complicated than has been
described heretofore. There are numerous shakeup and shakeoff satellites
present across the spectrum, and some may be very near the endpoint.

the star was identified as RRd star - double-mode pulsator, pulsating
simultaneously in the fundamental and in the first overtone modes. We find that
third mode is excited and firmly detect its period doubling. Period ratios are
not far from that expected for triple-mode - fundamental, first and third
overtone - pulsation. Unfortunately, we cannot reproduce period ratios of the
three modes with a consistent set of pulsation models. Therefore the other
interpretation, that additional mode is non-radial, is also likely.

the Janis-Newman algorithm can be generalized in order to include a NUT charge
and another parameter $c$, in addition to the angular momentum. Moreover it was
proved that only a NUT charge can be added for non-vanishing cosmological
constant. However despite the fact that the form of the coordinate
transformations was obtained, it was not explained how to perform the
complexification on the metric function, and the procedure does not follow
directly from the usual Janis-Newman rules. The goal of our paper is threefold:
explain the hidden assumptions of Demia\'nski's analysis, generalize the
computations to topological horizons (spherical and hyperbolic) and to charged
solutions, and explain how to perform the complexification of the function. In
particular we present a new solution which is an extension of the Demia\'nski
metric to hyperbolic horizons. These different results open the door to
applications in (gauged) supergravity since they allow for a systematic
application of the Demia\'nski-Janis-Newman algorithm.

reducible degenerate Grassmann-graded Lagrangian theory of even and odd
variables on graded bundles. Such Lagrangian theory is characterized by a
hierarchy of non-trivial higher-stage Noether identities and the corresponding
higher-stage gauge symmetries which are described in the homology terms. In
these terms, the second Noether theorems associate to the Koszul - Tate chain
complex of higher-stage Noether identities the gauge cochain sequence whose
ascent operator provides higher-order gauge symmetries of Lagrangian theory. If
gauge symmetries are algebraically closed, this operator is extended to the
nilpotent BRST operator which brings the gauge cochain sequence into the BRST
complex. In this framework, the first Noether theorem is formulated as a
straightforward corollary of the first variational formula. It associates to
any variational Lagrangian symmetry the conserved current whose total
differential vanishes on-shell. We prove in a general setting that a conserved
current of a gauge symmetry is reduced to a total differential on-shell. The
physically relevant examples of gauge theory on principal bundles, gauge
gravitational theory on natural bundles, topological Chern - Simons field
theory and topological BF theory are present. The last one exemplifies a
reducible Lagrangian system.

Camera 3 instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We study the
wavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 $\mu$m
and 1.7 $\mu$m. We find that the water absorption bands of the two L5 dwarfs at
1.15 $\mu$m and 1.4 $\mu$m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacent
continuum. This differs from the results of previous HST observations of L/T
transition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m displays
variations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. We find that
the relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respect
to that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the L5 dwarfs toward
the early T dwarfs. We utilize the models of Saumon & Marley (2008) and find
that the observed variability of the L5 dwarfs can be explained by the presence
of spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds.
Therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers - the
driver of the variability - must be located at very low pressures, where even
the water opacity is negligible. In the near future, the rotational spectral
mapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species to
probe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and
exoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.

for non-uniform input arrival times. This problem arises whenever the adder is
embedded into a more complex circuit, e. g. a multiplier.
  Most previous results are based on representing binary carry-propagate adders
as so-called parallel prefix graphs, in which pairs of generate and propagate
signals are combined using complex gates known as prefix gates. Adders
constructed in this model usually minimize the delay in terms of these prefix
gates. However, the delay in terms of logic gates can be worse by a factor of
two.
  In contrast, we aim to minimize the delay of the underlying logic circuit
directly. We prove a lower bound on the delay of a carry bit computation
achievable by any prefix carry bit circuit and develop an algorithm that
computes a prefix carry bit circuit with optimum delay up to a small additive
constant. Furthermore, we use this algorithm to construct a small parallel
prefix adder.
  Compared to existing algorithms we simultaneously improve the delay and size

non-trivial kinematic domain. We find that the amplitudes in spontaneously
broken gauge theories grow factorially with the numbers of particles produced,
and that this factorial growth is only mildly affected by the energy-dependent
formfactor computed in the non-relativistic limit. This is reminiscent of the
behaviour previously found in massive scalar theories. Cross sections are
obtained by integrating the amplitudes squared over the non-relativistic

TeV range if we use the non-relativistic high multiplicity limit. This signals
a breakdown of perturbation theory and indicates that the weak sector of the

at ~12'' resolution. For the first time in the far-IR domain, we spatially
resolve the emission associated with the bright H2 shocked regions ""Peak 1"" and
""Peak 2"" from that of the Hot Core and ambient cloud. We analyze the ~54-310um
spectra taken with the PACS and SPIRE spectrometers. More than 100 lines are
detected, most of them rotationally excited lines of 12CO (up to J=48-47), H2O,
OH, 13CO, and HCN. Peaks 1/2 are characterized by a very high
L(CO)/L(FIR)~5x10^{-3} ratio and a plethora of far-IR H2O emission lines. The
high-J CO and OH lines are a factor ~2 brighter toward Peak 1 whereas several
excited H2O lines are ~50% brighter toward Peak 2. A simplified non-LTE model
allowed us to constrain the dominant gas temperature components. Most of the CO
column density arises from Tk~200-500 K gas that we associate with low-velocity
shocks that fail to sputter grain ice mantles and show a maximum gas-phase
H2O/CO~10^{-2} abundance ratio. In addition, the very excited CO (J>35) and H2O
lines reveal a hotter gas component (Tk~2500 K) from faster (v_S>25 km/s)
shocks that are able to sputter the frozen-out H2O and lead to high H2O/CO>~1
abundance ratios. The H2O and OH luminosities cannot be reproduced by shock
models that assume high (undepleted) abundances of atomic oxygen in the
preshock gas and/or neglect the presence of UV radiation in the postshock gas.
Although massive outflows are a common feature in other massive star-forming
cores, Orion BN/KL seems more peculiar because of its higher molecular
luminosities and strong outflows caused by a recent explosive event.

  generalized simulated annealing",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The throughout knowledge of a X-ray beam spectrum is mandatory to assess the
quality of its source device. Since the techniques to directly measurement such
spectra are expensive and laborious, the X-ray spectrum reconstruction using
attenuation data has been a promising alternative. However, such reconstruction
corresponds mathematically to an inverse, nonlinear and ill-posed problem.
Therefore, to solve it the use of powerful optimization algorithms and good
regularization functions is required. Here, we present a generalized simulated
annealing algorithm combined with a suitable smoothing regularization function
to solve the X-ray spectrum reconstruction inverse problem. We also propose an
approach to set the initial acceptance and visitation temperatures and a
standardization of the objective function terms to automatize the algorithm to
address with different spectra range. Numerical tests considering three
different reference spectra with its attenuation curve are presented. Results
show that the algorithm provides good accuracy to retrieve the reference
spectra shapes corroborating the central importance of our regularization
function and the performance improvement of the generalized simulated annealing
compared to its classical version.

  process. Section 4.1.1 expanded",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this work is to describe a unified, and indeed simple,
mechanism for non-parametric Bayesian analysis, construction and generative
sampling of a large class of latent feature models which one can describe as
generalized notions of Indian Buffet Processes(IBP). This is done via the
Poisson Process Calculus as it now relates to latent feature models. The IBP
was ingeniously devised by Griffiths and Ghahramani in (2005) and its
generative scheme is cast in terms of customers entering sequentially an Indian
Buffet restaurant and selecting previously sampled dishes as well as new
dishes. In this metaphor dishes corresponds to latent features, attributes,
preferences shared by individuals. The IBP, and its generalizations, represent
an exciting class of models well suited to handle high dimensional statistical
problems now common in this information age. The IBP is based on the usage of
conditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, coupled with completely
random measures acting as Bayesian priors, that are used to create sparse
binary matrices. This Bayesian non-parametric view was a key insight due to
Thibaux and Jordan (2007). One way to think of generalizations is to to use
more general random variables. Of note in the current literature are models
employing Poisson and Negative-Binomial random variables. However, unlike their
closely related counterparts, generalized Chinese restaurant processes, the
ability to analyze IBP models in a systematic and general manner is not yet
available. The limitations are both in terms of knowledge about the effects of
different priors and in terms of models based on a wider choice of random
variables. This work will not only provide a thorough description of the
properties of existing models but also provide a simple template to devise and
analyze new models.

even if the gas has thousands of particles. Quantum systems composed of two and
three particles with attractive zero\=/range pairwise interactions are
considered for general masses and interaction strengths in two and three
dimensions (2D and 3D). The Faddeev decomposition is used to derive the
equations for the bound state, which is the starting point for the
investigation of universal properties of few\=/body systems, i.e. those that
all potentials with the same physics at low energy are able to describe in a
model\=/independent form. In 2D, the number of bound states in a three\=/body
system increases without bound as the mass of one particle becomes much lighter
than the other two. The analytic form of an effective potential between the
heavy particles explains the mass\=/dependence on the number of bound energy
levels. An exact analytic expression for the large\=/momentum asymptotic
behaviour of the spectator function in the Faddeev equation is presented. The
spectator function and its asymptotic form define the two- and three\=/body
contact parameters. The two\=/body parameter is found to be independent of the
quantum state in some specific 2D systems. The 2D and 3D momentum distributions
have a distinct sub\=/leading form whereas the 3D term depends on the mass of

sharp transition in the energy spectrum of three-body systems is found.

shape space built upon existing shapes. While this approach has proven to be
successful in various applications, a challenging issue remains, i.e., the
joint estimation of shape parameters and camera-pose parameters requires to
solve a nonconvex optimization problem. The existing methods often adopt an
alternating minimization scheme to locally update the parameters, and
consequently the solution is sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we
propose a convex formulation to address this problem and develop an efficient
algorithm to solve the proposed convex program. We demonstrate the exact
recovery property of the proposed method, its merits compared to alternative
methods, and the applicability in human pose and car shape estimation.

from spectrally agile cognitive radios with novel spectrum sharing, to use of

diverse access technologies, referred to as heterogeneous networks (HetNets).
Simultaneously, advances in electronics and storage, has led to the advent of
wireless devices equipped with multiple radio interfaces (e.g. WiFi, WiMAX,
LTE, etc.) and the ability to store and efficiently process large amounts of
data. Motivated by the convergence of HetNets and multi-platform radios, we
propose HetNetwork Coding as a means to utilize the available radio interfaces
in parallel along with network coding to increase wireless data throughput.
Specifically we explore the use of random linear network coding at the network
layer where packets can travel through multiple interfaces and be received via
multihoming. Using both simulations and experimentation with real hardware on
WiFi and WiMAX platforms, we study the scaling of throughput enabled by such
HetNetwork coding. We find from our simulations and experiments that the use of
this method increases the throughput, with greater gains achieved for cases
when the system is heavily loaded or the channel quality is poor. Our results
also reveal that the throughput gains achieved scale linearly with the number
of radio interfaces at the nodes.

engineering, scientists have pondered for centuries how to improve their
resolution and the existence of fundamental resolution limits. In recent years,
a new class of microscopes that overcome a long-held belief about the
resolution have revolutionized biological imaging. Termed ""superresolution""
microscopy, these techniques work by accurately locating optical point sources
from far field. To investigate the fundamental localization limits, here I
derive quantum lower bounds on the error of locating point sources in free
space, taking full account of the quantum, nonparaxial, and vectoral nature of
photons. These bounds are valid for any measurement technique, as long as it
obeys quantum mechanics, and serve as general no-go theorems for the resolution
of microscopes. To arrive at analytic results, I focus mainly on the cases of
one and two classical monochromatic sources with an initial vacuum optical
state. For one source, a lower bound on the root-mean-square position
estimation error is on the order of $\lambda_0/\sqrt{N}$, where $\lambda_0$ is
the free-space wavelength and $N$ is the average number of radiated photons.
For two sources, owing to the statistical effect of nuisance parameters, the
error bound diverges when their radiated fields overlap significantly. The use
of squeezed light to enhance further the accuracy of locating one classical
point source and the localization limits for partially coherent sources and
single-photon sources are also discussed. The presented theory establishes a
rigorous quantum statiscal inference framework for the study of superresolution
microscopy and points to the possibility of using quantum techniques for true
resolution enhancement.

  In two- and three-wave diffraction cases, the peak intensity of cooperative
radiation emitted at small and large angles to particle velocity is
investigated as a function of the particle number in an electron bunch. The
peak radiation intensity appeared to increase monotonically until saturation is
achieved. At saturation, the shot noise causes strong fluctuations in the
intensity of cooperative parametric radiation.
  It is shown that the duration of radiation pulses can be much longer than the
particle flight time through the crystal. This enables a thorough experimental
investigation of the time structure of cooperative parametric radiation
generated by electron bunches available with modern accelerators.
  The complicated time structure of cooperative parametric (quasi-Cherenkov)

body of literature demonstrates the value of considering differences in

analyzing intra-individual variability, particularly when variability is
treated as a predictor. In the present article, we first reviewed methods of
analyzing intra-individual variability as an outcome, including the individual

Bayesian method for analyzing intra-individual variability as a predictor. To
make this method easily accessible to the research community, we developed an
open source R package, VARIAN. To compare the accuracy of parameter estimates
using the proposed Bayesian analysis against the ISD as a predictor in a
regression, we carried out a simulation study. We then demonstrated, using
empirical data, how the estimated intra-individual variability derived from the
proposed Bayesian analysis can be used to answer the following two questions:
(1) is intra-individual variability in daily time-in-bed associated with
subjective sleep quality? (2) does subjective sleep quality mediate the
association between time-in-bed variability and depressive symptoms? We
concluded with a discussion of methodological and practical considerations that
can help guide researchers in choosing methods for evaluating intra-individual

sources are easy to identify since the angular separation of their lobes
remains almost constant at some tens of arcseconds for z>1. Using a simple
algorithm applied to the FIRST survey, we obtain the largest FRII sample to

meaningful description of the fraction of quasars with lobes as a function of
redshift and luminosity. This relation is combined with the bolometric quasar
luminosity function, as derived from surveys at IR to hard X-ray frequencies,
and a disc-lobe correlation to obtain a robust prediction for the density of
FRIIs on the radio sky. We find that the observed density can be explained by
the population of known quasars, implying that the majority of powerful jets
originate from a radiatively efficient accretion flow with a linear jet-disc

in order to understand complex substructures and separate populations. We use
line-strength indices to derive SSP-equivalent ages and metallicities.
Additionally, we use full spectral fitting methods, here the code STECKMAP, to
extract their star formation histories. The high quality of our data allows us
to study the 2D distribution of different stellar populations (i.e. young,
intermediate, and old). We can identify their dominant populations based on
these age-discriminated 2D light and mass contribution. In all galactic bulges
studied, at least 50% of the stellar mass already existed 10 Gyrs ago, more
than currently predicted by simulations. A younger component (age between 1 to
8 Gyrs) is also prominent and its present day distribution seems to be affected
much more strongly by morphological structures, especially bars, than the older

increasing complexity in their evolution, likely to be found in numerous bulge

an open question, largely due to a dearth of observational constraints. Here,
we present a new, nearly-simultaneous broadband spectrum of the black hole
X-ray binary (BHXB) XTE J1118+480 at an extremely low Eddington ratio
(L_x~1e-8.5 L_Edd). Our new spectral energy distribution (SED) includes the
radio, near-infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands. XTE J1118 is
now the second BHXB at such a low Eddington ratio with a well-sampled SED,
providing new constraints on highly sub-Eddington accretion flows and jets, and
opening the door for comparison studies. We apply a multi-zone jet model to the
new broadband SED, and we compare our results to previous fits to the same
source using the same model at 4-5 decades higher luminosity. We find that
after a BHXB transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state, the jet
base becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler
(by at least a factor of two). Our preferred model fit indicates that jet
particle acceleration is weaker after the transition into quiescence. That is,
accelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high enough Lorentz factors
to contribute significant amounts of synchrotron X-ray emission. Instead, the
X-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission from a
population of mildly relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocity
distribution associated with the jet base. The corresponding (thermal)
synchrotron component emits primarily in the infrared through ultraviolet
wavebands. Our results on XTE J1118 are consistent with broadband modeling for
A0620-00 and for Sgr A*. The above could therefore represent a canonical
baseline geometry for accreting black holes in quiescence. We conclude with
suggestions for future studies to further investigate the above scenario.

and provide fits to these relations, between Herschel luminosities and the
total gas mass integrated over entire galaxies, with the tightest, almost
linear, correlation found for the longest wavelength data (SPIRE500). However,
we find that accounting for the gas-phase metallicity (affecting the
dust-to-gas ratio) is crucial when applying these relations to low-mass, and
presumably high-redshift, galaxies. The molecular (H2) gas mass is found to be
better correlated with the peak of the IR emission (e.g. PACS160), driven
mostly by the correlation of stellar mass and mean dust temperature. When
examining these relations as a function of galactocentric radius we find the
same correlations, albeit with a larger scatter, up to a radius of 0.7 r_25
(within which most of the galaxy's baryonic mass resides). However, beyond this
radius the same correlations no longer hold, with the gas mass (predominantly
HI) increasing relative to the infrared emission. The tight relations found for
the bulk of the galaxy's baryonic content suggest that the total gas masses of

find the scatter in this relationship has a correctable dependence on color.
For individual AGN, the size of the Hbeta emitting region has a steeper
dependence on the nuclear optical luminosity than on the UV luminosity, that
can introduce a scatter of ~0.08 dex into the global relationship, due the
non-linear relationship between the variations in the ionizing continuum and
those in the optical continuum. Also, our analysis highlights the importance of
understanding and minimizing the scatter in the relationship traced by the
intrinsic variability of individual AGN, since it propagates directly into the

follow the time-dependent hierarchical fragmentation of self-gravitating cores,
until they reach effectively infinite density (and form stars). We show that
turbulent fragmentation robustly predicts two key features of the IMF. First, a
high-mass power-law scaling very close to the Salpeter slope, which is a
generic consequence of the scale-free nature of turbulence and self-gravity. We
predict the IMF slope (-2.3) is slightly steeper then the CMF slope (-2.1),
owing to the slower collapse and easier fragmentation of large cores. Second, a
turnover mass, which is set by a combination of the CMF turnover mass (a couple
solar masses, determined by the `sonic scale' of galactic turbulence, and so
weakly dependent on galaxy properties), and the equation of state (EOS). A
""soft"" EOS with polytropic index $\gamma<1.0$ predicts that the IMF slope
becomes ""shallow"" below the sonic scale, but fails to produce the full turnover
observed. An EOS which becomes ""stiff"" at sufficiently low surface densities

  (CRISM 2014)",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supernovae (SNe) are generally classified into Type I and Type II. Most SNe
(~ 80%), including all the subtypes of Type II, and Type Ib/c, arise from the
core-collapse of massive stars. During their lifetime, mass-loss from these
stars considerably modifies the medium around the stars. When the stars explode
as SNe, the resulting shock wave will expand in this wind-modified medium. In
contrast, Type Ia SNe will expand in a relatively uniform medium, but the
dynamics are different from those of core-collapse SNe. For young supernova
remnants, the properties of the ejecta as well as the surrounding medium are
important in determining the subsequent evolution of the SN shock wave, and the
dynamics and kinematics of the remnant. This will influence the acceleration of
particles at the SN shocks, and consequently affect the gamma-ray emission from
the remnant.
  Herein we discuss the expected properties, especially the density structure,
of the medium around various types and sub-types of SNe, as suggested by
current stellar evolution models. Using analytic and semi-analytic models and
numerical simulations, we investigate how these affect the kinematics of the SN
shock waves, assess the impact this would have on the production of cosmic
rays, and show how it influences the time-evolution of the hadronic gamma-ray
emission from the remnant. In the case of SNRs evolving in a wind medium, the
emission should reach a maximum early on, and thereafter decrease with time.
For SNe in a constant density medium, the emission would be expected to
increase with time upto the advent of the Sedov stage.

coupling of the dark matter to the $Z$ boson and set a limit $m_\chi \gtrsim
200$ GeV (except in a very narrow region around the $Z-$pole region). Using
complementarity between spin dependent, spin independent and FERMI limits, we
predict the nature of this coupling, more specifically the axial/vectorial
ratio that respects a thermal dark matter coupled through a $Z$-portal while
not being excluded by the current observations. We also show that the next
generation of experiments of the type LZ or XENON1T will test Z-portal scenario
for dark matter mass up to 2 TeV. The condition of a thermal dark matter
naturally predicts the spin--dependent scattering cross section on the neutron

clear prediction of the model and a signature testable in the near future

with respect to $\nu=3/2$, which we explain quantitatively by comparing three
CF density models and concluding that the $\nu=3/2$ CFs are likely formed by
the minority carriers in the upper energy spin state of the lowest Landau
level. Our data also allow us to probe the shape and size of the CF Fermi
contour. At a fixed electron density of $\simeq 1.8 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$,
as the quantum well width increases from 30 to 60 nm, the CFs show increasing
spin-polarization. We attribute this to the enhancement of the Zeeman energy
relative to the Coulomb energy in wider wells where the latter is softened
because of the larger electron layer thickness. The application of an
additional parallel magnetic field ($B_{||}$) leads to a significant distortion
of the CF Fermi contour as $B_{||}$ couples to the CFs' out-of-plane orbital
motion. The distortion is much more severe compared to the $\nu=1/2$ CF case at
comparable $B_{||}$. Moreover, the applied $B_{||}$ further spin-polarizes the

evolution of each simulation to a control run without feedback, and to a run

the presence of feedback prevents the runaway growth of massive stars, and the
resulting star-forming regions are less dense, and preserve their initial
substructure for longer. The addition of stellar winds to the feedback produces
only marginal differences compared to the simulations with just photoionisation
feedback.
  We search for mass segregation at different stages in the simulations; before
feedback is switched on in the SPH runs, at the end of the SPH runs (before
$N$-body integration) and during the $N$-body evolution. Whether a simulation
is primordially mass segregated (i.e. before dynamical evolution) depends
extensively on how mass segregation is defined, and different methods for
measuring mass segregation give apparently contradictory results. Primordial
mass segregation is also less common in the simulations when star formation
occurs under the influence of feedback. Further dynamical mass segregation can
also take place during the subsequent (gas-free) dynamical evolution. Taken
together, our results suggest that extreme caution should be exercised when
interpreting the spatial distribution of massive stars relative to low-mass

density is less (Zakharov's model) or greater (Silin's model) than the plasma
thermal energy density. The hybrid models presented in this paper treat the
electrons as a fluid by way of an equation for the high-frequency wave and
treat the ions kinetically with a super-particle simulation. This makes
possible consideration of non-resonant particles trapped by high-frequency
oscillations and the influence of trajectory crossing on the development of the
parametric instability. The evolution of ion energy distribution is studied. It
is shown that after saturation of the instability, the ion kinetic energy
density normalized to the initial field energy density is of the order of the
ratio of linear growth rate to the plasma frequency, for the case when the
initial field energy far exceeds the plasma thermal energy. In this case, the
ion energy distribution is different from the Maxwellian.In the opposite case
of hot plasma, the ions acquire a part of initial field energy, which is
approximately equal to the half of ratio of initial Langmuir field energy to
the plasma thermal energy. At this, the ion kinetic energy distribution is
close to the Maxwellian, and it is reasonably to speak about ion temperature.
The crossing of ion trajectories in the surrounding of density cavities is a
reason of instability quenching in both cases.

systems: photons from an optical pump mode are coherently scattered to a
high-order mode by mechanical motion of the cavity mirrors, and these modes
resonantly interact via radiation pressure force when certain conditions are
met. Such effects are predicted to occur in long baseline advanced
gravitational-wave detectors. They can pump energy into acoustic modes, leading
to parametric instability, but they can also extract acoustic energy, leading
to optomechanical cooling. We develop a large amplitude model of three-mode
interactions that explains the ring-up amplitude saturation after instability
occurs. We also demonstrate both radiation-pressure cooling and mechanical
amplification in two different three-mode optomechanical systems, including the
first observation of the three-mode parametric instability in a free-space
Fabry-Perot cavity. The experimental data agrees well with the theoretical
model. Contrary to expectations, parametric instability does not lead to loss
of cavity lock, a fact which may make it easier to implement control techniques

understanding the temporal and spatial evolution of biological processes such
as lateral transport along membranes and self-assembly of viruses. Most
theoretical efforts in the field of diffusive transport have focussed on
solving the diffusion equation on curved surfaces, for which it is not
tractable to incorporate particle interactions even though these play a crucial
role in crowded systems. We show here that it is possible to combine standard
constraint algorithms with the classical velocity Verlet scheme to perform
molecular dynamics simulations of particles constrained to an arbitrarily
curved surface, in which such interactions can be taken into account.
Furthermore, unlike Brownian dynamics schemes in local coordinates, our method
is based on Cartesian coordinates allowing for the reuse of many other standard
tools without modifications, including parallelisation through domain
decomposition. We show that by applying the schemes to the Langevin equation
for various surfaces, confined Brownian motion is obtained, which has direct
applications to many biological and physical problems. Finally we present two
practical examples that highlight the applicability of the method: (i) the
influence of crowding and shape on the lateral diffusion of proteins in curved

during inflation is the amplification of vacuum metric fluctuations. In this

rate $H$. For example, a gw detection close to the present experimental limit
(tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.1$) would indicate an inflationary expansion
rate close to $10^{14} \, {\rm GeV}$. This conclusion, however, would be
invalid if the observed gw originated from a different source. We construct and
study one of the possible covariant formulations of the mechanism suggested in
[43], where a spectator field $\sigma$ with a sound speed $c_{s} \ll 1$ acts as
a source for gw during inflation. In our formulation $\sigma$ is described by a
so-called $P(X)$ Lagrangian and a non-minimal coupling to gravity. This field
interacts only gravitationally with the inflaton, which has a standard action.
We compute the amount of scalar and tensor density fluctuations produced by
$\sigma$ and find that, in our realization, $r$ is not enhanced with respect to
the standard result but it is strongly sensitive to $c_s$, thus breaking the
direct $r \leftrightarrow H$ connection.

self-averaging effects, and describe schemes for the computation of response

the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, we assess the computation costs and
accuracies of the two methods at different temperatures. For almost all
considered cases, we find that, for the same computation cost, purifications
yield more accurate results than METTS -- often by orders of magnitude. The
METTS algorithm becomes more efficient only for temperatures well below the
system's energy gap. The exponential growth of the computation cost in the
evaluation of response functions limits the attainable timescales in both
methods and we find that in this regard, METTS do not outperform purifications.

dual structure and we sketch an abstract framework where the theory of
fibrations and enriched category theory are appropriately united.
  We initially work in the context of a monoidal category, where we study an
enrichment of the category of monoids in the category of comonoids under
certain assumptions. This is induced by the existence of the universal
measuring comonoid, a notion originally defined by Sweedler in vector spaces.
We then consider the fibred category of modules over arbitrary monoids, and we
establish its enrichment in the opfibred category of comodules over arbitrary
comonoids. This is now exhibited via the existence of the universal measuring
comodule, introduced by Batchelor.
  We then generalize these results to their `many-object' version. In the
setting of the bicategory of V-enriched matrices, we investigate an enrichment
of V-categories in V-cocategories as well as of V-modules in V-comodules. This
part constitutes the core of this treatment, and the theory of fibrations and
adjunctions between them plays a central role in the development. The newly
constructed categories are described in detail, and they appropriately fit in a
picture of duality, enrichment and fibrations as in the previous case.
  Finally, we introduce the concept of an enriched fibration, aimed to provide
a formal description for the above examples. Related work in this direction,
though from a different perspective and with dissimilar outcomes, has been
realized by Shulman. We also discuss an abstraction of this picture in the
environment of double categories, concerning categories of monoids and modules
therein.

considerations, we conclude that photospheric heterogeneities causing >0.2%
3-5-micron flux variations are present on virtually all L dwarfs, and probably
on most T dwarfs. A third of L dwarf variables show irregular light curves,
indicating that L dwarfs may have multiple spots that evolve over a single
rotation. Also, approximately a third of the periodicities are on time scales
>10 h, suggesting that slowly-rotating brown dwarfs may be common. We observe
an increase in the maximum amplitudes over the entire spectral type range,
revealing a potential for greater temperature contrasts in T dwarfs than in L
dwarfs. We find a tentative association (92% confidence) between low surface
gravity and high-amplitude variability among L3-L5.5 dwarfs. Although we can
not confirm whether lower gravity is also correlated with a higher incidence of

percent, which is significant too large for bit patterned magnetic recording.
Thermally written in errors can be decreased if larger head fields are applied.
However, larger fields lead to an increase the fundamental thermal jitter. This
leads to a dilemma between thermally written in errors and fundamental thermal
jitter. This dilemma can be partly relaxed by increasing the thickness of the
FePt film up to 30nm. For realistic head fields, it is found that the
fundamental thermal jitter is in the same order of magnitude of the fundamental
thermal jitter in conventional recording, which is about 0.5 to 0.8 nm.
Composite structures consisting of high Curie top layer and FePt as hard
magnetic storage layer can reduce the thermally written in errors to be smaller
than 10-4 if the damping constant is increased in the soft layer. Large damping
may be realized by doping with rare earth elements. Similar to single FePt
grains also in composite structure an increase of switching probability is
sacrifices by an increase of thermal jitter. Structures utilizing first order
phase transitions breaking the thermal jitter and writeability dilemma are
discussed.

consequent magnetoelastic contribution to PMA is not enough to explain the
observed anisotropy values in the distorted state. {\it Ab initio} calculations
show that the chemical ordering plays a crucial role in the appearance of PMA.
Through a phenomenological model we are able to explain that an excess of next

simultaneous energy harvesting and information transmission. Compared with the
existing protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: i) it
ensures uninterrupted information transmission since no time switching or power
splitting is needed at the relay for energy harvesting; ii) it enables the
so-called self-energy recycling, i.e., part of the energy (loop energy) that is
used for information transmission by the relay can be harvested and reused in
addition to the dedicated energy sent by the source. Under the multiple-input

assumed that the sparsity structure of the model is homogeneous over the entire
population. That is, the identities of important regressors are invariant
across the population and across the individuals in the collected sample. In
practice, however, the sparsity structure may not always be invariant in the
population, due to heterogeneity across different sub-populations. We consider
a general, possibly non-smooth M-estimation framework, allowing a possible
structural change regarding the identities of important regressors in the
population. Our penalized M-estimator not only selects covariates but also
discriminates between a model with homogeneous sparsity and a model with a
structural change in sparsity. As a result, it is not necessary to know or
pretest whether the structural change is present, or where it occurs. We derive
asymptotic bounds on the estimation loss of the penalized M-estimators, and
achieve the oracle properties. We also show that when there is a structural
change, the estimator of the threshold parameter is super-consistent. If the
signal is relatively strong, the rates of convergence can be further improved
and asymptotic distributional properties of the estimators including the
threshold estimator can be established using an adaptive penalization. The
proposed methods are then applied to quantile regression and logistic
regression models and are illustrated via Monte Carlo experiments.

that contextuality and nonlocality (hence nonobjectivity of physical
properties) are unavoidable features of QM which follow from the mathematical
apparatus of QM. Moreover these features are usually considered as basic in
quantum information processing. Nevertheless they raise still unsolved
problems, as the objectification problem in the quantum theory of measurement.
The extended semantic realism (ESR) model offers a possible way out from these
difficulties by embedding the mathematical formalism of QM into a broader
mathematical formalism and reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional
on detection rather than absolute. The embedding allows to recover the formal
apparatus of QM within the ESR model, and the reinterpretation of QM allows to
construct a noncontextual hidden variables theory which justifies the
assumptions introduced in the ESR model and proves its objectivity. According
to the ESR model both linear and nonlinear time evolution occur, depending on
the physical environment, as in QM. In addition, the ESR model, though
objective, implies modified Bell's inequalities that do not conflict with QM,
supplies different mathematical representations of proper and improper
mixtures, provides a general framework in which the local interpretations of
the GHZ experiment obtained by other authors are recovered and explained, and
supports an interpretation of quantum logic which avoids the introduction of
the problematic notion of quantum truth.

give a systematic method for producing an explicit presentation by generators
and relations of the equivariant and ordinary cohomology rings (with
$\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients) of any regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety
$\mathrm{Hess}(h)$ in type A. Specifically, we give an explicit algorithm,
depending only on the Hessenberg function $h$, which produces the $n$ defining
relations $\{f_{h(j),j}\}_{j=1}^n$ in the equivariant cohomology ring. Our
result generalizes known results: for the case $h=(2,3,4,...,n,n)$, which
corresponds to the Peterson variety $\mathrm{Pet}_n$, we recover the
presentation of $H^*_S(\mathrm{Pet}_n)$ given previously by Fukukawa, Harada,
and Masuda. Moreover, in the case $h=(n,n,...,n)$, for which the corresponding
regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety is the full flag variety
$\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, we can explicitly relate the generators of our
ideal with those in the usual Borel presentation of the cohomology ring of
$\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. The proof of our main theorem includes an
argument that the restriction homomorphism $H^*_T(\mathrm{Flags}(\mathbb{C}^n))
\to H^*_S(\mathrm{Hess}(h))$ is surjective. In this research announcement, we
briefly recount the context and state our results; we also give a sketch of our

the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism developed by

waveform vanishes, as expected from previous results which show that these
systems in scalar-tensor theory are indistinguishable from their general

the underlying economic uncertainty follows a continuous-time Markov process X
with a general state space (Borel right process (BRP)) and the stochastic
discount factor (SDF) is a positive semimartingale multiplicative functional of
X. A key result is the uniqueness theorem for a positive eigenfunction of the
pricing operator such that X is recurrent under a new probability measure
associated with this eigenfunction (recurrent eigenfunction). As economic
applications, we prove uniqueness of the Hansen and Scheinkman (2009)
factorization of the Markovian SDF corresponding to the recurrent
eigenfunction, extend the Recovery Theorem of Ross (2015) from discrete time,
finite state irreducible Markov chains to recurrent BRPs, and obtain the long
maturity asymptotics of the pricing operator. When an asset pricing model is
specified by given risk-neutral probabilities together with a short rate
function of the Markovian state, we give sufficient conditions for existence of
a recurrent eigenfunction and provide explicit examples in a number of
important financial models, including affine and quadratic diffusion models and
an affine model with jumps. These examples show that the recurrence assumption,
in addition to fixing uniqueness, rules out unstable economic dynamics, such as
the short rate asymptotically going to infinity or to a zero lower bound trap

[TD-CASSCF; Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 88}, 023402 (2013)], which divides the occupied

subdivides the active orbitals into an arbitrary number of subgroups, and poses
the {\it occupation restriction} by giving the minimum and maximum number of
electrons distributed in each subgroup. This enables highly flexible
construction of the configuration interaction (CI) space, allowing a
large-active-space simulation of dynamics, e.g., the core excitation or
ionization. The equations of motion both for CI coefficients and spatial

efficient algorithm is proposed to solve for the orbital time derivatives.
In-depth descriptions of the computational implementation are given in a

maximum information entropy is presented as the possible origin of effective
navigation in small-world networks. We find there exists a competition between
information entropy maximization and homophily in local structure through both
theoretical and experimental analysis. This competition means that a newly
built relationship between two individuals with more common friends would lead
to less information entropy gain for them. We conjecture that in the evolution
of the social network, both of the two assumptions coexist. The rule of maximum
information entropy produces weak ties in the network, while the law of
homophily makes the network highly clustered locally and the individuals would
obtain strong and trust ties. Our findings shed light on the social network
modeling from a new perspective.

In our companion paper, we discover that, on $\mathbb{R}^n$, the governing
operator in peridynamics, which involves a convolution, is a bounded function
of the classical (local) governing operator. Building on this, we define an
abstract convolution operator on bounded domains. The abstract convolution
operator is a function of the classical operator, defined by a Hilbert basis
available due to the purely discrete spectrum of the latter. As governing
operator of the nonlocal equation we use a function of the classical operator,
this allows us to incorporate local boundary conditions into nonlocal theories.
  For the homogeneous wave equation with the considered boundary conditions, we
prove that continuity is preserved by time evolution. We give explicit solution
expressions for the initial value problems with prominent boundary conditions
such as periodic, antiperiodic, Neumann, and Dirichlet. In order to connect to
the standard convolution, we give an integral representation of the abstract
convolution operator. We present additional ""simple"" convolutionsbased on
periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions that lead Neumann and Dirichlet
boundary conditions.
  We present a numerical study of the solutions of the wave equation. For
discretization, we employ a weak formulation based on a Galerkin projection and
use piecewise polynomials on each element which allows discontinuities of the
approximate solution at the element borders. We study convergence order of
solutions with respect to polynomial order and observe optimal convergence. We
depict the solutions for each boundary condition.

difficulty. For most of the operation time, each cavity remains in a vacuum
state, thus decoherence caused by the cavity decay and the unwanted
inter-cavity crosstalk are greatly suppressed. Moreover, only one

the rescattering mediated through a Breit-Wigner resonance and the rescattering

studied in this paper. The sensor that is deployed to monitor the environment
has limited energy constraint to the classical quickest change detection
problem. We consider the ""censoring"" strategy at the sensor side, i.e., the
sensor selectively sends its observations to the decision maker. The quickest
change detection problem is formulated in a minimax way. In particular, our
goal is to find the optimal censoring strategy and stopping time such that the
detection delay is minimized subject to constraints on both average run length
(ARL) and average energy cost before the change. We show that the censoring
strategy that has the maximal post-censoring Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence
coupled with Cumulative Sum (CuSum) and Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak (SRP) detection
procedure is asymptotically optimal for the Lorden's and Pollak's problem as
the ARL goes to infinity, respectively. We also show that the asymptotically
optimal censoring strategy should use up the available energy and has a very
special structure, i.e., the likelihood ratio of the no send region is a single
interval, which can be utilized to significantly reduce the computational
complexity. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate our results.

partial observations, if sufficiently informative, can be used to control the
inherent uncertainty due to chaos. The purpose of this paper is to investigate,
both theoretically and numerically, conditions on the observations of chaotic
systems under which they can be accurately filtered. In particular, we
highlight the advantage of adaptive observation operators over fixed ones. The
Lorenz '96 model is used to exemplify our findings.
  We consider discrete-time and continuous-time observations in our theoretical
developments. We prove that, for fixed observation operator, the 3DVAR filter
can recover the system state within a neighbourhood determined by the size of
the observational noise. It is required that a sufficiently large proportion of
the state vector is observed, and an explicit form for such sufficient fixed
observation operator is given. Numerical experiments, where the data is
incorporated by use of the 3DVAR and extended Kalman filters, suggest that less
informative fixed operators than given by our theory can still lead to accurate
signal reconstruction. Adaptive observation operators are then studied
numerically; we show that, for carefully chosen adaptive observation operators,
the proportion of the state vector that needs to be observed is drastically
smaller than with a fixed observation operator. Indeed, we show that the number

giant branch (TP-AGB) have become evident: 1) the modelling of the TP-AGB phase
is critical for the derivation of basic galaxy properties (e.g. mass and age)
up to high redshift, with consequent cosmological implications; 2) current
TP-AGB calibrations based on Magellanic Cloud (MC) clusters come out not to
work properly for other external galaxies, yielding a likely TP-AGB
overestimation; 3) the significance of the TP-AGB contribution in galaxies,
hence their derived properties, are strongly debated, with conflicting claims
in favour of either a heavy or a light TP-AGB. The only way out of this
condition of persisting uncertainty is to perform a reliable calibration of the
TP-AGB phase as a function of the star's initial mass (hence age) over a wide
range of metallicity, from very low to super-solar values. In this context, I
will review recent advancements and ongoing efforts towards a physically-sound
TP-AGB calibration that, moving beyond the classical use of the MC clusters,
combines increasingly refined TP-AGB stellar models with exceptionally
high-quality data for resolved TP-AGB stars in nearby galaxies. Preliminary
results indicate that a sort of ""TP-AGB island"" emerges in the age-metallicity
plane, where the contribution of these stars is especially developed, embracing
preferentially solar- and MC-like metallicities, and intermediate ages (~ few
Gyr).

bottomonium states around the deconfinement transition. Our study uses lattice
QCD with $N_f=2+1$ light quark flavors to describe the non-perturbative thermal
QCD medium between $140$MeV$<T<249$MeV and deploys lattice regularized
non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective field theory to capture the physics of
heavy quark bound states immersed therein. The spectral functions of the
$^3S_1$ $(\Upsilon)$ and $^3P_1$ $(\chi_{b1})$ bottomonium states are extracted
from Euclidean time Monte Carlo simulations using a novel Bayesian
prescription, which provides higher accuracy than the Maximum Entropy Method.
Based on a systematic comparison of interacting and free spectral functions we
conclude that the ground states of both the S-wave $(\Upsilon)$ and P-wave
$(\chi_{b1})$ channel survive up to $T=249$MeV. Stringent upper limits on the
size of the in-medium modification of bottomonium masses and widths are
provided.

$m_l=m_s/20$ by the HotQCD collaboration, giving access to temperatures between

exhibits a clean transition from a linear, confining behavior in the hadronic
phase to a Debye screened form above deconfinement. Interestingly its values
lie close to the color singlet free energies in Coulomb gauge at all

show that, if $S$ belongs to a wide class of compact sets (which we call \it

relatively simple parametric formulation. In this setup, standard methodologies
(method of moments, maximum likelihood) can be used to estimate some

Language Processing (NLP). A lot of research has been devoted to finding ways
of representing the semantics of individual words in vector spaces.
Distributional approaches --- meaning distributed representations that exploit
co-occurrence statistics of large corpora --- have proved popular and
successful across a number of tasks. However, natural language usually comes in
structures beyond the word level, with meaning arising not only from the
individual words but also the structure they are contained in at the phrasal or
sentential level. Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of
an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is an equally fundamental
task of NLP.
  This dissertation explores methods for learning distributed semantic
representations and models for composing these into representations for larger
linguistic units. Our underlying hypothesis is that neural models are a
suitable vehicle for learning semantically rich representations and that such
representations in turn are suitable vehicles for solving important tasks in
natural language processing. The contribution of this thesis is a thorough
evaluation of our hypothesis, as part of which we introduce several new
approaches to representation learning and compositional semantics, as well as
multiple state-of-the-art models which apply distributed semantic

so such stars are known which form a clump in the Petersen diagram without any

  Interestingly, all first overtone RR Lyrae stars for which precise
space-borne photometry is available show the additional mode, which suggests
that its excitation is common. Motivated by these results we searched for
non-radial modes in the OGLE-III photometry of RRc stars from the Galactic

with a signature of possible second sequence with higher period ratio (0.631).
The scatter in period ratios of the already known stars is explained as due to
population effects. Judging from the results of space observations this still
mysterious form of pulsation must be common among RRc stars and with our
analysis of the OGLE data we just touch the tip of the iceberg.

using nuclear magnetic resonance with thermal ensembles of liquid molecules,
however, such systems are known to be non-scalable for quantum computing. There
are proposals to implement geometric quantum computation in scalable
experimental platforms such as trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or quantum
dots, and a recent experiment has realized geometric single-bit gates with the
superconducting system. Here, we report the experimental realization of a
universal set of geometric quantum gates with solid-state spins of the diamond
defects. The diamond defects provide a scalable experimental platform with the
potential for room-temperature quantum computing, which has attracted strong
interest in recent years. Based on advance of coherent control in this system,
our experiment shows that all-geometric and potentially robust quantum
computation can be realized with solid-state spin qubits.

algorithms for the prediction of integral functions of nuclear data, such as
reactor power distributions or neutron multiplication factors. Similarly to the
established Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) methodology, MOCABA offers
the capability to utilize integral experimental data to reduce the prior
uncertainty of integral observables. The MOCABA approach, however, does not
involve any series expansions and, therefore, does not suffer from the
breakdown of first-order perturbation theory for large nuclear data
uncertainties. This is related to the fact that, in contrast to the GLLS
method, the updating mechanism within MOCABA is applied directly to the
integral observables without having to ""adjust"" any nuclear data. A central
part of MOCABA is the nuclear data Monte Carlo program NUDUNA, which performs
random sampling of nuclear data evaluations according to their covariance
information and converts them into libraries for transport code systems like
MCNP or SCALE. What is special about MOCABA is that it can be applied to any
integral function of nuclear data, and any integral measurement can be taken
into account to improve the prediction of an integral observable of interest.
In this paper we present two example applications of the MOCABA framework: the
prediction of the neutron multiplication factor of a water-moderated PWR fuel
assembly based on 21 criticality safety benchmark experiments and the
prediction of the power distribution within a toy model reactor containing 100

comes down to studying the circumstances for the fragmentation of a condensing
core during the first stages of the collapse. However, the probability of
fragmentation and the number of fragments seem to be determined to a large
degree by the initial conditions. In this work we study the fate of the linear
perturbations of a homogeneous gas sphere both analytically and numerically. In
particular, we investigate the stability of the well-known homologous solution
that describes the collapse of a uniform spherical cloud. The difficulty of the
mathematical singularity in the perturbation equations is surpassed here by
explicitly introducing a weak shock next to the sonic point. In parallel, we
perform adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical simulations of the linear
stages of the collapse and compared the growth rates obtained by each method.
With this combination of analytical and numerical tools, we explore the
behavior of both spherically symmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations. The
numerical experiments provide the linear growth rates as a function of the
core's initial virial parameter and as a function of the azimuthal wave number
of the perturbation. The overlapping regime of the numerical experiments and
the analytical predictions is the situation of a cold and large cloud, and in
this regime the analytically calculated growth rates agree very well with the

decretion disks. How- ever, metal-poor O stars have weaker stellar winds,
allowing the stars to retain angular momentum. Therefore, low-metallicity
environments should promote the formation of Oe stars, including those of
earlier spectral types than observed in high-metallicity en- vironments. Using
the RIOTS4 survey, a spatially complete spectroscopic survey of Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) field OB stars taken with the IMACS multi-slit spec-

represent 20-23% of our SMC Oe stars, a dramatic increase compared to the MW,

the higher frequencies of Oe stars and their earlier spectral range in the

with exactly the viscous speed of the disk, a regime termed type II migration.
Population synthesis models indicate that standard type II migration is too
rapid to be in agreement with the observations. We study the migration of
massive planets between $2\times10^{-4}$ and $2\times10^{-3} M_\odot$
corresponding to 0.2 to 2 Jupiter masses $M_J$. in order to estimate the
migration rate in comparison to type II migration. We follow the evolution of
planets embedded in two-dimensional, locally isothermal disks with non-zero
mass accretion which is explicitly modelled using suitable in- and outflow
boundary conditions to ensure a specific accretion rate. After a certain
relaxation time we release the planet and measure its migration through the
disk and the dependence on parameters such as viscosity, accretion rate and
planet mass. We study accreting and non-accretion planets. The inferred
migration rate of the planet is determined entirely by the disk torques acting
on it and is completely independent of the viscous inflow velocity, so there is
no classical type II migration regime. Depending on the local disk mass the
migration rate can be faster or slower than type II migration. From the torques
and the accretion rate profile in the disk we see that the gap formed by the
planet does not separate the inner from the outer disk as necessary for type II
migration, rather gas crosses the gap or is accreted onto the planet.

the sensory periphery, its possible role in network computation is less clear.
Most models of computation by neural networks are based on population firing
rates. In equivalent spiking implementations, firing is assumed to be random
such that averaging across populations of neurons recovers the rate-based
approach. Recently, however, Den\'eve and colleagues have suggested that the
spiking behavior of neurons may be fundamental to how neuronal networks
compute, with precise spike timing determined by each neuron's contribution to
producing the desired output. By postulating that each neuron fires in order to
reduce the error in the network's output, it was demonstrated that linear
computations can be carried out by networks of integrate-and-fire neurons that
communicate through instantaneous synapses. This left open, however, the
possibility that realistic networks, with conductance-based neurons with
subthreshold nonlinearity and the slower timescales of biophysical synapses,
may not fit into this framework. Here, we show how the spike-based approach can
be extended to biophysically plausible networks. We then show that our network
reproduces a number of key features of cortical networks including irregular
and Poisson-like spike times and a tight balance between excitation and
inhibition. Lastly, we discuss how the behavior of our model scales with
network size, or with the number of neurons ""recorded"" from a larger computing
network. These results significantly increase the biological plausibility of
the spike-based approach to network computation.

second order moments of the autocorrelation function of the images. To our

viable curvature corrected exponential $F(R)$ gravity model, in the presence of
matter fluids consisting of collisional matter and radiation. Particularly, we
express the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations of motion in terms of
parameters that are appropriate for describing the dark energy oscillations and
compare the dark energy density and the dark energy equation of state parameter
corresponding to collisional and non-collisional matter. In addition to these,
and owing to the fact that the cosmological evolution of collisional and
non-collisional matter universes, when quantified in terms of the Hubble
parameter and the effective equation of states parameters, is very much alike,
we further scrutinize the cosmological evolution study by extending the
analysis to the study of matter perturbations in the matter domination era. We
quantify this analysis in terms of the growth factor of matter perturbations,
in which case the resulting picture of the cosmological evolution is clear,
since collisional and non-collisional universes can be clearly distinguished.
Interestingly enough, since it is known that the oscillations of the effective
equation of state parameter around the phantom divide are undesirable and
unwanted in $F(R)$ gravities, when these are considered for redshifts near the
matter domination era and before, in the curvature corrected exponential model
with collisional matter which we study here there exist oscillations that never
cross the phantom divide. Therefore, this rather unwanted feature of the
effective equation of state parameter is also absent in the collisional matter
filled universe.

datacenters making power management a critical concern. Advances in processor
technology provide fine-grained control over operating frequency and voltage of
processors and this control can be used to tradeoff power for performance.
Although many power and performance models exist, they have a significant error
margin while predicting the performance of memory or file-intensive tasks and
HPC applications. Our investigations reveal that the prediction error is due in
part to the fact that they do not take frequency AND CPU variations account,
rather they just depend on the CPU by itself.
  In this paper, we empirically derive power and completion time models using
linear regression with CPU utilization and operating frequency as parameters.
We validate our power model on several Intel and AMD processors by predicting
within 2-7% of measured power. We validate our completion time model using five
kernels of NASA Parallel Benchmark suite and five CPU, memory and
file-intensive benchmarks on four heterogeneous systems and predicting within
1-6% of observed performance. We then show how these models can be employed to
realize as much as 15% savings in power while delivering 44% better performance

transport in the proton conductor BaSnO$_3$. Structural optimizations in the
stable and saddle point configurations for transfer and reorientation allow
description of the high-temperature classical and semi-classical regimes, in
which diffusion occurs by over-barrier motion. At lower temperature (typically
below 300 K), we describe a thermally-assisted quantum regime. In this regime,
transfer and reorientation occur when the surrounding matrix adopts particular
""coincidence"" configurations in which quantum tunneling is favored. Both the
non-adiabatic and the adiabatic cases are examined. In the adiabatic case, the
energy landscape of hydrogen in the coincidence configuration is very flat,
with very low coincidence energy barriers. Path-integral molecular dynamics
simulations of the H atom in the coincidence potential reveal, in the transfer
case, highly quantum behavior up to T=300 K (the density of probability of H in
the coincidence configuration, has its maximum at the saddle point, due to the
fact that the zero-point energy exceeds the coincidence energy barrier).
Arguments are given that support the adiabatic picture for the transfer
mechanism. This suggests existence of this state of hydrogen during the very
short lifetime of the coincidence configurations ($\sim$ 10$^{-13}$ s), as a
transition state for the transfer mechanism. Remarkably, such state is
identical to that of ice X, a highly quantum phase of ice observed at high
pressures $\approx$ 100 GPa. In the case of reorientation, typical times for
existence of the coincidence configuration and for protonic motion are roughly
equal, suggesting that the adiabatic picture is not valid. Protonic transfer
and reorientation in oxides are therefore governed by radically different
mechanisms below room temperature.

of huge amounts of range queries over massive sets of moving objects, where the
spatial extents of queries and objects are continuously modified over time. To
tackle this problem and significantly accelerate query processing we devise a
hybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that compresses data output and save query processing
work. The devised system relies on an ad-hoc spatial index leading to a problem
decomposition that results in a set of independent data-parallel tasks. The
index is based on a point-region quadtree space decomposition and allows to
tackle effectively a broad range of spatial object distributions, even those
very skewed. Also, to deal with the architectural peculiarities and limitations
of the GPUs, we adopt non-trivial GPU data structures that avoid the need of
locked memory accesses and favour coalesced memory accesses, thus enhancing the
overall memory throughput. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work
that exploits GPUs to efficiently solve repeated range queries over massive

slowly with the strength of the guide field. The fastest growing mode is
tearing type only for thin current sheets (half thickness $\approx d_e$, where
$d_e=c/\omega_{pe}$ is electron inertial length) and zero guide field. For
finite guide field or thicker current sheets, fastest growing mode is
non-tearing type. However growth rates of the fastest 2-D tearing mode and 3-D
non-tearing mode are comparable for thin current sheets ($d_e < $half thickness

that the general mode resonance conditions for electron-magnetohydrodynamic

dissipation mechanism (electron inertia and resistivity in cases of EMHD and

by Jerzy Kijowski and Andrzej Oko{\l}\'ow, which describes the states of a
quantum theory as projective families of density matrices. A strategy to
implement the dynamics in this formalism was presented in our first paper,
which we now test in two simple toy-models. The first one is a very basic
linear model, meant as an illustration of the general procedure, and we will
only discuss it at the classical level. In the second one, we reformulate the
Schr\""odinger equation, treated as a classical field theory, within this
projective framework, and proceed to its (non-relativistic) second
quantization. We are then able to reproduce the physical content of the usual
Fock quantization.

Hilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski to describe quantum states as
projective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler
Hilbert spaces. Beside the physical motivations for this approach, it could
help designing a quantum state space holding the states we need. In
[Oko{\l}\'ow 2013, arXiv:1304.6330] the description of a theory of Abelian
connections within this framework was developed, an important insight being to
use building blocks labeled by combinations of edges and surfaces. The present
work generalizes this construction to an arbitrary gauge group G (in
particular, G is neither assumed to be Abelian nor compact). This involves
refining the definition of the label set, as well as deriving explicit formulas
to relate the Hilbert spaces attached to different labels.
  If the gauge group happens to be compact, we also have at our disposal the
well-established Ashtekar-Lewandowski Hilbert space, which is defined as an
inductive limit using building blocks labeled by edges only. We then show that
the quantum state space presented here can be thought as a natural extension of
the space of density matrices over this Hilbert space. In addition, it is
manifest from the classical counterparts of both formalisms that the projective
approach allows for a more balanced treatment of the holonomy and flux
variables, so it might pave the way for the development of more satisfactory
coherent states.

electronics. Such structures may have the dielectric film with the thickness of
several nanometers wich is located on the cathode. Such film with a large
dielectric constant reduces the thickness of the potential barrier by about
film thickness and reduces the height of barrier. The grid electrode structure
may contain several periods of metallization with a thickness of tens of
nanometers, which allows one to obtain the resonant under barrier tunneling.
For all structures we obtained electrostatic Green's function, the built
profiles potential barriers, the calculated tunneling coefficients and
Volt-Ampere Characteristics (VAC) with regard to the distribution of electron
energies. The structures under consideration require to use of low voltages on
the gate (grid) electrodes. They are promising for the electron gun with a
large current controlled by low voltage on the grid, for example, in TWT with
subsequent acceleration of the electron beam. Since a major influence on the
tunneling provides the grid, the electrons emitted from the grid with
approximately the Fermi velocity, and the calculation of the electron gun with
multiple electrodes after the grid is greatly simplified.

calculation of the many-body density of states (MBDS) of a system with total
energy E, composed by N bosons. In the mean-field framework, an integral
expression for MBDS, which is proper to be performed by asymptotic expansions,
can be derived. However, the standard second order steepest descent method
cannot be applied to this integral when the ground-state is sufficiently
populated. Alternatively, we derive a uniform formula for MBDS, which is
potentially able to deal with this regime. In the case of the one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, using results found in the number theory literature, we
show that the uniform formula improves the standard expression achieved by
means of the second order method.

hard-to-reach and/or stigmatized communities. RDS utilizes a peer-driven
recruitment mechanism where sampled individuals pass on participation coupons
to at most $c$ of their acquaintances in the community ($c=3$ being a common
choice), who then in turn pass on to their acquaintances if they choose to
participate, and so on. This process of distributing coupons is shown to behave
like a new Reed-Frost type network epidemic model, in which becoming infected
corresponds to receiving a coupon. The difference from existing network
epidemic models is that an infected individual can not infect (i.e.\ sample)
all of its contacts, but only at most $c$ of them. We calculate $R_0$, the
probability of a major ""outbreak"", and the relative size of a major outbreak in
the limit of infinite population size and evaluate their adequacy in finite
populations. We study the effect of varying $c$ and compare RDS to the
corresponding usual epidemic models, i.e.\ the case of $c=\infty$. Our results
suggest that the number of coupons has a large effect on RDS recruitment.
Additionally, we use our findings to explain previous empirical observations.

harmonic extensions of function. Depending on this argument, the expression of

light beams passing through the atom cloud. We specialise to the case of Bose
gases in harmonic traps above critical temperature, for weakly-perturbative
measurements. For overlapping measurement regions, shot-noise correlations
revive after a trap oscillation period. For non-overlapping regions, bosonic
correlations dominate at long times, and propagate at finite speeds. Finally,
we give a realistic measurement protocol for performing such experiments.
