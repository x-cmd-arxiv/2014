definition of the zero-divisor graphs of commutative semigroups to not
necessarily commutative semigroups. We define an annihilating-ideal graph of a
ring as a special type of zero-divisor graph of a semigroup. We introduce two
ways to define the zero-divisor graphs of semigroups. The first definition
gives a directed graph ${\Gamma}(S)$, and the other definition yields an
undirected graph $\overline{{\Gamma}}(S)$. It is shown that $\Gamma(S)$ is not
necessarily connected, but $\overline{{\Gamma}}(S)$ is always connected and
${\rm diam}(\overline{\Gamma}(S))\leq 3$. For a ring $R$ define a directed
graph $\Bbb{APOG}(R)$ to be equal to $\Gamma(\Bbb{IPO}(R))$, where
$\Bbb{IPO}(R)$ is a semigroup consisting of all products of two one-sided
ideals of $R$, and define an undirected graph $\overline{\Bbb{APOG}}(R)$ to be
equal to $\overline{\Gamma}(\Bbb{IPO}(R))$. We show that $R$ is an Artinian
(resp., Noetherian) ring if and only if $\Bbb{APOG}(R)$ has DCC (resp., ACC) on
some special subset of its vertices. Also, It is shown that
$\overline{\Bbb{APOG}}(R)$ is a complete graph if and only if either
$(D(R))^{2}=0$, $R$ is a direct product of two division rings, or $R$ is a
local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ such that
$\Bbb{IPO}(R)=\{0,\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{m}^{2}, R\}$. Finally, we investigate
the diameter and the girth of square matrix rings over commutative rings
$M_{n\times n}(R)$ where $n\geq 2$.

be interdependent. We explore the emergence of the giant mutually connected
component, generalizing the percolation cluster in a single network to
interdependent networks, and observe the strong effect of loops of
interdependencies. In particular, we find that the giant mutual component does
not emerge in a loop formed by any number of layers. In contrast, we observe
multiple hybrid transitions in networks of networks formed by infinite number
of randomly connected layers, corresponding to the percolation of layers with
different number of interdependencies. In particular we find that layers with
many interdependencies are more fragile than layers with less
interdependencies. These hybrid transitions, combining a discontinuity and a
singularity, are responsible for joining a finite fraction of nodes in
different layers to the giant mutually connected component. In the case of
partial interdependence, when only a fraction of interlinks between layers
provide interdependence, some of these transitions can become continuous.

a Calabi-Yau (CY) hypersurface in weighted projective space is equivalent to
its corresponding FJRW-theory (LG) via analytic continuation. It is well known
that this correspondence fails in non-Calabi-Yau cases. The main obstruction is
a collapsing or dimensional reduction of the state space of the Landau-Ginzburg
model in the Fano case, and a similar collapsing of the state space of
Gromov-Witten theory in the general type case. We state and prove a modified
version of the cohomological correspondence that describes this collapsing
phenomenon at the level of state spaces. This result confirms a physical
conjecture of Witten-Hori-Vafa. The main purpose of this article is to provide
a quantum explanation for the collapsing phenomenon. A key observation is that
the corresponding Picard-Fuchs equation develops irregular singularities
precisely at the points where the collapsing occurs. Our main idea is to
replace analytic continuation with asymptotic expansion in this non-Calabi-Yau
setting. The main result of this article is that the reduction in rank of the
Gromov-Witten I-function due to power series asymptotic expansions matches
precisely the dimensional reduction of the corresponding state space.
Furthermore, asymptotic expansion under a different asymptotic sequence yields
a different I-function which can be considered as the mathematical counterpart
to the additional ""massive vacua"" of physics.

self-gravitating collisionless system in one dimension. The system is described
as a central ""S"" shape in phase-space surrounded by a nearly stationary halo
acting locally like a harmonic background on the S. To resolve the dynamics of
the S under its self-gravity and under the influence of the halo, we introduce
a novel approach using post-collapse Lagrangian perturbation theory. This
approach allows us to follow the evolution of the system between successive
crossing times and to describe in an iterative way the interplay between the
central S and the halo. Our theoretical predictions are checked against
measurements in entropy conserving numerical simulations based on the waterbag
method. While our post-collapse Lagrangian approach does not allow us to
compute rigorously the long term behavior of the system, i.e. after many
crossing times, it explains the close to power-law behavior of the projected
density observed in numerical simulations. Pushing the model at late time
suggests that the system could build at some point a very small flat core, but
this is very speculative. This analysis shows that understanding the dynamics
of initially cold systems requires a fine grained approach for a correct
description of their very central part. The analyses performed here can
certainly be extended to spherical symmetry.

galaxy clusters can be explained by conversion into photons of axion-like
particles (ALPs) in the cluster's magnetic field. Previously it has been shown
that conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic
ALPs---a cosmic ALP background (CAB)---can explain the observed soft X-ray
excess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend
this work to the three clusters A665, A2199 and A2255. We use a stochastic
model of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP-photon
conversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these
clusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three
clusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space. We
find the CAB can reproduce the magnitude of the observed excess in A2199 and
A2255 for the same CAB parameters that match the observed soft excess in the
Coma cluster. We also find good fit to the morphology of the excesses in these
clusters. Simulation of CAB conversion in the cluster A665 is in mild tension
with the other clusters due to producing a small but observable excess at large
radii where none is observed. This tension is alleviated considering the
uncertainty on predicting the count rate in the ROSAT detector, and on the
systematics affecting the magnetic field determination. Overall we find good
agreement between the CAB parameters for the four clusters studied so far.

(CMB) temperature anisotropies. The dipole measured in WMAP 3, 5 and 7 yr data
releases was 1) mutually consistent, 2) roughly aligned with the all-sky CMB
dipole and 3) correlated with clusters' X-ray luminosity. We analyzed WMAP 9 yr
and the 1st yr Planck data releases using a catalog of 980 clusters outside the
Kp0 mask to test our earlier findings. The dipoles measured on these new data
sets are fully compatible with our earlier estimates, being similar in
amplitude and direction to our previous results and in disagreement with the
results of an earlier study by the Planck Collaboration. Further, in Planck
datasets dipoles are found independent of frequency, ruling out the Thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich as the source of the effect. Both, in WMAP and Planck, we
find a clear correlation between the dipole measured at the cluster location in
filtered maps with the average anisotropy on the original maps, further proving
that the dipole is associated with clusters. The dipole signal is dominated by
the most massive clusters, with a statistical significance better than 99\%,
slightly larger than in WMAP. Since both data sets differ in foreground
contributions, instrumental noise and other systematics, the agreement between
WMAP and Planck dipoles argues against them being due to systematic effects in
either of the experiments.

  Fading Precoding and Decoding","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  A wireless massive MIMO system entails a large number (tens or hundreds) of
base station antennas serving a much smaller number of users, with large gains
in spectral-efficiency and energy-efficiency compared with conventional MIMO
technology. Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular massive MIMO
system, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends
to infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular
interference. This interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link
training sequences (pilot contamination) by users in different cells.
  We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell
interference in massive MIMO systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular
precoding, which we call Large-Scale Fading Precoding (LSFP). The main idea of
LSFP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to users from
different cells that re-use the same training sequence. Crucially, the
combining coefficients depend only on the slow-fading coefficients between the
users and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its
LSFP-combined symbols using conventional linear precoding that is based on
estimated fast-fading coefficients. Further, we derive estimates for downlink
and uplink SINRs and capacity lower bounds for the case of massive MIMO systems
with LSFP and a finite number of base station antennas.

for downlink multi-cell precoding. In the context of massive multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems where each BS is equipped with a large number of
antennas, sharing instant fading channel coefficients consumes a large amount
of resource. To consider practically implementable methods, we study in this
paper interference reduction based on precoding using the large-scale fading
coefficients that depend on the path-loss model and are independent of a
specific antenna. We focus on the downlink multi-cell precoding designs when
each BS is equipped with a practically finite number of antennas. In this
operation regime, pilot contamination is not the dominant source of
interference, and mitigation of all types of interference is required. This
paper uses an optimization approach to design precoding methods for equal
qualities of service (QoS) to all users in the network, i.e.,maximizing the
minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among all users. The
formulated optimization is proved to be quasi-convex, and can be solved
optimally. We also propose low-complexity suboptimal algorithms through uplink
and downlink duality. Simulation results show that the proposed precoding
methods improve 5% outage rate for more than 1000 times, compared to other
known interference mitigation techniques.

the primordial initial mass function may have extended to sub-solar masses. If
Pop III stars with masses < 0.8 M_Sun did form, then they should still be
present in the Galaxy today as either main sequence or red giant stars. Despite
broad searches, however, no primordial stars have yet been identified. It has
long been recognized that the initial metal-free nature of primordial stars
could be masked due to accretion of metal-enriched material from the
interstellar medium (ISM). Here we point out that while gas accretion from the
ISM may readily occur, the accretion of dust from the ISM can be prevented due
to the pressure of the radiation emitted from low-mass stars. This implies a
possible unique chemical signature for stars polluted only via accretion,
namely an enhancement in gas phase elements relative to those in the dust
phase. Using Pop III stellar models, we outline the conditions in which this
signature could be exhibited, and we derive the expected signature for the case
of accretion from the local ISM. Intriguingly, due to the large fraction of
iron depleted into dust relative to that of carbon and other elements, this
signature is similar to that observed in many of the so-called carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We therefore suggest that some fraction of the
observed CEMP stars may, in fact, be accretion-polluted Pop III stars.

refer to as the Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg compactification. For G=GL_n certain
smooth open substacks of this compactification have already appeared in the
work of Drinfeld and of L. Lafforgue on the Langlands correspondence for
function fields. The Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg compactification is however
already singular for G=SL_2; questions about its singularities arise naturally
in the geometric Langlands program, and form the topic of the present article.
  Drinfeld's definition of the compactification for a general reductive group G
relies on the Vinberg semigroup of G, and will be given in [Sch]. In the
present paper we focus on the case G=SL_2. In this case the compactification
can alternatively be viewed as a canonical one-parameter degeneration of the
moduli space of SL_2-bundles. We study the singularities of this degeneration
via the weight-monodromy theory of its nearby cycles: We give an explicit
description of the nearby cycles sheaf in terms of certain novel perverse
sheaves which we call ""Picard-Lefschetz oscillators"" and which govern the
singularities of the degeneration. We then use this description to determine
its intersection cohomology sheaf and other invariants of its singularities.
  We also discuss the relationship of our results for G=SL_2 with the
miraculous duality of Drinfeld and Gaitsgory in the geometric Langlands
program, as well as two applications of our results to the classical theory: To
Drinfeld's and Wang's ""strange"" invariant bilinear form on the space of

orbits challenge the established binary evolution paradigm that predicts
efficient orbital circularization during the mass transfer episode that spins
up the pulsar. Freire and Tauris (2014) recently proposed that these binary
MSPs may instead form from the rotationally delayed accretion-induced collapse
of a massive WD. This scenario predicts that eccentric systems preferably host
low-mass pulsars and travel with small systemic velocities - in tension with
new observational constraints. Here, I show that a substantial growth in
eccentricity may alternatively arise from the dynamical interaction of the
binary with a circumbinary disk. Such a disk may form from ejected donor
material during hydrogen flash episodes, when the neutron star is already an
active radio pulsar and tidal forces can no longer circularize the binary. I
demonstrate that a short-lived ($10^{4}-10^{5}$ \,yr) disk can result to
eccentricities of $e\sim0.01-0.15$ for orbital periods between 15 and 50 days.
Finally, I propose that, more generally, the disk hypothesis may explain the
lack of circular binary pulsars for the aforementioned orbital-period range.

mechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies to
over-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. On the other hand, some
models are also requiring `positive' AGN feedback, inducing star formation in
the host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.
However, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types of
feedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as few
observations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.
Here we present SINFONI near infrared integral field spectroscopy of XID2028,
an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 QSO detected in the XMM-COSMOS survey, in which
we clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the black
hole) outflow in the [OIII] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity and
outflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. The narrow component
of Ha emission and the rest frame U band flux from HST-ACS imaging enable to
map the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independently
show that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surrounded
by star forming regions on its edge. The outflow is therefore removing the gas
from the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formation
by outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). XID2028
represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedback
simultaneously at work.

derived approximations to its distribution under various asymptotic regimes,
such as degrees of freedom, dimension, or both tending to infinity. However,
several applications involve finite and relative small parameters, for which
the above approximations may be inaccurate. Recently, via a small noise
perturbation approach with fixed dimension and degrees of freedom, Johnstone
and Nadler derived simple yet accurate stochastic approximations to the
distribution of Roy's largest root in the real valued case, under a rank-one
alternative. In this paper, we extend their results to the complex valued case.
Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the leading eigenvector by developing
new stochastic approximations. Specifically, we derive simple stochastic
approximations to the distribution of the largest eigenvalue under five common
complex single-matrix and double-matrix scenarios. We then apply these results
to investigate several problems in signal detection and communications. In
particular, we analyze the performance of RLR detector in cognitive radio
spectrum sensing and constant modulus signal detection in the high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, we address the problem of

proposed a simple approach according to a distribution characteristic-based

were summarized into the so-called four laws, which were, as it turns out,
definitive negative answers to the doomed quests for perpetual motion machines.
As a matter of fact, one result of Sadi Carnot's work was precisely that the
heat-to-work conversion process is fundamentally limited; as such, it is
considered as a first version of the second law of thermodynamics. Although it
was derived from Carnot's unrealistic model, the upper bound on the
thermodynamic conversion efficiency, known as the Carnot efficiency, became a
paradigm as the next target after the failure of the perpetual motion ideal. In
the 1950's, Jacques Yvon published a conference paper containing the necessary
ingredients for a new class of models, and even a formula, not so different
from that of Carnot's efficiency, which later would become the new efficiency
reference. Yvon's first analysis [...] went fairly unnoticed for twenty years,
until Frank Curzon and Boye Ahlborn published their pedagogical paper about the
effect of finite heat transfer on output power limitation and their derivation
of the efficiency at maximum power, now known as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA)
efficiency. The notion of finite rate explicitly introduced time in
thermodynamics, and its significance cannot be overlooked as shown by the
wealth of works devoted to what is now known as finite-time thermodynamics
since the end of the 1970's. [...] The object of the article is thus to cover
some of the milestones of thermodynamics, and show through the illustrative
case of thermoelectric generators, our model heat engine, that the shift from
Carnot's efficiency to efficiencies at maximum power explains itself naturally

molecular hydrogen density (n(H2)~ 10^4 - 10^7), and ortho/para ratio (opr) of
H2 based on state-to-state reaction rates and explore the resulting
fractionation including the formation of a water ice mantle coating grain
surfaces. We find that the deuterium fractionation exhibits the expected
temperature dependence of large enrichments at low gas temperature. More
significantly the inclusion of water ice formation leads to large D/H ratios in
water ice (>= 10^-2 at 10 K) but also alters the overall deuterium chemistry.
For T < 20 K the implantation of deuterium into ices lowers the overall
abundance of HD which reduces the efficiency of deuterium fractionation at high
density. In agreement with an earlier study, under these conditions HD may not
be the primary deuterium reservoir in the cold dense interstellar medium and
H3+ will be the main charge carrier in the dense centers of pre-stellar cores

general mechanism by which ecosystems are able to maintain high levels of

extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed
environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of
biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid
environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and
diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model
composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions
among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the
circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external
environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic
interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the
children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from
a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with
hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes
bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to
biological interactions are varied.

perform each logical operation, including logical state initialization, logical

particular, adiabatic braiding of different types of holes on the surface leads
to a topologically protected, non-Abelian geometric logical CNOT. Throughout
the computation, quantum information is protected from both small perturbations

of the system size. Also the Hamiltonian terms have weight at most four during
the whole process. The effect of thermal error propagation is considered during
the adiabatic code deformation. With the help of active error correction, this

Furthermore, for both the cases with only pure shaping constraints or joint

that the temperature bias may be the main factor causing the mass bias. At

system such multi-stability and chaos. However, even phase locking may be
guaranteed under any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit
can be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error
caused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and
decoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error
oscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits
extremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in
this direction, available in the literature, examine the probability density of
the phase error and expected number of slipped cycles under stochastic noise in
the signal. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic
systems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions,
properties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors
such as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for
the number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by

to calculate only the low-energy eigenmodes of the reduced matrix using a
matrix filetering technique. This provides a basis for an approximation to

  system with distributed parameters","This preprint is submitted to European Control Conference ECC-2015",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many systems, arising in electrical and electronic engineering are based on
controlled phase synchronization of several periodic processes (""phase
synchronization"" systems, or PSS). Typically such systems are featured by the
gradient-like behavior, i.e. the system has infinite sequence of equilibria
points, and any solution converges to one of them. This property however says
nothing about the transient behavior of the system, whose important qualitative
index is the maximal phase error. The synchronous regime of gradient-like
system may be preceded by cycle slipping, i.e. the increase of the absolute
phase error. Since the cycle slipping is considered to be undesired behavior of
PSSs, it is important to find efficient estimates for the number of slipped
cycles. In the present paper, we address the problem of cycle-slipping for
phase synchronization systems described by integro-differential Volterra
equations with a small parameter at the higher derivative. New effective
estimates for a number of slipped cycles are obtained by means of Popov's
method of ""a priori integral indices"". The estimates are uniform with respect
to the small parameter.

2014 by the IASB, banks will face the next significant methodological challenge
after Basel 2. In this paper, first methodological thoughts are presented, and
ways how to approach underlying questions are proposed. It starts with a
detailed discussion of the structural conservatism in the final standard. The
exposure value iACV(c) (idealized Amortized Cost Value), as originally
introduced in the Exposure Draft 2009 (ED 2009), will be interpreted as
economic value under amortized cost accounting and provides the valuation
benchmark under IFRS 9. Consequently, iACV(c) can be used to quantify
conservatism (ie potential hidden reserves) in the actual implementation of the
final standard and to separate operational side-effects caused by the local
implementation from actual credit risk impacts. The second part continues with
a quantification of expected credit losses based on Impact of Risk(c) instead
of traditional cost of risk measures. An objective framework is suggested which
allows for improved testing of forward looking credit risk estimates during
credit cycles. This framework will prove useful to mitigate overly pro-cyclical
provisioning and to reduce earnings volatility. Finally, an LGD monitoring and
backtesting approach, applicable under regulatory requirements and accounting
standards as well, is proposed. On basis of the NPL Dashboard, part of the
Impact of Risk(c) framework, specific key risk indicators are introduced that
allow for a detailed assessment of collections performance versus LGD in in NPL
portfolio (bucket 3).

are studied in the case of static, spherically symmetric configurations in
General Relativity taking into account the Tolman-Ehrenfest effect. One type of
instabilities is found at low energies, where thermal energy becomes too weak
to halt gravity and another at high energies, where gravitational attraction of
thermal pressure overcomes its stabilizing effect. These turning points of
stability are found to depend on the total rest mass $\mathcal{M}$ over the
radius $R$. The low energy instability is the relativistic generalization of
Antonov instability, which is recovered in the limit $G\mathcal{M} \ll R c^2$
and low temperatures, while in the same limit and high temperatures, the high
energy instability recovers the instability of the radiation equation of state.
In the temperature versus energy diagram of series of equilibria, the two types
of gravothermal instabilities make themselves evident as a double spiral! The
two energy limits correspond also to radius limits. So that, stable static
configurations exist only in between two marginal radii for any fixed energy
with negative thermal plus gravitational energy. Ultimate limits of rest mass,
as well as total mass-energy, are reported. Applications to neutron cores are
discussed.

achievable rate of a two-hop wireless communication link, in which the
communication between a source and a destination is accomplished via a
buffer-aided relay node. It is assumed that there is no direct link between the
source and the destination, and the buffer-aided relay forwards the information
to the destination by employing the decode-and-forward scheme. Given
statistical delay constraints specified via maximum delay and delay violation
probability, the tradeoff between the statistical delay constraints imposed on
any two concatenated queues is identified. With this characterization, the
maximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by this two-hop link are
obtained by determining the effective capacity of such links as a function of
the statistical delay constraints, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at the source
and relay, and the fading distributions of the links. It is shown that
asymmetric statistical delay constraints at the buffers of the source and relay
node can improve the achievable rate. Overall, the impact of the statistical
delay tradeoff on the achievable throughput is provided.
