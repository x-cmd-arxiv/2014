to blur, the combination of applications that interact increases the need to
investigate potential security issues. Although security and forensic
researchers have been able to recover a variety of artifacts, empirical
research has not examined a suite of application artifacts from the perspective
of high-level pattern identification. This research presents a preliminary
investigation into the idea that residual artifacts generated by cloud-based
synchronized applications can be used to identify broad user behavior patterns.
To accomplish this, the researchers conducted a single-case, pretest-posttest,
quasi experiment using a smartphone device and a suite of Google mobile
applications. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it provides a
proof of concept of the extent to which residual data from cloud-based
synchronized applications can be used to broadly identify user behavior
patterns from device data patterns. Second, it highlights the need for security
controls to prevent and manage information flow between BYOD mobile devices and
cloud synchronization services.

necessary to optimize a tunable, quasi-monoenergetic, efficient, low-background
Compton backscattering (CBS) x-ray source that is based on the self-aligned
combination of a laser-plasma accelerator (LPA) and a plasma mirror (PM). The
main findings are: (1) an LPA driven in the blowout regime by 30 TW, 30 fs
laser pulses producesnot only a high-quality, tunable, quasi-monoenergetic
electron beam, but also a high-quality, relativistically intense (a0~1) spent
drive pulse that remains stable in profile and intensity over the LPA tuning
range. (2) A thin plastic film near the gas jet exit retro-reflects the spent
drive pulse efficiently into oncoming electrons to produce CBS x-rays without
detectable bremsstrahlung background. Meanwhile anomalous far-field divergence
of the retro-reflected light demonstrates relativistic ""denting"" of the PM.
Exploiting these optimized LPA and PM conditions, we demonstrate
quasi-monoenergetic (50% FWHM energy spread), tunable (75 to 200 KeV) CBS
x-rays, characteristics previously achieved only on more powerful laser systems
by CBS of a split-off, counter-propagating pulse. Moreover, laser-to-x-ray
photon conversion efficiency ~6e12 exceeds that of any previous LPA-based
quasi-monoenergetic Compton source. Particle-in-cell simulations agree well

lattice theory in mathematics and physics, biology and economics, and computer
science and coding theory. Do lattices also play a role in how the brain
represents information? To answer this question, we focus on higher-dimensional
stimulus domains, with particular emphasis on neural representations of the
physical space explored by an animal. Using information theory, we ask how to
optimize the spatial resolution of neuronal lattice codes.
  We show that the hexagonal activity patterns of grid cells found in the
hippocampal formation of mammals navigating on a flat surface lead to the
highest spatial resolution in a two-dimensional world. For species that move
freely in a three-dimensional environment, the firing fields should be arranged
along a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice or a equally dense non-lattice
variant thereof known as a hexagonal close packing (HCP). This quantitative
prediction could be tested experimentally in flying bats, arboreal monkeys, or
cetaceans. More generally, our theoretical results suggest that the brain
encodes higher-dimensional sensory or cognitive variables with populations of
grid-cell-like neurons whose activity patterns exhibit lattice structures at
multiple, nested scales.

(MOOCs), academic paper review) is an effective and scalable method to evaluate
the products (e.g., assignments, papers) of a large number of agents when the
number of dedicated reviewing experts (e.g., teaching assistants, editors) is
limited. Peer review poses two key challenges: 1) identifying the reviewers'
intrinsic capabilities (i.e., adverse selection) and 2) incentivizing the
reviewers to exert high effort (i.e., moral hazard). Some works in mechanism
design address pure adverse selection using one-shot matching rules, and pure
moral hazard was addressed in repeated games with exogenously given and fixed
matching rules. However, in peer review systems exhibiting both adverse
selection and moral hazard, one-shot or exogenous matching rules do not link
agents' current behavior with future matches and future payoffs, and as we
prove, will induce myopic behavior (i.e., exerting the lowest effort) resulting
in the lowest review quality.
  In this paper, we propose for the first time a solution that simultaneously
solves adverse selection and moral hazard. Our solution exploits the repeated
interactions of agents, utilizes ratings to summarize agents' past review
quality, and designs matching rules that endogenously depend on agents'
ratings. Our proposed matching rules are easy to implement and require no
knowledge about agents' private information (e.g., their benefit and cost
functions). Yet, they are effective in guiding the system to an equilibrium
where the agents are incentivized to exert high effort and receive ratings that
precisely reflect their review quality. Using several illustrative examples, we
quantify the significant performance gains obtained by our proposed mechanism
as compared to existing one-shot or exogenous matching rules.

Exponential/Proportional Fair EXP/PF). The system is judged based on
throughput, Packet Loss Ratio PLR, delay and fairness.A simulation platform
called LTE-Sim has been used to collect the data and produce the paper outcomes

system performance. From the simulation outcomes, the overall system
performance is as follows: throughput is duplicated or tripled based on the

times (PF case) and changed to be a half (MLWDF/EXP cases), and the fairness
stays closer to value of 1. It is considered an efficient and cost effective
way to increase the throughput, coverage and reduce the latency.

out-of-sample performance of strategies for trading the USD.JPY obtained across
multiple algorithm runs. We will also evaluate the differences between
strategies selected according to two different criteria: one relies on the
fitness obtained on the training set only, the second one makes use of an
additional validation dataset. Strategy activity and trade accuracy are
remarkably stable between in and out of sample results. From a profitability
aspect, the two criteria both result in strategies successful on out-of-sample
data but exhibiting different characteristics. The overall best performing
out-of-sample strategy achieves a yearly return of 19%.

new set of mobile computing applications that leverage the proliferating
sensing capabilities of smart-phones. For many of these applications, accurate
estimation of the user heading, as compared to the phone heading, is of
paramount importance. This is of special importance for many crowd-sensing
applications, where the phone can be carried in arbitrary positions and
orientations relative to the user body. Current state-of-the-art focus mainly
on estimating the phone orientation, require the phone to be placed in a
particular position, require user intervention, and/or do not work accurately
indoors; which limits their ubiquitous usability in different applications. In
this paper we present Humaine, a novel system to reliably and accurately
estimate the user orientation relative to the Earth coordinate system.
  Humaine requires no prior-configuration nor user intervention and works
accurately indoors and outdoors for arbitrary cell phone positions and
orientations relative to the user body. The system applies statistical analysis
techniques to the inertial sensors widely available on today's cell phones to
estimate both the phone and user orientation. Implementation of the system on
different Android devices with 170 experiments performed at different indoor
and outdoor testbeds shows that Humaine significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in diverse scenarios, achieving a median accuracy of
$15^\circ$ averaged over a wide variety of phone positions. This is $558\%$
better than the-state-of-the-art. The accuracy is bounded by the error in the
inertial sensors readings and can be enhanced with more accurate sensors and
sensor fusion.

unusually strong X-ray obscuration. The resulting dramatic decrease in incident
ionizing flux allowed us to construct a comprehensive physical, spatial and
temporal picture for the long-studied AGN wind in this object. Here we analyze
the UV spectra of the outflow acquired during the campaign as well as from four
previous epochs. We find that a simple model based on a fixed total
column-density absorber, reacting to changes in ionizing illumination, matches
the very different ionization states seen in five spectroscopic epochs spanning
16 years. Absorption troughs from C III* appeared for the first time during our
campaign. From these troughs, we infer that the main outflow component is
situated at 3.5+-1 pc from the central source. Three other components are
situated between 5-70 pc and two are further than 100 pc. The wealth of
observational constraints and the disparate relationship of the observed X-ray
and UV flux between different epochs make our physical model a leading
contender for interpreting trough variability data of quasar outflows.

globular clusters. The semi-analytical models show that DF (which is the only
evolutionary mechanism at work) is responsible for the formation of a bimodal
distribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of the
cluster. However, these models fail to reproduce the formation of the
long-lived central peak observed in all dynamically evolved clusters. The
results of $N$-body simulations confirm the formation of a sharp central peak,
which remains as a stable feature over the time regardless of the initial
concentration of the system. In spite of a noisy behavior, a bimodal
distribution forms in many cases, with the size of the dip increasing as a
function of time. In the most advanced stages the distribution becomes
monotonic. These results are in agreement with the observations. Also the shape
of the peak and the location of the minimum (which in most of the cases is
within 10 core radii) turn out to be consistent with observational results. For
a more detailed and close comparison with observations, including a proper
calibration of the timescales of the dynamical processes driving the evolution
of the BSS spatial distribution, more realistic simulations will be necessary.

Jeans equation analysis for dwarfs. (1) We show that spiral, Im, and Sph
galaxies with absolute magnitudes M_V > -18 form a sequence of decreasing
baryon-to-DM surface density with decreasing luminosity. We suggest that this
is a sequence of decreasing baryon retention vs. supernova-driven losses or
decreasing baryon capture after cosmological reionization. (2) The structural
differences between S+Im and Sph galaxies are small. Both are affected mostly
by the physics that controls baryon depletion. (3) There is a linear
correlation between the maximum rotation velocities of baryonic disks and the
outer circular velocities V_circ of test particles in their DM halos. Baryons
become unimportant at V_circ = 42+-4 km/s. Smaller galaxies are dim or dark.

enough to help to solve the ""Too Big To Fail"" problem with DM galaxy formation.

in bulk. When the node-lines are projected on to surfaces to form circles,
""drumhead"" like flat surface bands nestled inside of the circles are formed.

realization of multiple-qubit quantum gates. Universal multiple-qubit gates can
be implemented by a set of universal single qubit gates and any one kind of
two-qubit gate, such as a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. Semiconductor quantum dot
qubits are a leading approach for the physical implementation of quantum
computation, due to their potential for large-scale integration. Two-qubit gate
operations have been so far only demonstrated in individual electron spin-based
quantum dot systems. Due to the relatively short de-coherence time, charge
qubits in quantum dots are generally considered to be inferior for going beyond
single qubit level. Here, we demonstrate the benchmarking CNOT gate in two
capacitively coupled charge qubits, each consisting of an electron confined in
a GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot. Owing to the strong inter-qubit coupling
strength, gate operations with a clock speed up to 5GHz has been realized. A
processing tomography shows encouragingly that the universal two-qubit gate
operations have comparable fidelities to that of spin-based two-qubit gates.
Our results suggest that semiconductor charge qubits have a considerable
potential for scalable quantum computing and may stimulate the use of
long-range Coulomb interaction for coherent quantum control in other devices.

and agricultural applications. Traditionally, because of large sample
properties for data over a large threshold value, generalised Pareto (GP)
distributions are often used for modelling extreme rainfall. It can be shown
that under certain conditions the generalised hyperbolic (GH) distributions can
approximate the power law decay of the GP distribution in the tails. Given
their flexible form, this raises the possibility that distributions from the GH
family serve as a model for the entire rainfall distribution thus avoiding the
need to select a threshold. In this paper, we use a flexible censored
hierarchical model that leverages the GH distribution to accommodate data
subject to heavy tails and an excessive number of zeros. The fitted model
allows estimation of probabilities and return periods of the rainfall extremes,
and it produces narrower credible intervals in the tails than the traditional
GP method. The model not only fits the tails of the rainfall distribution, but
fits the whole distribution very well. It also efficiently represents
short-term dependencies in the data so it is suitable for evaluating duration
over and below thresholds as well as duration of zero rainfall.

scale factor, the temperature, the densities, the Hubble function, and almost
all quantities of cosmological interest (with the exception of t itself) are
elliptic functions of u, in particular they are bi-periodic with respect to a
lattice of the complex plane, when one takes u complex. After recalling the
basics of the theory, we use these explicit expressions, as well as the
experimental constraints on the present values of density parameters (we choose
for the curvature density a small value in agreement with experimental bounds)
to display the evolution of the main cosmological quantities for one real
period 2 omega_r of conformal time (the cosmic time t never end but it goes to
infinity for a finite value u_f < 2 omega_r of u). A given history of the
universe, specified by the measured values of present-day densities, is
associated with a lattice in the complex plane, or with an elliptic curve, and
therefore with two Weierstrass invariants g2, g3. Using the same experimental

modular parameter and the corresponding Klein j-invariant. If one takes the
flat case k=0, the lattice is only defined up to homotheties, and if one,
moreover, neglects the radiation contribution, the j-invariant vanishes and the

controlling the higher order moments of kinetic energy, the issues of
nonergodicity of BT and PB thermostats still persist. In this paper, we propose
a family of modifications for improving their ergodic characteristics. To do
so, we introduce two new measures of configurational temperature (second and
third order) based on the generalized temperature - curvature relationship. The
equations of motion for the existing thermostats are modified by controlling
the relevant higher order temperature variables. The ergodic characteristics of
the proposed modifications are tested using a single harmonic oscillator. For
the PB thermostat, the fastest route to ergodicity is by controlling the usual
configurational and kinetic temperatures along with the $2^{\text{nd}}$ order
configurational temperature. For the BT thermostat, controlling the usual
configurational temperature along with the $2^{\text{nd}}$ order
configurational temperature is sufficient to make it ergodic. Our method also
provides a new ergodic generalization of NH thermostat that reduces to kinetic

separated boundary-layer flow past a bump. Very large optimal gain values are
found, making it possible for small-amplitude noise to be strongly amplified
and to destabilize the flow. The optimal forcing is located close to the summit
of the bump, while the optimal response is the largest in the shear layer. The
largest amplification occurs at frequencies corresponding to eigenvalues which
first become unstable at higher Reynolds number. Nonlinear direct numerical
simulations show that a low level of noise is indeed sufficient to trigger
random flow unsteadiness, characterized here by large-scale vortex shedding.
Next, a variational technique is used to compute efficiently the sensitivity of
optimal gains to steady control (through source of momentum in the flow, or
blowing/suction at the wall). A systematic analysis at several frequencies
identifies the bump summit as the most sensitive region for control with wall
actuation. Based on these results, a simple open-loop control strategy is
designed, with steady wall suction at the bump summit. Linear calculations on
controlled base flows confirm that optimal gains can be drastically reduced at
all frequencies. Nonlinear direct numerical simulations also show that this
control allows the flow to withstand a higher level of stochastic noise without
becoming nonlinearly unstable, thereby postponing bypass transition. In the
supercritical regime, sensitivity analysis of eigenvalues supports the choice

interference on the desired signal from the blocker signal transmitted over the

zero-IF receivers are not applicable to low-IF receivers. In zero-IF receivers,
IQI induces self-interference where the pilots of the image interference are

evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general law on the direction

stochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical
equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can
be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The
wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced
logically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the
general quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed
smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the
classical and quantum phases. The speciation event is explained by the quantum
transition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the
quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for
characterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from
the quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may

suffer dramatically at low signal to noise (SNR) levels. In this paper, we
propose a novel secret key generation algorithm that is based on the estimated
angle of arrival (AoA) between the two legitimate nodes. Our algorithm has an
outstanding performance at very low SNR levels. Our algorithm can exploit
either the Azimuth AoA to generate the secret key or both the Azimuth and
Elevation angles to generate the secret key. Exploiting a second common source
of randomness adds an extra degree of freedom to the performance of our
algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the algorithm that
uses the most commonly used characteristics of the physical layer which are
channel amplitude and phase. We show that our algorithm has a very low bit

  Lattice QCD",,,,,"hep-lat hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using SU(2) lattice QCD in two dimensions, we study diagonal and off-diagonal
gluon propagators in the maximally Abelian gauge (MAG) with U(1)$_3$ Landau
gauge fixing. These propagators are investigated both in momentum space and
coordinate space. The Monte Carlo simulation is performed at $\beta=7.99,
30.5,$ and $120$ on $62^2, 128^2,$ and $256^2$ at the quenched level. In the
momentum space, the transverse component of the diagonal gluon propagator shows
suppression with increasing $\beta$ in the infrared region and the dressing
function at $\beta=120$ has a maximum at $p^2 \simeq 4$GeV, while the
transverse component of the off-diagonal gluon propagator does not show the
$\beta$-dependence and the dressing function does not have a maximum. This
behavior indicates that the effect of the Gribov copies is found for the
diagonal gluon, consistent with the result obtained by the Gribov-Zwanziger
action in the MAG. In addition, this behavior supports that the Abelian
dominance is not found in two dimensions. In the coordinate space, the diagonal
gluon propagator decreases as $\beta$ increases at long distance. In
particular, at $\beta=120$ the diagonal propagator decreases more rapidly with
increasing distance than the off-diagonal propagator. These behaviors also
indicate the presence of Gribov copies and no Abelian dominance in two
dimensions. Furthermore, we also study these propagators at
zero-spatial-momentum. The result suggests that all of the spectral functions
of diagonal and off-diagonal gluons would have negative regions and thus they
show the violation of the Kallen-Lehmann representation.

which are discrete-valued, and this number is likely to keep increasing as chip
complexity rises. Further, the accurate evaluation of a potential design choice
is computationally expensive because it requires detailed cycle-accurate system
simulation. If the discrete parameter space can be embedded into a larger
continuous parameter space, then continuous space techniques can, in principle,
be applied to the system optimization problem. Such continuous space techniques
often scale well with the number of parameters.
  We propose a novel technique for embedding the discrete parameter space into
an extended continuous space so that continuous space techniques can be applied
to the embedded problem using cycle accurate simulation for evaluating the
objective function. This embedding is implemented using simulation-based
ergodic interpolation, which, unlike spatial interpolation, produces the
interpolated value within a single simulation run irrespective of the number of
parameters. We have implemented this interpolation scheme in a cycle-based
system simulator. In a characterization study, we observe that the interpolated
performance curves are continuous, piece-wise smooth, and have low statistical
error. We use the ergodic interpolation-based approach to solve a large
multi-core design optimization problem with 31 design parameters. Our results
indicate that continuous space optimization using ergodic interpolation-based
embedding can be a viable approach for large multi-core design optimization

Five events are observed in several passbands in X-rays, which allows the
determination of the eruptive plasma temperature using a filter ratio method.
We find that the isothermal temperatures vary from 1.6 to 10 MK. These
temperatures are an average weighted toward higher temperature plasma. We
determine the mass constraints of eruptive plasmas by assuming simplified
geometrical structures of the plasma with isothermal plasma temperatures. This
method provides an upper limit to the masses of the observed eruptive plasmas
in X-ray passbands since any clumping causes the overestimation of the mass.
For the other two events, we assume the temperatures are at the maximum
temperature of the XRT temperature response function, which gives a lower limit
of the masses. We find that the masses in XRT, ~3x10 13 - 5x10 14 g, are
smaller in their upper limit than total masses obtained by LASCO, ~1x10 15 g.
In addition, we estimate the radiative loss, thermal conduction, thermal, and
kinetic energies of the eruptive plasma in X-rays. For four events, we find
that the thermal conduction time scales are much shorter than the duration of
eruption. This result implies that additional heating during the eruption may
be required to explain the plasma observations in X-rays for the four events.

can provide more reliable calibrations that preserve more information contained

Optical quantum computation, based on the concepts of KLM and cluster states,
has witnessed experimental realizations of larger and more complex systems in
terms of photon number. Quantum optical systems, which offer long coherence
times and easy manipulation of single qubits, allow us to probe quantum
properties of the light itself and of the physical systems around it. Recently,
a linear scheme for quantum computing, relying on the bosonic nature of
particles, has been proposed and realized experimentally with photons. The
ability to efficiently measure superpositions of quantum states consisting of
several photons is essential to the characterization of such systems. In fact,
the entire field of quantum information completely relies on the ability to
recover quantum states from measurements. However, the characterization of
quantum states requires many measurements, and often necessitates complicated
measurements schemes; for example, characterizing qubits requires measurements.
Here, we utilize structure, inherent to physically interesting quantum states
of light, in order to reduce the complexity in the recovery of a quantum state.
In particular, we devise a method enabling the recovery of three-photon quantum
states from only two-fold correlation measurements in a single setting. The
ability to take two-fold coincidences instead of three-fold offers the recovery
of the quantum states in far less measurements and in a considerably higher
SNR, because detection of two-photon events is much more likely than that of
three-photon ones. The concept suggested here paves the way to further ideas on
structure-based super resolution in quantum state tomography, such as
recovering a quantum state in an unknown basis in a single setup and recovering
the state of several photons without number resolving detectors.

the economic and social elites are continuously shrinking. Is this a natural
social phenomenon? What are the forces that shape this process? We try to
address these questions by studying a Core-Periphery social structure composed
of a social elite, namely, a relatively small but well-connected and highly
influential group of powerful individuals, and the rest of society, the
periphery. Herein, we present a novel axiom-based model for the forces
governing the mutual influences between the elite and the periphery. Assuming a
simple set of axioms, capturing the elite's dominance, robustness, compactness
and density, we are able to draw strong conclusions about the elite-periphery
structure. In particular, we show that a balance of powers between elite and
periphery and an elite size that is sub-linear in the network size are
universal properties of elites in social networks that satisfy our axioms. We
note that the latter is in controversy to the common belief that the elite size
converges to a linear fraction of society (most recently claimed to be 1%). We
accompany these findings with a large scale empirical study on about 100
real-world networks, which supports our results.

grouped into different subsets (contexts) corresponding to different, mutually
incompatible conditions. Within each context the random variables are jointly
distributed, but across different contexts they are stochastically unrelated.
The theory of contextuality is based on the analysis of the extent to which
some of these random variables can be viewed as preserving their identity
across different contexts when one considers all possible joint distributions
imposed on the entire set of the random variables. We illustrate the theory on
three systems of traditional interest in quantum physics (and also in
non-physical, e.g., behavioral studies). These are systems of the
Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky-type, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell-type, and
Suppes-Zanotti-Leggett-Garg-type. Listed in this order, each of them is
formally a special case of the previous one. For each of them we derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for contextuality while allowing for
experimental errors and contextual biases or signaling. Based on the same
principles that underly these derivations we also propose a measure for the
degree of contextuality and compute it for the three systems in question.

breakup of the encounter complex cannot be described, except in special
circumstances, in terms of a first-order process $\{AB\}\rightarrow A+B$.
Briefly, such a description neglects the occurrence of re-encounters, which lie
at the heart of Noyes's theory of diffusion-mediated reactions. The relation
$k=\alpha k_{\mbox{\scriptsize e}}$ becomes valid only when $\alpha$ (the
reaction probability per encounter) is very much smaller than unity
(activation-controlled reactions), or when $\beta$ (the re-encounter
probability) is negligible (as happens in a gas-phase reaction). References to
some works (by the author and his collaborators) which propound the correct

We describe here an alternative algorithm based on the coalescence of N massive

new macro-particles. The local conservation of charge, momentum and energy are
ensured by the resolution of a system of scalar equations. Various simulation
comparisons have been carried out with and without the merging algorithm, from
classical plasma physics problems to extreme scenarios where quantum
electrodynamics is taken into account, showing in addition to the conservation
of local quantities, the good reproducibility of the particle distributions. In
case where the number of particles ought to increase exponentially in the
simulation box, the dynamical merging permits a considerable speedup, and
significant memory savings that otherwise would make the simulations impossible

characterized by the fact that it possesses negative momentum and kinetic
energy and that it gives large negative pressure which acts as antigravity. We
consider phantom harmonic oscillator in comparison to a standard harmonic
oscillator. By using the first law of thermodynamics we explain why the energy
density of the Universe grows when it is filled with phantom. We also show how
the collision of phantom with a standard particle leads to exploration of
energy from the former by the latter (i.e. from phantom to the standard) if
their masses are different. The most striking of our conclusions is that the
collision of phantom and standard particles of the same masses is impossible
unless both of them are at rest and suddenly start moving with the opposite
velocities and kinetic energies. This effect is a classic analogue of a quantum
mechanical particle pair creation in a strong electric field or in physical
vacuum.

commonly many missing or contaminated pixels. This complicates different
analyses including projections on Fourier or other basis functions (for noise
suppression, compression, feature extraction, or retrieval of real-space
patterns), as they require integration over all pixels. Here, we derive
alternative formulations for Discrete Fourier Transform and a common orthogonal
basis by explicit consideration of missing pixels and finite size. Such linear
formulations exclude the nonlinear distortion that would be caused by
multiplication of the complete scattering pattern with the mask function.
Contrary to nonlinear and non-convex phase retrieval optimizations, such
reduced-dimension formulations can be used to fully enforce the constraints and
to retrieve unknown intensities in a linear fashion. Applications are
demonstrated for some typical cases, and extensions to more general cases are

its practicality and power as a tool for the study of electromagnetism. We
carefully develop this natural (Clifford) algebra of the Minkowski spacetime
geometry, with a particular focus on its intrinsic (and often overlooked)
complex structure. Notably, the scalar imaginary that appears throughout the
electromagnetic theory properly corresponds to the unit 4-volume of spacetime
itself, and thus has physical meaning. The electric and magnetic fields are
combined into a single complex and frame-independent bivector field, which
generalizes the Riemann-Silberstein complex vector that has recently resurfaced
in studies of the single photon wavefunction. The complex structure of
spacetime also underpins the emergence of electromagnetic waves, circular
polarizations, the normal variables for canonical quantization, the distinction
between electric and magnetic charge, complex spinor representations of Lorentz
transformations, and the dual (electric-magnetic field exchange) symmetry that
produces helicity conservation in vacuum fields. This latter symmetry manifests
as an arbitrary global phase of the complex field, motivating the use of a
complex vector potential, along with an associated transverse and
gauge-invariant bivector potential, as well as complex (bivector and scalar)
Hertz potentials. Our detailed treatment aims to encourage the use of spacetime
algebra as a readily available and mature extension to existing vector calculus
and tensor methods that can greatly simplify the analysis of fundamentally
relativistic objects like the electromagnetic field.
