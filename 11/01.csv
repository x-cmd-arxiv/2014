according to Yang-Mills Gravity (YMG); a gauge theory of gravity set in flat

singly ionized helium during the recombination epoch are deduced analytically
and then solved numerically. By considering several approximations we find that
the presence of primordial helium and its interaction with Lyman series photons
has a much stronger effect on the overall free electron density in YMG than it
does in the standard, General Relativity (GR) based, model. Compared to the
standard model recombination happens over a much larger range of temperatures,
although there is still a very sharp temperature of last scattering around 2000
K. Since the ionization history of the universe is not directly observable we
discuss how one may use it to predict the CMB power spectrum and thus test YMG.

Forcing-and-Forward (IFF), for communications among multi-pair multiple-antenna

multi antennas relay in the multiple-access and broadcast phases. The proposed
scheme utilizes Integer Forcing Linear Receiver (IFLR) at relay, which uses
equations, i.e., linear integer-combinations of messages, to harness the
intra-pair interference. Accordingly, we propose the design of mean squared
error (MSE) based transceiver, including precoder and projection matrices for
the relay and users, assuming that the perfect channel state information (CSI)
is available. In this regards, in the multiple-access phase, we introduce two
new MSE criteria for the related precoding and filter designs, i.e., the sum of
the equations MSE (Sum-Equation MSE) and the maximum of the equations MSE
(Max-Equation MSE), to exploit the equations in the relay. In addition, the
convergence of the proposed criteria is proven as well. Moreover, in the
broadcast phase, we use the two traditional MSE criteria, i.e. the sum of the
users' mean squred errors (Sum MSE) and the maximum of the users' mean squared
errors (Max MSE), to design the related precoding and filters for recovering
relay's equations by the users. Then, we consider a more practical scenario
with imperfect CSI. For this case, IFLR receiver is modified, and another
transceiver design is proposed, which take into account the effect of channels
estimation error. We evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy and
compare the results with the conventional amplify-and-forward (AF) and
denoise-and-forward (DF) strategies for the same scenario. The results indicate
the substantial superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of the outage

cluster environments have not been thoroughly investigated. Cluster
environments may contain radiation fields of low-energy photons created by
nearby galaxies and/or stars in the intracluster medium that produce diffuse
intracluster light. These radiation fields may absorb very high energy gamma
rays ($E\gtrsim100$ GeV; VHE) and trigger pair cascades with further production
of subsequent generations of gamma rays with lower energies via inverse Compton
scattering on surrounding radiation fields leaving a characteristic imprint in
the observed spectral shape. The change of the spectral shape of the blazar
reflects the properties of its ambient medium. We show, however, that neither
intracluster light nor the radiation field of an individual nearby galaxy can
cause substantial gamma-gamma absorption. Substantial gamma-gamma absorption is
possible only in the case of multiple, $\gtrsim5$, luminous nearby galaxies.
This situation is not found in the local Universe, but may be possible at
larger redshifts ($z\gtrsim2$). Since VHE gamma rays from such distances are
expected to be strongly absorbed by the extragalactic background light, we
consider possible signatures of gamma-ray induced pair cascades by calculating
the expected GeV flux which appears to be below the Fermi sensitivity even for
$\sim10$ nearby galaxies.

$G=(V,E)$, a demand function $\phi\colon V\to\{0,\ldots,d\}$, and an integer
$k$. The question is whether there exists a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices
such that every vertex $v\in V\setminus S$ has at least $\phi(v)$
vertex-disjoint paths to $S$; this abstractly captures questions about placing
servers or warehouses relative to demands. The problem is \NP-hard already for
instances with $d=4$ (Cicalese et al., arXiv '14), admits a log-factor
approximation (Boros et al., Networks '14), and is fixed-parameter tractable in
terms of~$k$ (Lokshtanov, unpublished '14). We prove several results regarding
kernelization and approximation for Vector Connectivity and the variant Vector
$d$-Connectivity where the upper bound $d$ on demands is a fixed constant. For
Vector $d$-Connectivity we give a factor $d$-approximation algorithm and
construct a vertex-linear kernelization, i.e., an efficient reduction to an
equivalent instance with $f(d)k=O(k)$ vertices. For Vector Connectivity we have
a factor $\text{opt}$-approximation and we can show that it has no
kernelization to size polynomial in $k$ or even $k+d$ unless
$\mathsf{NP\subseteq coNP/poly}$, making $f(d)\operatorname{poly}(k)$ optimal
for Vector $d$-Connectivity. Finally, we provide a write-up for fixed-parameter
tractability of Vector Connectivity($k$) by giving an alternative FPT algorithm
based on matroid intersection.

next-to-leading-order single parton scattering contributions at alpha_s^5
dominate the yield at large transverse momenta of the pair. Our analysis
further emphasises the importance of double parton scatterings --which are
expected to dominate the yield at large J/psi-rapidity differences-- at large
invariant masses of the pair in the CMS acceptance, and thereby solve a large
discrepancy between the theory and the CMS data. In addition, we provide the
first exact --gauge-invariant and infrared-safe-- evaluation of a class of

dominance of the double parton scatterings, which significantly deviate from
those for single parton scatterings. Such relations can be used to discriminate

t'Hooft and Parisi, our calculation is performed at zero fermion mass. The

Our result shows that in order to control the systematic effects in the

inflationary era of the Universe. We consider the Perturbed Power Law (PPL)
model of inflation which is a soft deviation from Power Law (PL) inflationary
model. This model captures the effect of higher order derivative of Hubble
parameter during inflation, which in turn leads to a non-zero effective mass
$m_{\rm eff}$ for the inflaton field. The higher order derivatives of Hubble
parameter at leading order sources constant difference in the spectral index
for scalar and tensor perturbation going beyond PL model of inflation. PPL
model have two observable independent parameters, namely spectral index for
tensor perturbation $\nu_t$ and change in spectral index for scalar
perturbation $\nu_{st}$ to explain the observed features in the scalar and
tensor power spectrum of perturbation. From the recent measurements of CMB
power spectra by WMAP, Planck and BICEP-2 for temperature and polarization, we
estimate the feasibility of PPL model with standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
Although BICEP-2 claimed a detection of $r=0.2$, estimates of dust
contamination provided by Planck have left open the possibility that only upper
bound on $r$ will be expected in a joint analysis. As a result we consider
different upper bounds on the value of $r$ and show that PPL model can explain
a lower value of tensor to scalar ratio ($r<0.1$ or $r<0.01$) for a scalar
spectral index of $n_s=0.96$ by having a non-zero value of effective mass of
the inflaton field $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{H^2}$. The analysis with WP+ Planck
likelihood shows a non-zero detection of $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{H^2}$ with
$5.7\,\sigma$ and $8.1\,\sigma$ respectively for $r<0.1$ and $r<0.01$. Whereas,
with BICEP-2 likelihood $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{H^2} = -0.0237 \pm 0.0135$ which

conical refinement monoids which can be obtained as the monoids of isomorphism
classes of finitely generated projective modules over a regular ring. The
analogous realization question for the larger class of exchange rings is also
of interest. A refinement monoid is said to be wild if it cannot be expressed
as a direct limit of finitely generated refinement monoids. In this paper, we
consider the problem of realizing some concrete wild refinement monoids by
regular rings and by exchange rings. The most interesting monoid we consider is
the monoid M obtained by successive refinements of the identity
x_0+y_0=x_0+z_0. This monoid is known to be realizable by the algebra A = K[F]
of the monogenic free inverse monoid F, for any choice of field K, but A is not
an exchange ring. We show that, for any uncountable field K, M is not
realizable by a regular K-algebra, but that a suitable universal localization
of A provides an exchange, non-regular, K-algebra realizing M. For any
countable field F, we show that a skew version of the above construction gives
a regular F-algebra realizing M. Finally, we develop some connections with the
Atiyah Problem for the lamplighter group G (the wreath product of Z/2Z by Z).
We prove that the algebra A can be naturally seen as a *-subalgebra of the
group algebra KG, for any complex subfield K closed under conjugation, and we
determine the structure of the *-regular closure of A in the regular ring of G.
Using this, we show that the subgroup of R generated by the von Neumann
dimensions of matrices over KG contains the rational field.

discuss various aspects of how inferring the energy scale of inflation is
complicated by the fact that the effective strength of gravity as seen by
inflationary quanta necessarily differs from that seen by gravitational
experiments at presently accessible scales. The uncertainty in the former
relative to the latter has to do with the unknown spectrum of universally
coupled particles between laboratory scales and the putative scale of
inflation. These intermediate particles could be in hidden as well as visible
sectors or could also be associated with Kaluza-Klein resonances associated
with a compactification scale below the scale of inflation. We discuss various

discretization of the Cahn-Hilliard equation is based on a convex-splitting of
the associated energy functional. Moreover, the capillary forcing term in the
Darcy equation is separated from the pressure gradient at the time discrete
level by using an operator-splitting strategy. Thus the computation of the
nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation is completely decoupled from the update of
pressure. Finally, a pressure-stabilization technique is used in the update of

determined with a methodology validated by a closure test. NNPDF3.0 uses a
global dataset including HERA-II deep-inelastic inclusive cross-sections, the
combined HERA charm data, jet production from ATLAS and CMS, vector boson
rapidity and transverse momentum distributions from ATLAS, CMS and LHCb, W+c
data from CMS and top quark pair production total cross sections from ATLAS and
CMS. Results are based on LO, NLO and NNLO QCD theory and also include
electroweak corrections. To validate our methodology, we show that PDFs
determined from pseudo-data generated from a known underlying law correctly
reproduce the statistical distributions expected on the basis of the assumed
experimental uncertainties. This closure test ensures that our methodological
uncertainties are negligible in comparison to the generic theoretical and
experimental uncertainties of PDF determination. This enables us to determine
with confidence PDFs at different perturbative orders and using a variety of
experimental datasets ranging from HERA-only up to a global set including the
latest LHC results, all using precisely the same validated methodology. We
explore some of the phenomenological implications of our results for the
upcoming 13 TeV Run of the LHC, in particular for Higgs production

0.25<x<0.50 (with 7K<Tc<16K) to AFM for 0.60<x<1 (with 19K<Tn<47K). The onset
of the AFM phase is associated to a metamagnetic transition with a critical
field increasing from H{cr}=0 at x~0.55 to ~6Tesla at x=1, coincident with an
increasing contribution of the first excited crystal electric field doublet. At
a critical point x{cr}=0.65 a second transition appears at Tl<Tn. In contrast
to observations in itinerant systems like CeRh{2}Si{2} or CeRh{3}B{2}, no
evidences for significant hybridization of the 4f electrons at large Sc

attributed to an increasing RKKY inter-layer interaction as Sc content grows.

We show that the coverability problem for NNCTs is Tower-complete. To our

an infinite set of token types, that has primitive recursive coverability. This
result implies Tower-completeness of coverability for ACPS with shaped stacks.

can be used to measure the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) through the
tidally induced shift in the waveform phase that depends on the tidal
deformability parameter $\lambda$. Previous work has shown that $\lambda$, a
function of the neutron-star EOS and mass, is measurable by Advanced LIGO for a
single event when including tidal information up to the merger frequency. In
this work, we describe a method for stacking measurements of $\lambda$ from
multiple inspiral events to measure the EOS. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo
simulations to estimate the parameters of a 4-parameter piecewise polytrope EOS
that matches theoretical EOS models to a few percent. We find that, for
""realistic"" event rates ($\sim 40$ binary neutron star inspiral events per year
with signal-to-noise ratio $> 8$ in a single Advanced LIGO detector), combining
a year of gravitational-wave data from a three-detector network with the
constraints from causality and recent high mass neutron-star measurements, the
EOS above nuclear density can be measured to better than a factor of two in
pressure in most cases. We also find that in the mass range
$1M_\odot$--$2M_\odot$, the neutron-star radius can be measured to better than
$\pm 1$ km and the tidal deformability can be measured to better than $\pm 1
\times 10^{36}$ g cm$^2$ s$^2$ (10%--50% depending on the EOS and mass). The
overwhelming majority of this information comes from the loudest $\sim 5$

lead to systematic errors in the EOS measurement that are as large as the

polarity reversal process during Cycle 24 using four years (2010.33--2014.33)
of line-of-sight magnetic field measurements from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager. The total flux associated with ARs reached maximum in the north in
2011, more than two years earlier than the south; the maximum is significantly
weaker than Cycle 23. The process of polar field reversal is relatively slow,
north-south asymmetric, and episodic. We estimate that the global axial dipole
changed sign in October 2013; the northern and southern polar fields (mean
above 60$^\circ$ latitude) reversed in November 2012 and March 2014,
respectively, about 16 months apart. Notably, the poleward surges of flux in
each hemisphere alternated in polarity, giving rise to multiple reversals in
the north. We show that the surges of the trailing sunspot polarity tend to
correspond to normal mean AR tilt, higher total AR flux, or slower mid-latitude
near-surface meridional flow, while exceptions occur during low magnetic
activity. In particular, the AR flux and the mid-latitude poleward flow speed
exhibit a clear anti-correlation. We discuss how these features can be
explained in a surface flux transport process that includes a field-dependent
converging flow toward the ARs, a characteristic that may contribute to solar
cycle variability.

applications of this fact. First, we show that if a subgroup $H$ of $Out(\FN)$
quasi-isometrically embeds into the complex of free factors via the orbit map,
then the limit set of $H$ in the boundary of Outer space consists of trees that
are uniquely ergodic and have uniquely ergodic dual lamination. Second, we
describe the Poisson boundary for random walks coming from distributions with
finite first moment with respect to the word metric on $Out(\FN)$: almost every
sample path converges to a tree that is uniquely ergodic and that has a
uniquely ergodic dual lamination, and the corresponding hitting measure on the
boundary of Outer space is the Poisson boundary. This improves a recent result
of Horbez. We also obtain sublinear tracking of sample paths with Lipschitz
geodesic rays.

famous (and to quite a few people, infamous) h-index, of interest to every

their beautiful 1998 article proving, rigorously, by a very deep and intricate

either too hard, or not worth the trouble!

of the observations likely stems from instrumental systematics; Luhman 16A
appears non-variable above $\approx$0.4%. Its spectrum is well fit by a single
cloud layer with intermediate cloud thickness (f_sed=2, Teff=1200 K). Luhman
16B varies at all wavelengths with peak-to-valley amplitudes of 7-11%. The
amplitude and light curve shape changes over only one rotation period. The
lowest relative amplitude is found in the deep water absorption band at 1.4
$\mu$m, otherwise it mostly decreases gradually from the blue to the red edge
of the spectrum. This is very similar to the other two known highly variable
early T dwarfs. A two-component cloud model accounts for most of the
variability, although small deviations are seen in the water absorption band.
We fit the mean spectrum and relative amplitudes with a linear combination of
two models of a warm, thinner cloud (Teff=1300 K, fsed=3) and a cooler, thicker
cloud (Teff=1000-1100 K, f_sed=1), assuming out-of-equilibrium atmospheric
chemistry. A cloud as for Luhman 16A but with holes cannot reproduce the
variability of Luhman 16B, indicating more complex cloud evolution through the
L/T transition. The projected separation of the binary has decreased by
$\approx$0.3'' in 8 months.

lead to variations in the times of transit that are diagnostic of the planetary
masses and the dynamical state of the system. Here we show that synodic
""chopping"" contributions to these transit timing variations (TTVs) can be used
to uniquely measure the masses of planets without full dynamical analyses
involving direct integration of the equations of motion. We present simple
analytic formulae for the chopping signal, which are valid (generally <10%
error) for modest eccentricities e <~ 0.1. Importantly, these formulae
primarily depend on the mass of the perturbing planet, and therefore the
chopping signal can be used to break the mass/free-eccentricity degeneracy
which can appear for systems near first order mean motion resonances. Using a
harmonic analysis, we apply these TTV formulae to a number of Kepler systems
which had been previously analyzed with full dynamical analyses. We show that
when chopping is measured, the masses of both planets can be determined
uniquely, in agreement with previous results, but without the need for
numerical orbit integrations. This demonstrates how mass measurements from TTVs
may primarily arise from an observable chopping signal. The formula for
chopping can also be used to predict the number of transits and timing
precision required for future observations, such as those made by TESS or
PLATO, in order to infer planetary masses through analysis of TTVs.

observed during these years. Linear polarization at 2.2 $\mu m$, its statistics

4 for the number density histogram of fluxes above 5~mJy, the distribution of
polarized flux density is closely linked to the single state power-law
distribution of the total $K_\mathrm{s}$-band flux densities reported earlier.
We find typical polarization degrees of the order of 20\%$\pm$10\% and a
preferred polarization angle of 13$^o$$\pm$15$^o$. Simulations show the
uncertainties under a total flux density of $\sim 2\,{\rm mJy}$ are probably
dominated by observational effects. At higher flux densities there are
intrinsic variations of polarization degree and angle within rather well

synchrotron radiation, this preferred polarization angle we find is very likely
coupled to the intrinsic orientation of the Sgr A* system i.e. a disk or
jet/wind scenario associated with the super massive black hole. If they are
indeed linked to structural features of the source the data imply a rather

Myr$^{-1}$. We include radiative cooling, diffuse heating, and the formation of
molecular gas using a chemical network. The SNe explode either at random
positions, at density peaks, or both. We further present a model combining
thermal energy for resolved and momentum input for unresolved SNe. Random
driving at high SN rates results in hot gas ($T\gtrsim 10^6$ K) filling $> 90$%
of the volume. This gas reaches high pressures ($10^4 < P/k_\mathrm{B} < 10^7$
K cm$^{-3}$) due to the combination of SN explosions in the hot, low density
medium and confinement in the periodic box. These pressures move the gas from a
two-phase equilibrium to the single-phase, cold branch of the cooling curve.
The molecular hydrogen dominates the mass ($>50$%), residing in small, dense
clumps. Such a model might resemble the dense ISM in high-redshift galaxies.
Peak driving results in huge radiative losses, producing a filamentary ISM with
virtually no hot gas, and a small molecular hydrogen mass fraction ($\ll 1$%).
Varying the ratio of peak to random SNe yields ISM properties in between the
two extremes, with a sharp transition for equal contributions. The velocity
dispersion in HI remains $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ in all cases. For peak
driving the velocity dispersion in H$_\alpha$ can be as high as $70$ km
s$^{-1}$ due to the contribution from young, embedded SN remnants.

adatom, we also calculate the electronic structure of a $10 \times 10$

is useful to study spin transport and spin relaxation, we also introduce a
realistic effective hopping Hamiltonian, based on symmetry considerations,
which describes the supercell bands around the Fermi level. We provide the
Hamiltonian parameters which are best fits to the first-principles data. We
demonstrate that, unlike for the case of hydrogen adatoms, fluorine's own
spin-orbit coupling is the principal cause of the giant induced local
spin-orbit coupling in graphene. The $sp^3$ hybridization induced transfer of
spin-orbit coupling from graphene's $\sigma$ bonds, important for hydrogenated
graphene, contributes much less. Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced
spin-orbit coupling due to fluorine adatoms is about $1000$ times more than
that of pristine graphene, and 10 times more than that of hydrogenated
graphene. Also unlike hydrogen, the fluorine adatom is not a narrow resonant
scatterer at the Dirac point. The resonant peak in the density of states of
fluorinated graphene in the dilute limit lies 260 meV below the Dirac point.
The peak is rather broad, about 300 meV, making the fluorine adatom only a

implementation of quantum information processing since they allow for a quantum
interface between stationary spin qubits and propagating single photons. In the
meanwhile, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers have moved to the
forefront of solid-state research due to their unique band structure featuring
a large band gap with degenerate valleys and non-zero Berry curvature. Here we
report the observation of quantum dots in monolayer tungsten-diselenide with an
energy that is 20 to 100 meV lower than that of two dimensional excitons.
Photon antibunching in second-order photon correlations unequivocally
demonstrates the zero-dimensional anharmonic nature of these quantum emitters.
The strong anisotropic magnetic response of the spatially localized emission
peaks strongly indicates that radiative recombination stems from localized
excitons that inherit their electronic properties from the host TMD. The large
$\sim$ 1 meV zero-field splitting shows that the quantum dots have singlet
ground states and an anisotropic confinement most likely induced by impurities

19, 2014 presented an extremely rare opportunity to obtain the first flyby
quality data of the nucleus and inner coma of a dynamically new comet. However,
the comet's dust tail potentially posed an impact hazard to those spacecraft.
To characterize the comet at large heliocentric distances, study its long-term
evolution, and provide critical inputs to hazard modeling, we imaged C/Siding
Spring with the Hubble Space Telescope when the comet was at 4.58, 3.77, and
3.28 AU from the Sun. The dust production rate, parameterized by the quantity
Af$\rho$, was 2500, 2100, and 1700 cm (5000-km radius aperture) for the three
epochs, respectively. The color of the dust coma is 5.0$\pm$0.3$\%$/100 nm for
the first two epochs, and 9.0$\pm$0.3$\%$/100 nm for the last epoch, and
reddens with increasing cometocentric distance out to ~3000 km from the
nucleus. The spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of the dust color
are most consistent with the existence of icy grains in the coma. Two jet-like
dust features appear in the north-northwest and southeast directions projected
in the sky plane. Within each epoch of 1-2 hour duration, no temporal
variations were observed for either feature, but the PA of the southeastern
feature varied between the three epochs by ~30$^\circ$. The dust feature
morphology suggests two possible orientations for the rotational pole of the
nucleus, (RA, Dec) = (295$^\circ\pm$5$^\circ$, +43$^\circ\pm$2$^\circ$) and
(190$^\circ\pm$10$^\circ$, 50$^\circ\pm$5$^\circ$), or their diametrically

identities in gauge theories, and follow essentially from diffeomorphism
invariance alone. Yet because quantization requires diffeomorphism invariance
to be broken, they not only reflect invariance under diffeomorphisms, but also
how the latter has been broken by gauge fixing terms. In order to not lose the
symmetry altogether, we cannot simply set some fields to zero, as is usually
done in cosmological perturbation theory, but need to decouple them smoothly
and make sure that they do not contribute to cosmological correlators in the
decoupling limit. We use these identities to derive a set of consistency
relations between bispectra and power spectra of cosmological perturbations in
different gauges. Without additional assumptions, these consistency relations
just seem to reflect the redundancy implied by diffeomorphisms. But when
combined with analyticity, in a formulation of the theory in which auxiliary

out of a prolonged coronal X-ray minimum, as documented by Chandra, while B was
rising to, then falling from, a peak of its long-term (8 yr) starspot cycle.
The FUV fluxes of the primary were steady over most of the STIS period,
although the [Fe XII] 124 nm coronal forbidden line (T= 1.5 MK) partly mirrored
the slowly rising X-ray fluxes. The FUV emissions of the secondary more closely
tracked the rise and fall of its coronal luminosities, especially the ""hot
lines"" like Si IV, C IV, and N V (T= 80,000-200,000 K), and coronal [Fe XII]
itself. The hot lines of both stars were systematically redshifted, relative to
narrow chromospheric emissions, by several km/s, showing little change in
amplitude over the 4-year period; especially for Alpha Cen B, despite the
significant evolution of its coronal activity. Further, the hot line profiles
of both stars, individually and epoch-averaged, could be decomposed into two
nearly equal components, one narrow (FWHM~ 25-45 km/s), the other broad (60-80
km/s). Not much variation of the component properties was seen over the 4-year

due to the absence of a unique minimum in the single-particle dispersion where
macroscopic number of bosons can condense. Here we consider a family of
tight-binding models with macroscopically degenerate lowest energy band,
separated from other bands by a gap. We predict the formation of exotic states
that spontaneously break rotational symmetry at relatively low filling. These
states belong to three nematic phases: Wigner crystal, supersolid, and
superfluid. The Wigner crystal phase is established exactly at low filling.
Supersolid and superfluid phases, at larger filling, are obtained by making use
of a projection onto the flat band, construction of an appropriate Wannier
basis, and subsequent mean-field treatment. The nematic superfluid that we
predict is uniform in real space but has an anisotropic momentum distribution,
providing a novel scenario for Bose condensation with an additional nematic
order. Our findings open up a promising direction of studying microscopic
quantum liquid crystalline phases of bosons.

Suzaku X-ray spectra for the central regions of the four X-ray brightest galaxy
clusters: Perseus, Coma, Virgo and Ophiuchus. We employ an optimized energy
range for our analysis (3.2-5.3 keV) that is relatively free of instrumental
features, and a baseline plasma emission model that incorporates the abundances
of elements with the strongest expected emission lines at these energies (S,
Ar, Ca) as free parameters. For the Perseus Cluster core, employing this
baseline model, we find evidence for an additional emission feature at an
energy $3.51^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ keV with a flux of ~$2.87\times10^{-7}$
ph/s/cm^2/arcmin^2. At slightly larger radii, we detect an emission line at
3.59+/-0.02 keV with a flux of ~$4.8\times10^{-8}$ ph/s/cm^2/arcmin^2. The
energies and fluxes of these features are broadly consistent with previous
claims, although the radial variation of the line strength appears in tension
with standard dark matter (DM) model predictions. Assuming a decaying DM origin
for the Perseus emission features allows us to predict the energies and line
fluxes for the other clusters in our sample. Critically, we do not detect an
emission feature at the predicted energy and line flux in the Coma, Virgo and
Ophiuchus clusters. The formal 99.5 per cent upper limits on the strengths of
an emission line in each cluster are below the decaying DM model predictions,
scaling from the Perseus Cluster center, apparently ruling the model out. In
the light of these results, we search for other explanations for the ~3.55 keV
emission feature in Perseus. Our results suggest that systematic effects
associated with modeling the complex spectra for the Perseus Cluster core,
details of the assumed ionization balance, and errors in the predicted
emissivities of the spectral lines may in part be responsible for the ~3.5 keV

risk neutral than agents because it operates at a longer time-scale, quantifies
social cost with the total expected delay along routes. From that perspective,
agents may make suboptimal decisions that degrade long-term quality. We define
the {\em price of risk aversion} (PRA) as the worst-case ratio of the social
cost at a risk-averse Wardrop equilibrium to that where agents are
risk-neutral. For networks with general delay functions and a single

tolerance and on the degree of variability present in the network. In contrast
to the {\em price of anarchy}, in general the PRA increases when the network
gets larger but it does not depend on the shape of the delay functions. To get
this result we rely on a combinatorial proof that employs alternating paths

state-of-the-art methods find dense subgraphs on the affinity graph as the
dominant clusters. However, the time and space complexity of those methods are
dominated by the construction of the affinity graph, which is quadratic with
respect to the number of data points, and thus impractical on large data sets.
To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we apply Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
and develop a scalable algorithm, Approximate Localized Infection Immunization
Dynamics (ALID). The major idea is to perform Localized Infection Immunization
Dynamics (LID) to find dense subgraph within local range of the affinity graph.
LID is further scaled up with guaranteed high efficiency and detection quality
by an estimated Region of Interest (ROI) and a carefully designed Candidate
Infective Vertex Search method (CIVS). ALID only constructs small local
affinity graphs and has a time complexity of O(C(a^*+ {\delta})n) and a space
complexity of O(a^*(a^*+ {\delta})), where a^* is the size of the largest
dominant cluster and C << n and {\delta} << n are small constants. We
demonstrate by extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real world data
that ALID achieves state-of-the-art detection quality with much lower time and
space cost on single machine. We also demonstrate the encouraging
parallelization performance of ALID by implementing the Parallel ALID (PALID)
on Apache Spark. PALID processes 50 million SIFT data points in 2.29 hours,
achieving a speedup ratio of 7.51 with 8 executors.

use of the cosine change of variables, trigonometric polynomials and, to avoid

Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations,

its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice,
operations research and revenue management, little is known about this
question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and
statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible.
However, even learning mixture with two MNL components is infeasible in
general.
  Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to
learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient
manner. We present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for
learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In
particular, a mixture of $r$ MNL components over $n$ objects can be learnt
using samples whose size scales polynomially in $n$ and $r$ (concretely,
$r^{3.5}n^3(log n)^4$, with $r\ll n^{2/7}$ when the model parameters are
sufficiently incoherent). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the
pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second,
learn the model parameters for each component using Rank Centrality introduced

generalization of existing analysis for tensor decomposition to a more

dynamical patterns that emerge among a set of nodes that interact in a
dynamically evolving signed random network. Node interactions take place at
random on a sequence of deterministic signed graphs. Each node receives
positive or negative recommendations from its neighbors depending on the sign
of the interaction arcs, and updates its state accordingly. Recommendations
along a positive arc follow the standard consensus update. As in the work by
Altafini, negative recommendations use an update where the sign of the neighbor
state is flipped. Nodes may weight positive and negative recommendations
differently, and random processes are introduced to model the time-varying
attention that nodes pay to these recommendations. Conditions for almost sure
convergence and divergence of the node states are established. We show that
under this so-called state-flipping model, all links contribute to a consensus
of the absolute values of the nodes, even under switching sign patterns and
dynamically changing environment. A no-survivor property is established,
indicating that every node state diverges almost surely if the maximum network

population dynamical models resulting from individual pairwise interactions is
proposed. Individuals are characterized by a continuous strategy that
represents all their behavioral, morphological, and functional traits.
Populations group conspecific individuals with identical strategy and are
measured by densities in space. Species can be monomorphic, if only one
strategy is present, or polymorphic otherwise. The procedure highlights the
structural properties fulfilled by the population per-capita growth rates. In
particular, the effect of perturbing a set of similar strategies is
proportional to the product of the corresponding densities, with a
proportionality coefficient that is density-dependent only through the total
density. This generalizes the law of mass action, which traditionally refers to
the case in which the per-capita growth rates are linearly density-dependent
and insensitive to joint strategy perturbations. Being underpinned with
individual strategies, the proposed procedure is most useful for evolutionary
considerations, in the case strategies are inheritable. The developed body of
theory is exemplified on a Holling-type-II many-prey-one-predator system and on

  reducibility","21 pages, submitted",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of the global structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers with
respect to the quasi-orders of Rudin-Keisler and Rudin-Blass reducibility was
initiated in the 1970s by Blass, Keisler, Kunen, and Rudin. In a 1973 paper
Blass studied the special class of P-points under the quasi-ordering of
Rudin-Keisler reducibility. He asked what partially ordered sets can be
embedded into the P-points when the P-points are equipped with this ordering.
This question is of most interest under some hypothesis that guarantees the
existence of many P-points, such as Martin's axiom for $\sigma$-centered
posets. In his 1973 paper he showed under this assumption that both
${\omega}_{1}$ and the reals can be embedded. This result was later repeated
for the coarser notion of Tukey reducibility. We prove in this paper that
Martin's axiom for $\sigma$-centered posets implies that every partial order of
size at most continuum can be embedded into the P-points both under
Rudin-Keisler and Tukey reducibility.

synchronized stream of videos, acquired from sensors with non-overlapping
fields of view. We adopt Markov Logic Network(MLN) as a tool to model
uncertainty in observations, and fuse information extracted from heterogeneous

pure empirical learning by incorporating domain knowledge, in the form of
user-defined rules and confidences associated with them. This work demonstrates
that the MLN based decision control system can be made scalable to model
statistical relations between a variety of entities and over long video

illustrate the mathematical soundness and wide-ranging applicability of our
approach.

winds, these may be detected in clusters through their interaction with
ionising radiation from massive stars. We argue that in the ONC (Orion Nebula
Cluster) one should see $\sim$ 10s of `X-ray proplyds' ( objects with optically
imaged offset ionisation fronts) in the range $0.3-0.6$pc from $\theta_1$C Ori
(the dominant O star in the ONC). Such objects lie outside the central `FUV
zone' in the ONC where proplyds are instead well explained by neutral winds
driven by external Far Ultraviolet (FUV) emission from $\theta_1$C. We show
that the predicted numbers and sizes of X-ray proplyds are compatible with
those observed and that this may also explain at least some of the far flung
proplyds seen in the Carina nebula. We compare the sizes of observed proplyds
outside the FUV region of the ONC with model predictions based on the current
observed X-ray luminosities of these sources ( bearing in mind that the current
size is actually set by the X-ray luminosity a few hundred years ago, $\sim$
the flow time to the ionisation front). We discuss whether variability on this
timescale can plausibly explain proplyd size data on a case by case basis. We
also show that the predicted radio free-free emission signature of X-ray
proplyds is readily detectable. Monitoring is however required to distinguish
such emission from non-thermal emission from active coronae. We also predict
that it is only at $> 1$ pc from $\theta_1$C that the free-free emission from
such offset ionised structures would be clearly distinguishable from an
externally driven ionised disc wind. We argue that the fortuitous proximity of
massive stars in the ONC can be used as a beacon to light up internally driven
X-ray winds and that this is a promising avenue for observationally testing
X-ray photoevaporation.

fast submodular function minimization (SFM) has become a critical problem.
Theoretically, unconstrained SFM can be performed in polynomial time [IFF 2001,
IO 2009]. However, these algorithms are typically not practical. In 1976, Wolfe
proposed an algorithm to find the minimum Euclidean norm point in a polytope,
and in 1980, Fujishige showed how Wolfe's algorithm can be used for SFM. For
general submodular functions, this Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm algorithm seems
to have the best empirical performance.
  Despite its good practical performance, very little is known about Wolfe's
minimum norm algorithm theoretically. To our knowledge, the only result is an
exponential time analysis due to Wolfe himself. In this paper we give a maiden
convergence analysis of Wolfe's algorithm. We prove that in $t$ iterations,
Wolfe's algorithm returns an $O(1/t)$-approximate solution to the min-norm
point on {\em any} polytope. We also prove a robust version of Fujishige's
theorem which shows that an $O(1/n^2)$-approximate solution to the min-norm
point on the base polytope implies {\em exact} submodular minimization. As a
corollary, we get the first pseudo-polynomial time guarantee for the
Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm algorithm for unconstrained submodular function
minimization.

They are formed in dark matter minihalos of $\rm 10^5-10^6 M_{\odot}$ at
$z=20-30$. Recent high resolution cosmological simulations show that a
protostellar disk forms as a consequence of gravitational collapse and
fragments into multiple clumps. However, it is not entirely clear if these
clumps will be able to survive to form multiple stars as simulations are unable
to follow the disk evolution for longer times. In this study, we employ a
simple analytical model to derive the properties of marginally stable
steady-state disks. Our results show that the stability of the disk depends on
the critical value of the viscous parameter $\alpha$. For $\alpha_{crit} = 1$,
the disk is stable for an accretion rate of $\rm \leq 10^{-3} M_{\odot}/yr$ and
becomes unstable at radii about $\rm \geq 100 AU$ in the presence of an
accretion rate of $\rm 10^{-2} M_{\odot}/yr$. For $0.06 < \alpha_{crit} < 1$,
the disk can be unstable for both accretion rates. The comparison of the
migration and the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scales shows that clumps are expected
to migrate inward before reaching the main sequence. Furthermore, in the
presence of a massive central star the clumps within the central 1 AU will be
tidally disrupted. We also find that UV feedback from the central star is
unable to disrupt the disk, and that photo-evaporation becomes important only
once the accretion rate has dropped to $\rm 2 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}/yr$. As
a result, the central star may reach a mass of 100 $\rm M_{\odot}$ or even
higher.

and Mopra telescopes have been carried out towards these regions. A clumpy
distribution of dense molecular clumps is revealed with 7 pc spatial
resolution. Large velocity gradient analysis shows that the molecular hydrogen
densities ($n({\rm H}_2)$) of the clumps are distributed from low to high
density ($10^3$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) and their kinetic temperatures ($T_{\rm
kin}$) are typically high (greater than $50$ K). These clumps seem to be in the
early stages of star formation, as also indicated from the distribution of
H$\alpha$, young stellar object candidates, and IR emission. We found that the
N48 region is located in the high column density HI envelope at the interface
of the two SGSs and the star formation is relatively evolved, whereas the N49
region is associated with LMC 5 alone and the star formation is quiet. The
clumps in the N48 region typically show high $n({\rm H}_2)$ and $T_{\rm kin}$,
which are as dense and warm as the clumps in LMC massive cluster-forming areas

conservation strategies and support the selection of starting material for
breeding programs. Diversity measures applied to crops usually have been
limited to the assessment of genome polymorphism at the DNA level.
Occasionally, selected morphological features are recorded and the content of
key chemical constituents determined, but unbiased and comprehensive chemical
phenotypes have not been included systematically in diversity surveys. Our
objective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by
nontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between
metabolic and genome diversity in this crop. Results: Ten sesame accessions
were selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in
India, Western Asia, Sudan and Venezuela based on previous AFLP studies.
Ethanolic seed extracts were separated by HPLC, metabolites were ionized by
positive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass
spectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000. Genome diversity was
determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) using eight primer
pair combinations. The relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at
the metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate
statistics. Conclusion: Patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic
levels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the
evolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. This result implies that when used
for the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity
assessment based on neutral DNA markers should be complemented with metabolic
profiles. We hypothesize that this applies to all crops with a long history of
domestication that possess commercially relevant traits affected by chemical
phenotypes.

strategies for transcription profiling. Gel-based analysis of cDNA fragments
allows to detect alterations in gene expression for genes which have neither
been sequenced yet nor are available in cDNA libraries. Commonly used protocols
are cDNA Differential Display (DDRT-PCR) and cDNA-AFLP. Both methods have been
used merely as qualitative gene discovery tools so far. Results: We developed
procedures for the conversion of DDRT-PCR data into quantitative transcription
profiles. Amplified cDNA fragments are separated on a DNA sequencer. Data
processing consists of four steps: (i) cDNA bands in lanes corresponding to
samples treated with the same primer combination are matched in order to
identify fragments originating from the same transcript, (ii) intensity of
bands is determined by densitometry, (iii) densitometric values are normalized,
and (iv) intensity ratio is calculated for each pair of corresponding bands.
Transcription profiles are represented by sets of intensity ratios (control vs.
treatment) for cDNA fragments defined by primer combination and DNA mobility.
We demonstrated the procedure by analyzing DDRT-PCR data on the effect of
secondary metabolites of oilseed rape Brassica napus on the transcriptome of
the pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. Conclusion: We developed a data
processing procedure for quantitative analysis of amplified cDNA fragments. The
system utilizes common software and provides an open-end alternative to
microarray analysis. The processing is expected to work equally well with
DDRT-PCR and cDNA-AFLP data and be useful in research on organisms for which
microarray analysis is not available or economical.

by a time-correlated compressible renewing flow. We show that the preferential
sampling of the phase space performed by tracers yields significant differences
between the Lagrangian statistics and its Eulerian counterpart. In particular,
the effective compressibility experienced by tracers has a non-trivial
dependence on the time correlation of the flow. We examine the consequence of
this phenomenon on the clustering of tracers, focusing on the transition from
the weak- to the strong-clustering regime. We find that the critical
compressibility at which the transition occurs is minimum when the time
correlation of the flow is of the order of the typical eddy turnover time.
Further, we demonstrate that the clustering properties in time-correlated
compressible flows are non-universal and are strongly influenced by the
spatio-temporal structure of the velocity field.

distinguished from \emph{steady systems}, in which parameters are constant. In
particular, in steady systems the excitation is either constant (e.g. nought)
or periodic with amplitude, frequency and phase angle which do not vary in
time. We apply our method to systems which are subjected to a transient
excitation, which is neither constant nor periodic. The effect of switching-off
and full-transient forces is investigated. The former can be representative of
switching-off procedures in machines; the latter can represent earthquake
vibrations, wind gusts, etc. acting on a mechanical system. This class of
transient systems can be seen as the evolution of an ordinary steady system
into another ordinary steady system, for both of which the classical theory of
dynamical systems holds. The evolution from a steady system to the other is
driven by a transient force, which is regarded as a map between the two steady
systems.

To overcome this difficulty, we invoke the large-system assumption, which
allows a deterministic approximation to the ergodic mutual information.
Leveraging results from random matrix theory, we are able to characterize the

obviates the need in the conventional analyses for an independent, necessarily

from the total specific heat to obtain the electron contribution. It eliminates
the uncertainties and errors in the electron contribution that follow from the

is comprised of contributions from two electron bands with
superconducting-state energy gaps that differ by a factor 3.8, with 77$\%$
coming from the band with the larger gap. The variation of the specific heat
with magnetic field is consistent with extended $s$-wave pairing, one of the
theoretical predictions. The relation between the densities of states and the
energy gaps in the two bands is not consistent with a theoretical model based
on interband interactions alone. Comparison of the normal-state density of

handful of pulsars that appear beyond the main pulse emission, in some cases
far away from it. In this paper we attempt to characterize the PPC emission in
relation to the pulsar main pulse geometry. In our analysis we find that PPC
components have properties very different from that of outer conal emission.
The separation of the PPC components from the main pulse center remains
constant with frequency. In addition the beam opening angles corresponding to
the separation of PPC components from the pulsar center are much larger than
the largest encountered in conal emission. Pulsar radio emission is believed to
originate within the magnetic polar flux tubes due to the growth of
instabilities in the outflowing relativistic plasma. Observationally, there is
strong evidence that the main pulse emission originates at altitudes of about
50 neutron star radii for a canonical pulsar. Currently, the most plausible
radio emission model that can explain main pulse emission is the coherent
curvature radiation mechanism, wherein relativistic charged solitons are formed
in a non-stationary electron-positron-pair plasma. The wider beam opening
angles of PPC require the emission to emanate from larger altitudes as compared
to the main pulse, if both these components originate by the same emission
mechanism. We explore this possibility and find that this emission mechanism is
probably inapplicable at the height of the PPC emission. We propose that the
PPC emission represents a new type of radiation from pulsars with a mechanism
different from that of the main pulse.

For the models under acceleration, we find that the light curves produced
purely by the high-latitude emission decay initially much steeper than the
constant $\Gamma$ case and gradually resume the $\hat \alpha = 2+\hat \beta$
relation in about one and half orders of magnitude in observer time. For the
models under deceleration, the trend is opposite. The light curves made purely
by the high-latitude emission decay initially shallower than the constant
$\Gamma$ case and gradually resume the relation $\hat \alpha = 2+\hat \beta$ in
a similar order of magnitude in observer time. We also show that how fast the
Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the shell increases or decreases is the main
ingredient determining the initial steepness or shallowness of the light
curves.

position of the peaks in the mass distribution of fission fragments is
determined mainly by the saddle point configuration originating from the shell
correction energy. The width of the peaks, on the other hand, results from the
shape fluctuations close to the scission point caused by the random force in
the Langevin equation. We have found out that the fluctuations between
elongated and compact shapes are essential for the fission process. According

point particle with an infinitely thin planar domain wall within the linearized
gravity in arbitrary dimensions. Since the metric of the wall increases with
distance, the wall and the particle are never free, and their energy-momentum
balance involves not only the instantaneous kinetic momenta, but also the
non-local contribution of gravitational stresses. However, careful analysis
shows that the stresses can be unambiguously divided between the colliding
objects leading to definition of the gravitationally dressed momenta. These
take into account for gravity in the same way as the potential energy does in
the non-relativistic theory, but our treatment is fully relativistic. Another
unusual feature of our problem is the non-vanishing flux of the total
energy-momentum tensor through the lateral surface of the world tube. In this
case the zero divergence of the energy-momentum tensor does not imply
conservation of the total momentum defined as the integral over the space-like
section of the tube. But one can still define the conservation low
infinitesimally, passing to time derivatives of the momenta. Using this
definition we establish the momentum balance in terms of the dressed particle

consistent with high frequency heating, and stays more or less the same during

input to the specific lesion detectors for detailed analysis. This procedure
can increase the computational performance of a screening system. Experimental

understanding and predicting the relevant state of the business cycle with the
objective of decomposing permanent shocks from those having only a transitory
impact on real output. This trend--cycle decomposition has a relevant impact on
several economic and fiscal variables and constitutes by itself an important
indicator for policy purposes. This paper deals with trend--cycle decomposition
for the Italian economy having some interesting peculiarities which makes it
attractive to analyse from both a statistic and an historical perspective. We
propose an univariate model for the quarterly real GDP, subsequently extended
to include the price dynamics through a Phillips curve. This study considers a
series of the Italian quarterly real GDP recently released by OECD which
includes both the 1960s and the recent global financial crisis of 2007--2008.
Parameters estimate as well as the signal extraction are performed within the
Bayesian paradigm which effectively handles complex models where the parameters
enter the log--likelihood function in a strongly nonlinear way. A new Adaptive
Independent Metropolis--within--Gibbs sampler is then developed to efficiently
simulate the parameters of the unobserved cycle. Our results suggest that
inflation influences the Output Gap estimate, making the extracted Italian OG
an important indicator of inflation pressures on the real side of the economy,
as stated by the Phillips theory. Moreover, our estimate of the sequence of
peaks and troughs of the Output Gap is in line with the OECD official dating of
the Italian business cycle.

recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning
problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative
filtering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each
of $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a
given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of
liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a
key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an
item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same
user again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to
users over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\log(km)$

achieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has
an exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration
steps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the

through kinematic variables (including the angular amplitude and speed of
thighs' motion), we investigate the link between these variables and Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. Our investigation relies on
the use of a few body-worn wireless inertial nodes and represents a first step
in the design of a portable system, amenable to be integrated in Internet of
Things (IoT) scenarios, for automatic detection of the degree of severity (in
terms of UPDRS score) of PD. The experimental investigation is carried out
considering 24 PD patients.

simply implies that fractal is a shape that it would still look the same even
if somebody could zoom in on one of its parts an infinite number of times. This
property is also called self-similarity with several applications including
nano pharmacology and drug nano carriers. We are interested in the study of the
properties of fractal aggregates in a microgravity environment above an
orbiting spacecraft. To model the effect we use a complete expression for the
gravitational acceleration. In particular on the surface of the Earth the
acceleration is corrected for the effect of oblateness and rotation. In the
gravitational acceleration the effect of oblateness can be modeled with the
inclusion of a term that contains the J2 harmonic coefficient, as well as a
term that depends on the square of angular velocity of the Earth. In orbit the
acceleration of gravity at the point of the spacecraft is a function of the
orbital elements and includes only in our case the J2 harmonic since no
coriolis force is felt by the spacecraft. Using the fitting parameter d = 3.0
we have found that the aggregate monomer number N is not significantly affected
and exhibits a minute 0.0001% difference between the geocentric and areocentric
latitudes of 90 degrees and 0 degrees. Finally for circular and elliptical
orbits around Earth and Mars of various inclinations and eccentricities the
aggregate monomer number is not affected at all at the orbital altitude of 300
km.
