representing the geometry of the computational domain and approximating the
solution. In practical applications, geometrical patches are used in order to
get flexibility in the geometrical representation. This multi-patch
representation corresponds to a decomposition of the computational domain into
non-overlapping subdomains also called patches in the geometrical framework. We
will present discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods that allow for discontinuities
across the subdomain (patch) boundaries. The required interface conditions are
weakly imposed by the dG terms associated with the boundary of the sub-domains.
The construction and the corresponding discretization error analysis of such dG
multi-patch IgA schemes will be given for heterogeneous diffusion model
problems in volumetric 2d and 3d domains as well as on open and closed
surfaces. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerous numerical
experiments which have been performed in G+SMO. The concept and the main
features of the IgA library G+SMO are also described.

the method are: the method is trivially parallelizable by parameterization with
each pseudorandom number generator derived from an independent prime modulus,
the method is fully scalable on massively parallel computing clusters due to
the large number of primes available for each implementation, the seeding and

few integer multiply--mod operations per pseudorandom number, the state of each

is different, and the method passes a battery of intrastream and interstream

electric potential of a sinusoidal form where the phase difference of the
electric potential between neighboring electrodes is 180 degrees. We
investigate the one- and two-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of a particle in an
EC field. The form of the dimensionless equations of motion is codimension two,
where the dimensionless control parameters are the interaction amplitude ($A$)
and damping coefficient ($\beta$). Our focus on the one-dimensional EC is
primarily on a case of fixed $\beta$ and relatively small $A$, which is
characteristic of typical experimental conditions. We study the nonlinear
behaviors of the one-dimensional EC through the analysis of bifurcations of
fixed points. We analyze these bifurcations by using Floquet theory to
determine the stability of the limit cycles associated with the fixed points in
the Poincar\'e sections. Some of the bifurcations lead to chaotic trajectories
where we then determine the strength of chaos in phase space by calculating the
largest Lyapunov exponent. In the study of the two-dimensional EC we
independently look at bifurcation diagrams of variations in $A$ with fixed
$\beta$ and variations in $\beta$ with fixed $A$. Under certain values of
$\beta$ and $A$, we find that no stable trajectories above the surface exists;
such chaotic trajectories are described by a chaotic attractor, for which the
the largest Lyapunov exponent is found. We show the well-known stable
oscillations between two electrodes come into existence for variations in $A$
and the transitions between several distinct regimes of stable motion for
variations in $\beta$.

  The purpose of this paper is i) to determine the orbits of the planets from
the RV measurements and update the value of the stellar mass (1.57 M), ii) to
analyse the stability of the planetary evolution in the vicinity and inside the
4/3 MMR, and iii) to elaborate a possible scenario for the formation of systems

  The results of the formation simulations are able to very closely reproduce
the 4/3 resonant dynamics of the best-fit config- uration obtained in this
paper. Moreover, the confidence interval of the fit matches well with the very
narrow stable region of the 4/3 mean-motion resonance. The formation process of
the HD 200964 system is very sensitive to the planetary masses and
protoplanetary disk parameters. Only a thin, flat disk allows the embryo-sized
planets to reach the 4/3 resonant configuration. The stable evolution of the
resonant planets is also sensitive to the mass of the central star, because of
overlapping high-order resonances inside the 4/3 resonance. Regardless of the
very narrow domain of stable motion, the confidence interval of our fit closely

objective function combining the fidelities and leakages at both agents. Using
common-goal games and best-response analysis, the optimal policies allow for
distributed implementation. In contrast, in the decentralized setting, repeated
discounted games are shown to naturally enable data exchange without any
central control nor economic incentives. The effect of repetition is modeled by
a time-averaged payoff function at each agent which combines its fidelity and
leakage at each interaction stage. For both approaches, it is shown that
non-trivial data exchange can be sustained for specific fidelity ranges even
when privacy is a limiting factor.

the in-plane component of vortices has larger energy on a paraboloidal shell

Regarding skyrmions, by using an in-plane anisotropy approximation to the
dipolar energy, it is shown that the skyrmion must have its width shrunk in

many applications, for instance in symmetric ciphers. In cryptography they must
satisfy some criteria (balancedness, high nonlinearity, high algebraic degree,
avalanche, or transparency) to provide best possible resistance against
attacks. Functions satisfying most criteria are however difficult to find.
Indeed, random generation does not work and the S-Boxes used in the AES or
Camellia ciphers are actually variations around a single function, the inverse
function in F_2^n. Would the latter function have an unforeseen weakness (for
instance if more practical algebraic attacks are developped), it would be
desirable to have some replacement candidates. For that matter, we propose to
weaken a little bit the algebraic part of the design of S-Boxes and use finite
semifields instead of finite fields to build such S-Boxes. Since it is not even
known how many semifields there are of order 256, we propose to build S-Boxes
and APN functions via semifields pseudo-extensions of the form S_{2^4}^2, where
S_{2^4} is any semifield of order 16 . Then, we mimic in this structure the use
of functions applied on a finite fields, such as the inverse or the cube. We

have focused on identifying the most prevalent groupings of illnesses that
demonstrate comorbidity, particularly among the elderly population, already in
receipt of care. In contrast, little attention has been paid to possible
socio-economic factors associated with increased rates of comorbidity or to the
possibility of wider unrevealed need. Given the known relationship between CVD,
diabetes and obesity and the strong socio-economic gradients in risk factors
for each of the three diseases as single morbidities, this paper uses the
Health Survey for England to examine the demographic and socio-economic
determinants of each of the seven disease combinations in the English
population. Using a multinomial logistic model, this research finds that gender
is a significant predictor for all seven disease combinations. However, gender
was not as influential as individual age or socio-economic profile. With regard
to ethnicity, the black population presents a high obesity, diabetes and
diabetes-related comorbidity risk, whilst the Asian population presents a high
risk for diabetes and diabetes-related comorbidity but a low risk for obesity
and comorbidity. Across the seven disease combinations, risk was lowest for
those individuals with a high income (4 out of 7), in-work (4 out of 7), home
owning (3 out of 7) and degree educated (3 out of 7). Finally, smokers have a
lower risk rate of obesity (and related) than ex-smokers relative to
individuals that never smoked (in all cases controlling for all other factors).
The important influence of socioeconomic factors has implications for the
spatial demand for services and the policy solutions adopted to tackle the
increasing prevalence of comorbidity.

signatures associated with parity violation. The existing analyses of these
signatures typically assume statistical isotropy. In the present work we
instead investigate the possibility that a pseudo-scalar inflaton is coupled to
a vector field carrying a small but non-negligible vacuum expectation value
(vev) coherent over our Hubble patch. We show that, in such case, correlators
involving the primordial curvature perturbations and gravitational waves
violate both statistical isotropy and parity symmetry. We compute the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies (T) and polarization (E/B)
generated by these primordial modes. The CMB two-point correlation functions
present distinct signals of broken rotational and parity invariance.
Specifically, we find non-vanishing TT, TE, EE and BB correlators between
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2 = \ell_1 \pm 1$ multipoles, and non-vanishing TB and EB
correlators between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2 = \ell_1 \pm 2$ multipoles. Such
signatures are specific of the models under consideration and they cannot be
generated if one of parity and isotropy is preserved. As a specific example we
consider the simple case in which the vector field has just an ""electric""
background component decaying in the standard way as $a^{-2}$. In this case a
strong scale-dependent quadrupolar modulation of the primordial power spectra
is generated and we find that almost noiseless data of the large-scale
temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropies (like, e.g., the ones provided
by WMAP or $Planck$) should be able to constrain the quadrupolar amplitude
coefficients $g_{2M}$ of the primordial scalar power spectrum (normalized at
the pivot scale comparable to the present horizon size $k_0^{-1} = 14~{\rm
Gpc}$) down to $g_{2M} = 30$ (68%CL).

We obtain a concrete characterization of the Doob--Martin boundary of this

speaking, this process can be conditioned to ""go to infinity"" at large times. A
(deterministic) sequence of finite rooted, planar, binary trees converges to a
point in the boundary if for each $m$ the random rooted, planar, binary tree
spanned by $m+1$ leaves chosen uniformly at random from the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$
tree in the sequence converges in distribution as $n$ tends to infinity -- a
notion of convergence that is analogous to one that appears in the recently
developed theory of graph limits.
  We show that a point in the Doob--Martin boundary may be identified with the
following ensemble of objects: a complete separable $\mathbb{R}$-tree that is
rooted and binary in a suitable sense, a diffuse probability measure on the
$\mathbb{R}$-tree that allows us to make sense of sampling points from it, and
a kernel on the $\mathbb{R}$-tree that describes the probability that the first
of a given pair of points is below and to the left of their most recent common
ancestor while the second is below and to the right. The Doob--Martin boundary
corresponds bijectively to the set of extreme points of the closed convex set
of normalized nonnegative harmonic functions, in other words, the minimal and
full Doob--Martin boundaries coincide. These results are in the spirit of the
identification of graphons as limit objects in the theory of graph limits.

(e.g. spectrum and energy), and also the inherent characteristics of the

two phenomena: fading and interference. The elegant interference alignment
concept reveals that with proper transmission signalling design, different
interference signals can in fact be aligned together, such that more radio
resources can be assigned to the desired transmission. Although interference
alignment can achieve a larger data rate compared to orthogonal transmission
strategies, several challenges should be addressed to enable the deployment of
this technique in future wireless networks For instance, to perform
interference alignment, normally, global channel state information (CSI) is
required to be perfectly known at all terminals. Clearly, acquiring such
channel knowledge is a challenging problem in practice and proper channel
training and channel state feedback techniques need to be deployed. In
addition, since the channels are time-varying proper adaptive transmission is
needed. This chapter review recent advances in practical aspects of
interference alignment. It also presents recent test-bed implementations of
signal processing algorithms for the realization of interference alignment.

models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that
disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on
representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images
and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch.
Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on
Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best
results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we
show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal
regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* -
""blue"" + ""red"" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800
images are made available for comparison.

  Accepted to be published in Signal Processing Letters",,"10.1109/LSP.2014.2387206",,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers statistical estimation problems where the probability
distribution of the observed random variable is invariant with respect to
actions of a finite topological group. It is shown that any such distribution
must satisfy a restricted finite mixture representation. When specialized to
the case of distributions over the sphere that are invariant to the actions of
a finite spherical symmetry group $\mathcal G$, a group-invariant extension of
the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is obtained. The $\mathcal G$-invariant
VMF is parameterized by location and scale parameters that specify the
distribution's mean orientation and its concentration about the mean,
respectively. Using the restricted finite mixture representation these
parameters can be estimated using an Expectation Maximization (EM) maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. This is illustrated for the problem of
mean crystal orientation estimation under the spherically symmetric group
associated with the crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral or hexahedral.
Simulations and experiments establish the advantages of the extended VMF EM-ML
estimator for data acquired by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD)
microscopy of a polycrystalline Nickel alloy sample.

incompleteness due to missing optically faint star forming galaxies. Using

complex modulus of the T2 torus, \tau = \beta^2 + i {R_1\over R_2}, then in the
small T2 limit, the partition function of the fivebrane tensor field can be
factorized, and contains the partition function of the 4d gauge theory. In this
way the SL(2,Z) symmetry of the 6d tensor partition function is identified with
the S-duality symmetry of the 4d gauge partition function. Each partition
function is the product of zero mode and oscillator contributions, where the
SL(2,Z) acts suitably. For the 4d gauge theory, which has a Lagrangian, this
product redistributes when using path integral quantization.

simultaneously lack indicators of ongoing star formation such as OII emission.
Two distinct stellar populations have been identified in these systems: a young
post-starburst population superimposed on an older host population. We present
a study of nine post-starburst galaxies with the following objectives: 1) to
investigate if and how kinematical differences between the young and old
populations of stars can be measured; and 2) to gain insight into the formation
mechanism of the young population in these systems. We fit high signal-to-noise
spectra with two independent populations in distinct spectral regions: the
Balmer region, the MgIb region, and the Ca Triplet when available. We show that
the kinematics of the two populations largely track one another if measured in
the Balmer region with high signal-to-noise data. Results from examining the
Faber-Jackson relation and the Fundamental Plane indicate these objects are not
kinematically disturbed relative to more evolved spheroids. A case-study of the
internal kinematics of one object in our sample shows it to be
pressure-supported and not rotationally-dominated. Overall our results are
consistent with merger-induced starburst scenarios where the young population
is observed during the later stages of the merger.

confidence-rating data, Likert scale data, where graded guessing tendencies or
response biases are created via base-rate or payoff manipulations, in the

We show how to construct an MPT model without order constraints that is
statistically equivalent to the MPT model with order constraints. This new
closure result extends the mathematical analysis of the MPT class, and it
offers an approach to order-restricted inference that extends the approaches
discussed by Knapp and Batchelder (2004). The usefulness of the method is

characterize metric spaces in which distances can be estimated using efficient
sketches. Specifically, we say that a sketching algorithm is efficient if it
achieves constant approximation using constant sketch size. A well-known result
of Indyk (J. ACM, 2006) implies that a metric that admits a constant-distortion
embedding into $\ell_p$ for $p\in(0,2]$ also admits an efficient sketching
scheme. But is the converse true, i.e., is embedding into $\ell_p$ the only way
to achieve efficient sketching?
  We address these questions for the important special case of normed spaces,
by providing an almost complete characterization of sketching in terms of
embeddings. In particular, we prove that a finite-dimensional normed space
allows efficient sketches if and only if it embeds (linearly) into
$\ell_{1-\varepsilon}$ with constant distortion. We further prove that for
norms that are closed under sum-product, efficient sketching is equivalent to
embedding into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. Examples of such norms
include the Earth Mover's Distance (specifically its norm variant, called
Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm), and the trace norm (a.k.a. Schatten $1$-norm or
the nuclear norm). Using known non-embeddability theorems for these norms by
Naor and Schechtman (SICOMP, 2007) and by Pisier (Compositio. Math., 1978), we
then conclude that these spaces do not admit efficient sketches either, making
progress towards answering another open question posed by Indyk in 2006.
  Finally, we observe that resolving whether ""sketching is equivalent to
embedding into $\ell_1$ for general norms"" (i.e., without the above
restriction) is equivalent to resolving a well-known open problem in Functional
Analysis posed by Kwapien in 1969.

representation of model discrepancy, which uses a Bayesian Smoothing Splines

expressions; resulting in a set of stochastic differential equations. Such an

elucidate the origin of complicated structures of a disk. Here we report SMA
observations of the dust continuum at 1.3~mm and $^{12}$CO~$J=2\rightarrow1$
line emission of the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass
star PDS~70. PDS~70, a weak-lined T Tauri star, exhibits a gap in the scattered
light from its disk with a radius of $\sim$65~AU at NIR wavelengths. However,
we found a larger gap in the disk with a radius of $\sim$80~AU at 1.3~mm.
Emission from all three disk components (the gas and the small and large dust
grains) in images exhibits a deficit in brightness in the central region of the
disk, in particular, the dust-disk in small and large dust grains has
asymmetric brightness. The contrast ratio of the flux density in the dust
continuum between the peak position to the opposite side of the disk reaches
1.4. We suggest the asymmetries and different gap-radii of the disk around
PDS~70 are potentially formed by several (unseen) accreting planets inducing
dust filtration.

parton inside a hadron. Top-quark initiated processes become increasingly
important since the top-quark luminosity can reach a few percent of the
bottom-quark luminosity. In the production of a heavy particle $H$ with mass
$m_H > m_t$, treating the top-quark as a parton allows us to resum large
logarithms $\log(m_{H}^{2}/m_{t}^{2}$) arising from collinear splitting in the
initial state. We quantify the effect of collinear resummation at the 14-TeV
LHC and a future 100-TeV hadron collider, focusing on the top-quark open-flavor
process $gg\to t\bar t H$ in comparison with $t\bar t \to H$ and $tg\rightarrow
tH$ at the leading order (LO) in QCD. We employ top-quark parton distribution
functions with appropriate collinear subtraction and power counting. We find
that (1) Collinear resummation enhances the inclusive production of a heavy
particle with $m_H\approx$ 5 TeV (0.5 TeV) by more than a factor of two
compared to the open-flavor process at a 100-TeV (14-TeV) collider; (2)
Top-quark mass effects are important for scales $m_H$ near the top-quark
threshold, where the cross section is largest. We advocate a modification of
the ACOT factorization scheme, dubbed m-ACOT, to consistently treat heavy-quark
masses in hadronic collisions; (3) The scale uncertainty of the total cross
section in m-ACOT is of about 20 percent at the LO. While a higher-order
calculation is indispensable for a precise prediction, the LO cross section is
well described by the process $t\bar t\to H$ using an effective factorization

support for the argument that the Ly$\alpha$ and other emission lines are all
being produced within the spatially extended gas. Finally, the full velocity
field of the system shows coherent velocity shear in all emission lines:
$\approx$500 km s$^{-1}$ over the central $\approx$50 kpc of the nebula. The
kinematic profiles are broadly consistent with large-scale rotation in a gas

suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ nebula represents accreting material that is
illuminated by an offset, hidden AGN or distributed star formation, and that is
undergoing rotation in a clumpy and turbulent gas disk. With an implied mass of

the major unsolved problems in astrophysics. One hypothesis is that they grew
from >10^5 M_sun black holes that formed in the `direct collapse' of massive
gas clouds that have low concentrations of both metals and molecular hydrogen
(H_2). Such clouds could form in the early (z>10) Universe if pre-galactic gas
is irradiated by H_2-photodissociating, far-ultraviolet (FUV) light from a
nearby star-forming galaxy. In this work, we re-examine the critical FUV flux
J_crit that is required to keep H_2 photodissociated and lead to direct
collapse. We submit that the same galaxies that putatively supply the
extraordinary FUV fluxes required for direct collapse should also produce
copious amounts of soft X-rays, which work to offset H_2 photodissociation by
increasing the ionization fraction and promoting H_2 formation. Accounting for
this effect increases the value of J_crit by a factor of at least 3-10,
depending on the brightness temperature of FUV radiation. This enhancement of
J_crit suppresses the abundance of potential direct collapse sites at z>10 by
several orders of magnitude. Recent studies---without accounting for the soft
X-rays from the FUV source galaxies---had already arrived at large values of
J_crit that implied that direct collapse may occur too rarely to account for
the observed abundance of high-redshift quasars. Our results suggest that
J_crit should be even higher than previously estimated, and pose an additional
challenge for the direct collapse scenario via strong FUV radiation to explain
the high-redshift quasar population.

Intriguingly, an excess in gamma rays coming from near the Galactic center has
been consistently observed in Fermi data. A recent analysis by the Fermi
collaboration confirms these earlier results. Taking into account the
systematic uncertainties in the modelling of the gamma ray backgrounds, we show
for the first time that this excess can be well fit by these final states. In
particular, for annihilations to $(WW, ZZ, hh, tt)$, dark matter with mass

acceptable fit. The fit range for $b\bar{b}$ is also enlarged to 35

associated star formation), the proportion of 'red' mergers increases rapidly
at z<2, with most merging systems at z~1.5 producing remnants that are red in
rest-frame UV-optical colours. The star formation enhancement during major
mergers is mild (~20-40%) which, together with the low incidence of such

numerical, and semi-empirical models of galaxy formation and evolution.
However, its exact shape and redshift dependence remain debated. Several recent
works support a relation in the local Universe steeper than previously thought.
Based on the comparisons with a variety of data on massive central galaxies, we
show that this steepening holds up to z~1, for stellar masses Mstar>2e11 Msun.
Specifically, we find significant evidence for a high-mass end slope of
\beta>0.35-0.70, instead of the usual \beta~0.20-0.30 reported by a number of
previous results. When including the independent constraints from the recent
BOSS clustering measurements, the data, independent of any systematic errors in
stellar masses, tend to favor a model with a very small scatter (< 0.15 dex) in
stellar mass at fixed halo mass, in the redshift range z < 0.8 and for
Mstar>3e11 Msun, suggesting a close connection between massive galaxies and
host halos even at relatively recent epochs. We discuss the implications of our
results with respect to the evolution of the most massive galaxies since z~1.

pseudobulges and classical bulges are not mutually exclusive: some galaxies
have both.
  The disky pseudobulges almost always have an exponential disk (scale lengths
= 125-870 pc, mean $\sim 440$ pc) with disk-related subcomponents: nuclear
rings, bars, and/or spiral arms. They constitute 11-59% of the galaxy stellar
mass (mean PB/T = 0.33), with stellar masses $\sim 7 \times 10^{9}$-$9 \times

the disky pseudobulges. Dynamical modeling of three systems indicates that
velocity dispersions are isotropic in the classical bulges and equatorially
biased in the disky pseudobulges.
  In the mass--radius and mass--stellar mass density planes, classical-bulge
components follow sequences defined by ellipticals and (larger) classical
bulges. Disky pseudobulges also fall on this sequence; they are more compact
than similar-mass large-scale disks. Although some classical bulges are quite
compact, they are distinct from nuclear star clusters in both size and mass,
and coexist with nuclear clusters in at least two galaxies.
  Since almost all the galaxies in this study are barred, they probably also
host boxy/peanut-shaped bulges (vertically thickened inner parts of bars). NGC
3368 shows evidence for such a zone outside its disky pseudobulge, making it a

functional representations of the conformal algebra is constructed. A key step
is the introduction of representations which involve an auxiliary functional.
It is observed that these functionals are not arbitrary but rather must satisfy
a pair of consistency equations corresponding to dilatation and special
conformal invariance. In a particular representation, the former corresponds to
the canonical form of the Exact Renormalization Group equation specialized to a
fixed-point whereas the latter is new. This provides a concrete understanding
of how conformal invariance is realized as a property of the Wilsonian
effective action and the relationship to action-free formulations of conformal
field theory.
  Subsequently, it is argued that the conformal Ward Identities serve to define
a particular representation of the energy-momentum tensor. Consistency of this
construction implies Polchinski's conditions for improving the energy-momentum
tensor of a conformal field theory such that it is traceless. In the Wilsonian
approach, the exactly marginal, redundant field which generates lines of

galaxy clusters is mostly counteracted by heating from the central active
galactic nucleus (AGN), the balance is not perfect. This can lead to residual
cooling flows and low-level star formation, the physics of which is not well
understood. Here we present a detailed study of the residual cooling flow in
the center of the low mass galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03 (A S1101) using
far-ultraviolet imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and far-infrared (FIR)
spectroscopy and photometry from the Herschel space observatory, along with a
wealth of archival data. We detect extended emission at UV, FIR, and [CII],
indicating a star formation rate of ~1-3 Msun/yr, depending on the indicator
and assumptions made. The most recently formed stars appear spatially
coincident with the lowest entropy ICM. We speculate that this low-entropy gas
has been displaced by the central AGN ~7.5 kpc north of the cD galaxy. These
data demonstrate that the displacement of the cooling core from the direct
vicinity of the central AGN can temporarily break the feedback cycle and lead
to cooling and star formation that is offset from the center of the galaxy. We
find an abundance (~10^7 Msun) of cold (20K) dust in the center of the cluster
and a second FIR peak ~30kpc to the north of the central galaxy. If confirmed
to be associated with the cooling filaments, this would be the most extended
complex of dust yet found in a cool core cluster.

a good match between a state obtained numerically from standard MPS techniques

mitigate the biased inferences in most common point estimators and is practical
for upcoming lensing surveys. The first part of our statistical framework

derive the lensing shear posterior by marginalizing over all intrinsic galaxy

ellipticities) and learn the distributions for the intrinsic galaxy properties
via hierarchical inference with a suitably flexible conditional probabilitiy
distribution specification. We use importance sampling to separate the modeling

AGN-driven outflows destroying the cool gas within their halos, which
dramatically decreases their cool gas covering fraction, while star-burst
driven winds are expelling cool gas into their circumgalactic media (CGM). This
picture appears contrary to quasar--quasar pair studies which show that the
quasar CGM contains significant amounts of cool gas whereas intrinsic gas found

account the effect of the finite size of the source. We apply these
considerations to the specific high-magnetic field pulsars class and show that,

of the Galactic thick disk and derived a surprisingly low dark matter density
at the solar position. This result was challenged by Bovy & Tremaine (2012,
ApJ, 756, 89), who claimed that the observational data are consistent with the
expected dark matter density if a one-dimensional approach is adopted. We
analyze the assumption at the bases of their formulation and their claim that
this returns a lower limit for the local dark matter density, which is accurate
within 20%. We find that the validity of their formulation depends on the
underlying mass distribution. We therefore analyze the predictions that their
hypothesis casts on the radial gradient of the azimuthal velocity dV/dR and
compare it with observational data as a testbed for the validity of their
formulation. We find that their hypothesis requires too steep a profile of
dV(Z)/dR, which is inconsistent with the observational data both in the Milky
Way and in external galaxies. As a consequence, their results are biased and
largely overestimate the mass density. Dynamical simulations also show that,
contrary to their claims, low values of dV/dR are compatible with a Milky Way
like potential with radially constant circular velocity. We nevertheless
confirm that, according to their criticism, our assumption dV/dR=0 is only an
approximation. If this hypothesis is released, and the available information
about dV/dR in the thick disk is used, the resulting local dark matter density
increases by a tiny amount, from 0+-1 to 2+-3 mM_sun pc^(-3), with an upper
limit of ~3.5 mM_sun pc^(-3). Hence, this approximation has negligible
influence on our results. Our analysis shows that their criticism is not a
viable explanation for the inferred lack of dark matter at the solar position
detected by us. More studies are required to understand these unexpected
results.

radiation transfer code to obtain the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) at z ~

5-sigma density peak, which can host high-z quasars, and in an average density
region, down to the stellar mass of M_star ~ 4* 10^7 Msun. We find that the
overdense regions evolve at a substantially accelerated pace --- the most
massive galaxy has grown to M_star ~ 8.4*10^10 Msun by z = 6.3, contains dust
of M_dust~ 4.1*10^8 Msun, and is associated with a very high star formation
rate, SFR ~ 745 Msun/yr.The attained SFR-M_star correlation results in the
specific SFR slowly increasing with M_star. Most of the UV radiation in massive
galaxies is absorbed by the dust, its escape fraction f_esc is low, increasing
slowly with time. Galaxies in the average region have less dust, and agree with
the observed UV LF. The LF of the overdense region is substantially higher, and
contains much brighter galaxies. The massive galaxies are bright in the
infrared (IR) due to the dust thermal emission, with L_IR~ 3.7*10^12 Lsun at z
= 6.3, while L_IR < 10^11 Lsun for the low-mass galaxies. Therefore, ALMA can
probe massive galaxies in the overdense region up to z ~ 10 with a reasonable
integration time. The UV spectral properties of disky galaxies depend
significantly upon the viewing angle.The stellar and dust masses of the most
massive galaxy in the overdense region are comparable to those of the
sub-millimetre galaxy (SMG) found by Riechers et al. at z = 6.3, while the
modelled SFR and the sub-millimetre flux fall slightly below the observed one.
Statistical significance of these similarities and differences will only become
clear with the upcoming ALMA observations.

traditional planet formation theories. These fall into two broad classes: (1)
formation further out followed by migration; (2) formation in situ from a disk
of gas and planetesimals. In the former, an abundance of resonant chains is
expected, which the Kepler data do not support. In the latter, required disk
mass surface densities may be too high. A recently proposed mechanism
hypothesizes that planets form in situ at the pressure trap associated with the
dead-zone inner boundary (DZIB) where radially drifting ""pebbles"" accumulate.
This scenario predicts planet masses ($M_p$) are set by the gap-opening process
that then leads to DZIB retreat, followed by sequential, inside-out planet
formation (IOPF). For typical disk accretion rates, IOPF predictions for $M_p$,
$M_p$ versus orbital radius $r$, and planet-planet separations are consistent
with observed systems. Here we investigate the IOPF prediction for how the
masses, $M_{p,1}$, of the innermost (""Vulcan"") planets vary with $r$. We show
that for fiducial parameters, $M_{p,1}\simeq5.0(r/{\rm{0.1\:AU}})\:M_\oplus$,
independent of the disk's accretion rate at time of planet formation. Then,
using Monte Carlo sampling of a population of these innermost planets, we test
this predicted scaling against observed planet properties, allowing for
intrinsic dispersions in planetary densities and Kepler's observational biases.
These effects lead to a slightly shallower relation
$M_{p,1}\propto{r}^{0.9\pm0.2}$, which is consistent with
$M_{p,1}\propto{r}^{0.7\pm0.2}$ of the observed Vulcans. The normalization of
the relation constrains the gap-opening process, favoring relatively low
viscosities in the inner dead zone.

string power spectra. The second approach uses the wake model, where string
density perturbations are concentrated in sheet-like structures whose surface
density grows with time. The qualitative and quantitative agreement of the two
gives confidence to the results. An essential ingredient in the UETC approach
is the inclusion of compensation factors in the integration with the Green's
function of the matter and radiation fluids, and we show that these
compensation factors must be included in the wake model also. We also present a
comparison of the UETCs computed in the Gaussian model, and those computed in
the unconnected segment model (USM) used by the standard cosmic string
perturbation package CMBACT. We compare numerical estimates for the bispectrum

process graph data. We start with defining the quasi-affine systems on a given
manifold $\cM$ that is formed by generalized dilations and shifts of a finite
collection of wavelet functions $\Psi:=\{\psi_j: 1\le j\le r\}\subset L_2(\R)$.
We further require that $\psi_j$ is generated by some refinable function $\phi$
with mask $a_j$. We present the condition needed for the masks $\{a_j: 0\le
j\le r\}$ so that the associated quasi-affine system generated by $\Psi$ is a
tight frame for $L_2(\cM)$. Then, we discuss how the transition from the
continuum (manifolds) to the discrete setting (graphs) can be naturally done.
In order for the proposed discrete tight wavelet frame transforms to be useful
in applications, we show how the transforms can be computed efficiently and
accurately by proposing the fast tight wavelet frame transforms for graph data
(WFTG). Finally, we consider two specific applications of the proposed WFTG:
graph data denoising and semi-supervised clustering. Utilizing the sparse
representation provided by the WFTG, we propose $\ell_1$-norm based
optimization models on graphs for denoising and semi-supervised clustering. On
one hand, our numerical results show significant advantage of the WFTG over the
spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT) by [1] for both applications. On the
other hand, numerical experiments on two real data sets show that the proposed
semi-supervised clustering model using the WFTG is overall competitive with the
state-of-the-art methods developed in the literature of high-dimensional data
classification, and is superior to some of these methods.

equivalent to solving for $x_i$ in $x = Gx + z$ for some $G$ and $z$ such that
the spectral radius of $G$ is less than 1. Our algorithm relies on the Neumann
series characterization of the component $x_i$, and is based on residual

model, in which the computation is split into small update tasks performed by
small processors with shared access to a distributed file system. We prove a
robust asymptotic convergence result when the spectral radius $\rho(|G|) < 1$,
regardless of the precise order and frequency in which the update tasks are
performed. We provide convergence rate bounds which depend on the order of
update tasks performed, analyzing both deterministic update rules via counting
weighted random walks, as well as probabilistic update rules via concentration
bounds. The probabilistic analysis requires analyzing the product of random
matrices which are drawn from distributions that are time and path dependent.
We specifically consider the setting where $n$ is large, yet $G$ is sparse,
e.g., each row has at most $d$ nonzero entries. This is motivated by
applications in which $G$ is derived from the edge structure of an underlying
graph. Our results prove that if the local neighborhood of the graph does not
grow too quickly as a function of $n$, our algorithm can provide significant
reduction in computation cost as opposed to any algorithm which computes the
global solution vector $x$. Our algorithm obtains an $\epsilon \|x\|_2$
additive approximation for $x_i$ in constant time with respect to the size of
the matrix when the maximum row sparsity $d = O(1)$ and $1/(1-\|G\|_2) = O(1)$.

described through either the $\gamma$-ray duration $T_{90}$ or through a
generalized burst duration $t_{\rm burst}$ which includes both the $\gamma$-ray
emission and (when present) an extended flaring X-ray plateau. Here, we define
a more specific operational description of $T_{\rm ce}$, and within the
framework of the internal-external shock model, we develop a numerical code to
study the relationship between $T_{90}$ and $T_{\rm ce}$, as well as between
$t_{\rm burst}$ and $T_{\rm ce}$, for different initial conditions. We find
that when $T_{\rm ce}\lesssim 10^4$ s, late internal collisions or refreshed
external collisions result in values of $T_{\rm 90}$ and $t_{\rm burst}$ larger
than $T_{\rm ce}$, usually by factors of $2-3$. For $T_{\rm ce}\gtrsim 10^4$ s,
the $t_{\rm burst}$ is always a good estimator for $T_{\rm ce}$, while $T_{90}$
can underpredict $T_{\rm ce}$ when the late central engine activity is
moderate. We find a clear bimodal distribution for $T_{\rm ce}$, based on our
simulations as well as on the observational data for $T_{90}$ and $t_{\rm
burst}$. We suggest that $t_{\rm burst}$ is a reliable measure for defining
""ultra-long"" GRBs. Bursts with $T_{90}$ of order $10^3$ s need not belong to a
special population, while bursts with $t_{\rm burst} > 10^4$ s, where the late
central engine activity is more moderate and shows up in X-rays, may represent
a new population. These conclusions are insensitive to the initial conditions
assumed in the models.

the standard CO-H2 conversion factor, we found no difference in molecular gas
mass, atomic gas mass, and total gas mass (a sum of atomic and molecular gas
mass) between interacting galaxies and isolated galaxies. However, interacting
galaxies have a higher global molecular gas fraction, global fmol (a ratio of
molecular gas mass to total gas mass averaged over a whole galaxy), than
isolated galaxies. The distribution of local molecular gas fraction, local fmol
(a ratio of the surface density of molecular gas to that of total gas), is
different from the distribution in typical isolated galaxies. By a
pixel-to-pixel comparison, isolated spiral galaxies show a gradual increase in
local fmol along the surface density of total gas until it is saturated at 1.0,
while interacting galaxies show no clear relation. We performed pixel-to-pixel
theoretical model fittings varying metallicity and external pressure. According
to the model fitting, external pressure can explain the trend of local fmol in
the interacting galaxies. Assuming a half of the standard CO-H2 conversion
factor for interacting galaxies, the results of pixel-to-pixel theoretical
model fitting get worse than adopting the standard conversion factor, although
global fmol of interacting galaxies becomes the same as in isolated galaxies.
We conclude that external pressure occurs due to the shock prevailing over a
whole galaxy or due to collisions between giant molecular clouds. The external
pressure accelerates an efficient transition from atomic gas to molecular gas.
Regarding chemical time-scale, high local fmol can be achieved at the very
early stage of interaction even if shock induced by the collision of galaxies
ionises interstellar gas.

mass loss rates, low wind velocities, exhibiting strong irregular photometric
and spectral variability. They are generally believed to be a relatively short
evolutionary stage in the life of a massive star, marking the transition from
the Main Sequence toward Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, recent studies
indicate that progenitors of several supernovae underwent LBV-like eruptions.
These studies support the view that at least some LBV stars are the end point
of the evolution but not a transition phase. LBVs are rare objects,
observations of whose in the Galaxy are inevitably connected with difficulties
in determination of the distance and interstellar extinction. Hence, studying
these rare objects in nearby galaxies is potentially more prospective.
Therefore, investigation of the extragalactic star Romano's star (V532 or
GR290) which is now classified as LBV/post-LBV star and shows late-WN spectrum,
is very important for our understanding of evolution of massive stars in
general.

scientific discoveries, from the use of sophisticated validation techniques, to
deep statistical methods for controlling the false discovery rate in multiple
hypothesis testing. However, there is a fundamental disconnect between the
theoretical results and the practice of data analysis: the theory of
statistical inference assumes a fixed collection of hypotheses to be tested, or
learning algorithms to be applied, selected non-adaptively before the data are
gathered, whereas in practice data is shared and reused with hypotheses and new
analyses being generated on the basis of data exploration and the outcomes of
previous analyses.
  In this work we initiate a principled study of how to guarantee the validity
of statistical inference in adaptive data analysis. As an instance of this
problem, we propose and investigate the question of estimating the expectations
of $m$ adaptively chosen functions on an unknown distribution given $n$ random
samples.
  We show that, surprisingly, there is a way to estimate an exponential in $n$
number of expectations accurately even if the functions are chosen adaptively.
This gives an exponential improvement over standard empirical estimators that
are limited to a linear number of estimates. Our result follows from a general
technique that counter-intuitively involves actively perturbing and
coordinating the estimates, using techniques developed for privacy
preservation. We give additional applications of this technique to our
question.

Fe$_4$, by using a model Hamiltonian with parameter values obtained from
density-functional theory (DFT). Magnetic anisotropy parameters, vibrational
energies, and electron-vibron coupling strengths of the Fe$_4$ are computed
using DFT. A giant spin model is applied to the Fe$_4$ with only two charge
states, specifically a neutral state with the total spin $S=5$ and a singly
charged state with $S=9/2$, which is consistent with our DFT result and
experiments on Fe$_4$ single-molecule transistors. In sequential electron
tunneling, we find that the magnetic anisotropy gives rise to new features in
conductance peaks arising from vibrational excitations. In particular, the peak
height shows a strong, unusual dependence on the direction as well as magnitude
of applied B field. The magnetic anisotropy also introduces vibrational
satellite peaks whose position and height are modified with the direction and
magnitude of applied B field. Furthermore, when multiple vibrational modes with
considerable electron-vibron coupling have energies close to one another, a
low-bias current is suppressed, independently of gate voltage and applied B
field, although that is not the case for a single mode with the similar
electron-vibron coupling. In the former case, the conductance peaks reveal a
stronger B-field dependence than in the latter case. The new features appear
because the magnetic anisotropy barrier is of the same order of magnitude as
the energies of vibrational modes with significant electron-vibron coupling.
Our findings clearly show the interesting interplay between magnetic anisotropy
and electron-vibron coupling in electron transport via the Fe$_4$. The similar
behavior can be observed in transport via other anisotropic magnetic molecules.

a dependent type theory with at least 1, Sigma, Pi, and identity types), we
define the type of constant functions from A to B. This involves an infinite
tower of coherence conditions, and we therefore need the category to have Reedy
limits of diagrams over omega. Our main result is that, if the category further
has propositional truncations and satisfies function extensionality, the type
of constant function is equivalent to the type ||A|| -> B.
  If B is an n-type for a given finite n, the tower of coherence conditions
becomes finite and the requirement of nontrivial Reedy limits vanishes. The
whole construction can then be carried out in Homotopy Type Theory and
generalises the universal property of the truncation. This provides a way to
define functions ||A|| -> B if B is not known to be propositional, and it
streamlines the common approach of finding a proposition Q with A -> Q and Q ->

  Constraints","Submitted to ADCHEM 2015",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate estimation of parameters is paramount in developing high-fidelity
models for complex dynamical systems. Model-based optimal experiment design
(OED) approaches enable systematic design of dynamic experiments to generate
input-output data sets with high information content for parameter estimation.
Standard OED approaches however face two challenges: (i) experiment design
under incomplete system information due to unknown true parameters, which
usually requires many iterations of OED; (ii) incapability of systematically
accounting for the inherent uncertainties of complex systems, which can lead to
diminished effectiveness of the designed optimal excitation signal as well as
violation of system constraints. This paper presents a robust OED approach for
nonlinear systems with arbitrarily-shaped time-invariant probabilistic
uncertainties. Polynomial chaos is used for efficient uncertainty propagation.
The distinct feature of the robust OED approach is the inclusion of chance
constraints to ensure constraint satisfaction in a stochastic setting. The
presented approach is demonstrated by optimal experimental design for the
JAK-STAT5 signaling pathway that regulates various cellular processes in a
biological cell.

the true GRB locations and we attribute this to systematic uncertainties. The
distribution of systematic uncertainties is well represented (68% confidence

10% of GBM-detected GRBs and extends to approximately 14 degrees. A more
complex model suggests that there is a dependence of the systematic uncertainty

scalar field $f:\mathbb{M} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{M}$ is a
triangulated simplicial mesh in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The contour tree is a
fundamental topological structure that tracks the evolution of level sets of
$f$ and has numerous applications in data analysis and visualization.
  All existing algorithms begin with a global sort of at least all critical
values of $f$, which can require (roughly) $\Omega(n\log n)$ time. Existing
lower bounds show that there are pathological instances where this sort is
required. We present the first algorithm whose time complexity depends on the
contour tree structure, and avoids the global sort for non-pathological inputs.
If $C$ denotes the set of critical points in $\mathbb{M}$, the running time is
roughly $O(\sum_{v \in C} \log \ell_v)$, where $\ell_v$ is the depth of $v$ in
the contour tree. This matches all existing upper bounds, but is a significant
improvement when the contour tree is short and fat. Specifically, our approach
ensures that any comparison made is between nodes in the same descending path
in the contour tree, allowing us to argue strong optimality properties of our
algorithm.
  Our algorithm requires several novel ideas: partitioning $\mathbb{M}$ in
well-behaved portions, a local growing procedure to iteratively build contour
trees, and the use of heavy path decompositions for the time complexity
analysis.

MeV$ produced via this mechanism freeze-out at $T_f \simeq 10 MeV$ with a
distribution function that is highly non-thermal and features a sharp
enhancement at low momentum thereby making this species \emph{cold} even for
very light masses. Dark matter abundance constraints from the CMB and phase
space density constraints from the most dark matter dominated dwarf spheroidal
galaxies provide upper and lower bounds respectively on combinations of mass
and mixing angles. For $\pi \rightarrow \mu \nu_s$, the bounds lead to a narrow
region of compatibility with the latest results from the $3.55 \mathrm{KeV}$

(today) in the range of $\sim \mbox{few kpc}$ consistent with the observation

canonical correlation analysis. The main contribution of this work is to
carefully define a structured Bayesian prior that encourages both element-wise

loading matrix, regularizing at three levels, which enables element-wise
sparsity and unsupervised recovery of latent factors corresponding to
structured variance across arbitrary subsets of the observations. In addition,
our structured prior allows for both dense and sparse latent factors so that
covariation among either all features or only a subset of features can both be
recovered. We use fast parameter-expanded expectation-maximization for
parameter estimation in this model. We validate our method on both simulated

and C18O(J=1-0) data with new high-resolution, 3D hydrodynamical simulations of
colliding supershells, we discuss the origin and nature of the GMC
(G288.5+1.5), favoring a scenario in which the cloud was partially seeded by
pre-existing denser material, but assembled into its current form by the action
of the shells. This assembly includes the production of some new molecular gas.
The GMC is well interpreted as non-self-gravitating, despite its high mass (MH2
~ 1.7 x 10^5 Msol), and is likely pressure confined by the colliding flows,
implying that self-gravity was not a necessary ingredient for its formation.
Much of the molecular gas is relatively diffuse, and the cloud as a whole shows
little evidence of star formation activity, supporting a scenario in which it
is young and recently formed. Drip-like formations along its lower edge may be
explained by fluid dynamical instabilities in the cooled gas.

reduce wireless resource usage. We then develop a multicast scheduling scheme
for the downlink multiple-input multiple output orthogonal-frequency division
multiplexing system in IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN). At each
time slot, the scheduler serves the users by either unicast or multicast
transmission. Out-sequence data received by a user is stored in user's cache
for future use.Multicast precoding and user selection for multicast grouping
are also considered and compliance with the IEEE 802.11 WLAN transmission
protocol. The scheduling scheme is based on the Lyapunov optimization
technique, which aims to maximize system rate. The resulting scheme has low
complexity and requires no prior statistical information on the channels and
queues. Furthermore, in the absence of channel error, the proposed scheme
restricts the worst case of frame dropping deadline, which is useful for
delivering real-time traffic. Simulation results show that our proposed
algorithm outperforms existing techniques by 17 % to 35 % in term of user
capacity.

$[0,1]^s$. One line of research studies the integration error of functions in
the unit ball of so-called Korobov spaces, which are Hilbert spaces of periodic
functions on $[0,1]^s$ with square integrable partial mixed derivatives of
order $\alpha$. Using Parseval's identity, this smoothness can be defined for
all real numbers $\alpha > 1/2$. This condition is necessary as otherwise the
Korobov space contains discontinuous functions for which function evaluation is
not well defined.
  This paper is concerned with more precise endpoint estimates of the
integration error using QMC rules for Korobov spaces with $\alpha$ arbitrarily
close to $1/2$. To obtain such estimates we introduce a $\log$-scale for
functions with smoothness close to $1/2$, which we call $\log$-Korobov spaces.
We show that lattice rules can be used to obtain an integration error of order
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2} (\log N)^{-\mu(1-\lambda)/2})$ for any $1/\mu <\lambda
\le 1$, where $\mu>1$ is a power in the $\log$-scale.
  We also consider tractability of numerical integration for weighted Korobov
spaces with product weights $(\gamma_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$. It is known that
if $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^\tau < \infty$ for some $1/(2\alpha) < \tau \le
1$ one can obtain error bounds which are independent of the dimension. In this
paper we give a more refined estimate for the case where $\tau$ is close to
$1/(2 \alpha)$, namely we show dimension independent error bounds under the
condition that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j \max\{1, \log
\gamma_j^{-1}\}^{\mu(1-\lambda)} < \infty$ for some $1/\mu < \lambda \le 1$.
The essential tool in our analysis is a $\log$-scale Jensen's inequality.
  The results described above also apply to integration in $\log$-cosine spaces
using tent-transformed lattice rules.

increases the quality of the assembly produced, it increases the memory by a

In this paper, we present a type of multi-resolution methods by using the
generalized self-loop rescaling strategy. The self-loop rescaling strategy
provides one uniform ansatz for the design of multi-resolution community
detection methods. Many quality functions for community detection can be
unified in the framework of the self-loop rescaling. The resulting
multi-resolution quality functions can be optimized directly using the existing
modularity-optimization algorithms. Several derived multi-resolution methods
are applied to the analysis of community structures in several synthetic and

pre-defined substructures in synthetic networks and real splits observed in
real-world networks. Finally, we give a discussion on the methods themselves
and their relationship. We hope that the study in the paper can be helpful for
the understanding of the multi-resolution methods and provide useful insight

derived from C I lines are negative and increase with the effective temperature
Teff; the corrections are especially significant for the infrared C I lines
with wavelengths 9060-9660 \AA. The carbon underabundance as a general property
of the stars in question is confirmed; a majority of the stars studied has the
carbon deficiency [C/Fe] between -0.1 and -0.5 dex, with a minimum at -0.7 dex.
When comparing the derived C deficiency with the N excess found by us for the
same stars earlier, we obtain a pronounced N vs. C anti-correlation, which
could be expected from predictions of the theory.We found that the ratio [N/C]
spans mostly the range from 0.3 to 1.7 dex. Both these enhanced [N/C] values
and the C and N anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence on
a star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority of
programme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (MS)
and/or the first dredge-up (FD) phase. Comparison with theoretical predictions
including rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-MS
objects with the initial rotational velocities V0 = 200-300 km/s or post-FD
objects with V0 = 0-300 km/s. The observed N vs. C anti-correlation reflects a
dependence of the C and N anomalies on the V0 value: on average the higher V0
the greater the anomalies. It is shown that an absence of detectable lithium in
the atmospheres of the stars, which is accompanied with the observed N excess
and C deficiency, is quite explainable.

by quantum information theory. The approach is based on a general framework,
which allows one to address a large class of physical theories which share
basic information-theoretic features. We first illustrate two very primitive
features, expressed by the axioms of causality and purity-preservation, which
are satisfied by both classical and quantum theory. We then discuss the axiom
of purification, which expresses a strong version of the Conservation of
Information and captures the core of a vast number of protocols in quantum
information. Purification is a highly non-classical feature and leads directly
to the emergence of entanglement at the purely conceptual level, without any
reference to the superposition principle. Supplemented by a few additional

a relay equipped with multiple antennas is considered in this letter, where a

energy and obtains information from the source with the radio-frequent signals
by jointly using the antenna selection (AS) and power splitting (PS)
techniques, and then the processed information is amplified and forwarded to
the destination relying on the harvested energy. This letter jointly optimizes
AS and PS to maximize the achievable rate for the proposed strategy.
Considering the joint optimization is according to the non-convex problem, a
two-stage procedure is proposed to determine the optimal ratio of received
signal power split for energy harvesting, and the optimized antenna set engaged
in information forwarding. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the
two-stage procedure, and demonstrate that the proposed harvest-and-forward

state-of-the-art numerical simulations with post-processing radiative transfer
(RT) to generate synthetic maps and predictions for ALMA. We performed
non-ideal global 3D MHD stratified simulations of the dead-zone outer edge
using the FARGO MHD code PLUTO. The stellar and disk parameters are taken from
a parameterized disk model applied for fitting high-angular resolution
multi-wavelength observations of circumstellar disks. The 2D temperature and
density profiles are calculated consistently from a given surface density
profile and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer. The 2D Ohmic resistivity profile is
calculated using a dust chemistry model. The magnetic field is a vertical net
flux field. The resulting dust reemission provides the basis for the simulation
of observations with ALMA. The fiducial model develops a large gap followed by
a jump in surface density located at the dead-zone outer edge. The jump in
density and pressure is strong enough to stop the radial drift of particles. In
addition, we observe the generation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability
(RWI) at the jumps location close to 60 AU. The vortices are steadily generated
and destroyed at a cycle of 40 local orbits. The RT results and simulated ALMA
observations predict the feasibility to observe such large scale structures

present a detailed analysis of charge, spin and thermal conductance, together
with the Seebeck and spin Seebeck coefficients (thermopowers). Since the
scattering mechanism also involves processes when electrons are inelastically
scattered back to the same electrode, one can expect the flow of spin and

turn, results in a finite spin thermopower, and the magnetic anisotropy plays a
key role for this effect to occur.

LOFAR is developed and used to determine the average density of usable
calibrator sources on the sky for subarcsecond observations at 140 MHz.
Methods. We used the multi-beaming capability of LOFAR to conduct a fast and
computationally inexpensive survey with the full International LOFAR array.
Sources were pre-selected on the basis of 325 MHz arcminute-scale flux density
using existing catalogues. By observing 30 different sources in each of the 12
sets of pointings per hour, we were able to inspect 630 sources in two hours to
determine if they possess a sufficiently bright compact component to be usable
as LOFAR delay calibrators. Results. Over 40% of the observed sources are
detected on multiple baselines between international stations and 86 are
classified as satisfactory calibrators. We show that a flat low-frequency
spectrum (from 74 to 325 MHz) is the best predictor of compactness at 140 MHz.
We extrapolate from our sample to show that the density of calibrators on the
sky that are sufficiently bright to calibrate dispersive and non-dispersive
delays for the International LOFAR using existing methods is 1.0 per square
degree. Conclusions. The observed density of satisfactory delay calibrator
sources means that observations with International LOFAR should be possible at
virtually any point in the sky, provided that a fast and efficient search using
the methodology described here is conducted prior to the observation to
identify the best calibrator.

to the reverberant acoustic environment. Estimating them from short and noisy
recordings poses a long-standing challenge of audio signal processing. In this
paper we apply a novel strategy based on ideas of Compressed Sensing. Relative
transfer function (RTF) corresponding to the relative impulse response can
often be estimated accurately from noisy data but only for certain frequencies.
This means that often only an incomplete measurement of the RTF is available. A
complete RTF estimate can be obtained through finding its sparsest
representation in the time-domain: that is, through computing the sparsest
among the corresponding relative impulse responses. Based on this approach, we
propose to estimate the RTF from noisy data in three steps. First, the RTF is
estimated using any conventional method such as the non-stationarity-based
estimator by Gannot et al. or through Blind Source Separation. Second,
frequencies are determined for which the RTF estimate appears to be accurate.
Third, the RTF is reconstructed through solving a weighted $\ell_1$ convex
program, which we propose to solve via a computationally efficient variant of
the SpaRSA (Sparse Reconstruction by Separable Approximation) algorithm. An
extensive experimental study with real-world recordings has been conducted. It
has been shown that the proposed method is capable of improving many
conventional estimators used as the first step in most situations.

calculate the caustic crossing rates for a comprehensive family of stellar mass
functions and find a dependence of the average number of caustic crossings with
the effective transverse velocity and the average mass, $\langle n \rangle
\propto {v_{eff} / \sqrt{\langle m \rangle}}$, equivalent to the theoretical
prediction for the case of microlenses with identical masses. We explore the
possibilities of the method to measure $v_{eff}$ using the $\sim$12 years of
OGLE monitoring of the four images of Q 2237+0305. To determine a lower limit
for $v_{eff}$ we count, conservatively, a single caustic crossing for each one
of the 4 high magnification events identified in the literature (plus one
additional proposed by us) obtaining $v_{eff} \gtrsim 240\sqrt{\langle m
\rangle/0.17M_\odot}\rm\,km\, s^{-1}$ at 68\% of confidence. From this value
and the average $FWHM$ of 4 high magnification events we obtain a lower limit
of $r_s \gtrsim 1.4 \sqrt{\langle m \rangle/0.17M_\odot}$ light-days for the
radius of the source ($r_s=FWHM/2.35$). Tentative identification of 3
additional caustic crossing events leads to estimates of $v_{eff}\simeq (493\pm
246)\sqrt{\langle m \rangle/0.17M_\odot}\rm\,km\, s^{-1}$ for the effective
transverse velocity and of $r_s \simeq (2.7\pm 1.3)\sqrt{\langle m

peculiar velocity of the galaxy is $v_t \simeq(429\pm246)\sqrt{\langle m

is accessed locally: a user accesses a randomly chosen storage node, which
subsequently queries its neighborhood to recover the data object. We aim at
finding an optimal allocation that minimizes the overall storage budget while
ensuring recovery with probability one. We show that the problem reduces to
finding the fractional dominating set of the underlying network. Furthermore,
we develop a fully distributed algorithm where each storage node communicates
only with its neighborhood in order to find its optimal storage allocation. The
proposed algorithm is based upon the recently proposed proximal center
method--an efficient dual decomposition based on accelerated dual gradient
method. We show that our algorithm achieves a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
ratio in $O(d_{\mathrm{max}}^{3/2}/\epsilon)$ iterations and per-node
communications, where $d_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximal degree across nodes.
Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

interaction of the atoms with different regions of the laser beam were modeled
separately to account for the varying laser beam intensity over the beam
profile as well as saturation effects that become important near the center of
the beam at the relatively high laser intensities used during the experiments
in order to obtain measurable signals. The model described the experimentally
measured signals for laser intensities for magnetic fields up to 55~G and laser

wellwidth or composition fluctuations in semiconductor heterostructures
(resulting in a formation of quantum dots) and coloured centers in wide bandgap

emission lines (0.1 meV linewidth). These narrow emission lines reveal the
effect of photon antibunching, the unambiguous attribute of single photon
emitters. The optical response of these emitters is inherently linked to
two-dimensional properties of the WSe2 monolayer, as they both give rise to

wall, in shear flow, is studied using a Langevin equation that accounts for
thermal fluctuations, hydrodynamic interactions and adhesive interactions.
Contrary to the conventional assumption that thermal fluctuations play a
negligible role at high P$\acute{e}$clet numbers, we find that for particles
with low surface densities of receptors, rotational diffusion caused by
fluctuations about the flow and gradient directions aids in bond formation,
leading to significantly greater adhesion on average, compared to simulations
where thermal fluctuations are completely ignored. The role of wall
hydrodynamic interactions on the steady state motion of a particle, when the
particle is close to the wall, has also been explored. At high P$\acute{e}$clet
numbers, the shear induced force that arises due to the stresslet part of the
Stokes dipole, plays a dominant role, reducing the particle velocity
significantly, and affecting the states of motion of the particle. The coupling
between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of the particle,
brought about by the presence of hydrodynamic interactions, is found to have no
influence on the binding dynamics. On the other hand, the drag coefficient,
which depends on the distance of the particle from the wall, plays a crucial
role at low rates of bond formation. A significant difference in the effect of
both the shear force and the position dependent drag force, on the states of
motion of the particle, is observed when the P$\acute{e}$let number is small.

the development of spintronic devices like spin-torque oscillators, spin-logic
devices, and spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memories. In this
development spin pumping, the process where pure spin-currents are generated
from magnetisation precession, has proved to be a powerful method for probing
spin physics and magnetisation dynamics. The effect originates from direct
conversion of low energy quantised spin-waves in the magnet, known as magnons,
into a flow of spins from the precessing magnet to adjacent normal metal leads.
The spin-pumping phenomenon represents a convenient way to electrically detect
magnetisation dynamics, however, precessing magnets have been limited so far to
pump pure spin currents, which require a secondary spin-charge conversion
element such as heavy metals with large spin Hall angle or multi-layer layouts
to be detectable. Here, we report the experimental observation of charge
pumping in which a precessing ferromagnet pumps a charge current, demonstrating
direct conversion of magnons into high-frequency currents via the relativistic
spin-orbit interaction. The generated electric current, differently from spin
currents generated by spin-pumping, can be directly detected without the need
of any additional spin to charge conversion mechanism and amplitude and phase
information about the relativistic current-driven magnetisation dynamics. The
charge-pumping phenomenon is generic and gives a deeper understanding of the
recently observed spin-orbit torques, of which it is the reciprocal effect and
which currently attract interest for their potential in manipulating magnetic
information. Furthermore, charge pumping provides a novel link between
magnetism and electricity and may find application in sourcing alternating
electric currents.

challenge for first-principles simulations, because the typically low
concentration of dopants renders an explicit treatment intractable. In systems
which do not display long-range band bending, a satisfactory remedy is offered
by the use of ""pseudoatoms"", with a fractional nuclear charge matching the bulk
doping concentration. However, this alone is not always sufficient for charged
surfaces, where the width of the space-charge region (SCR) often exceeds
realistic supercell dimensions. One generalization of the pseudoatom approach
which overcomes this difficulty relies on the introduction of an artificially
high doping level within a slab calculation, in conjunction with a multi-scale
electrostatic energy correction. Here, we present an alternative technique that
naturally extends the pseudoatom approach while bypassing the need for
calculations with an unrealistically high doping level. It is based on the
introduction of excess charge, mimicking free charge carriers from the SCR,
along with a fixed sheet of counter-charge mimicking the SCR-related field.
Self-consistency is obtained by imposing charge conservation and Fermi level
equilibration between the bulk, treated semi-classically, and the electronic
states of the slab/surface, which are treated quantum-mechanically. The method,
which we call CREST - the Charge-Reservoir Electrostatic Sheet Technique - can
be used with standard electronic structure codes. We validate the approach
using a simple tight-binding model, which allows for comparison of its results
with calculations encompassing the full SCR explicitly. We then employ it with
density functional theory, where it is used to obtain insights into the
electronic structures of the ""clean-cleaved"" Si(111) surface and its buckled

measurement limit, and then analyze the dynamical evolution induced by one such
interaction. The analysis is developed by means of a recently introduced method
for studying open quantum systems, namely the parametric representation with
environmental coherent states, that allows us to determine a necessary
condition that the quantum state of the apparatus must fullfil in order to give
information on the observable being measured. We find that this condition
strictly implies decoherence in the principal system, with respect to the
eigenstates of the hermitian operator that represents the measured observable,
thus establishing that there cannot be information flux from a quantum system
towards a readable analyser unless decoherence occurs. The relevance of
dynamical entanglement generation is highlighted, and consequences of the
possible macroscopic structure of the measurement apparatus are also commented

scales. Since they apparently extend into the intergalactic medium, it is
tantalizing to believe that they have a primordial origin, possibly being
produced during inflation. However, finding consistent scenarios for
inflationary magnetogenesis is a challenging theoretical problem. The
requirements to avoid an excessive production of electromagnetic energy, and to
avoid entering a strong coupling regime characterized by large values for the
electromagnetic coupling constant, typically allow one to generate only a tiny
amplitude of magnetic field during inflation. We propose a scenario for
building gauge-invariant models of inflationary magnetogenesis potentially free
from these issues. The idea is to derivatively couple a dynamical scalar, not
necessarily the inflaton, to fermionic and electromagnetic fields during the
inflationary era. Such couplings give additional freedom to control the
time-dependence of the electromagnetic coupling constant during inflation. This
fact allows us to find conditions to avoid the strong coupling problems that
affect many of the existing models of magnetogenesis. We do not need to rely on
a particular inflationary set-up for developing our scenario, that might be
applied to different realizations of inflation. On the other hand, specific
requirements have to be imposed on the dynamics of the scalar derivatively
coupled to fermions and electromagnetism, that we are able to satisfy in an
explicit realization of our proposal.

include in our analysis the radiative corrections obtained from the electroweak
theory for the graviton/photon/photon vertex. In this approach, the cross
section is related to the angular variation of the impact parameter ($b$),
which is then solved for $b$ as a function of the angle of deflection, and
measured in horizon units ($b_h\equiv b/(2 G M)$). Exact numerical solutions
for the angular deflection are presented. The numerical analysis shows that
perturbation theory in a weak background agrees with the classical Einstein
formula for the deflection already at distances of the order of $20$ horizon
units ($\sim 20\, b_h$) and it is optimal in the description both of very
strong and weak lensings. We show that the electroweak corrections to the cross
section are sizeable, becoming very significant for high energy gamma rays. Our

network structure is inferred by the dynamics of the nodes. From the dynamics
of the nodes one then constructs a network of functional relations, termed the
functional network. A fundamental question in the analysis of complex systems
concerns the relation between functional and structural networks. Using
synchronisation as a paradigm for network functionality, we study the dynamics
of cluster formation in functional networks. We show that the functional
network can drastically differ from the structural network. We uncover the
mechanism driving these bifurcations by obtaining necessary conditions for

are able to divide $\Delta{\cal E}_m= -Q W_{m}$ in two factors where $Q$

proposed as a method for the unsupervised classification of cells within a
sample into a number of clusters and in the case of multiple samples, the
matching of these clusters across the samples. The two tasks of clustering and
matching of the clusters are performed simultaneously within the JCM framework.
In this paper, we consider the case where there is a number of distinct classes
of samples whose class of origin is known, and the problem is to classify a new
sample of unknown class of origin to one of these predefined classes. For
example, the different classes might correspond to the types of a particular
disease or to the various health outcomes of a patient subsequent to a course
of treatment. We show and demonstrate on some real datasets how the JCM
procedure can be used to carry out this supervised classification task. A
mixture distribution is used to model the distribution of the expressions of a
fixed set of markers for each cell in a sample with the components in the
mixture model corresponding to the various populations of cells in the
composition of the sample. For each class of samples, a class template is
formed by the adoption of random-effects terms to model the inter-sample
variation within a class. The classification of a new unclassified sample is
undertaken by assigning the unclassified sample to the class that minimizes the
Kullback-Leibler distance between its fitted mixture density and each class
density provided by the class templates.

a third `target' variable, one must decompose the total information into
redundant, unique and synergistic components, i.e. obtain a partial information
decomposition (PID). However Shannon's theory of information does not provide
formulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun
addressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been
proposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of
discrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on
Gaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of
Gaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy
reduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and
hence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra
information contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,
and can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources. We find
that Gaussian systems frequently exhibit net synergy, i.e. the information
carried jointly by both sources is greater than the sum of informations carried
by each source individually. Drawing from several explicit examples, we discuss
the implications of these findings for measures of information transfer and
information-based measures of complexity, both generally and within a
neuroscience setting. Importantly, by providing independent formulae for
synergy and redundancy applicable to continuous time-series data, we open up a
new approach to characterizing and quantifying information sharing amongst
complex system variables.

emission and enhancements in the HCN-to-CO ratio. These clouds are massive
(~10^7 M_sun) structures with sizes (~30 pc) similar to GMCs in other systems.
Compared to disk galaxy GMCs, they show high line widths (~20-40 km/s) given
their size, with implied Mach numbers ~90. The clouds also show high surface
(~6,000 M_sun/pc^2) and volume densities (n_H2~2,000 cm^-3). Given these,
self-gravity can explain the line widths. This short free fall time (~0.7 Myr)
helps explain the more efficient star formation in NGC 253. We also consider
the starburst region as a whole. The geometry is confused by the high
inclination, but simple models support a non-axisymmetric, bar-like geometry
with a compact, clumpy region of high gas density embedded in an extended CO
distribution. Even for the whole region, the surface density still exceeds that
of a disk galaxy GMC. The orbital time (~10 Myr), disk free fall time (<~ 3
Myr), and disk crossing time (<~ 3 Myr) are each much shorter than in a normal

predictions from assuming vertical dynamical equilibrium or a marginally stable

affected by the number of camera sensors deployed (spatial coverage), as well
as the number of captured video frames out of which each node processes and
transmits data (temporal coverage). In this paper, we explore this aspect for
uniformly-formed VSNs, i.e., networks comprising identical wireless visual
sensor nodes connected to a collection node via a balanced cluster-tree
topology, with each node producing independent identically-distributed
bitstream sizes after processing the video frames captured within each network
activation interval. We derive analytic results for the energy-optimal
spatio-temporal coverage parameters of such VSNs under a-priori known bounds
for the number of frames to process per sensor and the number of nodes to
deploy within each tier of the VSN. Our results are parametric to the
probability density function characterizing the bitstream size produced by each
node and the energy consumption rates of the system of interest. Experimental
results reveal that our analytic results are always within 7% of the energy
consumption measurements for a wide range of settings. In addition, results
obtained via a multimedia subsystem show that the optimal spatio-temporal
settings derived by the proposed framework allow for substantial reduction of
energy consumption in comparison to ad-hoc settings. As such, our analytic
modeling is useful for early-stage studies of possible VSN deployments under
collision-free MAC protocols prior to costly and time-consuming experiments in

that for any such braided field, if a force-free equilibrium exists then it

follow scaling laws, and this allows us to extrapolate beyond the numerically

In particular, allosteric sites in proteins are a major target to increase the

Here, we use an atomistic graph-theoretical approach that exploits Markov

allosteric protein, caspase-1. Firstly, we use Markov Stability community
detection to perform a multiscale analysis of the structure of caspase-1 which
reveals that the active conformation has a weaker, less compartmentalised
large-scale structure as compared to the inactive conformation, resulting in
greater intra-protein coherence and signal propagation. We also carry out a
full computational point mutagenesis and identify that only a few residues are
critical to such structural coherence. Secondly, we characterise explicitly the
transients of random walks originating at the active site and predict the
location of a known allosteric site in this protein quantifying the
contribution of individual bonds to the communication pathway between the
active and allosteric sites. Several of the bonds we find have been shown
experimentally to be functionally critical, but we also predict a number of as

model for astrophysical applications, from which compact hybrid star
configurations are constructed. These are composed of a quark core and a
hadronic shell with a first-order phase transition at their interface. The
resulting mass-radius relations are in accordance with the latest astrophysical
constraints. Methods: The quark matter description is based on a quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) motivated chiral approach with higher-order quark
interactions in the Dirac scalar and vector coupling channels. For hadronic
matter we select a relativistic mean-field equation of state with
density-dependent couplings. Since the nucleons are treated in the
quasi-particle framework, an excluded volume correction has been included for
the nuclear equation of state at suprasaturation density which takes into
account the finite size of the nucleons. Results: These novel aspects, excluded
volume in the hadronic phase and the higher-order repulsive interactions in the
quark phase, lead to a strong first-order phase transition with large latent
heat, i.e. the energy-density jump at the phase transition, which fulfils a
criterion for a disconnected third-family branch of compact stars in the
mass-radius relationship. These twin stars appear at high masses ($\sim$ 2
M$_\odot$) that are relevant for current observations of high-mass pulsars.
Conclusions: This analysis offers a unique possibility by radius observations
of compact stars to probe the QCD phase diagram at zero temperature and large
chemical potential and even to support the existence of a critical point in the
QCD phase diagram.

agreement with effective equations of motion obtained from a generalization of
the Thiele approach. Skyrmion-defect interactions are described by an effective
potential with both repulsive and attractive components. For small current
densities a previously pinned skyrmion stays pinned whereas an unpinned
skyrmion moves around the impurities and never gets captured. For higher
current densities, j_c1 < j < j_c2, however, single holes are able to capture
moving skyrmions. The maximal cross section is proportional to the skyrmion
radius and to Sqrt(alpha), where alpha is the Gilbert damping. For j > j_c2 all
skyrmions are depinned. Small changes of the magnetic field strongly change the
pinning properties, one can even reach a regime without pinning, j_c2=0. We
also show that a small density of holes can effectively accelerate the motion

decreases in the variety of the classifications, and not to disparity or
technological distance, measured as (1 - cosine). A single frequency component
can accordingly be shown in the periodogram. Furthermore, the cyclical patterns
are associated with the numbers of inventors in the respective technologies.
Sometimes increased variety leads to a boost in the number of inventors, but in
early phases--when the technology is still under constructio--it can also be
the other way round. Since the development of the cycles thus seems independent
of technological distances among the patents, the visualization in terms of

in which stellar rotation provides a significant contribution to the angular
momentum budget. We begin by applying classic stability considerations for two
bodies to planetary systems --- where one mass is much smaller than the other.
The application of these stability criteria to a subset of the Kepler sample
indicates that the majority of the systems are not in a stable equilibrium
state. Motivated by this finding, we generalize the stability calculation to
include the quadrupole moment for the host star. In general, a stable
equilibrium requires that the total system angular momentum exceeds a minimum
value (denoted here as $L_X$) and that the orbital angular momentum of the
planet exceeds a minimum fraction of the total. Most, but not all, of the
observed planetary systems in the sample have enough total angular momentum to
allow an equilibrium state. Even with the generalizations of this paper,
however, most systems have too little orbital angular momentum (relative to the
total) and are not in an equilibrium configuration. Finally, we consider the
time evolution of these planetary systems; the results constrain the tidal
quality factor of the stars and suggest that $10^6\le{Q_\ast}\le10^7$.

linear projections to the input matrix or signal data during the top-level GEMM

the projected inputs and the results are accumulated to form the final outputs.
Throughput and energy scaling takes place by changing the number of projections
computed by each kernel, which in turn produces approximate results, i.e.
changes the precision of the performed computation. Results derived from a
voltage- and frequency-scaled ARM Cortex A15 processor running face recognition
and music matching algorithms demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for
280%~440% increase of processing throughput and 75%~80% decrease of energy
consumption against optimized GEMM and CONV kernels without any impact in the

constraint equation is obtained which generates the f(G) models that do not
suffer from the coincidence problem. Due to the absence of a universally
accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental theory, the study is
conducted over three different forms of logically chosen interaction terms. To
illustrate the set-up three widely known models of f(G) gravity are taken into
consideration and the problem is studied under the designed set-up. The study
reveals that the popular f(G) gravity models does not approve of a satisfactory
solution of the long standing coincidence problem, thus proving to be a major
setback for them as successful models of universe. Finally, two
non-conventional models of f(G) gravity have been proposed and studied in the
framework of the designed set-up. It is seen that a complete solution of the
coincidence problem is achieved for these models. The study also reveals that
the b-interaction term is much more preferable compared to the other
interactions, due to its greater compliance with the recent observational data.

challenged by the {\em Swift} discovery of short GRBs showing Extended Emission

show an initial hard pulse, characteristic of SGRBs, followed by a long
duration soft tail. We here consider the spectral peak energy
($E_{p,i}$)-radiated energy $(E_{iso})$ correlation and the redshift
distributions to probe the astronomical and physical origin of these different
classes of GRBs. We consider {\em Swift} events of $15$ SGRBs, $7$ SGRBEEs, 3
LGRBNs and 230 LGRBs. The spectral-energy properties of the initial pulse of
both SGRBEE and LGRBNs are found to coincide with those of SGRBs. A Monte Carlo
simulation shows that the redshift distributions of SGRBs, SGRBEE and LGRBNs
fall outside the distribution of LGRBs at 4.75$\,\sigma$, 4.67$\,\sigma$ and
4.31$\sigma$, respectively. A distinct origin of SGRBEEs with respect to LGRBs
is also supported by the elliptical host galaxies of the SGRBEE events 050509B

LGRBNs originate in mergers as SGRBs. Moreover, long/soft tail of SGRB and
LGRBNs satisfy the same $E_{p,i}-E_{iso}$ Amati-correlation holding for normal
LGRBs. This fact points to rapidly rotating black holes as a common long-lived
inner engine produced by different astronomical progenitors (mergers and

putative inner engines powering long GRBs. We describe a chirp search method
which steps aside Fourier analysis for signal detection in the Poisson
noise-dominated 2 kHz sampled BeppoSAX light curves. An efficient numerical
implementation is described in $O(Nn\log n)$ operations, where $N$ is the
number of chirp templates and $n$ is the length of the light curve time series,
suited for embarrassingly parallel processing. For detection of individual
chirps of duration $\tau=1$ s, the method is one order of magnitude more
sensitive in SNR than Fourier analysis. The Fourier-chirp spectra of GRB 010408
and GRB 970816 show a continuation of the spectral slope up to 1 kHz of
turbulence identified in low frequency Fourier analysis. The same continuation
is observed in an ensemble averaged spectrum of 40 bright long GRBs. An outlook
on a similar analysis of upcoming gravitational wave data is included.

sets and conflict-avoiding codes. By means of disjoint difference sets, we
obtain an infinite number of such user-irrepressible sequence sets whose
lengths are shorter than known results in general. Subsequently, the newly
defined partially conflict-avoiding codes are discussed.
