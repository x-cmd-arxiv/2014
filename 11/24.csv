spatial distribution characteristics above sunspots and faculae and their

the corona from the deep photosphere most effectively. We used
Fast-Fourier-Transform and frequency filtration of the intensity and
Doppler-velocity variations with Morlet wavelet to trace the wave propagating
from the photosphere to the chromosphere and corona. Spatial distribution of
low-frequency (1-2 mHz) oscillations outlines well the fan-loop structures in
the corona (the Fe IX 171 line) above sunspots and faculae. High-frequency
oscillations (5-7 mHz) are concentrated in fragments inside the photospheric
umbra boundaries and close to facular-region centers. This implies that the
upper parts of most coronal loops, which transfer low-frequency oscillations
from the photosphere, sit in the Fe IX 171 line-formation layer. We used
dominant frequency vs. distance from barycenter relations to estimate
magnetic-tube inclination angle in the higher layers, which poses difficulties
for direct magnetic-field measurements. According to our calculations, this
angle is about 40 degrees in the transition region around umbra borders. Phase
velocities measured in the coronal loops' upper parts in the Fe IX 171
line-formation layer reach 100-150 km/s for sunspots and 50-100 km/s for
faculae.

easily controlled by gate voltages and under certain conditions, becomes
sufficiently large to be measurable in current experimental setups. In fact it
reaches a maximum value when one of the spins are completely filtered due to
the vanishing density of states of the corresponding spin species in the
ferromagnetic part. Considering an N|F|N structure with a finite ferromagnetic

the transverse spin coherence length can be comparable to the length of F
denoted by $L$. Subsequently, due to the quantum interferences, the spin
current becomes oscillatory function of $JL/\hbar v_F$ in which $J$ is the spin

play important roles in applications, such as linear inverse problems with
convex constraints, and constrained statistical inference. It is a well-known
fact that, given a closed convex cone $C\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, its conic
intrinsic volumes determine a probability measure on the finite set
$\{0,1,...d\}$, customarily denoted by $\mathcal{L}(V_C)$. The aim of the
present paper is to provide a Berry-Esseen bound for the normal approximation
of ${\cal L}(V_C)$, implying a general quantitative central limit theorem (CLT)
for sequences of (correctly normalised) discrete probability measures of the
type $\mathcal{L}(V_{C_n})$, $n\geq 1$. This bound shows that, in the
high-dimensional limit, most conic intrinsic volumes encountered in
applications can be approximated by a suitable Gaussian distribution. Our
approach is based on a variety of techniques, namely: (1) Steiner formulae for
closed convex cones, (2) Stein's method and second order Poincar\'e inequality,
(3) concentration estimates, and (4) Fourier analysis. Our results explicitly
connect the sharp phase transitions, observed in many regularised linear
inverse problems with convex constraints, with the asymptotic Gaussian
fluctuations of the intrinsic volumes of the associated descent cones. In
particular, our findings complete and further illuminate the recent
breakthrough discoveries by Amelunxen, Lotz, McCoy and Tropp (2014) and McCoy
and Tropp (2014) about the concentration of conic intrinsic volumes and its
connection with threshold phenomena. As an additional outgrowth of our work we
develop total variation bounds for normal approximations of the lengths of
projections of Gaussian vectors on closed convex sets.

segments a 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional array of data values into a set of disjoint

nominated constant data level are assumed to be background pixels and are not
assigned to any clump. FellWalker is thus equivalent in purpose to the

basis of a set of evenly-spaced contours and thus uses only a small fraction of
the available data values, the FellWalker algorithm is based on a
gradient-tracing scheme which uses all available data values. Comparisons of
CLUMPFIND and FellWalker using a crowded field of artificial Gaussian clumps,
all of equal peak value and width, suggest that the results produced by
FellWalker are less dependent on specific parameter settings than are those of

dots, in which each electron is interacting with its nuclear spin environment.
Focusing on the case of uncoupled dots, and starting from either Bell or Werner
states of two qubits, we calculate the decay of entanglement due to the
hyperfine interaction with the nuclei. We mostly focus on the regime of
magnetic fields in which the bath-induced electron spin flips play a role, for
example their presence leads to the appearance of entanglement sudden death at
finite time for two qubits initialized in a Bell state. For these fields the
intrabath dipolar interactions and spatial inhomogeneity of hyperfine couplings
are irrelevant on the time scale of coherence (and entanglement) decay, and
most of the presented calculations are performed using the uniform-coupling
approximation to the exact hyperfine Hamiltonian. We provide a comprehensive
overview of entanglement decay in this regime, considering both free evolution
of the qubits, and an echo protocol with simultaneous application of $\pi$
pulses to the two spins. All the currently relevant for experiments bath states
are considered: the thermal state, narrowed states (characterized by diminished
uncertainty of one of the components of the Overhauser field) of two
uncorrelated baths, and a correlated narrowed state with a well-defined value
of the $z$ component of the Overhauser field interdot gradient. While we mostly
use concurrence to quantify the amount of entanglement in a mixed state of the
two electron spins, we also show that their entanglement dynamics can be
reconstructed from measurements of the currently relevant for experiments
entanglement witnesses, and the fidelity of quantum teleportation performed
using a partially disentangled state as a resource.

from its response to a known input signal. More specifically, we consider
systems whose response to the input signal is given by a weighted superposition
of delayed and Doppler shifted versions of the input. This problem arises in a
multitude of applications such as wireless communications and radar imaging.
Due to practical constraints, the input signal has finite bandwidth B, and the
received signal is observed over a finite time interval of length T only. This
gives rise to a delay and Doppler resolution of 1/B and 1/T. We show that this
resolution limit can be overcome, i.e., we can exactly recover the continuous
delay-Doppler pairs and the corresponding attenuation factors, by solving a
convex optimization problem. This result holds provided that the distance
between the delay-Doppler pairs is at least 2.37/B in time or 2.37/T in
frequency. Furthermore, this result allows the total number of delay-Doppler
pairs to be linear up to a log-factor in BT, the dimensionality of the response
of the system, and thereby the limit for identifiability. Stated differently,
we show that we can estimate the time-frequency components of a signal that is
S-sparse in the continuous dictionary of time-frequency shifts of a random
window function, from a number of measurements, that is linear up to a
log-factor in S.

the single target paradigm (one protein or target, one disease, one drug) that
has been the dominant premise in drug development in the recent past is
untenable. More often than not, a drug-like compound (ligand) can be
promiscuous - that is, it can interact with more than one target protein. In
recent years, in in silico target prediction methods the promiscuity issue has
been approached computationally in different ways. In this study we confine
attention to the so-called ligand-based target prediction machine learning
approaches, commonly referred to as target-fishing. With a few exceptions, the
target-fishing approaches that are currently ubiquitous in cheminformatics
literature can be essentially viewed as single-label multi-classification
schemes; these approaches inherently bank on the single target paradigm
assumption that a ligand can home in on one specific target. In order to
address the ligand promiscuity issue, one might be able to cast target-fishing
as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. For illustrative and
comparison purposes, single-label and multi-label Naive Bayes classification
models (denoted here by SMM and MMM, respectively) for target-fishing were
implemented. The models were constructed and tested on 65,587 compounds and 308
targets retrieved from the ChEMBL17 database. SMM and MMM performed
differently: for 16,344 test compounds, the MMM model returned recall and
precision values of 0.8058 and 0.6622, respectively; the corresponding recall
and precision values yielded by the SMM model were 0.7805 and 0.7596,

paper we study the effects of anisotropy on slowly rotating stars in General
Relativity. We also consider one of the most popular extensions of Einstein's
theory, namely scalar-tensor theories allowing for spontaneous scalarization (a
phase transition similar to spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnetic
materials). Anisotropy affects the moment of inertia of neutron stars (a
quantity that could potentially be measured in binary pulsar systems) in both
theories. We find that the effects of scalarization increase (decrease) when
the tangential pressure is bigger (smaller) than the radial pressure, and we
present a simple criterion to determine the onset of scalarization by
linearizing the scalar-field equation. Our calculations suggest that binary
pulsar observations may constrain the degree of anisotropy or even, more
optimistically, provide evidence for anisotropy in neutron star cores.

back-action which limits the knowledge acquired by the measurement. A careful
balance between the information obtained and the back-action disturbance leads
to a limit known as the standard quantum limit. The means to surpass this limit
by modulating the measurement strength with the period proportional to half
period of the oscillation has been proposed decades ago (Braginskii et al 1978
JETP Lett. 27 276; Thorne et al 1978 Phys. Rev. Lett. 40 667; Braginskii et al

squeezed state of one quadrature of the oscillator motion with the quantum
noise below that of the zero-point fluctuations has been a long-standing goal.
Here, we report on the generation of a quadrature-squeezed state of an
oscillator by stroboscopic back-action evading measurement. The oscillator is
the collective spin of an atomic ensemble precessing in magnetic field. It is
initially prepared in nearly the ground state with an average thermal occupancy
number $0.08 \pm 0.01$. The oscillator is coupled to the optical mode of a
cavity, and the cavity output field detected with polarization homodyning
serves as the meter. A back-action-evading measurement is performed by
stroboscopically modulating the intensity of the light field at twice the
Larmor frequency, resulting in a squeezed state conditioned on the
light-polarization measurement with $2.2 \pm 0.3$ dB noise reduction below the
zero-point fluctuations for the measured quadrature. The demonstrated squeezing
holds promise for metrological advantage in quantum sensing.

principally resulting from ultraviolet (UV) photon absorption- induced
processing, are likely at the heart of the variations in the observed
properties of dust in the interstellar medium. Aims. The consequences of the
size-dependent and compositional variations in a-C(:H), from aliphatic-rich
a-C:H to aromatic-rich a-C, are studied within the context of the interstellar
dust extinction and emission. Methods. Newly-derived optical property data for
a-C(:H) materials, combined with that for an amorphous forsterite-type silicate
with iron nano-particle inclusions, a-SilFe, are used to explore dust evolution
in the interstellar medium. Results. We present a new dust model that consists
of a power-law distribution of small a-C grains and log-normal distributions of
large a-SilFe and a-C(:H) grains. The model, which is firmly anchored by
laboratory-data, is shown to quite naturally explain the variations in the
infrared (IR) to far-ultraviolet (FUV) extinction, the 217 nm UV bump, the IR
absorption and emission bands and the IR-mm dust emission. Conclusions. The
major strengths of the new model are its inherent simplicity and built-in
capacity to follow dust evolution in interstellar media. We show that mantle
accretion in molecular clouds and UV photo-processing in photo-dominated
regions are likely the major drivers of dust evolution.

theories of gravitation such as supergravity and superstring theories posses
vacuum states with $\Lambda<0$. Even within the framework of general
relativity, a negative cosmological constant permits black holes with horizons
topologically different from the usual spherical ones. These solutions are
convertible to wormhole solutions by adding some exotic matter. In this paper,
the asymptotically flat wormhole solutions in a generic cosmological constant
background are studied. By constructing a specific class of shape functions,
mass function, energy density and pressure profiles which support such a
geometry are obtained. It is shown that for having such a geometry, the
wormhole throat $r_0$, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the equation of
state parameter $\omega$ should satisfy two specific conditions. The
possibility of setting different values for the parameters of the model helps
us to find exact solutions for the metric functions, mass functions and
energy-momentum profiles. At last, the volume integral quantifier, which
provides useful information about the total amount of energy condition

exploit and preserve structure in the pivoted Cholesky factorization when
approximating a matrix $A$ that is both symmetric ($A=A^T$) and what we call
{\em perfect shuffle symmetric}, or {\em perf-symmetric}. The latter property
means that $A = \Pi A\Pi$ where $\Pi$ is a permutation with the property that
$\Pi v = v$ if $v$ is the vec of a symmetric matrix and $\Pi v = -v$ if $v$ is
the vec of a skew-symmetric matrix. Matrices with this structure can arise when
an order-4 tensor $\cal A$ is unfolded and its elements satisfy ${\cal

case in certain quantum chemistry applications where the tensor entries are
electronic repulsion integrals. Our technique involves a closed-form block
diagonalization followed by one or two half-sized pivoted Cholesky

important if the entries in $\cal A$ are expensive to compute. In addition to
being a structure preserving rank reduction technique, we find that this

with increasing wavelengths, by amounts in agreement with expectations from
fireball expansions. The radiative energy released during SdM declined
following an exponential pattern, while the breadth of individual SdM and the
time interval between them widened. Emission lines remained sharp (FWHM~1000
km/s) throughout the whole nova evolution, with the exception of a broad
pedestal with a trapezoidal shape (extending for 3600 km/sec at the top and
4500 km/sec at the bottom) which was only seen during the advanced decline from
SdM maxima and was absent in between SdM. V5588 Sgr at maximum light displayed

dependent limit problem. However, the noncritical scaling ($\e^\beta,\quad
\beta>1$) is considered in front of the nonlinear term. The homogenized system
in the limit is obtained as a Darcy's law with memory with two permeabilities
and an extra term that is due to the stochastic perturbation on the boundary of
the holes. We use the two-scale convergence method. Due to the stochastic
integral, the pressure that appears in the variational formulation does not
have enough regularity in time. This fact made us rely only on the variational
formulation for the passage to the limit on the solution. We obtain a
variational formulation for the limit that is solution of a Stokes system with
two pressures. This two-scale limit gives rise to three cell problems, two of
them give the permeabilities while the third one gives an extra term in the

deciding if two distributions are different, given samples from both, without
making any parametric assumptions about the form of the distributions. The
current literature is split into two kinds of tests - those which are
consistent without any assumptions about how the distributions may differ
(\textit{general} alternatives), and those which are designed to specifically
test easier alternatives, like a difference in means (\textit{mean-shift}
alternatives).
  The main contribution of this paper is to explicitly characterize the power
of a popular nonparametric two sample test, designed for general alternatives,
under a mean-shift alternative in the high-dimensional setting. Specifically,
we explicitly derive the power of the linear-time Maximum Mean Discrepancy
statistic using the Gaussian kernel, where the dimension and sample size can
both tend to infinity at any rate, and the two distributions differ in their
means. As a corollary, we find that if the signal-to-noise ratio is held
constant, then the test's power goes to one if the number of samples increases
faster than the dimension increases. This is the first explicit power
derivation for a general nonparametric test in the high-dimensional setting,
and also the first analysis of how tests designed for general alternatives
perform when faced with easier ones.

guaranteed as long as the heterozygote individuals enjoy a selective advantage.
Despite the classic nature of the problem, as we move towards increasingly

understanding its implications is still not fully understood. Our key
contribution is to establish complexity theoretic hardness results implying
that even in the textbook case of single locus diploid models predicting

algorithmically intractable. We complement our results by establishing that
under randomly chosen fitness landscapes diversity survives with significant
probability. Our results are structurally robust along several dimensions

stability/persistence, restriction to typical subclasses of fitness
landscapes). Technically, our results exploit connections between game theory,
nonlinear dynamical systems, complexity theory and biology and establish
hardness results for predicting the evolution of a deterministic variant of the
well known multiplicative weights update algorithm in symmetric coordination

plane. Our models are seen as a deformation of the 3D Euler equations which
respects the variational structure of the original equations so that explicit
solutions can be found for the supremum norms of the basic fields. The value of
the model's parameter determines if there is finite-time blowup, and the
singularity time can be computed explicitly in terms of the initial conditions
and the model's parameter. We use a representative parameter value, for which
the solution blows up in finite-time, as a benchmark for the systematic study
of errors in numerical solutions. We compare numerical integrations of our
""original"" model with a ""mapped"" version of these equations. The mapped version
is a globally regular (in time) system of equations, obtained via a bijective
nonlinear mapping of time and fields from the original model equations
(Bustamante 2011). We show that the mapped system's numerical solution
increases accuracy in estimates of supremum norms and singularity time while
entailing only a small additional computational cost. We study the Fourier
spectrum of the model's numerical solution and find that the analyticity-strip
width (a measure of the solution's analyticity) tends to zero as a power law in
a finite time. This is in agreement with the finite-time blowup of the supremum
norms, in the light of rigorous bounds stemming from the bridge (Bustamante &

mutation of one gene depend on one or more mutations at another gene. Epistasis
is critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes,
including pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational
load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life.
Nevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of
epistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene,
whereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different
mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue
by combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently
published high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles
can epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between
two random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more
severe mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative
epistasis than the other allele is 50-70% in eukaryotic organisms, but only
20-30% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that
predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up
the process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our
results indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the
genome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate
epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.

harmoniously agrees with that of star-forming galaxies at $z \sim$ 1.4-1.7 in
stellar mass range of $10^{8.5}M_{\odot}<M_{*}<10^{11}M_{\odot}$. The relation
between stellar mass, metallicity and star formation rate of our sample is
roughly consistent with the local fundamental metallicity relation. We find
that the mass-metallicity relation shows a strong correlation with the
4000\AA\, break; galaxies with higher 4000\AA\, break typically have higher
metallicity at a fixed mass, by 0.06 dex in average. This trend is independent
of the methodology of metallicity. We also use the metallicity estimated by

be reduced from 0.091 to 0.077 dex by a three-dimensional relation between
stellar mass, metallicity and 4000\AA\, break. The reduction of scatter in

$z \sim 0.57$ in the BH mass range of $10^{7.4-9.1} M_{\odot}$. By consistently
applying multi-component spectral and structural decomposition to high-quality
Keck spectra and high-resolution HST images, BH masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) are
estimated using the H$\beta$ broad emission line combined with the 5100 \AA\
nuclear luminosity, and bulge luminosities ($L_{\rm bul}$) are derived from
surface photometry. Comparing the resulting $M_{\rm BH}-L_{\rm bul}$ relation
to local active galaxies and taking into account selection effects, we find
evolution of the form $M_{\rm BH} / L_{\rm bul} \propto (1+z)^{\gamma}$ with
$\gamma=1.8\pm0.7$, consistent with BH growth preceding that of the host
galaxies. Including an additional sample of 27 active galaxies with $0.5<z<1.9$
taken from the literature and measured in a consistent way, we obtain
$\gamma=0.9\pm0.7$ for the $M_{\rm BH}-L_{\rm bul}$ relation and
$\gamma=0.4\pm0.5$ for the $M_{\rm BH}$--total host galaxy luminosity ($L_{\rm
host}$) relation. The results strengthen the findings from our previous studies
and provide additional evidence for host-galaxy bulge growth being dominated by
disk-to-bulge transformation via minor mergers and/or disk instabilities.

observations, but detected in a 2010 \xmm{} observation at a significance level
of $9\sigma$ in the 0.3--8 keV energy band. The \xmm{} spectrum is consistent
with a power law with photon index $\Gamma = 3.17^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$, but is
better fit with a $kT_{in} = 0.70\pm0.06$\,keV disk blackbody. The luminosity
was $\sim 10^{38}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, and the source displayed strong short-term
X-ray variability. These results, combined with the hardness ratios of its
emission, strongly suggest an X-ray binary nature for the source. The follow-up
studies with \swift{} XRT observations revealed that the source exhibited
recurrent outbursts with period about a month. The XRT spectra can be described
by a power law ($\Gamma\sim 2.5$--2.9) or a disk blackbody ($kT_{in}\sim
0.8$--1.0\,keV), and the luminosity was in a range of
10$^{38}$--10$^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, with no evidence showing any significant
changes of the spectral parameters in the observations. Based on the X-ray
spectral and temporal properties, we conclude that XMMU J001446.81-391123.48 is
a new transient X-ray binary in NGC 55, which possibly contains a black hole
primary.

$d(z)$ that are of relevance for SN1a cosmology and for future peculiar
velocity surveys at non-negligible redshifts.
  1) Previous work has shown that the correction to the lowest order
perturbation $\delta d / d = -\delta v / c z$ has the peculiar characteristic
that it appears to depend on the absolute state of motion of sources, rather
than on their motion relative to that of the observer. The resolution of this
apparent violation of the equivalence principle is that it is necessary to
allow for evolution of the velocities with time, and also, when considering
perturbations on the scale of the observer-source separation, to include the
gravitational redshift effect. We provide an expression for $\delta d / d$ that
provides a physically consistent way to measure peculiar velocities and
determine their impact for SN1a cosmology.
  2) We then calculate the perturbation to the redshift as a function of source
flux density, which has been proposed as an alternative probe of large-scale
motions. We show how the inclusion of surface brightness modulation modifies
the relation between $\delta z(m)$ and the peculiar velocity, and that, while
the noise properties of this method might appear promising, the velocity signal
is swamped by the effect of galaxy clustering for most scales of interest.
  3) We show how, in linear theory, peculiar velocity measurements are biased
downwards by the effect of smaller scale motions or by measurement errors (such
as in photometric redshifts). Our results nicely explain the effects seen in
simulations by Koda et al.\ 2013.
  We critically examine the prospects for extending peculiar velocity studies
to larger scales with near-term future surveys.

have independent effects with regard to certain phenotypes. Understanding the
global epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.
Current knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited
by the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic
relations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis
to simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations.
Specifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the
mutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis
tends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting
conditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing
deleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of
epistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic
interactions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable
epistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas
genes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore,
genes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas
this co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific
epistasis. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide picture about epistatic
dynamics under environmental perturbations.

electroweak oblique parameters $\Delta S$ and $\Delta T$ are studied. In the
minimal model, the mixture of the septet $\eta$ and the scalar doublet in the
standard model (SM) is driven by a non-Hermitian dimension-7 operator. For a
smaller bare mass of the septet, $\Delta S$ gives a stringent constraint on the
mixing angle $\sin\beta$ between the CP-odd neutral parts of the SM Higgs
doublet and $\eta$. In general, increasing the mass of the scalar septet
$M_\eta$ will enhance the deviation of $T$ from the SM, whereas it decreases
the magnitude of $\Delta S$ for a larger bare mass within the range
$M_\eta\lesssim 400\,{\rm GeV}$. We also examine two extended models from the
ordinary doublet-septet mixture pattern. One of them is based on a inert
doublet-septet mixing pattern, in which there is no vacuum expectation value
for the neutral component of $\eta$, and a stable dark matter could naturally
exist. For a benchmark point with this inner doublet mass of $M_\chi=250{\rm}$
and $M_\eta=400\,{\rm GeV}$ in this model, the mixing coefficient is found to
be less than $1.8$. The other extension is constructed by imposing a doubly
charged scalar mixed with the doubly charged component of the septet. Apart
from the contribution by the septet-doublet admixture, $\Delta S$ is suppressed
by a factor of $s_W^2$ and $\Delta T$ has a significant constraint due to the
vanishing vacuum polarization of $Z$ at the momentum transfer $p^2=0$.

  The dual to this statement checks whether an effective motif $M$ belongs to
the subcategory of $DM^{eff}_{gm,R}$ generated by motives of varieties of

range 0.01$<$z$<$0.1 (8399 galaxies in $g$ to $K_s$ bands) to derive the
stellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations for various divisions of 'early'

(i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, the
adopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection of
outliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. In particular we
note that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits
($<10^{10}\mathcal{M_{\odot}}$) the S\'ersic index bimodality, evident for high
mass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separator
of early- and late-type systems. The final set of stellar mass $-$ half-light
radius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10
bands ($ugrizZYJHK_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-z
benchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. Exploring the variation of the
stellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlier
findings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at a
smaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\mathcal{M_{\odot}}$ both
spiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $K_s$
(which is near linear in log wavelength). Finally we note that the sizes used
in this work are derived from 2D S\'ersic light profile fitting (using

the packet level has stimulated the deployment of packet-level redundancy
elimination techniques within the network by enabling network nodes to memorize
data packets. Redundancy elimination results in traffic reduction which in turn
improves the efficiency of network links. In this paper, the concept of network
compression is introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation
beyond removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress
redundancy.
  In the first part of the paper, we introduce ""memory-assisted compression"",
which utilizes the memorized content within the network to learn the statistics
of the information source generating the packets which can then be used toward
reducing the length of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source.
Using simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that
memory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction.
  In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average
network-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing and
memory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall traffic. We
derive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain in Erdos-Renyi
random network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for the number of
memories deployed in a random graph beyond which network-wide benefits start to
shine. Finally, the network-wide benefits are studied on Internet-like
scale-free networks. We show that non-vanishing network compression gain is
obtained even when only a tiny fraction of the total number of nodes in the
network are memory-enabled.

purpose of parameter estimation: The dynamics of open quantum systems is
typically described by a quantum dynamical semigroup generator ${\cal L}$. The
eigenvalues of ${\cal L}$ are complex, reflecting unitary as well as
dissipative dynamics. For certain values of parameters defining ${\cal L}$,
non-hermitian degeneracies emerge, i.e. exceptional points ($EP$). The
dynamical signature of these $EP$s corresponds to a unique time evolution. This
unique feature can be employed experimentally to locate the $EP$s and thereby
to determine the intrinsic system parameters with a high accuracy. This way we
turn the disadvantage of the dissipation into an advantage. We demonstrate this
method in the open system dynamics of a two-level system described by the Bloch
equation, which has become the paradigm of diverse fields in physics, from NMR

this work. It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available,
e.g., stereo correspondences, motions, etc. Previous efforts have been focusing
on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all
using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features
from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for
various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous
characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally
formulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem.
Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for
estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity
of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured
learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous
CRF in a unified deep CNN framework.
  The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with
no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the
integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can
exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP
problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form
solutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and
outdoor scene datasets.

errors in parallax and the high interstellar extinction in the inner parts of
the Galactic disc prevent us to model the bar overdensity. This result suggests
the need to combine Gaia and IR data to undertake such studies. We find that IR

the framework of the hadronic model in which gamma-rays are produced by
collisions of relativistic protons with the protons of background plasma in the
Galactic halo. It is assumed in this model that the observed radio emission
from the FBs is due to synchrotron radiation of secondary electrons produced by
$pp$ collisions. However, if these electrons loose their energy by the
synchrotron and inverse-Compton, the spectrum of secondary electrons is too
soft, and an additional arbitrary component of primary electrons is necessary
in order to reproduce the radio data. Thus, a mixture of the hadronic and
leptonic models is required for the observed radio flux. It was shown that if
the spectrum of primary electrons is $\propto E_e^{-2}$, the permitted range of
the magnetic field strength is within 2 - 7 $\mu$G region. The fraction of
gamma-rays produced by $pp$ collisions can reach about 80% of the total
gamma-ray flux from the FBs. If magnetic field is <2 $\mu$G or >7 $\mu$G the
model is unable to reproduce the data. Alternatively, the electrons in the FBs
may lose their energy by adiabatic energy losses if there is a strong plasma
outflow in the GC. Then, the pure hadronic model is able to reproduce
characteristics of the radio and gamma-ray flux from the FBs. However, in this
case the required magnetic field strength in the FBs and the power of CR
sources are much higher than those followed from observations.

emerge from the initial singularity while descending it. As a result, in this

We devise how this approach can enable the generation of IAP with the available
high-energy kHz-repetition-rate Ytterbium-based laser amplifiers (delivering
180-fs, 1030-nm pulses). We show theoretically that this requires a
three-colour field composed of the fundamental and its second harmonic as well
as a lower-frequency auxiliary component. We present pulse characterization
measurements of such auxiliary pulses generated directly by white-light seeded
OPA with the required significantly shorter pulse duration than the that of the
fundamental. This, combined with our recent experimental results on
three-colour waveform synthesis [Phys. Rev. X 4, 021028 (2014)], proves that
the theoretically considered multi-colour drivers for IAP generation can be
realized with existing high-power laser technology. The high-energy driver
pulses, combined with the strongly enhanced single-atom-level conversion
efficiency we observe in our calculations, thus make multi-colour drivers prime
candidates for the development of unprecedented high-energy IAP sources in the

Fisher vector coding (FVC) has been identified as an effective coding method
for image classification. Most, if not all, % FVC implementations employ the
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to characterize the generation process of local
features. This choice has shown to be sufficient for traditional low
dimensional local features, e.g., SIFT; and typically, good performance can be
achieved with only a few hundred Gaussian distributions. However, the same
number of Gaussians is insufficient to model the feature space spanned by
higher dimensional local features, which have become popular recently. In order
to improve the modeling capacity for high dimensional features, it turns out to
be inefficient and computationally impractical to simply increase the number of
Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a model in which each local feature is
drawn from a Gaussian distribution whose mean vector is sampled from a
subspace. With certain approximation, this model can be converted to a sparse
coding procedure and the learning/inference problems can be readily solved by
standard sparse coding methods. By calculating the gradient vector of the
proposed model, we derive a new fisher vector encoding strategy, termed Sparse
Coding based Fisher Vector Coding (SCFVC). Moreover, we adopt the recently
developed Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) descriptor as a high
dimensional local feature and implement image classification with the proposed
SCFVC. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only
significantly outperforms the traditional GMM based Fisher vector encoding but
also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in generic object recognition,

effect through the Polyakov Loop fields. The dilepton production rate in PNJL
model is enhanced compared to NJL and Born rate in the deconfined phase due to
the suppression of color degrees of freedom at moderate temperature. The
presence of isoscalar-vector interaction further enhances the dileption rate
over the Born rate in the low mass region. Further, we also have computed the
Euclidean correlation function in vector channel and the conserved density
fluctuation associated with temporal correlation function appropriate for a hot

amplitudes, we adopt a right-handed chiral correlator to do the LCSR
calculation. In the resultant LCSRs for the TFFs, the transverse leading-twist
distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;K^*}^\bot$ provides over $90\%$ contribution,
thus those TFFs provide good platforms for testing the property of
$\phi_{2;K^*}^\bot$. We suggest a model for $\phi_{2;K^*}^\bot$, in which two
parameters $B_{2;K^*}^\bot$ and $C_{2;K^*}^\bot$ dominantly control its
longitudinal distribution. With a proper choice of $B_{2;K^*}^\bot$ and
$C_{2;K^*}^\bot$, our predictions on $B\to K^*$ TFFs are consistent with those
of lattice QCD predictions. As an application, we also calculate the branching
fraction of the $B$-meson rare decay $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$. The predicted
differential branching fraction $d{\cal B}/dq^2(B\to K^{*}\mu^+\mu^-)$ is
consistent with the LHCb and Belle measurements within errors. After
integrating over the allowable $q^2$-region, we get the branching fraction,
${\cal B}(B\to K^*\mu^+\mu^-) = \left(1.088^{+0.261}_{-0.205} \right)\times
10^{-6}$, where the errors are squared average of the mentioned error sources.
When the precision of experimental measurements or the other source of
theoretical uncertainties for this process have been further improved in the

simple NLS1s like PG1244+026 by showing stronger broad spectral features at Fe
K and larger amplitude flux variability. These are correlated: the strongest Fe
K features are seen during deep dips in the light curves of complex NLS1s.
There are two competing explanations for these features, one where a compact
X-ray source on the spin axis of a highly spinning black hole approaches the
horizon and the consequent strong relativistic effects focus the intrinsic flux
onto the inner edge of a thin disc, giving a dim, reflection dominated
spectrum. The other is that the deep dips are caused by complex absorption by
clumps close to the hard X-ray source. The reflection dominated model is able
to reproduce the very short 30s soft lag from reverberation seen in the complex
NLS1 1H0707-495. However, it does not explain the characteristic switch to hard
lags on longer timescales. Instead, a full model of propagating fluctuations
coupled to reverberation can explain the switch in the simple NLS1 PG1244+026
using a low spin black hole. However PG1244+026 has a longer reverberation lag
of $\sim 200$s.
  Here we extend the successful propagation-reverberation model for the simple
NLS1 PG1244+026 to include the effect of absorption from clumps in a turbulent
region above the disk. The resulting occultations of the inner accretion flow
can introduce additional hard lags when relativistic effects are taken into
account. This dilutes the soft lag from reverberation and shifts it to higher
frequencies, making a smooth transition between the 200s lags seen in simple
NLS1s to the 30s lags in complex NLS1s. These two classes of NLS1 could then be
determined by inclination angle with respect to a clumpy, probably turbulent,
failed wind structure on the disc.

a non-semisimple group of gauge symmetry with observables consisting in the
holonomies of connections around three closed loops. The connections are a
linear combination of gauge potentials with coefficients containing a set of
one-dimensional scalar fields. It is checked that these observables are both
metric independent and gauge invariant. The gauge invariance is achieved by
requiring non-trivial gauge transformations in the scalar field sector. This
topological field theory is solvable and has only a relevant amplitude which
has been computed exactly. From this amplitude it is possible to isolate a
topological invariant which is Milnor's triple linking invariant. The
topological invariant obtained in this way is in the form of a sum of multiple
contour integrals. The contours coincide with the trajectories of the three
loops mentioned before. The introduction of the one-dimensional scalar field is
necessary in order to reproduce correctly the particular path ordering of the

10.1007/s11128-014-0866-z (2014)). The authors compared the efficiency of their
protocol with that of two other existing protocols and claimed that their
protocol is efficient. Here, we have shown that the efficiency of Hassanpour
Houshmand (HH) protocol is not high, and there exist several approaches through
which more efficient protocols for the same task can be designed. To establish
this point, we have proposed an efficient protocol of controlled deterministic
secure quantum communication which is based on permutation of particles (PoP)
technique and is considerably efficient compared to HH protocol. We have also
generalized this protocol into its bidirectional counterpart. Interestingly,
bipartite entanglement (Bell state) is sufficient for the realization of the
proposed protocols, but HH protocol and other existing protocols require at
least tripartite entanglement. Further, we have shown that it is possible to
construct a large number of efficient protocols of unidirectional and
bidirectional controlled deterministic secure quantum communication by using
various alternative approaches and different quantum states. These alternative
protocols can be realized by modifying the existing protocols of quantum secure
direct communication and deterministic secure quantum communication. We have
also shown that it is possible to design completely orthogonal-state-based
protocols for unidirectional and bidirectional controlled deterministic secure
quantum communication.

marked effectiveness in leveraging snapshot numbers for spatial resolution in
large field-of-view imaging. To acquire high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) images
under angularly varying illuminations for subsequent reconstruction, FP
requires long exposure time, which largely limits its practical applications.
In this paper, based on the recently reported Wirtinger flow algorithm, we
propose an iterative optimization framework incorporating phase retrieval and
noise relaxation together, to realize FP reconstruction using low SNR images
captured under short exposure time. Experiments on both synthetic and real
captured data validate the effectiveness of the proposed reconstruction method.
Specifically, the proposed technique could save around 80% exposure time to
achieve similar retrieval accuracy compared to the conventional FP. Besides, we
have released our source code for non-commercial use.

automatically integration out of heavy degrees of freedom, the running differs
markedly from the Gell-Mann-Low version. However, similar behaviour can be
observed: scalar mass squared parameter and the quartic coupling can change
sign from a positive to a negative one due to running which causes spontaneous
symmetry breaking or an instability in the renormalizable part of the potential
for a given range of scales. However, care must be taken when drawing
conclusions, because of the truncation of higher dimension operators. As for

channels confined between two flat planes. The location of the separatrix
between the Dean vortices, induced by centrifugal force, is dependent on the
location of the maxima of axial velocity. An asymmetry in the axial velocity
profile can change the location of the separatrix. This is achieved physically
by introducing slip alternatingly at the top and bottom walls. This leads to
streamline crossing and Lagrangian chaos. An approximate analytical solution of
the velocity field is obtained using perturbation theory. This is used to find
the Lagrangian trajectories of fluid particles. Poincare sections taken at
periodic locations in the axial direction are used to study the extent of
chaos. The extent of mixing, for low slip and low Reynolds numbers, is shown to
be greater when Dean vortices in adjacent half cells are counter-rotating. Wide
channels are observed to have much better mixing than tall channels; an
important observation not made for separatrix flows till now. Eulerian
indicators are used to gauge the extent of mixing with varying slip length and
it is shown that an optimum slip length exists which maximizes the mixing in a
particular geometry.

general trend on bipartite lattice with particle-hole symmetry. In particular,
recently fabricated graphene is well described by the honeycomb lattice within
tight-binding approximation. We use SUSY quantum mechanics to study the RKKY
interaction on bipartite lattices. The SUSY structure naturally differentiate
the zero modes and those paired states at finite energies. The significant role
of zero modes is largely ignored in previous literature because their measure
is often zero in the thermodynamic limit. Employing both real-time and
imaginary-time formalism, we arrive at the same conclusion: The RKKY
interaction for impurity spins on different sublattices is always
antiferromagnetic. However, for impurity spins on the same sublattice, the
carrier-mediated RKKY interaction is not always ferromagnetic. Only in the
absence of zero modes, the sign rule on the bipartite lattice holds true. Our
finding highlight the importance of the zero modes in bipartite lattices. Their
significance needs further investigation and may lead to important advances in

possibility to describe the properties of such media via a discrete set of

to recognize the infinite fields at the location of elementary charges as the
essential physical requirement, or such infinite fields can be ignored via
introduction of continuous charge distribution? In order to answer this
question, we consider the interaction of a homogeneously charged insulating
plate with a compact magnetic dipole, moving along the plate. We arrive at the
apparent violation of the angular momentum conservation law and show that this
law is re-covered, when the electric field at the location of each elementary

description of electromagnetic properties of material media via the continuous

discriminated by subtle and local differences. Variances in the pose, scale or

classification systems follow the pipeline of finding foreground object or
object parts (where) to extract discriminative features (what).
  In this paper, we propose to apply visual attention to fine-grained
classification task using deep neural network. Our pipeline integrates three
types of attention: the bottom-up attention that propose candidate patches, the
object-level top-down attention that selects relevant patches to a certain
object, and the part-level top-down attention that localizes discriminative
parts. We combine these attentions to train domain-specific deep nets, then use
it to improve both the what and where aspects. Importantly, we avoid using
expensive annotations like bounding box or part information from end-to-end.
The weak supervision constraint makes our work easier to generalize.
  We have verified the effectiveness of the method on the subsets of ILSVRC2012
dataset and CUB200_2011 dataset. Our pipeline delivered significant
improvements and achieved the best accuracy under the weakest supervision
condition. The performance is competitive against other methods that rely on

full Lennard - Jones (LJ) potential. The results found for freezing parameters
for the fluid - face centred cubic (fcc) crystal transition are in very good
agreement with simulation results. It is shown that although the contribution
made by the symmetry broken part to the grand thermodynamic potential at the
freezing point is small compared to that of the symmetry conserving part, its
role is crucial in stabilizing the crystalline structure and on values of
freezing parameters. The effect of attractive part of the LJ potential on the
freezing parameters is found to be small, confirming the view that the fluid -
solid transition is primarily determined by the repulsive part of the
potential.

For $\lambda<1$, when the spectrum is entirely real, there is a well-known

However, as $\lambda \to 1$, the spectrum, while remaining real, contains
Jordan blocks in which eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions

possibility of the polarization sounding of a pulsar magnetosphere using pulsar
self-radiation as a test signal will be considered. The main idea of such a
sounding is based on the fact that in some models of pulsar magnetosphere the
emission frequency depends on the height of its origin above the pulsar
surface. For this purpose it is needed to study the dependence of such a
parameter as the rotation measure on frequency and pulse phase. We expect that
it is possible to register the rotation measure dependence on the central
observing frequency and/or the pulse phase during the observations at widely
spaced frequencies in the same conditions. The reliable registration of this
dependence will result in resolving of the pulsar magnetosphere in depth. It is
preferably to carry out the polarization researches in the observational mode
of the individual pulses.
  In this part of the work the model of polarized pulsed radio emission and the
model of weakly anisotropic propagation medium are considered.
  In future articles we will show how to determine the polarization parameters
of pulsar radiation with the highest precision in presence of different types
of recorders on the receiving side. The specifics of polarization observations

$2n$ endowed with a $J$-preserving circle action with isolated fixed points. In
this note we analyse the `geography problem' for such manifolds, deriving
equations relating the Chern numbers to the index $k_0$ of $(M,J)$. We study
the symmetries and zeros of the Hilbert polynomial associated to $(M,J)$, which
imply many rigidity results for the Chern numbers when $k_0\neq 1$.
  We apply these results to the category of compact, connected symplectic
manifolds. A long-standing question posed by McDuff and Salamon, also known as
the `McDuff conjecture', asked about the existence of non-Hamiltonian actions
with isolated fixed points. This question was answered recently by Tolman, with
an explicit construction of a six-dimensional manifold with such an action. One
issue that this raises is whether one can find topological criteria that ensure
the manifold can only support a Hamiltonian or only a non-Hamiltonian action.
In this vein, we are able to deduce such criteria from our rigidity theorems in
terms of relatively few Chern numbers, depending on the index. This improves
upon results of Feldman for which one needs to know the entire Todd genus.
  Another consequence of our work is that, in the situation above with a
Hamiltonian action, the minimal Chern number coincides with the index and is at
most $n+1$, mirroring results of Michelsohn in the complex category and Hattori
in the almost complex category.

distribution on a set of strings in the motif of the Laplace distribution on a
set of real numbers and reveal its basic properties. This Laplace-like
distribution has two parameters: a string that represents the location of the
distribution and a positive real number that represents the dispersion. It is
difficult to explicitly write maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters
because their log likelihood function is a complex function, the variables of
which include a string; however, we construct estimators that almost surely
converge to the maximum likelihood estimators as the number of observed strings
increases and demonstrate that the estimators strongly consistently estimate
the parameters. Next, we develop an iteration algorithm for estimating the
parameters of the mixture model of the Laplace-like distributions and

the modeling of KH instability developing in the coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
and contributes to the triggering of wave turbulence subsequently leading to
the coronal heating. KH instability of MHD waves in coronal active regions
recently observed and imaged in unprecedented detail in EUV high cadence,
high-resolution observations by SDO/AIA, and spectroscopic observations by
Hinode/EIS instrument, is posing now challenge for its realistic modeling. It
is shown that considering the solar mass flows of CMEs as moving cylindrical
twisted magnetic flux tubes, the observed instability can be explained in terms
of unstable m = -3 MHD mode. We also describe the occurrence of the KH
instability in solar jets. The obtained critical jet speeds for the instability
onset as well as the linear wave growth rates are in good agreement with the

Dynamical
balance among different species in ecosystems is often described by
deterministic replicator equations with moderate success. However, fluctuations
are inevitable, either caused by external environment or intrinsic random
competitions in finite populations, and the evolutionary dynamics is stochastic
in nature. Here we show that, after appropriate coarse-graining, random
fluctuations generate dissipation towards extinction because the evolution
trajectories in the phase space of all competing species possess positive
curvature. As a demonstrating example, we compare the fluctuation-induced
dissipative dynamics in Lotka-Volterra model with numerical simulations and
find impressive agreement. Our finding is closely related to the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem in statistical mechanics but the marked
difference is the non-equilibrium essence of the generic evolutionary dynamics.
As the evolving ecosystems are far from equilibrium, the relation between
fluctuations and dissipations is often complicated and dependent on microscopic
details. It is thus remarkable that the generic positivity of the trajectory
curvature warrants dissipation arisen from the seemingly harmless fluctuations.
The unexpected dissipative dynamics is beyond the reach of conventional
replicator equations and plays a crucial role in investigating the biodiversity
in ecosystems.

data have been proposed and implemented. Popular examples of such conditions
include linearizability (or atomicity), sequential consistency, causal
consistency, and eventual consistency. These consistency conditions are usually
defined independently from the computing entities (nodes) that manipulate the
replicated data; i.e., they do not take into account how computing entities
might be linked to one another, or geographically distributed. To address this
lack, as a first contribution, this paper introduces the notion of proximity
graph between computing nodes. If two nodes are connected in this graph, their
operations must satisfy a strong consistency condition, while the operations
invoked by other nodes are allowed to satisfy a weaker condition. The second
contribution is the use of such a graph to provide a generic approach to the
hybridization of data consistency conditions into the same system. We
illustrate this approach on sequential consistency and causal consistency, and
present a model in which all data operations are causally consistent, while
operations by neighboring processes in the proximity graph are sequentially
consistent. The third contribution of the paper is the design and the proof of
a distributed algorithm based on this proximity graph, which combines
sequential consistency and causal consistency (the resulting condition is
called fisheye consistency). In doing so the paper not only extends the domain
of consistency conditions, but provides a generic provably correct solution of
direct relevance to modern georeplicated systems.

study the propagation of normal MHD modes in a flux tube considering the two
cases, notably of untwisted magnetic flux tube and the twisted one. The
numerical solution to the dispersion relation shows that the kink ($m = 1$)
wave traveling in an untwisted flux tube becomes unstable if the jet speed
exceeds $1060$ km\,s$^{-1}$ -- a speed which is inaccessible for solar surges.
A weak twist (the ratio of azimuthal to longitudinal magnetic field component)
of the internal magnetic field in the range of $0.025$--$0.2$ does not change
substantially the critical flow velocity. Thus, one implies that, in general,
the kink mode is stable against the KH instability. It turns out, however, that
the $m = -2$ and $m = -3$ MHD modes can become unstable when the twist
parameter has values between $0.2$ and $0.4$. Therefore, the corresponding
critical jet speed for instability onset lies in the range of $93.5$--$99.3$
km\,s$^{-1}$. The instability wave growth rate, depending on the value of the
wavelength, is of the order of several dozen inverse milliseconds. It remains
to be seen whether these predictions will be observationally validated in

in the HCl lines traces the extended envelope, and a broad one traces a more
compact central region. The gas-phase HCl abundance in FIR 4 is 9e-11, a factor
of only 0.001 that of volatile elemental chlorine. The H2Cl+ lines are detected
in absorption and trace a tenuous foreground cloud, where we find no depletion
of volatile chlorine. Gas-phase HCl is the tip of the chlorine iceberg in
protostellar cores. Using a gas-grain chemical model, we show that the
hydrogenation of atomic chlorine on grain surfaces in the dark cloud stage
sequesters at least 90% of the volatile chlorine into HCl ice, where it remains
in the protostellar stage. About 10% of chlorine is in gaseous atomic form.

the HARPSpol spectropolarimeter to observe the early B-type stars beta CMa
(HD44743; B1 II/III) and epsilon CMa (HD52089; B1.5 II). For both stars, we
consistently detected the signature of a weak (<30 G in absolute value)
longitudinal magnetic field. We determined the physical parameters of both
stars and characterise their X-ray spectrum. For beta CMa, our mode
identification analysis led to determining a rotation period of 13.6+/-1.2 days
and of an inclination angle of the rotation axis of 57.6+/-1.7 degrees, with
respect to the line of sight. On the basis of these measurements and assuming a
dipolar field geometry, we derived a best fitting obliquity of ~22 degrees and
a dipolar magnetic field strength (Bd) of ~100 G (60<Bd<230 G within 1 sigma),
below what is typically found for other magnetic massive stars. For epsilon CMa
we could only determine a lower limit on the dipolar magnetic field strength of
13 G. For this star, we determine that the rotation period ranges between 1.3
and 24 days. Both stars are expected to have a dynamical magnetosphere. We also
conclude that both stars are most likely core hydrogen burning and that they
have spent more than 2/3 of their main sequence lifetime. A histogram of the
distribution of the dipolar magnetic field strength for the magnetic massive
stars known to date does not show the magnetic field ""desert"" observed instead
for intermediate-mass stars. The biases involved in the detection of (weak)
magnetic fields in massive stars with the currently available instrumentation
and techniques imply that weak fields might be more common than currently
observed. Our results show that, if present, even relatively weak magnetic
fields are detectable in massive stars and that more observational effort is
probably still needed to properly access the magnetic field incidence.

based on the segmentation of the video sequence into shots that will be further
analyzed to determine its relevance and interest. Of special interest in the
approach is the use of the audio information that provides additional
robustness to the overall performance of the summarization system. For every
video shot a set of low and mid level audio-visual descriptors are computed and

requirements for both passenger and freight traffic, but also it must respect a

preparation of a feasible timetable a complex and time-consuming process, that
normally takes several months to be completed. This article addresses the
problem of generating periodic timetables, which means that the involved trains
operate in a recurrent pattern. For instance, the trains belonging to the same
train line, depart from some station every 15 minutes or one hour. To tackle
the problem, we present a constraint-based model suitable for this kind of

general solution of the Dirac--K\""ahler equation for the case of the spherical
Riemann space of constant positive curvature, for which due to the geometry
itself one may expect to have a discrete energy spectrum. In the case of the
minimal value of the total angular momentum, $j=0$, the radial equations are
reduced to second-order ordinary differential equations, which are
straightforwardly solved in terms of the hypergeometric functions. For non-zero
values of the total angular momentum, however, the radial equations are reduced
to a pair of complicated fourth-order differential equations. Employing the
factorization approach, we derive the general solution of these equations
involving four independent fundamental solutions written in terms of
combinations of the hypergeometric functions. The corresponding discrete energy
spectrum is then determined via termination of the involved hypergeometric
series, resulting in quasi-polynomial wave-functions. The constructed solutions
lead to notable observations when compared with those for the ordinary Dirac
particle. The energy spectrum for the Dirac-K\""ahler particle in spherical
space is much more complicated. Its structure substantially differs from that
for the Dirac particle since it consists of two paralleled energy level series
each of which is twofold degenerate. Besides, none of the two separate series
coincides with the series for the Dirac particle. Thus, the Dirac--K\""ahler
field cannot be interpreted as a system of four Dirac fermions. Additional
arguments supporting this conclusion are discussed.

that on an average during 'drought' (low ISMR) periods in India, GCR flux is
decreasing, and during 'flood' (high ISMR) periods, GCR flux is increasing. The
results of our analysis suggest for a possibility that the decreasing GCR flux
during the summer monsoon season in India may suppress the rainfall. On the
other hand, increasing GCR flux may enhance the rainfall. We suspect that in
addition to real environmental conditions, significant levitation/dispersion of
low clouds and hence reduced possibility of collision/coalescence to form
raindrops suppresses the rainfall during decreasing GCR flux in monsoon season.
On the other hand, enhanced collision/coalescence efficiency during increasing
GCR flux due to electrical effects may contribute to enhancing the rainfall.
Based on the observations, we put forward the idea that, under suitable
environmental conditions, changing GCR flux may influence precipitation by
suppressing/enhancing it, depending upon the decreasing/increasing nature of
GCR flux variability during monsoon season in India, at least. We further note
that the rainfall variability is inversely related to the temperature variation
during ISMR season. We suggest an explanation, although speculative, how a
decreasing/increasing GCR flux can influence the rainfall and the temperature.
We speculate that the proposed hypothesis, based on the Indian climate data can
be extended to whole tropical and sub-tropical belt, and that it may contribute
to global temperature in a significant way. If correct, our hypothesis has
important implication for the sun - climate link.

Compressive Sampling (CS) of time-domain signals. An analysis that is relied on
two fundamental CS principles; the Uniform Random Sampling (URS) and the
Uncertainty Principle (UP), is presented. We show that CS on a single- and
multi-band signals performs better if the URS is done only within the band and
suppress the out-band parts, compared to ordinary URS that ignore the band
limits. It means that sampling should only be done at the signal support, while
the non-support should be masked and suppressed in the reconstruction process.
We also show that for an N-length discrete time signal with K-number of
frequency components (Fourier coefficients), given the knowledge of the
spectrum, URS leads to exact sampling on the location of the K-spectral peaks.
These results are used to formulate a sampling scheme when the boundaries of
the bands are not sharply distinguishable, such as in a triangular- or a
stacked-band- spectral signals. When analyzing these cases, CS will face a
paradox; in which narrowing the band leads to a more number of required
samples, whereas widening it leads to lessen the number. Accordingly; instead
of signal analysis by dividing the signal's spectrum vertically into bands of
frequencies, slicing horizontally magnitude-wise yields less number of required
sample and better reconstruction results. Moreover, it enables sample reuse
that reduces the sample number even further. The horizontal slicing and sample
reuse methods imply non-uniform random sampling, where larger-magnitude part of
the spectrum should be allocated more sample than the lower ones.

elasmobranchs and assess their utility in reducing negative interactions
between sharks and humans, including bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a
single untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs
detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of
magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field
detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly
narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that
magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates
the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several
teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present
in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect
magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as
demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer
from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic
detection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies
depends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in
target teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be
independently tested with adequate sample sizes.

  conservation law with nonlinearly degenerate viscosity","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1411.6332",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the decay rate in time to solutions of the Cauchy
problem for the one-dimensional viscous conservation law where the far field
states are prescribed. Especially, we deal with the case that the flux function
which is convex and also the viscosity is a nonlinearly degenerate one
(p-Laplacian type viscosity). As the corresponding Riemann problem admits a
Riemann solution as the constant state or the single rarefaction wave, it has
already been proved by Matsumura-Nishihara that the solution to the Cauchy
problem tends toward the constant state or the single rarefaction wave as the
time goes to infinity. We investigate that the decay rate in time of the
corresponding solutions. Furthermore, we also investigate that the decay rate
in time of the solution for the higher order derivative. These are the first
result concerning the asymptotic decay of the solutions to the Cauchy problem
of the scalar conservation law with nonlinear viscosity. The proof is given by
L1, L2-energy and time-weighted Lq-energy methods.

  arXiv:1502.04602",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the precise decay rate in time to solutions of the
Cauchy problem for the one-dimensional conservation law with a nonlinearly
degenerate viscosity where the far field states are prescribed. Especially, we
deal with the case when the flux function is convex or concave but linearly
degenerate on some interval. As the corresponding Riemann problem admits a
Riemann solution as a multiwave pattern which consists of the rarefaction waves
and the contact discontinuity, it has already been proved by Yoshida that the
solution to the Cauchy problem tends toward the linear combination of the
rarefaction waves and contact wave for p-Laplacian type viscosity as the time
goes to infinity. We investigate that the decay rate in time of the
corresponding solutions toward the multiwave pattern. Furthermore, we also
investigate that the decay rate in time of the solution for the higher order
derivative. The proof is given by L1, L2-energy and time-weighted Lq-energy
methods under the use of the precise asymptotic properties of the interactions
between the nonlinear waves.

with complex parameters and arbitrary complex initial conditions is
investigated. Two associated difference equations are also studied. The
solutions in the complex plane of such equations exhibit many rich and
complicated asymptotic behavior. The analysis of the local stability of these
three difference equations and periodicity have been carried out. We further
exhibit several interesting characteristics of the solutions of this equation,
using computations, which does not arise when we consider the same equation
with positive real parameters and initial conditions. Many interesting
observations led us to pose several open problems and conjectures of paramount
importance regarding chaotic and higher order periodic solutions and global
asymptotic convergence of such difference equations. It is our hope that these
observations of these complex difference equations would certainly be new
add-ons to the present art of research in rational difference equations in
understanding the behavior in the complex domain.

  Replication Attack Based on Biological Structures of the Body","7 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By developing communications and increase of access points, computer networks
have been vulnerable considerably against wide range of information attacks,
specially new and complicated attacks. Every day, replication attacks attack
millions of network and mobile users. Increase in amount of replication attack
may be a potential danger for income of SMS or network and causes losing
customers of these services provider. Humans or software can be used to
encounter these replication attacks. It is obvious that lonely absolute use of
each method will not result in a proper answer to encounter replication
attack`s problem. Since replication attack is one of the important problems of
information protection and security in organizations for computer and mobile
phone users, while reviewing types of replication attacks and methods of
encountering, this paper uses similarities between pathologies in body and
invader factors in replication attacks, a model is provided based on biological
simulation methods existing in body`s adapted immune system to encounter these
threats.
