proposed. We consider curvilinear magnetic nanoshells of spherical geometry
whose ground state is a vortex magnetization distribution. Chirality of this
magnetic vortex can be switched in controllable way by applying a Gaussian
pulse of spatially uniform magnetic field along the symmetry axis of the shell.
The chirality switching process is explored in detail numerically for various
parameters of magnetic pulse: the corresponding switching diagram is build. The
role of the curvature is ascertained by studying the switching diagram
evolution under the continuous transition from hemispherical shell to the disk
shaped sample with the volume and thickness kept constant.

show that, for each root, we obtain a linear free divisor. So we obtain a new
family of linear free divisors. This gives the converse part of an existing
theorem which says, by using the quiver representation, that linear free
divisors come from a tree. We prove that our construction is independent of the

number of inspections over a larger number of time periods to detect a
violation (an illegal act) of an inspectee. Compared with earlier models, we
allow varying rewards to the inspectee for successful violations. As one
possible example, the most valuable reward may be the completion of a sequence
of thefts of nuclear material needed to build a nuclear bomb. The inspectee can
observe the inspector, but the inspector can only determine if a violation
happens during a stage where he inspects, which terminates the game; otherwise
the game continues. Under reasonable assumptions for the payoffs, the
inspector's strategy is independent of the number of successful violations.
This allows to apply a recursive description of the game, even though this
normally assumes fully informed players after each stage. The resulting
recursive equation in three variables for the equilibrium payoff of the game,
which generalizes several other known equations of this kind, is solved
explicitly in terms of sums of binomial coefficients. We also extend this
approach to non-zero-sum games and, similar to Maschler (1966), ""inspector
leadership"" where the inspector commits to (the same) randomized inspection
schedule, but the inspectee acts legally (rather than mixes as in the
simultaneous game) as long as inspections remain.

X-ray selected clusters and accounting for all the covariances between
cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Using cluster number counts in
combination with recent data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the
CMB lensing potential generated by large scale structures, as well as with
other cosmological constraints on the background expansion history and its mean

$\log_{10}B_0 < 3.75$ at the 95.4 per cent confidence level, for the Hu-Sawicki

This technique has been extensively used in many areas of biology, but is
particularly useful for studying the spread of quickly evolving infectious
diseases agents, e.g.,\ influenza virus. Phylodynamics inference uses a
coalescent model that defines a probability density for the genealogy of
randomly sampled individuals from the population. When we assume that such a
genealogy is known, the coalescent model, equipped with a Gaussian process
prior on population size trajectory, allows for nonparametric Bayesian
estimation of population size dynamics. While this approach is quite powerful,
large data sets collected during infectious disease surveillance challenge the
state-of-the-art of Bayesian phylodynamics and demand computationally more
efficient inference framework. To satisfy this demand, we provide a
computationally efficient Bayesian inference framework based on Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo for coalescent process models. Moreover, we show that by splitting

approach. Using several simulated and real datasets, we show that our method

convex functions. Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and
synchronous process. Distributed and asynchronous variants of gradient descent
have been studied since the 1980s, and they have been experiencing a resurgence
due to demand from large-scale machine learning problems running on multi-core
processors.
  We provide a version of asynchronous gradient descent (AGD) in which
communication between cores is minimal and for which there is little
synchronization overhead. We also propose a new timing model for its analysis.
With this model, we give the first amortized analysis of AGD on convex
functions. The amortization allows for bad updates (updates that increase the
value of the convex function); in contrast, most prior work makes the strong
assumption that every update must be significantly improving.
  Typically, the step sizes used in AGD are smaller than those used in its
synchronous counterpart. We provide a method to determine the step sizes in AGD
based on the Hessian entries for the convex function. In certain circumstances,
the resulting step sizes are a constant fraction of those used in the
corresponding synchronous algorithm, enabling the overall performance of AGD to
improve linearly with the number of cores.
  We give two applications of our amortized analysis.

studied in this work are selected from a family of truncated cubes defined by a
truncation parameter, s, which varies from cubes (s = 0) via cuboctahedra (s =
0.5) to octahedra (s = 1). Our results suggest that shapes with small values of
s show square-like behavior whereas shapes with large values of s tend to show
more disc-like behavior. At an intermediate value of s = 0.4, the phase
behavior of the system shows both square-like and disc-like features. The
results are also compared with the phase behavior of 3D bulk polyhedra and of
2D rounded hard squares. Both comparisons reveal key similarities in the number

entropic self-assembly of polyhedral particles is a first step toward
understanding the self-assembly of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces, which

and loss modeled by two coupled Schrodinger equations (dimer) is studied. It is
shown that the problem can be reduced to a perturbed pendulum-like equation.
This is done by finding two constants of motion. Firstly, a generalized problem
using Melnikov type analysis and topological degree arguments is studied for
showing the existence of periodic (libration), shift periodic (rotation), and
chaotic solutions. Then these general results are applied to the PT-symmetric
dimer. It is interestingly shown that if a sufficient condition is satisfied,
then rotation modes, which do not exist in the dimer with constant gain-loss,
will persist. An approximate threshold for PT-broken phase corresponding to the
disappearance of bounded solutions is also presented. Numerical study is
presented accompanying the analytical results.

sensitive to outliers in direction measurements. In this paper, we firstly
provide a complete characterization of well-posed instances of the location

parallel rigidity. For robust estimation of camera locations, we introduce a
two-step approach, comprised of a pairwise direction estimation method robust
to outliers in point correspondences between image pairs, and a convex program
to maintain robustness to outlier directions. In the presence of partially
corrupted measurements, we empirically demonstrate that our convex formulation
can even recover the locations exactly. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of
our formulations through experiments on Internet photo collections.

simultaneously observed by NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS),
other spacecraft, and also by New Solar Telescope (NST) at the BBSO. This paper
presents the first part of our investigation focused on analysis of the IRIS

redshifted jet-like flow with the speed of ~100 km/s of the chromospheric
material before the flare. Strong nonthermal emission of the C II k 1334.5 A
line, formed in the chromosphere-corona transition region, is observed at the
beginning of the impulsive phase in several small (with a size of ~1 arcsec)
points. It is also found that the C II k line is redshifted across the flaring
region before, during and after the impulsive phase. A peak of integrated
emission of the hot (1.1 MK) plasma in the Fe XXI 1354.1 A line is detected
approximately 5 minutes after the integrated emission peak of the lower
temperature C II k. A strong blueshift of the Fe XXI line across the flaring
region corresponds to evaporation flows of the hot chromospheric plasma with a
speed of 50 km/s. Additional analysis of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) data supports the idea that the upper
chromospheric dynamics observed by IRIS has features of ""gentle"" evaporation
driven by heating of the solar chromosphere by accelerated electrons and by a
heat flux from the flare energy release site.

electrolyte transport for biomolecular solvation that have been developed over
the past decade. A key component of these methods is the differential geometry
of surfaces theory, as applied to the solvent-solute boundary. In these
approaches, the solvent-solute boundary is determined by a variational
principle that determines the major physical observables of interest, for
example, biomolecular surface area, enclosed volume, electrostatic potential,
ion density, electron density, etc. Recently, differential geometry theory has
been used to define the surfaces that separate the microscopic (solute) domains
for biomolecules from the macroscopic (solvent) domains. In these approaches,
the microscopic domains are modeled with atomistic or quantum mechanical
descriptions, while continuum mechanics models (including fluid mechanics,
elastic mechanics, and continuum electrostatics) are applied to the macroscopic
domains. This multiphysics description is integrated through an energy
functional formalism and the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is employed to
derive a variety of governing partial differential equations for different
solvation and transport processes; e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami equation for the
solvent-solute interface, Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations for
electrostatic potentials, the Nernst-Planck equation for ion densities, and the
Kohn-Sham equation for solute electron density. Extensive validation of these
models has been carried out over hundreds of molecules, including proteins and
ion channels, and the experimental data have been compared in terms of
solvation energies, voltage-current curves, and density distributions. We also
propose a new quantum model for electrolyte transport.

model by using the Green's function method. Surface spin configuration is
calculated by minimizing the spin interaction energy. It is shown that the
angles between spins near the surface are strongly modified with respect to the
bulk configuration. Taking into account this surface spin reconstruction, we
calculate self-consistently the spin-wave spectrum and the layer magnetizations
as functions of temperature up to the disordered phase. The spin-wave spectrum
shows the existence of a surface-localized branch which causes a low surface
magnetization. We show that quantum fluctuations give rise to a crossover
between the surface magnetization and interior-layer magnetizations at low
temperatures. We calculate the transition temperature and show that it depends
strongly on the helical angle. Results are in agreement with existing
experimental observations on the stability of helical structure in thin films
and on the insensitivity of the transition temperature with the film thickness.
We also study effects of various parameters such as surface exchange and
anisotropy interactions. Monte Carlo simulations for the classical spin model
are also carried out for comparison with the quantum theoretical result.

and an Hodge's operator, this flux creates an electromotive force (emf). This
emf is finally linked with the current to give the fundamental tensor - or

link between currents of cycles (surface boundaries) and energy sources in the

the graph structure on which the topology is based. Starting then from energies
relations we show that this metric is the Lagrange's operator of the circuit.

dual-pivot Quicksort then needs more comparisons than a corresponding version

also the precise leading term of the average number of swaps, the number of

simple cost measure that approximates I/O costs in the memory hierarchy. We
determine optimal order statistics for each of the cost measures. It turns out
that the asymmetries in Yaroslavskiy's algorithm render pivots with a
systematic skew more efficient than the symmetric choice. Moreover, we finally
have a convincing explanation for the success of Yaroslavskiy's algorithm in

contrast ten types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields

management strategy evaluation (MSE) that uses complex food webs in its
operating model. Plans that target specific stock sizes ($B_{\text{MSY}}$)
consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing
pressures ($F_{\text{MSY}}$). A new self-optimising control rule, introduced
here for its robustness to structural instability, led to intermediate yields.
Most plans outperformed single-species management plans with pressure targets
set without considering multispecies interactions. However, more refined plans
to ""maximise the yield from each stock separately"", in the sense of a Nash
equilibrium, produced total yields comparable to plans aiming to maximise total
harvested biomass, and were more robust to structural instability. Our analyses
highlight trade-offs between yields, amenability to negotiations, pressures on
biodiversity, and continuity with current approaches in the European context.

showing that thermalization in the steady state is intimately connected to
properties of the $N\to \infty$ classical Hamiltonian dynamics. When the
dynamics is ergodic, the Floquet spectrum obeys a Wigner-Dyson statistics and
the system satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH):
Independently of the initial state, local observables relax to the $T=\infty$
thermal value, and Floquet states are delocalized in the Hilbert space. On the
contrary, if the classical dynamics is regular no thermalization occurs. We
further discuss the relationship between ergodicity and dynamical phase
transitions, and the relevance of our results to other fully-connected

from the region of melting. The mechanics of this process, however, are complex
and incompletely understood. In partially molten rocks undergoing shear
deformation, melt pockets between grains align coherently in the stress field;
it has been hypothesized that this anisotropy in microstructure creates an
anisotropy in the viscosity of the aggregate. With the inclusion of anisotropic
viscosity, continuum, two-phase-flow models reproduce the emergence and angle
of melt-enriched bands that form in laboratory experiments. In the same
theoretical context, these models also predict sample-scale melt migration due
to a gradient in shear stress. Under torsional deformation, melt is expected to
segregate radially inward. Here we present new torsional deformation
experiments on partially molten rocks that test this prediction.
Microstructural analyses of the distribution of melt and solid reveal a radial
gradient in melt fraction, with more melt toward the centre of the cylinder.
The extent of this radial melt segregation grows with progressive strain,
consistent with theory. The agreement between theoretical prediction and
experimental observation provides a validation of this theory, which is
critical to understanding the large-scale geodynamic and geochemical evolution
of Earth.

$n$-homological algebra where $n \geq 2$ is a fixed integer, and it deals with

  All short exact sequences in such a subcategory are split, but it has nice
exact sequences with $n+2$ objects. This was recently formalised by Jasso in
the theory of $n$-abelian categories. There is also a derived version of
$n$-homological algebra, formalised by Geiss, Keller, and Oppermann in the
theory of $( n+2 )$-angulated categories (the reason for the shift from $n$ to
$n+2$ is that angulated categories have triangulated categories as the ""base

subspaces of spaces of symmetric tensors with square-integrable divergence on a

H(div)-Pk (1=<k<=n) tensor spaces, enriched, for each n-1 dimensional simplex,
by (n+1)n/2 H(div)-Pn+1 bubble functions when 1=< k<= n-1, and by (n-1)n/2

approximate the symmetric matrix field in a mixed formulation problem where the
other variable is approximated by discontinuous piecewise Pk-1 polynomials.
This in particular leads to first order mixed elements on simplicial grids with

the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the database
community, specifically, spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a
location-based request to workers according to their positions. In this paper,
we consider an important spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely reliable
diversity-based spatial crowdsourcing (RDB-SC), in which spatial tasks (such as
taking videos/photos of a landmark or firework shows, and checking whether or
not parking spaces are available) are time-constrained, and workers are moving
towards some directions. Our RDB-SC problem is to assign workers to spatial
tasks such that the completion reliability and the spatial/temporal diversities
of spatial tasks are maximized. We prove that the RDB-SC problem is NP-hard and
intractable. Thus, we propose three effective approximation approaches,
including greedy, sampling, and divide-and-conquer algorithms. In order to
improve the efficiency, we also design an effective cost-model-based index,
which can dynamically maintain moving workers and spatial tasks with low cost,

a doublet $\lambda_{a}$, $a=1,2$, of anticommuting (both global and

an explicit Jacobian corresponding to this change of variables in the theories

the Yang--Mills path integral with $s_{a}$-potential (functionally-dependent)

functional $\Lambda$ and the anticommuting generators $s_{a}$ of BRST-antiBRST
transformations, amount to a precise change of the gauge-fixing functional.
This proves the independence of the vacuum functional under such BRST-antiBRST
transformations and leads to the presence of modified Ward identities. The form
of transformation parameters that induces a change of the gauge in the path
integral is found and is exactly evaluated for connecting two arbitrary
$R_{\xi}$-like gauges. The finite field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations
are used to generalize the Gribov horizon functional $h_{ 0 }$, in the Landau
gauge of the BRST-antiBRST setting in the Gribov--Zwanziger model, and to find
$h_{\xi}$ corresponding to general $R_{\xi}$-like gauges in the form compatible

muon upgrade of the CMS experiment in Phase 2 of the CERN LHC. Its first
implementation is planned for the GE1/1 system in the $1.5 < \mid\eta\mid <
2.2$ region of the muon endcap mainly to control muon level-1 trigger rates
after the second long LHC shutdown. A GE1/1 triple-GEM detector is read out by
3,072 radial strips with 455 $\mu$rad pitch arranged in eight $\eta$-sectors.
We assembled a full-size GE1/1 prototype of 1m length at Florida Tech and
tested it in 20-120 GeV hadron beams at Fermilab using Ar/CO$_{2}$ 70:30 and
the RD51 scalable readout system. Four small GEM detectors with 2-D readout and
an average measured azimuthal resolution of 36 $\mu$rad provided precise
reference tracks. Construction of this largest GEM detector built to-date is
described. Strip cluster parameters, detection efficiency, and spatial
resolution are studied with position and high voltage scans. The plateau
detection efficiency is [97.1 $\pm$ 0.2 (stat)]\%. The azimuthal resolution is
found to be [123.5 $\pm$ 1.6 (stat)] $\mu$rad when operating in the center of
the efficiency plateau and using full pulse height information. The resolution
can be slightly improved by $\sim$ 10 $\mu$rad when correcting for the bias due
to discrete readout strips. The CMS upgrade design calls for readout
electronics with binary hit output. When strip clusters are formed
correspondingly without charge-weighting and with fixed hit thresholds, a
position resolution of [136.8 $\pm$ 2.5 stat] $\mu$rad is measured, consistent
with the expected resolution of strip-pitch/$\sqrt{12}$ = 131.3 $\mu$rad. Other
$\eta$-sectors of the detector show similar response and performance.

of quenched and annealed stretched polymers in random environment on ${\mathbb

appear in such models. In the ballistic regime an irreducible decomposition of
typical polymers leads to an effectiverandom walk reinterpretation of the
latter. In the annealed casethe Ornstein-Zernike theory based on this approach
paves the way to an essentially complete control on the level of local limit
results and invariance principles. In the quenched case, the renewal structure
maps the model of stretched polymers into an effective model of directed
polymers. As a result one is able to use techniques and ideas developed in the
context of directed polymers in order to address issues like strong disorder in
low dimensions and weak disorder in higher dimensions. Among the topics
addressed: Thermodynamics of quenched and annealed models, multi-dimensional
renewal theory (under Cramer's condition), renormalization and effective random
walk structure of annealed polymers, very weak disorder in dimensions $d\geq 4$
and strong disorder in dimensions $d=1,2$.

theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical

located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number
of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the
network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar
behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies
in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge
to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there
are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a
major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter
poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered.

often leads to overfitting.

the Minkowski sum, which is in general computationally intractable. Our
representation is an outer approximation of the Minkowski sum. The new

agent concentration.

  Technology, Vol. 10, No. 4, July 2013",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an implementation framework that lays out the ground for
a coherent, systematic, and comprehensive approach to implement the National
Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS) of Jordan. The
Framework 1). Suggests a methodology to analyze the NIACSS, 2). Illustrates how
the NIACSS analysis can be utilized to design strategic moves and develop an
appropriate functional structure, and 3). proposes a set of adaptable strategic
controls that govern the NIACSS implementation and allow achieving excellence,
innovation, efficiency, and quality.The framework, if adopted, is expected to
harvest several advantages within the following areas: information security
implementation management, control and guidance, efforts consolidation,
resource utilization, productive collaboration, and completeness. The framework
is flexible and expandable; therefore, it can be generalized.

equations implies full search among all possible subsets of the dictionary,
which is computationally intractable, while l1 minimization will do the job
when a Restricted Isometry Property holds for the dictionary. Yet, practical
sparse recovery algorithms may fail to recover the vector of coefficients even
when the dictionary deviates from the RIP only slightly. To enjoy l1
minimization guarantees in a wider sense, a method based on a combination of
full-search and l1 minimization is presented. The idea is based on partitioning
the dictionary into atoms which are in some sense well-conditioned and those
which are ill-conditioned. Inspired by that, a matrix coherency graph is
introduced which is a tool extracted by the structure of the dictionary. This
tool can be used for decreasing the greediness of sparse coding algorithms so
that recovery will be more reliable. We have modified the IRLS algorithm by
applying the proposed method on it and simulation results show that the
modified version performs quite better than the original algorithm.
