  Communications","15 pages, 6 figures, IEEE Communications Magazine",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The very original concept of cognitive radio (CR) raised by Mitola targets at
all the environment parameters, including those in physical layer, MAC layer,
application layer as well as the information extracted from reasoning. Hence
the first CR is also referred to as ""full cognitive radio"". However, due to its
difficult implementation, FCC and Simon Haykin separately proposed a much more
simplified definition, in which CR mainly detects one single parameter, i.e.,
spectrum occupancy, and is also called as ""spectrum sensing cognitive radio"".
With the rapid development of wireless communication, the infrastructure of a
wireless system becomes much more complicated while the functionality at every
node is desired to be as intelligent as possible, say the self-organized
capability in the approaching 5G cellular networks. It is then interesting to
re-look into Mitola's definition and think whether one could, besides obtaining
the ""on/off"" status of the licensed user only, achieve more parameters in a
cognitive way. In this article, we propose a new cognitive architecture
targeting at multiple parameters in future cellular networks, which is a one
step further towards the ""full cognition"" compared to the most existing CR
research. The new architecture is elaborated in detailed stages, and three
representative examples are provided based on the recent research progress to
illustrate the feasibility as well as the validity of the proposed
architecture.

a generalization of an orthonormal basis. A frame $\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$ is said to

combinatorial structure of frames and their decomposition into tight or
scalable subsets by using partially-ordered sets (posets). We define the factor
poset of a frame $\{f_i\}_{i\in I}$ to be a collection of subsets of $I$
ordered by inclusion so that nonempty $J\subseteq I$ is in the factor poset if
and only if $\{f_j\}_{j\in J}$ is a tight frame for $H_n$. A similar definition
is given for the scalability poset of a frame. We prove conditions which factor
posets satisfy and use these to study the inverse factor poset problem, which
inquires when there exists a frame whose factor poset is some given poset $P$.
We determine a necessary condition for solving the inverse factor poset problem
in $H_n$ which is also sufficient for $H_2$. We describe how factor poset
structure of frames is preserved under orthogonal projections. We also consider
the enumeration of the number of possible factor posets and bounds on the size
of factors posets. We then turn our attention to scalable frames and present
partial results regarding when a frame can be scaled to have a given factor
poset.

System. Some comets also have a very eccentric orbit with a large semi-major
axis (Halley family comets) going far away from the Sun (more than 15 AU) in a
low acceleration regime where they would be subject to MOND perturbation. They
also approach the Sun very closely (less than 3 AU) and are affected by the
sublimation of ices from their nucleus, triggering so-called non-gravitational
forces. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of MOND
perturbation on three comets with various orbital elements (2P/Encke, 1P/Halley

perturbations. It is motivated by the fact that when fitting an outgassing
model for a comet, we have to take into account all of the small perturbing
effects to avoid absorbing these effects into the non-gravitational parameters.
Otherwise, we could derive a completely wrong estimation of the outgassing. For
this work, we use six different forms of MOND functions and compute the secular
variations of the orbital elements due to MOND and non-gravitational

hypothesis that all upper triangular variables are i.i.d. Gaussians variables
with mean 0 and variance $1$ and the hypothesis where ${\mathbf{X}}$ is the sum
of such matrix and an independent rank-one perturbation.
  This setup applies to the situation where under the alternative, there is a
planted principal submatrix ${\mathbf{B}}$ of size $L$ for which all upper
triangular variables are i.i.d. Gaussians with mean $1$ and variance $1$,
whereas all other upper triangular elements of ${\mathbf{X}}$ not in

refer to this as the `Gaussian hidden clique problem.'
  When $L=(1+\epsilon)\sqrt{n}$ ($\epsilon>0$), it is possible to solve this
detection problem with probability $1-o_n(1)$ by computing the spectrum of
${\mathbf{X}}$ and considering the largest eigenvalue of ${\mathbf{X}}$. We
prove that this condition is tight in the following sense: when
$L<(1-\epsilon)\sqrt{n}$ no algorithm that examines only the eigenvalues of
${\mathbf{X}}$ can detect the existence of a hidden Gaussian clique, with error
probability vanishing as $n\to\infty$.
  We prove this result as an immediate consequence of a more general result on
rank-one perturbations of $k$-dimensional Gaussian tensors. In this context we
establish a lower bound on the critical signal-to-noise ratio below which a

matter halos. The exclusion constraint can be due to quantum mechanics (for
fermions such as massive neutrinos) or to Lynden-Bell's statistics (for
collisionless systems undergoing violent relaxation). This model has a finite
mass. Furthermore, a statistical equilibrium state exists for all accessible
values of energy. Dwarf and intermediate size halos are degenerate quantum
objects stabilized against gravitational collapse by the Pauli exclusion
principle. Large halos at sufficiently high energies are in a gaseous phase
where quantum effects are negligible. They are stabilized by thermal motion.
Below a critical energy they undergo gravitational collapse (gravothermal
catastrophe). This may lead to the formation of a central black hole that does
not affect the structure of the halo. This may also lead to the formation of a
compact degenerate object surrounded by a hot massive atmosphere extending at
large distances. We argue that large dark matter halos should not contain a
degenerate nucleus (fermion ball) because these nucleus-halo structures are
thermodynamically unstable. We compare the rotation curves of the classical
King model to observations of large dark matter halos (Burkert profile).
Because of collisions and evaporation, the central density increases while the
slope of the halo density profile decreases until an instability takes place.
We find that the observations are compatible with a King profile at, or close
to, the point of marginal stability in the microcanonical ensemble. At that
point, the King profile can be fitted by the modified Hubble profile that has a
flat core and a halo in which the density decreases as $r^{-3}$. This is
qualitatively similar to the Burkert profile.

algorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of

necessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold
at low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests
on a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there

obtaining all of the first- and second-order sensitivities, for one
functional-type system responses. Therefore, the SO-ASAP should be used when M
is much larger than N, while the SO-ASAP should be used when N is much larger
than M. The original SO-ASAP presented in this work should enable the hitherto
very difficult, if not intractable, exact computation of all of the
second-order response sensitivities (i.e., functional Gateaux-derivatives) for
large-systems involving many parameters, as usually encountered in practice.
Very importantly, the implementation of the SO-ASAP requires very little
additional effort beyond the construction of the adjoint sensitivity system
needed for computing the first-order sensitivities.

sensitivity analysis procedure (SO-ASAP) to a paradigm neutron diffusion
problem, which is sufficiently simple to admit an exact solution, thereby
making transparent the mathematical derivations underlying the SO-ASAP. The
illustrative application presented in this work shows that the actual number of
adjoint computations needed for computing all of the first- and second-order
response sensitivities may significantly less than 2*N+1 per response. For this
illustrative problem, four (4) large-scale adjoint computations sufficed for
the complete and exact computations of all 4 first- and 10 distinct
second-order derivatives. Furthermore, the construction and solution of the
SASS requires very little additional effort beyond the construction of the
adjoint sensitivity system needed for computing the first-order sensitivities.
Only the sources on the right-sides of the diffusion operator needed to be
modified; the left-side of the differential equations remained unchanged. Most
of the second-order relative sensitivities are just as large as or larger than
the first-order ones. We show that the second-order sensitivities cause the
expected value of the response to differ from the computed nominal value of the
response; and they contribute decisively to causing asymmetries in the response
distribution. Neglecting the second-order sensitivities would nullify the
third-order response correlations, and hence would nullify the skewness of the
response; consequently, any events occurring in a response's long and/or short
tails, which are characteristic of rare but decisive events would likely be
missed. We expect the SO-ASAP to affect significantly other fields that need
efficiently computed second-order response sensitivities, e.g., optimization,
data assimilation/adjustment, model calibration, and predictive modeling.

At each
time slot, a network controller activates non-interfering links and forwards
packets to all nodes at a common rate; the maximum rate is referred to as the
broadcast capacity of the wireless network. Existing policies achieve the
broadcast capacity by balancing traffic over a set of spanning trees, which are
difficult to maintain in a large and time-varying wireless network. We propose
a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the broadcast capacity when the
underlying network topology is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This algorithm
utilizes local queue-length information, does not use any global topological
structures such as spanning trees, and uses the idea of in-order packet
delivery to all network nodes. Although the in-order packet delivery constraint
leads to degraded throughput in cyclic graphs, we show that it is throughput
optimal in DAGs and can be exploited to simplify the design and analysis of
optimal algorithms. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has
superior delay performance as compared to tree-based approaches.

is that dramatic and discrete changes in behavior, measured with mobile phone
data, will indicate extreme events. In this study, we propose an efficient
system for spatiotemporal detection of behavioral anomalies from mobile phone
data and compare sites with behavioral anomalies to an extensive database of
emergency and non-emergency events in Rwanda. Our methodology successfully
captures anomalous behavioral patterns associated with a broad range of events,
from religious and official holidays to earthquakes, floods, violence against
civilians and protests. Our results suggest that human behavioral responses to
extreme events are complex and multi-dimensional, including extreme increases
and decreases in both calling and movement behaviors. We also find significant

spin polarization. We point to an unexpected source of HH-LH mixing in quantum
dots, arguing that in contrast with current models the mixing does not reflect
the strain between the dot and its matrix and does not scale inversely with the

atomistic pseudopotential calculations on a range of strained and unstrained

in the QD of a dense ladder of intermediate states between the HH and LH states
which amplifies and propagates this interaction and leads to ""supercoupling""
(analogous to super-exchange in magnetism). This explains a number of
outstanding puzzles regarding the surprising large coupling seen in unstrained

networks whose topology changes dynamically with time. The SDA framework
(designed to be resilient to both insider and outsider attacks) comprises of a
pair-wise key establishment mechanism run along the edges of a data gathering
tree and a distributed trust evaluation model that is tightly integrated with
the data aggregation process itself. If an aggregator node already shares a
secret key with its child node, the two nodes locally coordinate to refresh and
establish a new pair-wise secret key; otherwise, the aggregator node requests
the sink to send a seed-secret key message that is used as the basis to
establish a new pair-wise secret key. The trust evaluation model uses the
two-sided Grubbs test to identify outlier data in the periodic beacons
collected from the child nodes (neighbor) nodes. Once the estimated trust score
for a neighbor node falls below a threshold, the sensor node locally classifies
its neighbor node as a Compromised or Faulty (CF) node, and discards the data
or aggregated data received from the CF node. This way, the erroneous data
generated by the CF nodes could be filtered at various levels of the data
gathering tree and are prevented from reaching the root node (sink node).
Finally, we assess the effectiveness of our trust evaluation model through a
comprehensive simulation study.

we forecast the constraints from the angular power spectrum and that of A* from

These instruments present numerous challenges for detector technology in the
absence of the availability of Helium-3, which is the default choice for
detectors for instruments built until today and due to the extreme rates
expected across the ESS instrument suite. Additionally a new generation of
source requires a new generation of detector technologies to fully exploit the
opportunities that this source provides. The detectors will be sourced from
partners across Europe through numerous in-kind arrangements; a process that is
somewhat novel for the neutron scattering community. This contribution presents
briefly the current status of detectors for the ESS, and outlines the timeline
to completion. For a conjectured instrument suite based upon instruments
recommended for construction, a recently updated snapshot of the current
expected detector requirements is presented. A strategy outline as to how these
requirements might be tackled by novel detector developments is shown. In terms
of future developments for the neutron community, synergies should be sought
with other disciples, as recognized by various recent initiatives in Europe, in
the context of the fundamentally multi-disciplinary nature of detectors. This
strategy has at its basis the in-kind and collaborative partnerships necessary
to be able to produce optimally performant detectors that allow the ESS
instruments to be world-leading. This foresees and encourages a high level of
collaboration and interdependence at its core, and rather than each group being
all-rounders in every technology, the further development of centres of
excellence across Europe for particular technologies and niches.

There is a lack of empirical studies about Scrum-based ASD programming which
has become the most popular agile methodology among industry practitioners. In
this paper, we present empirical findings regarding the aspects of task
allocation decision-making, collaboration, and team morale related to the Scrum
ASD process which have not yet been well studied by existing research. We draw
our findings from a 12 week long course work project in 2014 involving 125
undergraduate software engineering students from a renowned university working
in 21 Scrum teams. Instead of the traditional survey or interview based
methods, which suffer from limitations in scale and level of details, we obtain
fine grained data through logging students' activities in our online agile
project management (APM) platform - HASE. During this study, the platform
logged over 10,000 ASD activities. Deviating from existing preconceptions, our
results suggest negative correlations between collaboration and team
performance as well as team morale.

  Organization",,,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been widely recognized that the performance of a multi-agent system is
highly affected by its organization. A large scale system may have billions of
possible ways of organization, which makes it impractical to find an optimal
choice of organization using exhaustive search methods. In this paper, we
propose a genetic algorithm aided optimization scheme for designing
hierarchical structures of multi-agent systems. We introduce a novel algorithm,
called the hierarchical genetic algorithm, in which hierarchical crossover with
a repair strategy and mutation of small perturbation are used. The phenotypic
hierarchical structure space is translated to the genome-like array
representation space, which makes the algorithm genetic-operator-literate. A
case study with 10 scenarios of a hierarchical information retrieval model is
provided. Our experiments have shown that competitive baseline structures which
lead to the optimal organization in terms of utility can be found by the
proposed algorithm during the evolutionary search. Compared with the
traditional genetic operators, the newly introduced operators produced better
organizations of higher utility more consistently in a variety of test cases.
The proposed algorithm extends of the search processes of the state-of-the-art
multi-agent organization design methodologies, and is more computationally
efficient in a large search space.

subgraph. These problems can be formulated in terms of optimization of suitable
objectives on connected subgraphs, a problem which is generally computationally
difficult. We overcome the combinatorics of connectivity by embedding connected
subgraphs into linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Computationally efficient
tests are then realized by optimizing convex objective functions subject to
these LMI constraints. We prove, by means of a novel Euclidean embedding

  submitted in final form to IEEE TBME 2014/11/11. Copyright IEEE (2014)",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modern Markov chain models of ionic channels in excitable membranes are
numerically stiff. The popular numerical methods for these models require very
small time steps to ensure stability. Our objective is to formulate and test
two methods addressing this issue, so that the timestep can be chosen based on
accuracy rather than stability.
  Both proposed methods extend Rush-Larsen technique, which was originally
developed to Hogdkin-Huxley type gate models. One method, ""Matrix Rush-Larsen""
(MRL) uses a matrix reformulation of the Rush-Larsen scheme, where the matrix
exponentials are calculated using precomputed tables of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The other, ""hybrid operator splitting"" (HOS) method exploits
asymptotic properties of a particular Markov chain model, allowing explicit
analytical expressions for the substeps.
  We test both methods on the Clancy and Rudy (2002) INa Markov chain model.
With precomputed tables for functions of the transmembrane voltage, both
methods are comparable to the forward Euler method in accuracy and
computational cost, but allow longer time steps without numerical instability.
  We conclude that both methods are of practical interest. MRL requires more
computations than HOS, but is formulated in general terms which can be readily
extended to other Markov Chain channel models, whereas the utility of HOS
depends on the asymptotic properties of a particular model.
  The significance of the methods is that they allow a considerable speed-up of
large-scale computations of cardiac excitation models by increasing the time
step, while maintaining acceptable accuracy and preserving numerical stability.

eSFGs and compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) in all colors, but are more
inclined to ""red sequence"" than ""green valley"" galaxies. We also find that
cSFGs have distributions similar to cQGs on the nonparametric morphology
diagrams. The cQGs and cSFGs have larger $Gini$ and smaller $M_{20}$, while
eSFGs have the reverse. About one-third of cSFGs show signatures of
postmergers, and almost none of them can be recognized as disks. Moreover,
those visually extended cSFGs all have lower $Gini$ coefficients ($Gini<0.4$),
indicating that the $Gini$ coefficient could be used to clean out noncompact

more frequent among cSFGs than that in eSFGs and cQGs, implying that cSFGs have
previously experienced violent gas-rich interactions(such as major mergers or
disk instabilities), which could trigger both star formation and black hole

reduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering,

projections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature
representation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very
difficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is
vulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse
principal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature
analysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression
optimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization
is incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients
sparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model
used in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature,
which in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output
of our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under
the PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative
algorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and
conduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art

k-means algorithms and min-cut algorithms gain most popularity due to their

constructed in min-cut algorithms which partition the vertices of the graph
into two sets. However, existing clustering algorithms tend to cluster minority

to leverage exclusive lasso on k-means and min-cut to regulate the balance
degree of the clustering results. By optimizing our objective functions that

  Experiments",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While there are many studies on weight regularization, the study on structure
regularization is rare. Many existing systems on structured prediction focus on
increasing the level of structural dependencies within the model. However, this
trend could have been misdirected, because our study suggests that complex
structures are actually harmful to generalization ability in structured
prediction. To control structure-based overfitting, we propose a structure
regularization framework via \emph{structure decomposition}, which decomposes
training samples into mini-samples with simpler structures, deriving a model
with better generalization power. We show both theoretically and empirically
that structure regularization can effectively control overfitting risk and lead
to better accuracy. As a by-product, the proposed method can also substantially
accelerate the training speed. The method and the theoretical results can apply
to general graphical models with arbitrary structures. Experiments on
well-known tasks demonstrate that our method can easily beat the benchmark
systems on those highly-competitive tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracies yet with substantially faster training speed.

self-consistent set of equations is formulated which describes the

corresponding closed cosmological model which also was numerically simulated
for the case of one-component degenerated Fermi gas and two-component Boltzmann

model. Two specific features of cosmological evolution of a statistical system
of scalar charged particles were obtained with respect to cosmological
evolution of the minimal interaction models: appearance of giant bursts of
invariant cosmological acceleration $\Omega$ at the time interval
$8\cdot10^3\div2\cdot10^4 t_{Pl}$ and strong heating ($3\div 8$ orders of

periods, with different marginal prices is sufficient for identification as
long as these price differences are due to exogenous (and binary) changes in

age of the clusters is less than 1 Myr and also the distance to the clusters is
consistent with the kinematic distance. On the sky, Cloud 1 is located very
close to the H I peak of high-velocity cloud (HVC) Complex H, and there are
some H I intermediate velocity structures between the Complex H and the

possibility that Complex H impacting on the Galactic disk has triggered star
formation in Cloud 1 as well as the formation of Cloud 1 molecular cloud.

assessing current and projecting future trends in prevalence, incidence and
mortality and for evaluating the impact and cost-effectiveness of control
measures. In generalized epidemics the available data are of variable quality
among countries and limited mainly to trends in the prevalence of HIV among
women attending ante-natal clinics. In concentrated epidemics one needs, at the
very least, time trends in the prevalence of HIV among different risk groups,
including intravenous drug users, men-who-have-sex-with-men, and commercial sex
workers as well as the size of each group and the degree of overlap between
them. Here we focus on the comparatively straight forward problems presented by
generalized epidemics. We fit data from Kenya to a susceptible-infected model
and then successively add structure to the model, drawing on our knowledge of
the natural history of HIV, to explore the effect that different structural
aspects of the model have on the fits and the projections.
  Both heterogeneity in risk and changes in behaviour over time are important
but easily confounded. Using a Weibull rather than exponential survival
function for people infected with HIV, in the absence of treatment, makes a
significant difference to the estimated trends in incidence and mortality and
to the projected trends. Allowing for population growth has a small effect on
the fits and the projections but is easy to include. Including details of the
demography adds substantially to the complexity of the model, increases the run
time by several orders of magnitude, but changes the fits and projections only
slightly and to an extent that is less than the uncertainty inherent in the
data. We make specific recommendations for the kind of model that would be
suitable for understanding and managing HIV epidemics in east and southern
Africa.
