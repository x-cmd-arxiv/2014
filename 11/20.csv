  Earth Mover's Distance","Accepted for oral presentation at NIPS OTML'14 workshop",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is the only method we currently have to
measure connections between different parts of the human brain in vivo. To
elucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles
of axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates
of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the
brain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal
fibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for
estimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by
means of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there
are multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including
smoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics. Here, we give four
reasons for the use of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) equipped with the
arc-length, as a distance metric. (continued)

to $l$ hops away via forwarding by the intermediate nodes on the routes, where
$l\in \mathbb{N}$ is a natural number. We characterize the necessary and
sufficient topological conditions on the network structure. The tight
conditions we found are consistent with the tight conditions identified for
$l=1$, where only local communication is allowed, and are strictly weaker for
$l>1$. Let $l^*$ denote the length of a longest path in the given network. For
$l\ge l^*$ and undirected graphs, our conditions hold if and only if $n\ge

$n$ is the total number of nodes and $f$ is the maximal number of Byzantine
nodes; and for $l\ge l^*$ and directed graphs, our conditions is equivalent to

interpolates halo properties in grids that are progressively built. This
strategy is less memory-demanding and allows one to start the modeling at
redshifts high enough and halo masses low enough to have trivial boundary
conditions. The number of free parameters is minimized by making the causal
connection between physical processes usually treated as independent from each
other, which leads to more reliable predictions. But the strongest points of
AMIGA are: i) the inclusion of molecular cooling and metal-poor, population III
(Pop III) stars, with the most dramatic feedback, and ii) the accurate
follow-up of the temperature and volume filling factor of neutral, singly, and
doubly ionized regions, taking into account the distinct halo mass functions in
those environments. We find the following general results. Massive Pop III
stars determine the IGM metallicity and temperature, and the growth of
spheroids and disks is self-regulated by that of massive black holes developed
from the remnants of those stars. Yet, the properties of normal galaxies and
active galactic nuclei appear to be quite insensitive to Pop III star
properties owing to the much higher yield of ordinary stars compared to Pop III
stars and the dramatic growth of MBHs when normal galaxies begin to develop,
which cause the memory loss of the initial conditions.

development of atomic frequency standards based on a vapor cell. We have
accurately calculated light shift in Raman-Ramsey interference using the
density-matrix equations for a three-level system without invoking the
adiabatic approximation. Specifically, phase shifts associated with coherent
density-matrix terms are studied as they are relevant to the detection of
Raman-Ramsey interference in transmission (or absorption) through the medium.
For the single-velocity case, the numerically computed results are compared
with the analytical results obtained using the adiabatic approximation. The
result shows light shift suppression in conformity with the closed-form
analytic solutions. The computational studies have also been extended to
investigate Raman-Ramsey interference for a Doppler-broadened vapor medium.
Importantly, a velocity-induced frequency shift is found at the fringe center
as an additional source of frequency error for a vapor cell Raman clock.

interacting binary system. It is then used to calculate the evolution of a
classical nova system composed of a 1.25 Msun Main-Sequence (MS) star and a 1.0
Msun white dwarf (WD) companion. The system begins as a well separated
non-interacting binary system. Initially, the two stars evolve independently of
each other. However, Roche lobe overflow begins as the MS star expands on its
way to become a Red Giant. We follow the mass accreted onto the WD and the
ensuing nuclear runaways for several thousand flashes. The main finding is that
the Roche-Lobe mass transfer rate is modulated by oscillations in the MS star,
with a period that is somewhat shorter than the thermal time scale of the star.
This periodically modulates the rate of thermonuclear flashes on the WD,
between once every 12000 yrs, such that the WD can cool, to once every 300 yrs,
such that it cannot. The system is further complicated by the secular drift in
the secondary modulation. Such secondary modulation could explain systems like
T Pyxidis. Last, we find that the overall process of mass gain by the WD has an
efficiency of roughly 9%, thus requiring a donor with an initial mass of larger
than about 5 Msun MS for an initial 1 Msun WD, if the WD is to reach the
Chandrasekhar mass.

identified as one of the causes for the under-utilization of the valuable radio
spectrum. Governmental agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) are seeking ways to remove stringent regulatory barriers and facilitate
broader access to the spectrum resources. The goal is to allow for an improved
and ubiquitous sharing of the precious radio spectrum between commercial
service providers.
  In this paper, we propose a novel noncooperative game theoretic approach, to
show how to foster more sharing of the radio spectrum via the use of regulatory
power. We define a two stage game in which the government regulators move
first, followed by the providers. The providers are incentivized by lower
spectrum allocation fees from the regulators in return for proof-of-sharing.
The providers are offered discounted spectrum bands, potentially at different
locations, but will be asked to provide coverage to users that are not
subscribed to them so as to maintain their subsidy incentives from the
government. In a simplification of the model, analytical expressions for the
providers' perfect equilibrium strategies are derived, and we argue for the
existence of the government's part of a perfect equilibrium. Our analysis shows
that through subsidization, the government can provide small service providers
a fair chance to compete with the large providers, thereby avoiding
monopolization in the market.

however, ensure that M preserves all second-order entailments of T w.r.t. S,
which is stronger than is required in many applications, and may lead to large
modules in practice. In this paper we propose a novel approach in which module
extraction is reduced to a reasoning problem in datalog. Our approach not only
generalises existing approximations in an elegant way, but it can also be
tailored to preserve only specific kinds of entailments, which allows us to
extract significantly smaller modules. An evaluation on widely-used ontologies
has shown very encouraging results.

is of both scientific and technological interest. Here, we demonstrate
epitaxial growth of 2D topological insulator, i.e. quantum spin Hall (QSH)
state, on Si(111) surface with a large energy gap, based on first-principles
calculations. We show that Si(111) surface functionalized with 1/3 monolayer of
halogen atoms [Si(111)-sqrt(3) x sqrt(3)-X (X=Cl, Br, I)] exhibiting a trigonal
superstructure, provides an ideal template for epitaxial growth of heavy
metals, such as Bi, which self-assemble into a hexagonal lattice with high
kinetic and thermodynamic stability. Most remarkably, the Bi overlayer is
""atomically"" bonded to but ""electronically"" decoupled from the underlying Si
substrate, exhibiting isolated QSH state with an energy gap as large as 0.8 eV.
This surprising phenomenon is originated from an intriguing substrate orbital
filtering effect, which critically select the orbital composition around the
Fermi level leading to different topological phases. Particularly, the
substrate-orbital-filtering effect converts the otherwise topologically trivial
freestanding Bi lattice into a nontrivial phase; while the reverse is true for
Au lattice. The underlying physical mechanism is generally applicable, opening
a new and exciting avenue for exploration of large-gap topological
surface/interface states.

Einstein-Maxwell-Thomas-Fermi equations that account for all the fundamental
interactions, have been recently introduced. These configurations have a more
general character than the ones obtained with the traditional
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff, which impose the condition of local charge
neutrality. The resulting configurations have a less massive and thinner crust,
leading to a new mass-radius relation. Signatures of this new structure of the
neutron star on the thermal evolution might be a potential test for this
theory. We compute the cooling curves by integrating numerically the energy
balance and transport equations in general relativity, for globally neutral
neutron stars with crusts of different masses and sizes, according to this
theory for different core-crust transition interfaces. We compare and contrast
our study with known results for local charge neutrality. We found a new
behavior for the relaxation time, depending upon the density at the base of the
crust, $\rho_{\rm crust}$. In particular, we find that the traditional increase
of the relaxation time with the crust thickness holds only for configurations
whose density of the base of the crust is greater than $\approx 5\times
10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The reason for this is that neutron star crusts with very
thin or absent inner crust have some neutrino emission process blocked which
keep the crust hotter for longer times. Therefore, accurate observations of the
thermal relaxation phase of neutron stars might give crucial information on the
core-crust transition which may aid us in probing the inner
composition/structure of these objects.

theory, and the extended normal ordering of Mukherjee and Kutzelnigg. The
resulting non-equilibrium kinetic equations generalize the usual Redfield
theory to many-electron systems, while ensuring that the orbital occupations

rests on two innovations for solving this high dimensional problem: visual
noise that samples from natural image statistics, and a computer algorithm that
collaborates with human observers to efficiently obtain a solution. In this
work, we visualize observers' internal representations of a visual scene
category (street) using an experiment in which the observer views the
naturalistic visual noise and collaborates with the algorithm to externalize
his internal representation. As no scene information was presented, observers
had to use their internal knowledge of the target, matching it with the visual
features in the noise. We matched reconstructed images with images of
real-world street scenes to enhance visualization. Critically, we show that the
visualized mental images can be used to predict rapid scene detection
performance, as each observer had faster and more accurate responses to
detecting real-world images that were the most similar to his reconstructed
street templates. These results show that it is possible to visualize
previously unobservable mental representations of real world stimuli. More

Traditional models of visual perception posit that scene categorization is

account for the mounting evidence that human observers are relatively
insensitive to the local details in an image. Psychologists have long theorized
that the affordances, or actionable possibilities of a stimulus are pivotal to
its perception. To what extent are scene categories created from similar
affordances? Using a large-scale experiment using hundreds of scene categories,
we show that the activities afforded by a visual scene provide a fundamental
categorization principle. Affordance-based similarity explained the majority of
the structure in the human scene categorization patterns, outperforming
alternative similarities based on objects or visual features. We all models
were combined, affordances provided the majority of the predictive power in the
combined model, and nearly half of the total explained variance is captured
only by affordances. These results challenge many existing models of high-level
visual perception, and provide immediately testable hypotheses for the

possibilities is here revised by means of numerical reconstructions of the

Frequently, a severe degeneracy between $f(R)$ approaches occurs, since
different paradigms correctly explain present time dynamics. To set the initial
conditions on the $f(R)$ functions, we involve the use of the so called
cosmography of the Universe, i.e. the technique of fixing constraints on the
observable Universe by comparing expanded observables with current data. This
powerful approach is essentially model independent and correspondingly we got a
model independent reconstruction of $f(z)$ classes within the interval
$z\in[0,1]$. To allow the Hubble rate to evolve around $z\leq1$, we considered
three relevant frameworks of effective cosmological dynamics, i.e. the
$\Lambda$CDM model, the CPL parametrization and a polynomial approach to dark
energy. Finally cumbersome algebra permits to pass from $f(z)$ to $f(R)$ and
the general outcome of our work is the determination of a viable $f(R)$
function, that effectively describes the observed Universe dynamics.

formulated as Hamiltonian systems and the phase flow in each system is
characterised by the value of the corresponding Hamiltonian and one other
parameter (the mass parameter in the Kepler problem and the curvature parameter
in the geodesic motion problem). Using a canonical transformation the
Hamiltonian vector field for the geodesic motion problem is transformed into
one which is proportional to that for the Kepler problem. Within this framework
the energy of the Kepler problem is equal to (minus) the curvature parameter of
the constant curvature space and the mass parameter is given by the value of
the Hamiltonian for the geodesic motion problem. We work with the corresponding
family of evolution spaces and present a unified treatment which is valid for
all values of energy continuously. As a result, there is a correspondence
between the constants of motion for both systems and the Runge-Lenz vector in
the Kepler problem arises in a natural way from the isometries of a space of
constant curvature. In addition, the canonical nature of the transformation
guarantees that the Poisson bracket Lie algebra of constants of motion for the

Kondo-Heisenberg model where the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain is coupled to a
Hubbard chain through a Kondo exchange interaction in the p-wave channel - a
strongly correlated version of the prototypical Tamm-Shockley model. We derive
and solve renormalization group equations at two-loop order in the Kondo
parameter, and find that, at half-filling, the charge degrees of freedom in the
Hubbard chain acquire a Mott gap, even in the case of a non-interacting
conduction band (Hubbard parameter $U=0$). Furthermore, at low enough
temperatures, the system maps onto a spin-1/2 ladder with local ferromagnetic
interactions along the rungs, effectively locking the spin degrees of freedom
into a spin-$1$ chain with frozen charge degrees of freedom. This structure
behaves as a spin-1 Haldane chain, a prototypical interacting topological spin
model, and features two magnetic spin-$1/2$ end states for chains with open
boundary conditions. Our analysis allows to derive an insightful connection

environment, and examined the corresponding dynamics and correlation between
the 10 key structural motifs that serve as the allosteric hotspots in
intramolecular signaling network. We dubbed these 10 structural motifs ""binary
switches"" as they display molecular interactions that switch between two
distinct states. By projecting the receptor dynamics on these binary switches
that yield $2^{10}$ microstates, we show that (i) the receptors in apo,
antagonist-bound, and agonist-bound states explore vastly different
conformational space; (ii) among the three receptor states the apo state
explores the broadest range of microstates; (iii) in the presence of the
agonist, the active conformation is maintained through coherent couplings among
the binary switches; and (iv) to be most specific, our analysis shows that
W246, located deep inside the binding cleft, can serve as both an agonist
sensor and actuator of ensuing intramolecular signaling for the receptor
activation.Finally, our analysis of multiple trajectories generated by
inserting an agonist to the apo state underscores that the transition of the
receptor from inactive to active form requires the disruption of ionic-lock in
the DRY motif.

establish simple scaling relationships between observable quantities and
cluster masses, making galaxy clusters useful cosmological probes. Recent X-ray
observations suggest that self-similarity may be broken in the outskirts of
galaxy clusters. In this work, we analyze a mass-limited sample of massive
galaxy clusters from the Omega500 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to
investigate the self-similarity of the diffuse X-ray emitting intracluster
medium (ICM) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We find that the
self-similarity of the outer ICM profiles is better preserved if they are
normalized with respect to the mean density of the universe, while the inner
profiles are more self-similar when normalized using the critical density.
However, the outer ICM profiles as well as the location of accretion shock
around clusters are sensitive to their mass accretion rate, which causes the
apparent breaking of self-similarity in cluster outskirts. We also find that
the collisional gas does not follow the distribution of collisionless dark
matter perfectly in the infall regions of galaxy clusters, leading to 10%
departures in the gas-to-dark matter density ratio from the cosmic mean value.
Our results have a number implications for interpreting observations of galaxy
clusters in X-ray and through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and their
application to cluster cosmology.

us to scenarios where the system can be diagonalized into the sum of two

  Such a system might be interesting for magnetogenesis because of how the

it would be possible to transfer a magnetic field from the dark sector,
generated perhaps before the coupling was turned on, to the visible sector. We
also investigate whether the simple existence of the mixing provides more
opportunities to generate magnetic fields. We find that neither possibility

large range in $\log M_{dyn}/L_{g}$ (of 1.6~dex) and $\log M_{dyn}/L_{K}$ (of
1.3~dex). There is a strong, approximately linear correlation between the $M/L$

$\log~M_{dyn}/L$ residuals implies that it is possible to estimate the $M/L$

population synthesis (SPS) models with a Salpeter stellar initial mass function
(IMF) can not simultaneously match $M_{dyn}/L_{g}$ vs. $(g-z)_{rest-frame}$ and
$M_{dyn}/L_{K}$ vs. $(g-K)_{rest-frame}$. By changing the slope of the IMF we
are still unable to explain the M/L of the bluest and reddest galaxies. We find
that an IMF with a slope between $\alpha=2.35$ and $\alpha=1.35$ provides the
best match. We also explore a broken IMF with a Salpeter slope at
$M<1M_{\odot}$ and $M>4M_{\odot}$ and a slope $\alpha$ in the intermediate
region. The data favor a slope of $\alpha=1.35$ over $\alpha=2.35$.
Nonetheless, our results show that variations between different SPS models are
comparable to the IMF variations. In our analysis we assume that the variation
in $M/L$ and color is driven by differences in age, and that other
contributions (e.g., metallicity evolution, dark matter) are small. These
assumptions may be an important source of uncertainty as galaxies evolve in
more complex ways.

After a proper choice of the operator basis we present a global fit to all the

triple gauge boson vertex (TGV) collider measurements, electroweak precision
tests and Higgs searches. In this framework modifications of the interactions
of the Higgs field to the electroweak gauge bosons are related to anomalous
TGV's, and given the current experimental precision, we show that the analysis
of the latest Higgs boson data at the LHC and Tevatron gives rise to strong

Interestingly, we present how this correlated pattern of deviations from the SM

of the $SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y$ symmetry, characteristic of for instance composite
Higgs models. Furthermore, anomalous TGV signals expected at first order in the
non--linear realization may appear only at higher orders of the linear one, and
viceversa. Their study could lead to hints on the nature of the observed boson.

and be long-lasting compared to gas rings. This involves the existence of a
pressure maximum which traps dust either in between two gap-opening planets or
at the outermost gap edge of a single or multiple planet system, combined with
the decoupling of large dust particles from the gas. We perform 2D gas
hydrodynamical simulations of disks with one and two giant planets which may
open deep or partial gaps. A gas ring forms in between two planets such that
the surface mass density is higher than on either side of it. This ring is a
region of pressure maximum where we expect large grains, which are marginally
coupled to the gas and would otherwise be subject to radial drift, to collect.
Such a pressure maximum also occurs at the outermost gap edge in a disk with
one or more planets. We infer the dust evolution in these regions as the gas
disk evolves, to understand the longer term behavior of the resulting dust
rings. Over time the gas surface density in the ring(s) decreases, which may
cause the larger trapped particles to decouple. Consequently, these particles
are expected to stay in ring structure(s) longer than the gas. For a Minimum
Mass Solar Nebula model, we expect that millimeter and centimeter-sized grains
in the outer O(10) au would most likely undergo this trapping and decoupling
process.

physical mechanism mechanism underlying the contribution from the magnetic
field is the torque exerted on the rotating black hole by the field amplified
by the accreting material. If the squared magnetic field is proportional to the
accretion rate, then there will be a correlation between jet power and
accretion luminosity. There is evidence for such a correlation, but inadequate
knowledge of the accretion luminosity of the limited and inhomogeneous used
samples prevented a firm conclusion. Here we report an analysis of archival
observations of a sample of blazars (quasars whose jets point towards Earth)
that overcomes previous limitations. We find a clear correlation between jet
power as measured through the gamma-ray luminosity, and accretion luminosity as
measured by the broad emission lines, with the jet power dominating over the

to this problem have been described, but none is yet regarded as providing a
definitive solution. Maximum entropy estimation and Bayesian field theory are
two such approaches. Both have origins in statistical physics, but the
relationship between them has remained unclear. Here I unify these two methods
by showing that every maximum entropy density estimate can be recovered in the
infinite smoothness limit of an appropriate Bayesian field theory. I also show
that Bayesian field theory estimation can be performed without imposing any
boundary conditions on candidate densities, and that the infinite smoothness
limit of these theories recovers the most common types of maximum entropy
estimates. Bayesian field theory is thus seen to provide a natural test of the
validity of the maximum entropy null hypothesis. Bayesian field theory also
returns a lower entropy density estimate when the maximum entropy hypothesis is
falsified. The computations necessary for this approach can be performed
rapidly for one-dimensional data, and software for doing this is provided.
Based on these results, I argue that Bayesian field theory is poised to provide
a definitive solution to the density estimation problem in one dimension.

Transform (FDMT) algorithm for optimal detection of such signals. Our algorithm
has a low theoretical complexity of 2N_f N_t+ N_t N_d log_2(N_f) where N_f, N_t
and N_d are the numbers of frequency bins, time bins, and dispersion measure

conserves the sensitivity of brute force dedispersion. Our tests indicate that

The latter algorithm's computation and data transport requirements are similar

a fast algorithm for sensitive dedispersion of pulses shorter than normally
allowed by incoherent dedispersion. In typical cases this algorithm is orders
of magnitude faster than coherent dedispersion by convolution. We analyze the

cosmic star formation rates in the era of cosmological reionization. These

non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the mathematical language of Differential
Geometry, we compare it with the primitive formulation of the GENERIC model and
discuss the main technical differences of the two approaches. In both dynamical
models the description of dissipation is of the ""entropy-gradient"" type. SEA
focuses only onto the irreversible component of the time evolution, chooses a
sub-Riemannian metric tensor as dissipative structure, and uses the local
entropy density field as potential. GENERIC emphasizes the coupling between the
reversible and irreversible components of the time evolution, chooses two
compatible degenerate structures (Poisson and degenerate co-Riemannian), and
uses the global energy and entropy functionals as potentials. As an
illustration, we rewrite the known GENERIC formulation of the Boltzmann
Equation in terms of the square-root of the distribution function adopted by
the SEA formulation. We then provide a formal proof that in more general
frameworks, whenever all degeneracies in the GENERIC framework are related to
conservation laws, the SEA and GENERIC models of the irreversible component of
the dynamics are essentially interchangeable, provided of course they assume
the same kinematics. As part of the discussion, we note that equipping the
dissipative structure of GENERIC with the Leibniz identity makes it
automatically SEA on metric leaves.

type-checking to decide the direction of reduction, which eliminates the need

better guide the parsing. Our system learns very accurate parses in GeoQuery,

the inflaton mass scale and is just enough to stabilise the SM Higgs potential.
The fine-tuned SM Higgs has then a mass around 126 GeV, in agreement with LHC

inflation may be realised in string theory with the (complex) inflaton/Higgs
identified with a continuous Wilson line or D-brane position. We show specific
examples and study in detail a IIB orientifold with D7-branes at singularities,
with SM gauge group and MSSM Higgs sector. In this case the inflaton/Higgs
fields correspond to D7-brane positions along a two-torus transverse to them.
Masses and monodromy are induced by closed string $G_3$ fluxes, and the
inflaton potential can be computed directly from the DBI+CS action. We show how
this action sums over Planck suppressed corrections, which amount to a field
dependent rescaling of the inflaton fields, leading to a linear potential in
the large field regime. We study the evolution of the two components of the

occurs and 50-60 efolds are obtained with r>0.07, testable in forthcoming

address the problem of filament channel formation and show how they acquire

twisting of a quasi-potential flux system that is bounded by a PIL and contains
a coronal hole (CH). The magnetic helicity injected by the small-scale
photospheric motions is shown to inverse-cascade up to the largest allowable
scales that define the closed flux system: the PIL and the CH. This process
produces field lines that are both sheared and smooth, and are sheared in
opposite senses at the PIL and the CH. The accumulated helicity and shear flux
are shown to be in excellent quantitative agreement with the

scatterometer that illuminates the sample with a linearly polarized 1064 nm

scatter for azimuthal angles in the plane of the laser beam. We extract from
these images the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the

that application of these coatings led to a more than 50% increase of the
integrated wide-angle scatter, to 5.00+/-0.30 and 3.38+/-0.20 ppm for the two
coated samples. In addition, the BRDF function of the coated optics takes on a
pattern of maxima versus azimuthal angle. We compare with a scattering model to
show that this is qualitatively consistent with roughness scattering from the
coating layer interfaces. These results are part of a broader study to
understand and minimize optical loss in quantum noise filter cavities for

perturbations to the wind field and updated absorption coefficients in the
linear regime on the initial value of the blast radius (R0), which is the
strongly non-linear zone of shock propagation near the body and corresponds to
energy deposition per path length, is relatively small. Using optical
photometry for ground-truth for energy deposition, we find that the ReVelle
model accurately predicts blast radii from infrasound periods ({\tau}), but
systematically under-predicts R0 using pressure amplitude. If the weak shock to
linear propagation distortion distance is adjusted as part of the modelling
process we are able to self-consistently fit a single blast radius value for
amplitude and period. In this case, the distortion distance is always much less
(usually just a few percent) than the value of 10 percent assumed in the
ReVelle model. Our study shows that fragmentation is an important process even
for centimeter sized meteoroids, implying that R0, while a good measure of
energy deposition by the meteoroid, is not a reliable means of obtaining the
meteoroid mass. We derived an empirical period-blast radius relation
appropriate to cm sized meteoroids. Our observations suggest that meteors
having blast radii as small as 1m are detectable infrasonically at the ground,
an order of magnitude smaller than previously considered.

tasks in probabilistic logic programming, where the goal is to compute the
probability of given queries being true provided a set of mutually independent
random variables, a model (a logic program) and some evidence. The core of
solving this inference task involves translating the logic program to a
propositional theory and using a model counter. In this paper, we show that for
some problems that involve inductive definitions like reachability in a graph,
the translation of logic programs to SAT can be expensive for the purpose of
solving inference tasks. For such problems, direct implementation of stable
model semantics allows for more efficient solving. We present two
implementation techniques, based on unfounded set detection, that extend a
propositional model counter to a stable model counter. Our experiments show
that for particular problems, our approach can outperform a state-of-the-art
probabilistic logic programming solver by several orders of magnitude in terms
of running time and space requirements, and can solve instances of

networks and mobile networks where the power of sensors (or mobile devices) is

protocols based on wake-up scheduling have been developed over the years in
order to enable timely neighbor discovery between neighboring sensors while
saving energy. However, existing protocols are not fine-grained enough to
support all heterogeneous battery duty cycles, which can lead to a more rapid
deterioration of long-term battery health for those without support. Existing
research can be broadly divided into two categories according to their
neighbor-discovery techniques---the quorum based protocols and the co-primality
based protocols.In this paper, we propose two neighbor discovery protocols,
called Hedis and Todis, that optimize the duty cycle granularity of quorum and
co-primality based protocols respectively, by enabling the finest-grained
control of heterogeneous duty cycles. We compare the two optimal protocols via
analytical and simulation results, which show that although the optimal
co-primality based protocol (Todis) is simpler in its design, the optimal
quorum based protocol (Hedis) has a better performance since it has a lower
relative error rate and smaller discovery delay, while still allowing the

learning, where a model is selected by minimizing a loss function over
constraint set. When the training dataset consists of private information, it
is natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has
been the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni
2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss
function and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value
of the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error
bounds are fairly well understood \cite{BassilyST14}. In this work, we show
that the geometric properties of the constraint set can be used to derive
significantly better results. Specifically, we show that a differentially
private version of Mirror Descent leads to error bounds of the form
$\tilde{O}(G_{\mathcal{C}}/n)$ for a lipschitz loss function, improving on the
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{p}/n)$ bounds in Bassily, Smith and Thakurta 2014. Here $p$ is
the dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number of data points in the
training set, and $G_{\mathcal{C}}$ denotes the Gaussian width of the
constraint set that we optimize over. We show similar improvements for strongly
convex functions, and for smooth functions. In addition, we show that when the
loss function is Lipschitz with respect to the $\ell_1$ norm and $\mathcal{C}$
is $\ell_1$-bounded, a differentially private version of the Frank-Wolfe
algorithm gives error bounds of the form $\tilde{O}(n^{-2/3})$. This captures
the important and common case of sparse linear regression (LASSO), when the
data $x_i$ satisfies $|x_i|_{\infty} \leq 1$ and we optimize over the $\ell_1$
ball. We show new lower bounds for this setting, that together with known
bounds, imply that all our upper bounds are tight.

eigenvalues of the Koopman operator are invariant to invertible transformations
of the system state, so that the values of the Koopman eigenfunctions serve as
a set of intrinsic coordinates that can be used to map between different
observations (e.g., measurements obtained through different sets of sensors) of
the same fundamental behavior. The measurements we wish to merge can also be
nonlinear, but must be ""rich enough"" to allow (an effective approximation of)
the state to be reconstructed from a single set of measurements. This approach
requires independently obtained sets of data that capture the evolution of the
heterogeneous measurements and a single pair of ""joint"" measurements taken at
one instance in time. Computational approximations of eigenfunctions and their
corresponding eigenvalues from data are accomplished using Extended Dynamic
Mode Decomposition. We illustrate this approach on measurements of
spatio-temporal oscillations of the FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, and show how to fuse

fundamental results about these tangent spaces, compute them in many examples,

improved definition of the tangent bundle, using what we call the dvs
diffeology, which ensures that scalar multiplication and addition are smooth.

multiple dynamical timescales. Turbulence within cores results in a spatially
non-uniform angular momentum of the cloud, causing a stochastic variation in
orientation of the disk forming from the collapsing material. In the absence of
star-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a natural
mechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in the
resulting planetary systems. However, owing to high accretion rates in the
embedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar disk
extends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational and
accretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk. Here, we
demonstrate that the resulting gravitational coupling is sufficient to suppress
any significant star-disk misalignment, with accretion playing a secondary
role. The joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wandering
of star-aligned bipolar outflows. Such wandering widens the effective opening
angle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of the
remainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope. Accordingly, the processes
described in this work provide an additional mechanism responsible for
sculpting the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).

Although the SHE in multiorbital systems without inversion symmetry (IS) is
expected to show several characteristic properties due to the cooperative roles
of orbital degrees of freedom and a lack of IS, a theoretical understanding of
the cooperative roles has been lacking. To clarify the cooperative roles, we
study the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) derived by the linear-response theory
for a $t_{2g}$-orbital tight-binding model of the $[001]$ surface or interface
of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the presence of dilute nonmagnetic impurities. We find that
the band anticrossing, arising from a combination of orbital degrees of freedom
and a lack of IS, causes an increase of magnitude and a sign change of the SHC
at some nonmagnetic impurity concentrations. Since a similar mechanism for
controlling the magnitude and sign of the response of Hall effects works in
other multiorbital systems without IS, our mechanism provides an ubiquitous
method to control the magnitude and sign of the response of Hall effects in
some multiorbital systems by introducing IS breaking and tuning of the
nonmagnetic impurity concentration.

limit. We show here that this X-ray source is not exotic in any sense. The
standard equations of accretion along field lines predict that, for the

luminosity $L_X$ must be near the Eddington limit (i.e., $L_{X}\approx
3.5\times 10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$); and that the surface magnetic field $B$, that
does not depend on $P_S$, must be modest (i.e., $B_*\approx 1-10$ TG). The
observed higher luminosity can be explained by a moderate amount of geometric
beaming that occurs in our direction. Other ultraluminous X-ray sources may
also turn out to be common pulsars with similar physical characteristics, but
since the emission must occur at a favorable angle to the observer, we expect
that very few such pulsars will be discovered in the future.

fixed-frequency superconducting qubits. Through off-resonant driving of a bus
resonator, statically coupled qubits acquire a state-dependent phase. However,
photon loss leads to dephasing during the gate, and any residual entanglement
between the resonator and qubits after the gate leads to decoherence. Here we
consider how to shape the drive pulse to minimize these unwanted effects.
First, we review how the gate's entangling and dephasing rates depend on the
system parameters and validate closed-form solutions against direct numerical
solution of a master equation. Next, we propose spline pulse shapes that reduce
residual qubit-bus entanglement, are robust to imprecise knowledge of the
resonator shift, and can be shortened by using higher-degree polynomials.
Finally, we present a procedure that optimizes over the subspace of pulses that
leave the resonator unpopulated. This finds shaped drive pulses that further
reduce the gate duration. Assuming realistic parameters, we exhibit shaped
pulses that have the potential to realize ~212 ns spline pulse gates and ~120
ns optimized gates with ~6e-4 average gate infidelity. These examples do not
represent fundamental limits of the gate and in principle even shorter gates
may be achievable.

contracts with long maturities if the continuous fee structure is kept, which
is ordinarily assumed for a GMWB contract. In fact for some long maturities it
can be shown that the fee cannot be charged as any proportion of the account
value -- there is no solution to match the initial premium with the fair
annuity price. On the other hand, the extra fee due to adding the death benefit
can be charged upfront or in periodic instalment of fixed amount, and it is
cheaper than buying a separate life insurance.

extend this notion to sets of line segments in the Euclidean plane and present

points moving along given line segments. We show that relations between
$\beta$-skeletons for $\beta > 1$, $1$-skeleton (Gabriel Graph), and the
Delaunay triangulation for sets of points hold also for sets of segments. We

stage for the liquid state machine (LSM), a popular model for reservoir
computing. Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the
p-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of
readout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain
better performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it
attractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of
dendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having
multiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity. The number of synaptic
connections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of
connections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find
the best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.
Hence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network
similar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We
show that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this
architecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of
binary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train
classification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation
task. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons
cannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout.
An additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the
'choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event
representation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems
where the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary
synapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations.

localization. Discovering the malicious or vulnerable anchor node is an
essential problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In wireless sensor
networks, anchor nodes are the nodes that know its current location.
Neighbouring nodes or non-anchor nodes calculate its location (or its location
reference) with the help of anchor nodes. Ingenuous localization is not
possible in the presence of a cheating anchor node or a cheating node.
Nowadays, it's a challenging task to identify the cheating anchor node or
cheating node in a network. Even after finding out the location of the cheating
anchor node, there is no assurance, that the identified node is legitimate or
not. This paper aims to localize the cheating anchor nodes using trilateration
algorithm and later associate it with maximum likelihood expectation technique
(MLE), and Mahalanobis distance to obtain maximum accuracy in identifying
malicious or cheating anchor nodes during localization. We were able to attain
a considerable reduction in the error achieved during localization. For
implementation purpose we simulated our scheme using ns-3 network simulator.

\emph{Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey} (ALFALFA), and its mass is dominated by
neutral hydrogen (HI) gas. In contrast, both the stellar masses of the bright
HII and diffuse stellar regions are small. In addition, the fit to the spectral
energy distribution to each region shows the stellar populations of HII and
diffuse regions are different. The bright HII region contains a large fraction
of O-type stars, revealing the recent strong star formation, whereas the
diffuse region is dominated by median age stars, which has a typical age of
$\sim$ 600 Myrs. Using the McGaugh's abundance model, we found that the average
metallicity of KKR 17 is 12 + (O/H) = 8.0 $\pm$ 0.1. The star formation rate of
KKR 17 is 0.21$\pm$0.04 M$_{\odot}$/yr, which is $\sim$1/5 of our Milky Way's.
Based on the analysis results to young stellar clusters in HII region, it is
found that the bright HII region showed two sub-components with different
velocities and metallicities. This may be caused by the outflow of massive
stars or merging events. However, the mechanism of triggering star formation in
the HII region is still uncertain.

investigate the broadband modelling of four SGRBs with evidence for energy

which a newly formed magnetar injects energy into a forward shock as it loses
angular momentum along open field lines. By performing an order of magnitude
search for the underlying physical parameters in the blast wave, we constrain
the characteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum against their

The application of the magnetar energy injection profile restricts the
successful matches to a limited family of models that are self-consistent

curves that describe how the radio signatures of these SGRBs ought to have
looked given the restrictions imposed by the available data, and discuss the
detectability of these signatures with present-day and near-future radio
telescopes. Our results show that both the Atacama Large Millimetre Array and

negligible misalignment between the neutrino Yukawa basis and the charged
lepton basis, we find an analytical expression for the final asymmetry directly
in terms of the low energy neutrino parameters that fully reproduces previous
numerical results. This expression also shows that is possible to identify an
effective leptogenesis phase for these models. When we also impose the wash-out
of a large pre-existing asymmetry $N^{\rm p,i}_{B-L}$, the strong thermal (ST)
condition, we derive analytically all those constraints on the low energy
neutrino parameters that characterise the {\rm ST}-$SO(10)$-inspired
leptogenesis solution, confirming previous numerical results. In particular we
show why, though neutrino masses have to be necessarily normally ordered, the
solution implies an analytical lower bound on the effective neutrino-less
double beta decay neutrino mass, $m_{ee} \gtrsim 8\,{\rm meV}$, for $N^{\rm
p,i}_{B-L}=10^{-3}$, testable with next generation experiments. This, in
combination with an upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle, necessarily in
the first octant, forces the lightest neutrino mass within a narrow range $m_1
\simeq (10$-$30)\,{\rm meV}$ (corresponding to $\sum_i \, m_i \simeq
(75$-$125)\,{\rm meV}$). We also show why the solution could correctly predict
a non-vanishing reactor neutrino mixing angle and requires the Dirac phase to
be in the fourth quadrant, implying $\sin\delta $ (and $J_{CP}$) negative as
hinted by current global analyses. Many of the analytical results presented
(expressions for the orthogonal matrix, RH neutrino mixing matrix, masses and
phases) can have applications beyond leptogenesis.

inflation makes a distinct prediction: the observed correlation functions of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) become statistically anisotropic. We
study the implications of the current bound on statistical anisotropy derived
from the Planck 2013 CMB temperature data for such a model. The previous
calculations based on the attractor solution indicate that the magnitude of
anisotropy in the power spectrum is proportional to $N^2$, where $N$ is the
number of $e$-folds of inflation counted from the end of inflation. In this
paper, we show that the attractor solution is not compatible with the current
bound, and derive new predictions using another branch of anisotropic
inflation. In addition, we improve upon the calculation of the mode function of
perturbations by including the leading-order slow-roll corrections. We find
that the anisotropy is roughly proportional to
$[2(\varepsilon_H+4\eta_H)/3-4(c-1)]^{-2}$, where $\varepsilon_H$ and $\eta_H$
are the usual slow-roll parameters and $c$ is the parameter in the model,
regardless of the form of potential of an inflaton field. The bound from Planck
implies that breaking of rotational invariance during inflation (characterized
by the background homogeneous shear divided by the Hubble rate) is limited to
be less than ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$. This bound is many orders of magnitude
smaller than the amplitude of breaking of time translation invariance, which is
observed to be ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$.

characterized by a localized constriction. We consider a capsule with a
stress-free spherical shape and impose its steady state configuration in an
infinitely long straight channel as the initial condition for our calculations.
We report how the capsule deformation, velocity, retention time, and maximum
stress of the membrane are affected by the capillary number, Ca, and the
constriction shape. We estimate the deformation by measuring the variation of
the three-dimensional surface area and a series of alternative quantities
easier to extract from experiments. These are the Taylor parameter, the
perimeter and the area of the capsule in the spanwise plane. We find that the
perimeter is the quantity that reproduces the behavior of the three-dimensional
surface area the best. We observe that, in general, area-deformation correlated
quantities grow linearly with Ca, while velocity-correlated quantities saturate
for large Ca but display a steeper increase for small Ca. The velocity of the
capsule divided by the velocity of the flow displays, surprisingly, two
different qualitative behaviors for small and large capillary numbers. Finally,
we report that longer constrictions and spanwise wall bounded (versus spanwise
periodic) domains cause larger deformations and velocities. If the deformation
and velocity in the spanwise wall bounded domains are rescaled by the initial
equilibrium deformation and velocity, their behavior is undistinguishable from
that in a periodic domain. In contrast, a remarkably different behavior is
reported in sinusoidally shaped and smoothed rectangular constrictions
indicating that the capsule dynamics is particularly sensitive to abrupt
changes in the cross section. In a smoothed rectangular constriction larger
deformations and velocities occur over a larger distance.

introduce a novel growth model that is motivated by time-warping models in
functional data analysis and includes a nonmonotone time-warping component that
allows the inclusion and description of boom-bust cycles and facilitates
insights into the dynamics of asset bubbles. The underlying idea is to model
longitudinal growth trajectories for house prices and other phenomena, where
temporal setbacks and deflation may be encountered, by decomposing such
trajectories into two components. A first component corresponds to underlying
steady growth driven by inflation that anchors the observed trajectories on a
simple first order linear differential equation, while a second boom-bust
component is implemented as time warping. Time warping is a commonly
encountered phenomenon and reflects random variation along the time axis. Our
approach to time warping is more general than previous approaches by admitting
the inclusion of nonmonotone warping functions. The anchoring of the
trajectories on an underlying linear dynamic system also makes the time-warping
component identifiable and enables straightforward estimation procedures for
all model components. The application to the dynamics of housing prices as
observed for 19 metropolitan areas in the U.S. from December 1998 to July 2013
reveals that the time setbacks corresponding to nonmonotone time warping vary
substantially across markets and we find indications that they are related to

the same time models and simulations have been tailored to quantify the
different effects of the environment on the evolution of galaxies. Simulations,
models, and observations consistently indicate that star-forming dwarf galaxies
entering high-density environments for the first time can be rapidly stripped
from their interstellar medium. The lack of gas quenches the activity of star
formation, producing on timescales of ${\sim}$1~Gyr quiescent galaxies with
spectro-photometric, chemical, structural, and kinematical properties similar
to those observed in dwarf early-type galaxies inhabiting rich clusters and
loose groups. Simulations and observations consistently identify ram pressure
stripping as the major effect responsible for the quenching of the
star-formation activity in rich clusters. Gravitational interactions (galaxy
harassment) can also be important in groups or in clusters whenever galaxies
have been members since early epochs. The observation of clusters at different
redshifts combined with the present high infalling rate of galaxies onto

Besides the commonly reported three hole-like and two electron-like bands in

zone center and one more fast-dispersing band near the X point in the vicinity
of Fermi level. By tuning the polarization and the energy of incident

density of a distribution given the sample of data points. However, it has
certain drawbacks: proper description of the density using narrow kernels needs
large data samples, whereas if the kernel width is large, boundaries and narrow
structures tend to be smeared. Here, an approach to correct for such effects,
is proposed that uses an approximate density to describe narrow structures and
boundaries. The approach is shown to be well suited for the description of the
efficiency shape over a multidimensional phase space in a typical particle

the $\Lambda_b^0\to D^0p\pi$ decay.

errors in the hardware processing it. A future fault-tolerant quantum computer
will use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In
the smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a
two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.
For each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed
stabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing
the encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using
nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and
NV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at
the end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable
to physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for
fault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the
two parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit
repetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We
construct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using
ancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating
three-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate
stabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to
coherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits.
While increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are
required to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a
critical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.

how to use semiclassical approximation to get the same results as strong field

$L_{\rm bol}=2.6\pm0.6\times10^{47}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}=6.7 \pm
1.6\times10^{13}L_{\odot}$, to which the three components contribute
$31\%,32\%,3\%$, respectively, with the remainder provided by the extreme UV

relations to estimate a star formation rate (SFR) in the range $60-270\,{\rm

these indicators are promising tools for estimating the SFR in high-redshift
quasars in general. At the time observed the black hole was growing in mass
more than 100 times faster than the stellar bulge, relative to the mass ratio
measured in the local universe, i.e. compared to ${M_{\rm BH}}/{M_{\rm bulge}}

the topological level (who interacts with whom) and at the temporal level (when
interactions occur and how often). While it is known that temporal
heterogeneities often have strong effects on dynamical processes, e.g. the
burstiness of contact sequences is associated with slower spreading dynamics,
the picture is far from complete. In this paper, we show that temporal
heterogeneities result in temporal sparsity} at the time scale of average
inter-event times, and that temporal sparsity determines the amount of slowdown
of Susceptible-Infectious (SI) spreading dynamics on temporal networks. This
result is based on the analysis of several empirical temporal network data
sets. An approximate solution for a simple network model confirms the
association between temporal sparsity and slowdown of SI spreading dynamics.
Since deterministic SI spreading always follows the fastest temporal paths, our
results generalize -- paths are slower to traverse because of temporal
sparsity, and therefore all dynamical processes are slower as well.

top of a mirror surface (for example, designing a reflectarray antenna). Here
we show, both theoretically and experimentally, that full-power reflection with
general control over reflected wave phase is possible with a single-layer array
of deeply sub-wavelength inclusions. These proposed artificial surfaces,
metamirrors, provide various functions of shaped or nonuniform reflectors
without utilizing any mirror. This can be achieved only if the forward and
backward scattering of the inclusions in the array can be engineered
independently, and we prove that it is possible using electrically and

possess desired reflecting properties at the operational frequency band, while
at other frequencies the array is practically transparent. The metamirror

Hence observer semantics are an integral part of what we mean by spacetime.
  Semantics make up the essential difference in how one describes and uses the
concept of space in physics, chemistry, biology and technology. In these notes,
I have tried to assemble what seems to be a set of natural, and pragmatic,
considerations about discrete, finite spacetimes, to unify descriptions of
these areas.
  It reviews familiar notions of spacetime, and brings them together into a
less familiar framework of promise theory (autonomous agents), in order to
illuminate the goal of encoding the semantics of observers into a description
of spacetime itself. Autonomous agents provide an exacting atomic and local
model for finite spacetime, which quickly reveals the issues of incomplete
information and non-locality. From this we should be able to reconstruct all
other notions of spacetime.
  The aim of this exercise is to apply related tools and ideas to an initial
unification of real and artificial spaces, e.g. databases and information webs
with natural spacetime. By reconstructing these spaces from autonomous agents,
we may better understand naming and coordinatization of semantic spaces, from
crowds and swarms to datacentres and libraries, as well as the fundamental

coordinates allows for the possibility that the fluid interface is not a graph
over the horizontal. We use a technical reformulation which converts the
traveling wave equations into a system of the form ""identity plus compact.""
Rabinowitz' global bifurcation theorem is applied and the final conclusion is
the existence of either a closed loop of solutions, or an unbounded set of
nontrivial traveling wave solutions which contains waves which may move
arbitrarily fast, become arbitrarily long, form singularities in the vorticity
or curvature, or whose interfaces self-intersect.

identical quantum system that interact dissipatively with a reservoir in a {\it

globally Lindbladian, one of the subsystems ""sees"" the reservoir in a state
modified by the interaction with the other subsystem and hence it undergoes a
non-Markovian dynamics. As a consequence, the heat flow exhibits a
non-exponential time behaviour which can greatly deviate from the case where
each party is independently coupled to the reservoir. We investigate both
thermal and correlated initial states of $S$ and show that the presence of
correlations at the beginning can considerably affect the heat flux rate. We
carry out our study in two paradigmatic cases -- a pair of harmonic oscillators
with a reservoir of bosonic modes and two qubits with a reservoir of fermionic
modes -- and compare the corresponding behaviours. In the case of qubits and
for initial thermal states, we find that the trace distance discord is at any

gravity is investigated. We find a new type of Wald entropy, which appears on
entangling surface without the rotational symmetry and reduces to usual Wald
entropy on Killing horizon. Furthermore, we obtain a formal formula of HEE for
the most general higher derivative gravity and work it out exactly for some
squashed cones. As an important application, we derive HEE for gravitational
action with one derivative of the curvature when the extrinsic curvature
vanishes. We also study some toy models with non-zero extrinsic curvature. We
prove that our formula yields the correct universal term of entanglement
entropy for 4d CFTs. Furthermore, we solve the puzzle raised by Hung, Myers and
Smolkin that the logarithmic term of entanglement entropy derived from Weyl
anomaly of CFTs does not match the holographic result even if the extrinsic
curvature vanishes. We find that such mismatch comes from the `anomaly of
entropy' of the derivative of curvature. After considering such contributions
carefully, we resolve the puzzle successfully. In general, we need to fix the
splitting problem for the conical metrics in order to derive the holographic
entanglement entropy. We find that, at least for Einstein gravity, the
splitting problem can be fixed by using equations of motion. How to derive the
splittings for higher derivative gravity is a non-trivial and open question.
For simplicity, we ignore the splitting problem in this paper and find that it
does not affect our main results.

and functions, and consists of two parts: the fine multifractal theory and the
coarse multifractal theory. The fine and the coarse theory are linked by a web
of conjectures known collectively as the Multifractal Formalism. Very roughly
speaking the Multifractal Formalism says that the multifractal spectrum from
fine theory equals the Legendre transform of the Renyi dimensions from the
coarse theory.
  Recently {\it fine} multifractal zeta-functions, i.e. multifractal
zeta-functions designed to produce detailed information about the fine
multifractal theory, have been introduced and investigated. The purpose of this
work is to complement and expand this study by introducing and investigating
{\it coarse} multifractal zeta-functions, i.e. multifractal zeta-functions
designed to produce information about the coarse multifractal theory, and, in
particular, to establish a {\it Multifractal Fortmalism for Zeta-Functions}
linking fine multifractal zeta-functions and coarse multifractal zeta-functions

  Several applications are given, including applications to multifractal

(including Omega_m=0.50 and H_0=73.9 (-9.5+10.6) km/s/Mpc), fits the
angular-size data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.806. On the basis of their
chi^2_dof values alone, both models appear to account for the data very well in
spite of the fact that the R_h=ct Universe expands at a constant rate, while
LCDM does not. However, because of the different number of free parameters in
these models, selection tools, such as the Bayes Information Criterion, favour
R_h=ct over LCDM with a likelihood of ~86% versus ~14%. These results impact
the question of galaxy growth at large redshifts. Previous work suggested an
inconsistency with the underlying cosmological model unless elliptical and disk
galaxies grew in size by a surprisingly large factor ~6 from z~3 to 0. The fact
that both LCDM and R_h=ct fit the cluster-size measurements quite well casts
some doubt on the suggestion that the unexpected result with individual

astrophysical causes, such as mergers and/or selection effects.

through tiny, smooth deformations of the substrate, dubbed here ""wrinklogami"",
that barely affect the macroscale topography. This ""pro-lamination"" effect
reflects a surprising capability of smooth wrinkles to suppress compression in
elastic films even when spherical or other doubly-curved topography is imposed,
in a similar fashion to origami folds that enable construction of curved
structures from an unstretchable paper. We show that the emergence of a
wrinklogami pattern signals a nontrivial isometry of the sheet to its planar,
undeformed state, in the doubly asymptotic limit of small thickness and weak
tensile load exerted by the adhesive substrate. We explain how such an
""asymptotic isometry"" concept broadens the standard usage of isometries for
describing the response of elastic sheets to geomertric constraints and
mechanical loads.

  Classification using a Simple Model of Active Dendrites","Accepted for publication in Neural Computation",,,,"cs.NE q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a spike-based model which employs neurons with
functionally distinct dendritic compartments for classifying high dimensional
binary patterns. The synaptic inputs arriving on each dendritic subunit are
nonlinearly processed before being linearly integrated at the soma, giving the
neuron a capacity to perform a large number of input-output mappings. The model
utilizes sparse synaptic connectivity; where each synapse takes a binary value.
The optimal connection pattern of a neuron is learned by using a simple
hardware-friendly, margin enhancing learning algorithm inspired by the
mechanism of structural plasticity in biological neurons. The learning
algorithm groups correlated synaptic inputs on the same dendritic branch. Since
the learning results in modified connection patterns, it can be incorporated
into current event-based neuromorphic systems with little overhead. This work
also presents a branch-specific spike-based version of this structural
plasticity rule. The proposed model is evaluated on benchmark binary
classification problems and its performance is compared against that achieved
using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
techniques. Our proposed method attains comparable performance while utilizing
10 to 50% less computational resources than the other reported techniques.

that the very broad band, anomalous emission of Yb2+-doped CaF2 and SrF2,
usually associated with impurity-trapped excitons, is, rather, an IVCT
luminescence associated with Yb2+-Yb3+ mixed valence pairs. It is very
efficiently excited by a two-photon upconversion mechanism. The IVCT vertical
transition leaves the pair moieties very far from their equilibrium structures;
this explains the unexpectedly large band width of the emission band and its
low peak energy, because the large reorganization energies are substracted from
the normal emission. The ab initio IVCT energy diagrams explain the different
luminescent properties of Yb-doped CaF2, SrF2, BaF2, and SrCl2: the presence of
IVCT luminescence in Yb-doped CaF2 and SrF2; its coexistence with regular 5d-4f
emission in SrF2; its absence in BaF2 and SrCl2; the quenching of all emissions
in BaF2; and the presence of additional 5d-4f emissions in SrCl2 which are
absent in SrF2. They also allow to interpret and reproduce recent experiments

on Tungsten slab sample were experimentally measured at 60$^{\circ}$ and
120$^{\circ}$ by using a time-of-flight method. Theoretical calculations are
carried out by Monte Carlo neutron transport code MCNP-4C with evaluated

120$^{\circ}$ in the elastic scattering peak, caused by a slight difference in
the oscillation pattern of the elastic angular distribution at angles larger

two-level system (representing the electronic state) coupled to a thermalized
bath of classical harmonic oscillators (representing the nuclei degrees of

electronic state are chosen as reaction coordinates. Then, the dynamical
equations at non vanishing temperature become those of an effective Hamiltonian
submitted to damping terms and their associated Langevin random forces. The
advantage of this new formalism is to extend the original theory by taking into
account both ionic and covalent interactions. The standard theory is recovered
only when covalent interactions are neglected. Increasing these covalent
interactions from zero, the energy barrier predicted by the standard theory
first depresses, next vanish (or almost vanish) and for stronger covalent
interactions, covalent bond formation takes place of ET. In biochemistry, the
standard Marcus theory often fails to explain the enzymatic reactions
especially those with non Arrhenius behavior which are barrierless and also
dissipate little heat. We claim that this improved theory should yield an
interesting tool for understanding them.

\emph{relay attack}, which affects several technologies such as RFID, NFC,
Bluetooth, and Ad-hoc networks. A prominent family of DB protocols are those
based on graphs, which were introduced in 2010 to resist both mafia and
distance frauds. The security analysis in terms of distance fraud is performed
by considering an adversary that, given a vertex labeled graph $G = (V, E)$ and
a vertex $v \in V$, is able to find the most frequent $n$-long sequence in $G$
starting from $v$ (MFS problem). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is
still an open question whether the distance fraud security can be computed
considering the aforementioned adversarial model. Our first contribution is a
proof that the MFS problem is NP-Hard even when the graph is constrained to
meet the requirements of a graph-based DB protocol. Although this result does
not invalidate the model, it does suggest that a \emph{too-strong} adversary is
perhaps being considered (i.e., in practice, graph-based DB protocols might
resist distance fraud better than the security model suggests.) Our second
contribution is an algorithm addressing the distance fraud security of the
tree-based approach due to Avoine and Tchamkerten. The novel algorithm improves
the computational complexity $O(2^{2^n+n})$ of the naive approach to
$O(2^{2n}n)$ where $n$ is the number of rounds.
