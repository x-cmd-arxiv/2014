vanadium oxide thin films is highly desirable for not only fundamental
research, but also technological applications that utilize the subtle change in
the physical properties originating from the metal- insulator transition (MIT)
near room temperature. However, due to the multivalent nature of vanadium and
the lack of a good understanding on growth control of the oxidation state,
stabilization of phase pure vanadium oxides with a single oxidation state is
extremely challenging. Here, we systematically varied the growth conditions to
clearly map out the growth window for preparing phase pure epitaxial vanadium
oxides by pulsed laser deposition for providing a guideline to grow high
quality thin films with well-defined oxidation states of V2(+3)O3, V(+4)O2, and
V2(+5)O5. A well pronounced MIT was only observed in VO2 films grown in a very
narrow range of oxygen partial pressure P(O2). The films grown either in lower
(< 10 mTorr) or higher P(O2) (> 25 mTorr) result in V2O3 and V2O5 phases,
respectively, thereby suppressing the MIT for both cases. We have also found
that the resistivity ratio before and after the MIT of VO2 thin films can be
further enhanced by one order of magnitude when the films are further oxidized
by post-annealing at a well-controlled oxidizing ambient. This result indicates
that stabilizing vanadium into a single valence state has to compromise with
insufficient oxidation of an as grown thin film and, thereby, a subsequent
oxidation is required for an improved MIT behavior.

performance of face recognition is becoming comparable to human. Using private
large scale training datasets, several groups achieve very high performance on
LFW, i.e., 97% to 99%. While there are many open source implementations of CNN,
none of large scale face dataset is publicly available. The current situation
in the field of face recognition is that data is more important than algorithm.
To solve this problem, this paper proposes a semi-automatical way to collect
face images from Internet and builds a large scale dataset containing about
10,000 subjects and 500,000 images, called CASIAWebFace. Based on the database,
we use a 11-layer CNN to learn discriminative representation and obtain
state-of-theart accuracy on LFW and YTF. The publication of CASIAWebFace will
attract more research groups entering this field and accelerate the development
of face recognition in the wild.

channels from the $n$ instances of the physical channel by a simple linear

input to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either
essentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much
information as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by
transmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.
Unfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels
is poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying
physical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient
to determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete
memoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the
other. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is
directly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which
are essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the
performance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast

73.41 d variability period. High resolution spectropolarimetric data analyzed
using Least-Squares Deconvolution yield a Zeeman signature detected in the mean
Stokes V profile corresponding to phase 0.5 of the spectral ephemeris.
Interpreting the 73.41 d period as the stellar rotational period, we have
phased the equivalent widths and inferred longitudinal field measurements. The
phased magnetic data exhibit a weak sinusoidal variation, with maximum of about
565 G at phase 0.5, and a minimum of about -335 G at phase 0.0, with extrema
approximately in phase with the (double-wave) Halpha equivalent width
variation. Modeling of the Halpha equivalent width variation assuming a
quasi-3D magnetospheric model produces a unique solution for the ambiguous
couplet of inclination and magnetic obliquity angles: (i, beta) or (beta,
i)=(35 deg,90 deg). Adopting either geometry, the longitudinal field variation
yields a dipole polar intensity Bd=2.6\pm 0.9~kG, consistent with that obtained
from direct modelling of the Stokes V profiles. We derive a wind magnetic
confinement parameter eta*\simeq 100, leading to an Alfv\'en radius RA\simeq
3-5~R*, and a Kepler radius RK\simeq 20~R*. This supports a physical scenario
in which the Halpha emission and other line variability have their origin in an
oblique, co-rotating 'dynamical magnetosphere' structure resulting from a
magnetically channeled wind. Nevertheless, the details of the formation of
spectral lines and their variability within this framework remain generally
poorly understood.

many aspects of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction processes, including
substorms. However, neither the Dungey model nor its numerous modifications
were able to explain fully the onset conditions for MR in the tail. In this
paper, we introduce new onset conditions for forced MR in the tail. We call our
scenario the ""windsock memory conditioned ram pressure effect"". Our
non-flux-transfer associated forcing is introduced by a combination of
large-scale windsock motions exhibiting memory effects and solar wind dynamic
pressure actions on the nightside magnetopause during northward oriented IMF.
Using global MHD GUMICS-4 simulation results, upstream data from WIND,
magnetosheath data from Cluster-1 and distant-tail data from the two-probe
ARTEMIS mission, we show that the simultaneous occurrence of vertical windsock
motions of the magnetotail and enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure introduces
strong nightside disturbances, including enhanced electric fields and
persistent vertical cross-tail shear flows. These perturbations, associated
with a stream interaction region in the solar wind, drive MR in the tail during
episodes of northward oriented interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We detect
MR indirectly, observing plasmoids in the tail and ground based signatures of
Earthward moving fast flows. We also consider the application to solar system
planets and close-in exoplanets, where the proposed scenario can elucidate some

190\,MHz with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Four fields have been monitored
with cadences between 15 minutes and several months. A total of 151 images were
obtained, giving a total survey area of 2275 deg$^2$. We analysed our data
using standard LOFAR tools and searched for radio transients using the LOFAR
Transients Pipeline (TraP). No credible radio transient candidate has been
detected; however, we are able to set upper limits on the surface density of
radio transient sources at low radio frequencies. We also show that
low-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent
transient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods
to determine the upper limits on the transient surface density. One is free of
assumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a
power-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the
transient surface density. Both of these methods provide better constraints
than the approach used in previous works. The best value for the upper limit we
can set for the transient surface density, using the method assuming a
power-law flux distribution, is 1.3$\cdot$10$^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$ for transients
brighter than 0.3 Jy with a time-scale of 15 min, at a frequency of 150 MHz. We
also calculated for the first time upper limits for the transient surface
density for transients of different time-scales. We find that the results can
differ by orders of magnitude from previously reported, simplified estimates.

adiabatic quantum optimization. We show that, in this way, a broad class of
NP-complete problems becomes accessible for quantum simulations, including the
knapsack problem, number partitioning, and instances of the max-cut problem.
Moreover, a general theoretical study reveals correlations of the success
probability with entanglement at the end of the protocol. From exact numerical
simulations for small systems and linear ramps, however, we find no substantial
correlations with the entanglement during the optimization. For the final
state, we derive analytically a universal upper bound for the success
probability as a function of entanglement, which can be measured in experiment.
The proposed trapped-ion setups and the presented study of entanglement address
pertinent questions of adiabatic quantum optimization, which may be of general

bootstrap methods that were used to find the anomalous dimension of the $N=0$

simulated the evolution of these cores using SPH. Each core has been evolved
once with no radiative feedback from stars, once with continuous radiative
feedback, and once with episodic radiative feedback. Here we analyse the
multiplicity statistics from these simulations. With episodic radiative
feedback, (i) the multiplicity frequency is ~60% higher than in the field; (ii)
the multiplicity frequency and the mean semi-major axis both increase with
primary mass; (iii) one third of multiple systems are hierarchical systems with
more than two components; (iv) in these hierarchical systems the inner pairings
typically have separations of a few au and mass ratios concentrated towards
unity, whereas the outer pairings have separations of order 100 au and a
flatter distribution of mass ratios. The binary statistics are compatible with
observations of young embedded populations, and -- if wider orbits are
disrupted preferentially by external perturbations -- with observations of
mature field populations. With no radiative feedback, the results are similar
to those from simulations with episodic feedback. With continuous radiative
feedback, brown dwarfs are under-produced, the number of multiple systems is
too low, and the statistical properties of multiple systems are at variance
with observation. This suggests that star formation in Ophiuchus may only be
representative of global star formation if accretion onto protostars, and hence
radiative feedback, is episodic.

in their orbital and size-distributions. While all populations show steep
size-distributions for large objects, recently relative deficit of Neptunian
Trojans and scattering objects with diameters $D<100\,\mathrm{km}$ were
detected. We have investigated this deficit with a 32 square degree survey,
detecting 77 TNOs to a limiting $r$-band magnitude of 24.6. Our Plutinos sample
(18 objects in 3:2 mean motion resonance with Neptune) also shows a deficit of
$D<100\,\mathrm{km}$ objects. We reject a single power-law size-distribution
and find that the Plutinos favour a divot. The Plutinos are thus added the list
of populations with a deficit of $D<100\,\mathrm{km}$ objects. The fact that
three independent samples of three different populations show this trend
suggests that it is a real feature, possibly shared by all hot TNO populations
as a remnant of ""born big"" planetesimal formation processes. We surmise the
existence of $9000\pm3000$ Plutinos with $H_r\leq8.66$ and
$37000^{+12000}_{-10000}$ Plutinos with $H_r\leq10.0$. Our survey also
discovered one temporary Uranian Trojan, one temporary Neptunian Trojans and
one stable Neptunian Trojan, from which we derive populations of
$110^{+500}_{-100}$, $210^{+900}_{-200}$ and $150^{+600}_{-140}$ ,
respectively, with $H_r\leq10.0$. The Neptunian Trojans are thus less numerous
than the main belt asteroids, which has over 700 asteroids with $H_r\leq10.0$.
With such numbers, the temporary Neptunian Trojans cannot be previously stable
Trojans that happen to be escaping the resonance now; they must be captured
from another reservoir. With three 3:1 and one 4:1 resonators, we add to the
growing evidence that the high-order resonances are more populated than
expected.

present detailed abundances from ESO VLT/UVES high-resolution spectroscopy for
ET0097, the first CEMP star found in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal. This star
has $\text{[Fe/H]}=-2.03\pm0.10$, $\text{[C/Fe]}=0.51\pm0.10$ and
$\text{[N/Fe]}=1.18\pm0.20$. The traditional definition of CEMP stars is
$\text{[C/Fe]}\geq0.70$, but taking into account that this luminous red giant
branch star has undergone mixing, it was intrinsically less nitrogen enhanced
and more carbon-rich when it was formed, and so it falls under the definition
of CEMP stars, as proposed by Aoki et al. (2007) to account for this effect. By
making corrections for this mixing, we conclude that the star had
$\text{[C/Fe]}\approx0.8$ during its earlier evolutionary stages. Apart from
the enhanced C and N abundances, ET0097 shows no peculiarities in other
elements lighter than Zn, and no enhancement of the heavier neutron-capture
elements (Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy), making this a CEMP-no star. However, the
star does show signs of the weak $r$-process, with an overabundance of the
lighter neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr). To explain the abundance pattern
observed in ET0097, we explore the possibility that this star was enriched by
primordial stars. In addition to the detailed abundances for ET0097, we present
estimates and upper limits for C abundances in 85 other stars in Sculptor
derived from CN molecular lines, including 11 stars with $\text{[Fe/H]}\leq-2$.
Combining these limits with observations from the literature, the fraction of
CEMP-no stars in Sculptor seems to be significantly lower than in the Galactic
halo.

conditions differ. The necessary and sufficient condition is given for the
minimal mass bridge to lie totally above (or below) deck. Furthermore this
condition depends only on material properties. If one ignores joint mass, and
considers only bridges above deck level, the optimal complexity (number of
elements in the bridge) tends toward infinity (producing a material continuum).
If joint mass is considered then the optimal complexity is finite. The optimal

therefore cheaper to build), and under reasonable material choices, yields the

Shen, Horowitz, and Teige. We study mainly equal mass systems leading to a
hypermassive neutron star (HMNS), and analyze in detail its structure and
dynamics. In order to exclude gauge artifacts, we introduce a novel coordinate
system used for post-processing. The results for our equal mass models show
that the strong radial oscillations of the HMNS modulate the instantaneous
frequency of the gravitational wave (GW) signal to an extend that leads to
separate peaks in the corresponding Fourier spectrum. In particular, the high
frequency peaks which are often attributed to combination frequencies can also
be caused by the modulation of the m=2 mode frequency in the merger phase. As a
consequence for GW data analysis, the offset of the high frequency peak does
not necessarily carry information about the radial oscillation frequency.
Further, the low frequency peak in our simulations is dominated by the
contribution of the plunge and the first 1-2 bounces. The amplitude of the
radial oscillations depends on the initial NS spin, which therefore has a
complicated influence on the spectrum. Another important result is that HMNSs
can consist of a slowly rotating core with an extended, massive envelope
rotating close to Keplerian velocity, contrary to the common notion that a
rapidly rotating core is necessary to prevent a prompt collapse. Finally, our
estimates on the amount of unbound matter show a dependency on the initial NS
spin, explained by the influence of the latter on the amplitude of radial
oscillations, which in turn cause shock waves.

discrete, point-like events while fields have purely continuous equations of
motion. A workaround is the use of effective theories like the Langevin
equation with the drawback of energy conservation violation. We present a new
method, which allows to model non-continuous interactions between particles and
scalar fields, allowing us to simulate scattering-like interactions which
exchange energy and momentum quanta between fields and particles obeying full
energy and momentum conservation and control over interaction strengths and
times. In this paper we apply this method to different model systems, starting
with a simple scalar harmonic oscillator which is damped by losing discrete
energy quanta. The second and third system is a scalar oscillator and a one
dimensional field which are both damped by discrete energy loss and which are
coupled to a stochastic force, leading to equilibrium states which correspond
to statistical Langevin-like systems. The last example is a scalar field in 3D
which is coupled to a microcanonical ensemble of particles by incorporating
particle production and annihilation processes. Obeying the detailed-balance
principle, the system equilibrates to thermal and chemical equilibrium with
dynamical fluctuations on the fields, generated dynamically by the discrete

inactive to a fluctuating active phase. Despite being known for several decades

generic on-shell forms. The basic idea is to extend the three-particle
amplitudes to the space of unphysical helicities keeping the dimension of the
related coupling constant fixed, and construct on-shell forms out of them. We
briefly discuss the analytic structure of the extended on-shell diagrams, both
at tree level and one loop. Furthermore, we propose an integration contour
which, applied to the relevant on-shell forms, allows to extract the
four-particle amplitudes in Lorentz signature at one loop. With this contour at
hand, we explicitly apply our procedure to this case obtaining the IR
divergences as poles in the deformation parameter space, as well as the correct
functional form for the finite term. This procedure provides a natural
regularization for generic on-shell diagrams.

The optimization formulation based on matrix factorization can be solved very
efficiently by standard algorithms in practice. However, due to the
non-convexity caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical
understanding of this formulation. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
guarantee for the factorization formulation to correctly recover the underlying
low-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those
in previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global
optima of a factorization formulation, and recover the true low-rank matrix. We
study the local geometry of a properly regularized factorization formulation
and prove that any stationary point in a certain local region is globally
optimal. A major difference of our work from the existing results is that we do
not need resampling in either the algorithm or its analysis. Compared to other
works on nonconvex optimization, one extra difficulty lies in analyzing
nonconvex constrained optimization when the constraint (or the corresponding
regularizer) is not ""consistent"" with the gradient direction. One technical
contribution is the perturbation analysis for non-symmetric matrix
factorization.

its covariance matrix, accounting for all noise sources and including
relativistic corrections. From the measured ACT 148 GHz PDF alone, we find

information about the planet's orbital period and size relative to the host
star. More recently, it has been demonstrated that a tight constraint on an
individual planet's eccentricity can sometimes be derived from the light curve
via the ""photoeccentric effect,"" the effect of a planet's eccentricity on the
shape and duration of its light curve. This has only been studied for large
planets and high signal-to-noise scenarios, raising the question of how well it
can be measured for smaller planets or low signal-to-noise cases. We explore
the limits of the photoeccentric effect over a wide range of planet parameters.
The method hinges upon measuring $g$ directly from the light curve, where $g$
is the ratio of the planet's speed (projected on the plane of the sky) during
transit to the speed expected for a circular orbit. We find that when the
signal-to-noise in the measurement of $g$ is $< 10$, the ability to measure
eccentricity with the photoeccentric effect decreases. We develop a ""rule of
thumb"" that for per-point relative photometric uncertainties $\sigma = \{
10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5} \}$, the critical values of planet-star radius ratio
are $R_p / R_\star \approx \{ 0.1, 0.05, 0.03 \}$ for Kepler-like 30-minute
integration times. We demonstrate how to predict the best-case uncertainty in
eccentricity that can be found with the photoeccentric effect for any light
curve. This clears the path to study eccentricities of individual planets of
various sizes in the Kepler sample and future transit surveys.

relativistically blurred reflection that is commonly detected from the
accretion discs of AGN by the coronae of energetic particles believed to give
rise to the powerful X-ray continua by the inverse-Compton scattering of
thermal seed photons from the disc. Recent measurements of the emissivity
profiles of accretion discs as well as reverberation time lags between the
primary X-ray continuum and the reflection suggest that this corona is situated
at a low height above the disc and extends radially, tens of gravitational
radii over the disc surface, hence should also Compton scatter the reflected
X-rays. We find that the detection of blurred reflection from as close in as
the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of maximally rotating black holes
is consistent with such coronae, but requires that the corona be patchy,
consisting perhaps of a number of isolated flares throughout the region.
Considering only the requirement that it be possible to detect reflection from
the ISCO, we find that at any given moment, the covering fraction of the inner
part of the accretion disc by the corona needs to be less than 85 per cent,
though allowing for the detection of 'reflection-dominated' spectra in which
the total reflected flux exceeds that seen in the continuum requires covering
fractions as low as 50 or 25 per cent.

mediators of a broken dark U(1) gauge theory that kinetically mixes with the
Standard Model (SM) hypercharge. Dark photons can be detected in the exotic
decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, h -> Z Z_D -> 4l, and in Drell-Yan events, pp
-> Z_D -> ll. If the dark U(1) is broken by a hidden-sector Higgs mechanism,
then mixing between the dark and SM Higgs bosons also allows the exotic decay h
-> Z_D Z_D -> 4l. We show that the 14 TeV LHC and a 100 TeV proton-proton
collider provide powerful probes of both exotic Higgs decay channels. In the
case of kinetic mixing alone, direct Drell-Yan production offers the best
sensitivity to Z_D, and can probe epsilon >~ 9 x 10^(-4) (4 x 10^(-4)) at the
HL-LHC (100 TeV pp collider). The exotic Higgs decay h -> Z Z_D offers slightly
weaker sensitivity, but both measurements are necessary to distinguish the
kinetically mixed dark photon from other scenarios. If Higgs mixing is also
present, then the decay h -> Z_D Z_D can allow sensitivity to the Z_D for
epsilon >~ 10^(-9) - 10^(-6) (10^(-10) - 10^(-7)) for the mass range 2 m_mu <
m_(Z_D) < m_h/2 by searching for displaced dark photon decays. We also compare
the Z_D sensitivity at pp colliders to the indirect, but model-independent,
sensitivity of global fits to electroweak precision observables. We perform a
global electroweak fit of the dark photon model, substantially updating
previous work in the literature. Electroweak precision measurements at LEP,
Tevatron, and the LHC exclude epsilon as low as 3 x 10^(-2). Sensitivity can be

of their mixing with the bulk. In the presence of disorder, the edge states may
be stabilized when the bulk is localized or destabilized when the bulk is

a dimensionless crossing-time and the virial mass. We compared our results with
those obtained for a sample of triplets from the catalogue ""Isolated Triplets

a mock catalogue in order to compare real and projected configurations, and to
estimate the three dimensional dynamical parameters of the triple systems. We
found that the SDSS-triplets prefer alignment configurations while K-triplets

conclude that the SDSS-triplets, K-triplets and Compact Groups present a
similar behaviour comprising compact systems with low crossing-time values,

the smooth dark halo (DH) lensing contributions. While lensing usually
constrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocity
dispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster members
breaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints on
single galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as a
result, (b) refine the constraints on the DM-only map, a high-end goal of lens
modelling. The knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves the
fit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of the
rms. The constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the DH, while
for the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, including
the galaxy halo truncation radius. For an L$^*$ galaxy with M$^*_B$=-20.96, for
example, we obtain best fitting truncation radius r$^*_{tr}=20.5^{+9.6}_{-6.7}$

the surface brightness reconstruction of the southern giant arc, we improve the
constraints on r$_{tr}$ of two nearby cluster members, which have measured
velocity dispersions, by more than ~30%. We estimate the stripped mass for
these two galaxies, getting results that are consistent with numerical
simulations. In the future, we plan to apply this analysis to other galaxy
clusters for which velocity dispersions of member galaxies are available.

class of extended off-plane gamma-ray sources. The distance to HESS J1507-622
is the key parameter to constrain the source's most important properties, such
as age and energetics of the relativistic particle population.
  In this article we report on results of follow-up observations of the
potential X-ray counterpart with Suzaku. We present detailed measurements of
its spectral parameters and find a high absorbing hydrogen column density,
compatible with the total amount of Galactic gas in this direction. In
comparisons to measurements and models of the Galactic three-dimensional gas
distribution we show that the potential X-ray counterpart of HESS J1507-622 may
be located at the far end of the Galaxy. If the gamma-ray source is indeed
physically connected to this extended X-ray source, this in turn would place
the object outside of the usual distribution of Galactic VHE gamma-ray
emitters.

current bounds coming from non-Gaussianity measurements. Here we consider
additional aspects related to the measurement of B-modes that may provide
additional leverage to constrain the sound speed parametrizing non-canonical

the spectral index of scalar perturbations $\alpha$. We also study how other
parameters related to the ultra violet completion of inflation modify the
dependence of $r$ on $c_s$. For instance, we find that heavy degrees of freedom
interacting with curvature fluctuations generically tend to make the constraint

an aura and (possibly) spray. The core is due to primary protons which suffer
multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) and slow down by multiple collisions with
atomic electrons (Bethe-Bloch theory). The halo is due to charged secondaries,
many of them protons, from elastic interactions with H, elastic and inelastic
interactions with O, and nonelastic interactions with O. We show that the halo
radius is roughly one third of the beam range. The aura is due to neutral
secondaries (neutrons and gamma rays). Spray denotes dose, avoidable in
principle, coming in from the beam line.
  We have measured the absolute dose at 177 MeV using a test beam in a water
tank. The beam monitor was a PPIC 'proton counter' and the field IC a dose
calibrated Exradin T1. We took depth-dose scans at ten displacements from the
beam axis ranging from 0 to 10 cm. The dose spans five orders of magnitude, and
the transition from halo to aura is obvious.
  We present model-dependent (MD) and model-independent (MI) fits to these
data. The MD fit has 25 parameters, and the goodness of fit (rms
(measurement/fit) - 1) is 15%. The MI fit uses cubic spline fits in depth and
radius. The goodness of fit is 9%. This fit is more portable and conceptually
simpler.
  We discuss the prevalent parameterization of the core/halo originated by the
PSI group. We argue that its use of T(w), a mass stopping power which includes
energy deposited by nuclear secondaries, is incorrect. The electromagnetic
(Bethe-Bloch) mass stopping power should be used instead. In consequence,
'Bragg peak chamber' measurements and associated corrections are, in our view,
irrelevant. Furthermore, using T(w) leads to spurious excess dose on the axis
of the core around midrange, which may be significant in fields involving
relatively few pencil beams.

torque that is responsible for high switching error probability in elliptical
nanomagnet geometries. The absence of this torque in cylindrical magnets
portends lower error rates, but our simulations show that the error rate
actually does not improve significantly compared to elliptical magnets while
the switching becomes unacceptably slow. Here, we show that dipole coupled
nanomagnetic logic can offer relatively high reliability (switching error
probability < 10^-8), moderate clock speed (~ 100 MHz) and 2-3 orders of

energy barrier of the magnet is increased to at least ~5.5 eV to allow
engineering a stronger dipole coupling between neighboring nanomagnets.

360-degree digitalization of discontinuous (piecewise-continuous) solids. The
main advantage of using this co-phased 2-projectors profilometer is that
self-occluding shadows due to discontinuities are solved efficiently. Previous
1-projector, 1-camera 360-degree profilometers generate self-occluding shadows
at the solid discontinuities. Yet another advantage of our new profilometer is
a trivial line-by-line fringe-data assembling from all 360-degree perspectives.

camera. Higher resolutions and less-noisy phase demodulation are trivial by
increasing the angular-resolution and phase-step number without any change on
our co-phased profilometer. This profilometer may be used to digitize complex

determine the analytic planar vector fields $X$ in such a way that for a given
Liapunov function
\[V=V(x,y)=\dfrac{\lambda}{2}(x^2+y^2)+\displaystyle\sum_{j=3}^{\infty}
H_j(x,y),\] where $H_j=H_j(x,y)$ are homogenous polynomial of degree $j,$ the
following equation holds
\[X(V)=\displaystyle\sum_{j=3}^{\infty}V_j(x^2+y^2)^{j+1}, \] where $V_j$ for
$j\in\mathbb{N}$ are the Liapunov constants. In particular we study the case
when the origin is a center and the vector field is polynomial.

solving the renormalization problem does not immediately traduce into having a
rigorous construction of the corresponding theory. Here, we start developing an
approach to renormalization based on cylinder measures. After explaining how
renormalization can be mathematically better understood in terms of them, we
argue that a renormalization problem can, under certain hypothesis, be reduced
to that of the corresponding strongly coupled theory, and obtain a family of

introduced and studied the formal loop space of a scheme $X$. It is an
algebraic version of the space of smooth loops in a differentiable manifold.
  We generalize their construction to higher dimensional loops. To any scheme
$X$ -- not necessarily smooth -- we associate $\mathcal L^d(X)$, the space of
loops of dimension $d$. We prove it has a structure of (derived) Tate scheme --
ie its tangent is a Tate module: it is infinite dimensional but behaves nicely
enough regarding duality. We also define the bubble space $\mathcal B^d(X)$, a
variation of the loop space. We prove that $\mathcal B^d(X)$ is endowed with a
natural symplectic form as soon as $X$ has one.
  To prove our results, we develop a theory of Tate objects in a stable
$(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal C$. We also prove that the non-connective
K-theory of $\mathbf{Tate}(\mathcal C)$ is the suspension of that of $\mathcal
C$.
  The last chapter is aimed at a different problem: we study there the
existence of a Lie structure on the tangent of a derived Artin stack. This in
particular applies to not necessarily smooth schemes.
  Throughout this thesis, we will use the tools of $(\infty,1)$-categories and
symplectic derived algebraic geometry.

the model simulation computing time is approximately 50% of that of the finite

a fully screened regime where we recover $\Lambda$CDM to high precision, an
unscreened regime where the fifth force is in full operation, and, a partially
screened regime where screening occurs in the inner part of a halo, but the

crucial role in the study of approximate counting. It has been conjectured that
there is no fully polynomial-time (randomized) approximation scheme

maximum degree of $6$ is already as hard as the general problem. In this paper,
we obtain a surprising tractability result for a family of #BIS instances. We
design a very simple deterministic fully polynomial-time approximation scheme

There is no restriction for the degrees on the other side, which do not even
have to be bounded by a constant. Previously, FPTAS was only known for

Galerkin (DG) finite element method on space-time adaptive Cartesian meshes

Notoriously, the original DG method produces strong oscillations in the
presence of discontinuous solutions and several types of limiters have been
introduced over the years to cope with this problem. Following the innovative
idea recently proposed in \cite{Dumbser2014}, the discrete solution within the
troubled cells is \textit{recomputed} by scattering the DG polynomial at the
previous time step onto a suitable number of sub-cells along each direction.
Relying on the robustness of classical finite volume WENO schemes, the sub-cell
averages are recomputed and then gathered back into the DG polynomials over the
main grid. In this paper this approach is implemented for the first time within
a space-time adaptive AMR framework in two and three space dimensions, after
assuring the proper averaging and projection between sub-cells that belong to
different levels of refinement. The combination of the sub-cell resolution with
the advantages of AMR allows for an unprecedented ability in resolving even the
finest details in the dynamics of the fluid. The spectacular resolution
properties of the new scheme have been shown through a wide number of test
cases performed in two and in three space dimensions, both for the Euler
equations of compressible gas dynamics and for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
equations.

variation of TR $n_{ch}$ or $p_t$ yields relative to a trigger condition
(leading hadron or jet $p_t$). An alternative approach is 2D trigger-associated
(TA) correlations on hadron transverse momentum $p_t$ or rapidity $y_t$ in
which all hadrons from all p-p events are included. Based on a two-component
(soft+hard) model (TCM) of TA correlations a jet-related TA hard component is
isolated. Contributions to the hard component from the triggered dijet and from
secondary dijets (MPI) can be distinguished, including their azimuth dependence
relative to the trigger direction. Measured $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p fragmentation
functions and a minimum-bias jet spectrum from 200 GeV p-\=p collisions are
convoluted to predict the 2D hard component of TA correlations as a function of
p-p collision multiplicity. The agreement between QCD predictions and TA
correlation data is quantitative, confirming a dijet interpretation for the TCM
hard component. The TA azimuth dependence is inconsistent with conventional UE
assumptions.

existence of a binary companion has been hinted by indirect observational

identified. We have examined archival Hubble Space Telescope images of
IRC+10216, and find that the images taken in 2011 exhibit dramatic changes in
its innermost region from those taken at earlier epochs. The scattered light is
more spread out in 2011. After proper motion correction, the brightest peak in
2011 is close to, but not coincident with, the dominant peak in previous
epochs. A fainter point-like object was revealed at about 0.5 arcsec from this

caused by dissipation of intervening circumstellar dust, as indicated by the
brightening trend in the lightcurve extracted from the Catalina photometric
survey. We tentatively identify the brightest peak in 2011 as the primary star
of IRC+10216 and the fainter point-like source as a companion. The cause of
non-detections of the companion candidate in earlier epochs is uncertain. These

entanglement of formation and the quantum discord. We derive analytic
expressions of the entanglement-death time in two special cases: when the
reservoirs for each mode are identical, as well as when a single reservoir acts
on the first mode only. In the latter configuration, we show that all the pure
Gaussian states lose their entanglement at the same time determined solely by
the field-reservoir coupling. Also investigated is the evolution of the
Gaussian quantum discord for the same choices of thermal baths. We notice that
the discord can increase in time above its initial value in a special
situation, namely, when it is defined by local measurements on the attenuated
mode and the input state is mixed. This enhancement of discord is stronger for
zero-temperature reservoirs and increases with the input degree of mixing.

is (in general) not possible because of the unknown orbital plane inclination.
Even when the mass of the visible star can be measured, only a lower limit can
be placed on the mass of the unseen companion. However, since these inclination
angles should be isotropically distributed, for a large enough, unbiased
sample, the companion mass distribution can be deconvolved from the
distribution of observables. In this work, we construct a hierarchical
probabilistic model to infer properties of unseen companion stars given
observations of the orbital period and projected radial velocity of the primary
star. We apply this model to three mock samples of low-mass white dwarfs
(LMWDs, $M\lesssim0.45~\Msun$) and a sample of post-common-envelope binaries.
We use a mixture of two Gaussians to model the WD and neutron star (NS)
companion mass distributions. Our model successfully recovers the initial
parameters of these test data sets. We then apply our model to 55 WDs in the
extremely low-mass (ELM) WD Survey. Our maximum a posteriori model for the WD
companion population has a mean mass $\mu_{\rm WD} = 0.74~\Msun$, with a
standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm WD} = 0.24~\Msun$. Our model constrains the NS
companion fraction $f_{\rm NS}$ to be $<$16\% at 68\% confidence. We make
samples from the posterior distribution publicly available so that future

taken into account. Raman active, zero-momentum inter Landau level excitations
in graphene are sensitive to electron-electron interactions due to the
non-applicability of the Kohn theorem in this system, with a clearly
non-parabolic dispersion relation.

schemes, one can notice obvious relations among the sine-values of the CP
phases in those schemes. Using the relations, we establish a few
parametrization-independent equations, by which the matrix elements of the CKM
matrix can be completely fixed up to a universal parameter. If it is true, we
expect that there should exist a hidden symmetry in the nature which determines
the relations. Moreover, it requires a universal parameter, naturally it would
be the famous Jarlskog invariant which is also parametrization independent.
Thus the four parameters (three mixing angles and one CP phase) of the CKM
matrix are not free, but determined by the symmetry and the universal
parameter. As we generalize the rules to the PMNS matrix for neutrino mixing,
the CP phase of the lepton sector is predicted to be within a range of $0\sim
59^\circ$ centered at $39^\circ$ (in the P$_a$ parametrization) which will be
tested in the future experiments.

environment. To understand the effect of the dispersal rate $d$, the original
habitat radius $h_0$, the spreading capability $\mu$, and the initial density
$u_0$ on the dynamics of the problem, we divide the time-periodic habitat into
two cases: favorable habitat and unfavorable habitat. By choosing $d$, $h_0$,
$\mu$ and $u_0$ as variable parameters, we obtain a spreading-vanishing
dichotomy and sharp criteria for the spreading and vanishing in time-periodic
environment. We introduce the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_1(d, \alpha,
\gamma, h(t), T)$ to determine the spreading and vanishing of the invasive
species. We prove that if $\lambda_1(d, \alpha, \gamma, h_0, T)\leq 0$, the
spreading must happen; while if $\lambda_1(d, \alpha, \gamma, h_0, T)> 0$, the
spreading is also possible. Our results show that the species in the favorable
habitat can establish itself if the dispersal rate is slow or the occupying
habitat is large. In an unfavorable habitat, the species vanishes if the
initial density of the species is small, while survive successfully if the
initial value is big. Moreover, when spreading occurs, the asymptotic spreading
speed of the free boundary is determined.

describing Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in dark energy background. It is to be
regarded as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is embedded into the dark energy
solution producing Reissner-Nordstrom-dark energy black hole. We find that the
space-time geometry of Reissner-Nordstrom-dark energy solution is Petrov type
$D$ in the classification of space-times. It is also shown that the embedded
space-time possesses an energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field
interacting with the dark energy having negative pressure. We find the
energy-momentum tensor for dark energy violates the the strong energy condition
due to the negative pressure, whereas that of the electromagnetic field obeys
the strong energy condition. It is shown that the time-like vector field for an
observer in the Reissner-Nordstrom-dark energy space is expanding,
accelerating, shearing and non-rotating. We investigate the surface gravity of
the horizons for the embedded dark energy black hole. The characteristic
properties of relativistic dark energy based on the de Sitter solution is
discussed in an appendix.

self-organization arises via mechanisms akin to those in the Kuramoto model for
synchronization of coupled oscillators. In addition, our simulations show that
the phase equations evolve to a broadband phase-locked state, analogous to the
soliton formation process in the LLE. Our simplified equations intuitively
explain the origin of the pump phase offset in soliton- modelocked parametric
frequency combs. They also predict that the phase of the intracavity field
undergoes an anti-symmetrization that precedes phase synchronization, and they
clarify the role of chaotic states in soliton formation in parametric combs.

modeled by random telegraph processes, which act either collectively

an exact closed system of first-order linear differential equations with
constant coefficients, for the average density matrix elements and for their

and demonstrated numerically that the uncorrelated fluctuations of the protein

feedback, we demonstrate the existence of chimera states. The domains of
coherence and incoherence that are typical for chimera states are found to
exist for the amplitude, phase, and inversion of the coupled lasers. These
chimera states defy several of the previously established existence criteria.
While chimera states in phase oscillators generally demand nonlocal coupling,
large system sizes, and specially prepared initial conditions, we find chimera
states that are stable for global coupling in a network of only four coupled
lasers for random initial conditions. The existence is linked to a regime of
multistability between the synchronous steady state and asynchronous periodic
solutions. We show that amplitude-phase coupling, a concept common in different
fields, is necessary for the formation of the chimera states.
