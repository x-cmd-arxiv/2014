  Spaces",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With his Clifford algebra of differential forms, Kaehler's algebra addresses
the overlooked manifestation of symmetry in the solutions of exterior systems.
In this algebra, solutions with a given symmetry are members of left ideals
generated by corresponding idempotents. These combine with phase factors to
take care of all the dependence of the solution on $x^{i}$ and $% dx^{i}$ for
each $\partial /\partial x^{i}=0$ symmetry. The maximum number of idempotents
(each for a one-parameter group) that can, therefore, go into a solution is the
dimensionality $n$ of the space. This number is further limited by
non-commutativity of idempotents.
  We consider the tensor product of Kaehler algebra with tangent Clifford
algebra, i.e. of valuedness. It has a commutative subalgebra of ""mirror
elements"", i.e. where the valuedness is dual to the differential form (like in
$dx\mathbf{i}$, but not in $dx\mathbf{j}$). It removes the aforementioned
limitation in the number of idempotent factors that can simultaneously go into
a solution.
  In the Kaehler calculus, which is based on the Kaehler algebra, total angular
momentum is linear in its components, even it is not valued in tangent algebra.
In particular, it is not a vector operator.
  We carry Kaehler's treatment over to the aforementioned commutative algebra.
Non-commutativity thus ceases to be a limiting factor in the formation of
products of idempotents representing each a one-parameter symmetry. The
interplay of factors that emerges in the expanded set of such products is
inimical to operator theory. For practical reasons, we stop at products
involving three one-parameter idempotents ---henceforth call ternary--- even
though the dimensionality of the all important spacetime manifold allows for
four of them.

interaction between topography and sediment transport. Their characteristics
have been so far related to reptation transport caused by the impacts on the
ground of grains entrained by the wind into saltation. By means of direct
numerical simulations of grains interacting with a wind flow, we show that the
instability turns out to be driven by resonant grain trajectories, whose length
is close to a ripple wavelength and whose splash leads to a mass displacement
towards the ripple crests. The pattern selection results from a compromise
between this destabilizing mechanism and a diffusive downslope transport which
stabilizes small wavelengths. The initial wavelength is set by the ratio of the
sediment flux and the erosion/deposition rate, a ratio which increases linearly
with the wind velocity. We show that this scaling law, in agreement with
experiments, originates from an interfacial layer separating the saltation zone
from the static sand bed, where momentum transfers are dominated by mid-air
collisions. Finally, we provide quantitative support for the use the
propagation of these ripples as a proxy for remote measurements of sediment
transport.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). In principle, a number of suggested
physical mechanisms can reproduce their power spectral properties, thus more
powerful diagnostics which preserve phase are required to discern between
different models. In this paper, we first find for two Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) observations of the BHB GRS 1915+105 that the QPO has a well
defined average waveform. That is, the phase difference and amplitude ratios
between the first two harmonics vary tightly around a well defined mean. This
enables us to reconstruct QPO waveforms in each energy channel, in order to
constrain QPO phase-resolved spectra. We fit these phase resolved spectra
across 16 phases with a model including Comptonisation and reflection (Gaussian
and smeared edge components) to find strong spectral pivoting and a modulation
in the iron line equivalent width. The latter indicates the observed reflection
fraction is changing throughout the QPO cycle. This points to a geometric QPO
origin, although we note that the data presented here do not entirely rule out
an alternative interpretation of variable disc ionisation state. We also see
tentative hints of modulations in the iron line centroid and width which,
although not statistically significant, could result from a non-azimuthally
symmetric QPO mechanism.

problems decomposition and for producing tight lower bounds to the optimal

on large scale mixed--integer programs with a specific structure that is of

implement and the method is amenable to distributed computations. We also

partition function of the polymer chain with a fixed radius of gyration is
described in the framework of the mean-field approximation. The contributions
of polymer-cosolvent and the cosolvent-cosolvent interactions in the total
Helmholtz free energy are treated also within the mean-field approximation. For
convenience we separate the system volume on two parts: the volume occupied by
the polymer chain expressed through its gyration volume and the bulk solution.
Considering the equilibrium between the two subvolumes we obtain the total
Helmholtz free energy of the solution as a function of radius of gyration and
the cosolvent concentration within gyration volume. After minimization of the
total Helmholtz free energy with respect to its arguments we obtain a system of
coupled equations with respect to the radius of gyration of the polymer chain
and the cosolvent concentration within the gyration volume. Varying the
interaction strength between polymer and cosolvent we show that the polymer
collapse occurs in two cases - either when the interaction between polymer and

effects could be relevant for different disciplines where conformational
transitions of macromolecules in the presence of a cosolvent are of interest,

four of the ten double-mode stars show large-amplitude Blazhko modulation of

unique, Blazhko RRd stars is given. While the P1/P0 period ratio is normal, and
the overtone mode is dominant in the other RRd stars of the cluster, the period
ratio is anomalous and the fundamental mode has a larger (or similar) mean
amplitude than the overtone has in Blazhko RRd stars. The modulations of the
fundamental and overtone modes are synchronized only in one of the Blazhko RRd
stars. No evidence of any connection between the modulations of the modes in
the other three stars is found. The Blazhko modulation accounts, at least
partly, for the previously reported amplitude and period changes of these
stars. Contrary to the $\sim50$$%$ Blazhko statistics of RRab and RRd stars,
Blazhko modulation occurs only in 10$%$ of the overtone variables in M3. Four
of the five Blazhko RRc stars are bright, evolved objects, and one has a
similar period and brightness as Blazhko RRd stars have. The regions of the
instability strip with high and low occurrence rate of the Blazhko modulation
overlap with the regions populated by first- and second-generation stars

potentials on 3D lattices with multiple defects and having non-rectangular
geometries, based on rank-structured tensor representations. This is a
significant generalization of our recent technique for the grid-based summation
of electrostatic potentials on the rectangular $L\times L \times L$ lattices by
using the canonical tensor decompositions and yielding the $O(L)$ computational
complexity instead of $O(L^3)$ by traditional approaches. The resulting lattice
sum is calculated as a Tucker or canonical representation whose directional
vectors are assembled by the 1D summation of the generating vectors for the
shifted reference tensor, once precomputed on large $N\times N \times N$
representation grid in a 3D bounding box. The tensor numerical treatment of
defects is performed in an algebraic way by simple summation of tensors in the
canonical or Tucker formats. To diminish the considerable increase in the
tensor rank of the resulting potential sum the $\varepsilon$-rank reduction
procedure is applied based on the generalized reduced higher-order SVD scheme.
For the reduced higher-order SVD approximation to a sum of canonical/Tucker
tensors, we prove the stable error bounds in the relative norm in terms of
discarded singular values of the side matrices. The required storage scales
linearly in the 1D grid-size, $O(N)$, while the numerical cost is estimated by
$O(N L)$. Numerical tests confirm the efficiency of the presented tensor
summation method: we demonstrate that a sum of millions of Newton kernels on a
3D lattice with defects/impurities can be computed in seconds in Matlab
implementation.

studying the finite-volume energy spectra obtained from dynamical lattice QCD
calculations. Using a large basis of interpolating operators, including both
those resembling a $q\bar{q}$ construction and those resembling a pair of
mesons with relative momentum, a reliable excited-state spectrum can be
obtained. Working at ${m_\pi=391\,\mathrm{MeV}}$, we find a gradual increase in
the $J^P=0^+$ $\pi K$ phase-shift which may be identified with a broad scalar
resonance that couples strongly to $\pi K$ and weakly to $\eta K$. The
low-energy behavior of this amplitude suggests a virtual bound-state that may
be related to the $\kappa$ resonance. A bound state with $J^P=1^-$ is found
very close to the $\pi K$ threshold energy, whose coupling to the $\pi K$
channel is compatible with that of the experimental $K^\star(892)$. Evidence is
found for a narrow resonance in $J^P=2^+$. Isospin--3/2 $\pi K$ scattering is
also studied and non-resonant phase-shifts spanning the whole elastic
scattering region are obtained.

how link state impacts the allocation of power between these two distinct

the largest transmission rate region. We analytically determine the link-state

interesting trend: when the user-to-relay link is marginally stronger than the
direct link, it is optimal to use only independent coding. In this case, the
relay need not use full power. However, for larger user-to-relay link gains,
the relay must supplement independent coding with block Markov coding to
achieve the largest rate region. These link-state regimes are important for the
application of two-way relaying in 5G networks, such as in D2D mode or

Universe and their origin still remains uncertain. Observational evidence
favors the association with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole
(NS-BH) binary mergers. Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet
launched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent
observations have revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray
afterglows with durations $\sim10^2\!-\!10^5~\mathrm{s}$, suggesting continuous
energy injection from a long-lived central engine, which is incompatible with
the short ($\lesssim1~\mathrm{s}$) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system.
The formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer
spin-down timescales, can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious
doubts on whether a relativistic jet can be launched at merger. Here we present
a novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after
the collapse of a supramassive NS. Early differential rotation and subsequent
spin-down emission generate an optically thick environment around the NS
consisting of a photon-pair nebula and an outer shell of baryon-loaded ejecta.
While the jet easily drills through this environment, spin-down radiation
diffuses outwards on much longer timescales and accumulates a delay that allows
the SGRB to be observed before (part of) the long-lasting X-ray signal. By
analyzing diffusion timescales for a wide range of physical parameters, we find
delays that can generally reach $\sim10^5~\mathrm{s}$, compatible with
observations. The success of this fundamental test makes this ""time-reversal""
scenario an attractive alternative to current SGRB models.

mass accretion rate. Recently, Zamaninasab (2014) report that the jet magnetic
flux and accretion disc luminosity are tightly correlated over 7 orders of
magnitude for a sample of 76 radio-loud active galaxies, concluding that the
data are explained by the MAD mode of accretion. Their analysis assumes
radiatively efficient accretion, and their sample consists primarily of
radiatively efficient sources, while GRMHD simulations of MAD thus far have
been carried out in the radiatively inefficient regime. We propose a model to
interpret MAD systems in the context of multiple accretion regimes, and apply
it to the sample in Zamaninasab (2014), along with additional radiatively
inefficient sources from archival data. We show that most of the radiatively
inefficient radio-loud galaxies are consistent with being MAD systems. Assuming
the MAD relationship found in radiatively inefficient simulations holds at
other accretion regimes, a significant fraction of our sample can be candidates
for MAD systems. Future GRMHD simulations have yet to verify the validity of
this assumption.

regulating star formation, using ~350 nearby galaxies observed by the mJy
Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm (mJIVE) survey. The >10^7 K brightness
temperature required for an mJIVE detection cannot be achieved via star
formation alone, allowing us to unambiguously detect nearby radio AGN and study
their role in galaxy evolution. Radio AGN are an order of magnitude more common
in early-type galaxies (ETGs) than in their late-type counterparts. The
VLBI-detected ETGs in this study have a similar stellar mass distribution to
their undetected counterparts, are typically not the central galaxies of
clusters and exhibit merger fractions that are significantly higher than in the
average ETG. This suggests that these radio AGN (which have VLBI luminosities
>10^22 W Hz^-1) are primarily fuelled by mergers, and not by internal stellar
mass loss or cooling flows. Our radio AGN are a factor of ~3 times more likely
to reside in the UV-optical red sequence than the average ETG. Furthermore,
typical AGN lifetimes (a few 10^7 yr) are much shorter than the transit times
from blue cloud to red sequence (~1.5 Gyr). This indicates that the AGN are not
triggered promptly and appear several dynamical timescales into the associated
star formation episode, implying that they typically couple only to residual
gas, at a point where star formation has already declined significantly. While
evidence for AGN feedback is strong in systems where the black hole is fed by
the cooling of hot gas, AGN triggered by mergers appear not to strongly
regulate the associated star formation. The inability of the AGN to rapidly
quench merger-driven star formation is likely to make merging the dominant mode
of star formation in nearby ETGs, in line with evidence for minor mergers being
the primary driver of stellar mass growth in these systems.

physics effects in Higgs observables by means of effective dimension six
operators. Specifically, Higgs production in association with a high transverse
momentum jet has been suggested as a way to discriminate between operators that
modify the Higgs-top coupling and operators that induce an effective
Higgs-gluon coupling---a distinction that is hard to achieve with signal
strength measurements alone. With this article we would like to draw attention
to another source of new physics in Higgs+jet observables: the triple gluon
operator $O_{3g}$ (consisting of three factors of the gluon field strength
tensor). We compute the distortions of kinematic distributions in Higgs+jet
production at a 14 TeV LHC due to $O_{3g}$ and compare them with the
distortions due to dimension six operators involving the Higgs doublet. We find
that the transverse momentum, the jet rapidity and the difference between the
Higgs and jet rapidity are well suited to distinguish between the contributions
from $O_{3g}$ and those from other operators, and that the size of the
distortions are similar if the Wilson coefficients are of the same order as the
expected bounds from other observables. We conclude that a full analysis of new
physics in Higgs+jet observables must take the contributions from $O_{3g}$ into
account.

particular on the backreaction of complex structure moduli. In our setting, the
shift symmetry comes from a partial large complex structure limit of the
underlying type IIB orientifold or F-theory fourfold. The coefficient of the
inflaton term in the superpotential has to be tuned small to avoid conflict
with Kahler moduli stabilisation. To allow such a tuning, this coefficient
necessarily depends on further complex structure moduli. At large values of the
inflaton field, these moduli are then in danger of backreacting too strongly.
To avoid this, further tunings are necessary. In weakly coupled type IIB theory
at the orientifold point, implementing these tunings appears to be difficult if
not impossible. However, fourfolds or models with mobile D7-branes provide
enough structural freedom. We calculate the resulting inflaton potential and
study the feasibility of the overall tuning given the limited freedom of the
flux landscape. Our preliminary investigations suggest that, even imposing all
tuning conditions, the remaining choice of flux vacua can still be large enough
for such models to provide a promising path to large-field inflation in string
theory.

observed rather than convergence to equilibrium. Such fluctuations have been
empirically observed in the retail market for gasoline, in airline pricing and
in the online sale of consumer goods. Motivated by this, we study a model of
price competition in which an equilibrium rarely exists. We seek to analyze the
welfare, despite the nonexistence of an equilibrium, and present welfare
guarantees as a function of the market power of the sellers.
  We first study best response dynamics in markets with sellers that provide a
homogeneous good, and show that except for a modest number of initial rounds,
the welfare is guaranteed to be high. We consider two variations: in the first
the sellers have full information about the valuation of the buyer. Here we
show that if there are $n$ items available across all sellers and $n_{\max}$ is
the maximum number of items controlled by any given seller, the ratio of the
optimal welfare to the achieved welfare will be at most
$\log(\frac{n}{n-n_{\max}+1})+1$. As the market power of the largest seller
diminishes, the welfare becomes closer to optimal. In the second variation we
consider an extended model where sellers have uncertainty about the buyer's
valuation. Here we similarly show that the welfare improves as the market power
of the largest seller decreases, yet with a worse ratio of
$\frac{n}{n-n_{\max}+1}$. The exponential gap in welfare between the two
variations quantifies the value of accurately learning the buyer valuation.
  Finally, we show that extending our results to heterogeneous goods in general
is not possible. Even for the simple class of $k$-additive valuations, there
exists a setting where the welfare approximates the optimal welfare within any
non-zero factor only for $O(1/s)$ fraction of the time, where $s$ is the number
of sellers.

  The expansion of the spin network generating function is given in terms of a

a unique probe of cosmology from relatively low redshifts (z ~ 1) up through
the Epoch of Reionization (z ~ 8) and even beyond. To date, most work has
focused on recovering the spherically averaged power spectrum of the 21 cm
signal, since this approach maximizes the signal-to-noise in the initial
measurement. However, like galaxy surveys, the 21 cm signal is affected by
redshift space distortions, and is inherently anisotropic between the
line-of-sight and transverse directions. A measurement of this anisotropy can
yield unique cosmological information, potentially even isolating the matter
power spectrum from astrophysical effects. However, in interferometric
measurements, foregrounds also have an anisotropic footprint between the
line-of-sight and transverse directions: the so-called foreground ""wedge"".
Although foreground subtraction techniques are actively being developed, a
""foreground avoidance"" approach of simply ignoring contaminated modes has
arguably proven most successful to date. In this work, we analyze the effect of
this foreground anisotropy in recovering the redshift space distortion
signature in 21 cm measurements at both high and intermediate redshifts. We
find the foreground wedge corrupts nearly all of the redshift space signal for
even the largest proposed EoR experiments (HERA and the SKA), making
cosmological information unrecoverable without foreground subtraction. The
situation is somewhat improved at lower redshifts, where the redshift-dependent
mapping from observed coordinates to cosmological coordinates significantly
reduces the size of the wedge. Using only foreground avoidance, we find that a
large experiment like CHIME can place non-trivial constraints on cosmological
parameters.

analysis of PET data which is free from this compartmental assumption, we
propose a nonparametric deconvolution and analysis model for dynamic PET data

the possible deconvolved functions while still performing well when a linear
compartmental model setup is the true data generating mechanism. As the
deconvolution needs to be performed on only a relative small number of basis

is both robust to typical brain imaging noise levels while also being
computationally efficient. The new methodology is investigated through

interaction between ALA and PHE in bulk water is enthalpically dominated upon
confinement depending on the relative orientations between the side chains. In
the case of SER-ASN, hydrogen bonded configurations that are similar in bulk

observation that BP degradation occurs more rapidly on hydrophobic
octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers and on H-Si(111), versus
hydrophilic SiO2. For unencapsulated BP field-effect transistors, the ambient
degradation causes large increases in threshold voltage after 6 hours in
ambient, followed by a ~10^3 decrease in FET current on/off ratio and mobility
after 48 hours. Atomic layer deposited AlOx overlayers effectively suppress
ambient degradation, allowing encapsulated BP FETs to maintain high on/off
ratios of ~10^3 and mobilities of ~100 cm2/(V*s) for over two weeks in ambient.
This work shows that the ambient degradation of BP can be managed effectively
when the flakes are sufficiently passivated. In turn, our strategy for
enhancing BP environmental stability will accelerate efforts to implement BP in

from one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users. This results in
an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value
have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value. Existing
approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items
are small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if
good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with
unstructured content.
  We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of
items and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph'
constrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that
the presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible --
however this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage
of the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in
exploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of
recommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple
policies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.
  From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and
`strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the
same order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for
the worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon
settings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph.
Conversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly
sub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal.

execution and memory hierarchies have significant impact on running time and
need to be taken into account to get a reliable picture. One such example is
Quicksort: It has been demonstrated experimentally that under certain
conditions on the hardware the classically optimal balanced choice of the pivot
as median of a sample gets harmful. The reason lies in mispredicted branches
whose rollback costs become dominating.
  In this paper, we give the first precise analytical investigation of the
influence of pipelining and the resulting branch mispredictions on the
efficiency of (classic) Quicksort and Yaroslavskiy's dual-pivot Quicksort as
implemented in Oracle's Java 7 library. For the latter it is still not fully

prediction strategies, we give precise asymptotics for the expected number of

extrapolations outside the measured range. Most high-frequency extrapolations
use a power law, 1/$\omega^n$, transitioning to $1/\omega^{4}$ at a
considerably higher frequency and continuing this free-carrier extension to
infinity. The mid-range power law is adjusted to match the slope of the data
and to give pleasing curves, but the choice of power (usually between 0.5 and

outputs from probability measures. Many important machine learning and
statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning
and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as
hyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available
heuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the
problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice
only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have
to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our
knowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for
distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate
step (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the
distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple,
analytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution
regression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main
contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage
sampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched
with kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency
trade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one-stage
sampled minimax optimal rate [Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al.,

however, conjectured that $\Lambda\geq 0$, remarking, ""the new conjecture is a

consider a modified Newman's conjecture: $\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}} \Lambda_f \geq
0$, for $\mathcal{F}$ a family of $L$-functions.
  We extend their results by proving this modified Newman's conjecture for

elliptic curves with $p + 1$ points over $\mathbb{F}_p$. By the Weil
conjectures, this has either the maximum or minimum possible number of points
over $\mathbb{F}_{p^{2n}}$. The fact that $#E(\mathbb{F}_{p^{2n}})$ attains the

events from a quantum substratum. In this account, spacetime is not a
substantive manifold that becomes occupied with events; rather, spacetime
itself exists only in virtue of specific actualized events. This implies that
spacetime is discrete rather than continuous, and that properties attributed to
spacetime based on the notion of a continuum are idealizations that do not
apply to the real physical world. It is further noted that the transactional
picture of the emergence of spacetime can provide the quantum dynamics that
underlie the causal set approach as proposed by Sorkin and others.

related to the Robinson congruence. Since the topology appears in the lines of

evolution of their tendex and vortex lines. The correspondence between fields
of different spin results in analogous configurations based on the same

benchmark function as a variable parameter of the model and study a broad class
of functions instead of a individual target benchmark. We consider a multitude
of well-studied auction settings, and improve upon a few previous results.
  (1) Multi-unit auctions. Given a $\beta$-competitive unlimited supply
auction, the best previously known multi-unit auction is $2\beta$-competitive.
We design a $(1+\beta)$-competitive auction reducing the ratio from $4.84$ to
$3.24$. These results carry over to matroid and position auctions.
  (2) General downward-closed environments. We design a $6.5$-competitive
auction improving upon the ratio of $7.5$. Our auction is noticeably simpler
than the previous best one.
  (3) Unlimited supply online auctions. Our analysis yields an auction with a
competitive ratio of $4.12$, which significantly narrows the margin of
$[4,4.84]$ previously known for this problem.
  A particularly important tool in our analysis is a simple decomposition
lemma, which allows us to bound the competitive ratio against a sum of
benchmark functions. We use this lemma in a ""divide and conquer"" fashion by
dividing the target benchmark into the sum of simpler functions.

one of the main existing network management protocol i.e. Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP) with respect to the current network conditions. The
network traffic is growing at a high speed. When we talk about the networked
environment of cloud, the monitoring tool should be capable of handling the
traffic tribulations efficiently and represent a correct scenario of the
network condition. The proposed Model Cloud Network Management Model provides a
comprehensive solution to manage the growing traffic in cloud and trying to
improve communication of manager and agents as in SNMP (the traditional TCP IP
network management protocol). Firstly CNMM concentrates on reduction of packet
exchange between manager and agent. Secondly it eliminates the counter problems
exist in SNMP by having periodic updates from agent without querying by the
manager. For better management we are including managers using virtualized
technology. CNMM is a proposed model with efficient communication, secure
packet delivery and reduced traffic. Though the proposed model supposed to
manage the cloud traffic in a better and efficient way, the model is still a
theoretical study, its implementation and results are yet to discover. The
model however is the first step towards development of supported algorithms and
protocol. Our further study will concentrate on development of supported

size and dielectric decrement. At high surface potential, both mechanisms can
cause saturation of the counter-ion concentration near a charged surface. The
modified Grahame equation and differential capacitance are derived analytically
for a general expression of a permittivity epsilon(n) that depends on the local
ion concentration, n, and under the assumption that the co-ions are fully
depleted from the surface. The concentration at counter-ion saturation is found
for any epsilon(n), and a criterion predicting which of the two mechanisms
(steric vs. dielectric decrement) is the dominant one is obtained. At low
salinity, the differential capacitance as function of surface potential has two
peaks (so-called camel-shape). Each of these two peaks is connected to a
saturation of counter-ion concentration caused either by dielectric decrement
or by their finite size. Because these effects depend mainly on the counter-ion
concentration at the surface proximity, for opposite surface-potential polarity
either the cations or anions play the role of counter-ions, resulting in an
asymmetric camel-shape. At high salinity, we obtain and analyze the crossover
in the differential capacitance from a double-peak shape to a uni-modal one.
Finally, several nonlinear models of the permittivity decrement are considered,
and we predict that the concentration at dielectrophoretic saturation shifts to
higher concentration than those obtained by the linear decrement model.

density wave (CDW) order in the pseudogap phase. Theoretical proposals can be
divided into two classes: one assumes the underlying Fermi surface without CDW
as a conventional large surface; the other assumes small hole-like Fermi
pockets. In both scenarios, we theoretically study the quantum oscillation and
find three evenly spaced peaks in the oscillation spectra. The central dominant
peak is induced by the CDW order. Its effective mass is strongly enhanced as
the CDW vanishes in agreement with experiments. But the two scenarios have
different understandings of the subdominant satellite peaks. In the
large-surface scenario they are induced by the interlayer tunneling between the
bilayer CuO$_{2}$ planes. Their effective masses are also enhanced with
descreasing CDW. In the small-pocket scenario one of the subdominant peaks
comes from the original small Fermi pockets of the pseudogap state. Its
effective mass is nearly independent of the CDW strength and increases
monotonically with the doping. We propose future quantum oscillation
experiments to test these different predictions and thus to clarify the
underlying Fermi surface structure of the pseudogap state.

pure states in quantum physics, are extended to locally normal states on
funnels of type I$_\infty$ factors. Such funnels are used in the description of
infinite systems, appearing for example in quantum field theory or in quantum
statistical mechanics; their respective constituents are interpreted as
algebras of observables localized in an increasing family of nested spacetime
regions. Given a generic reference state (expectation functional) on a funnel,
e.g, a ground state or a thermal equilibrium state, it is shown that
irrespective of the global type of this state all of its excitations, generated
by the adjoint action of elements of the funnel, can coherently be superimposed
in a meaningful manner. Moreover, these states are the extreme points of their
convex hull and as such are analogues of pure states. As further support of
this analogy, transition probabilities are defined, complete families of
orthogonal states are exhibited and a one-to-one correspondence between the
states and families of minimal projections on a Hilbert space is established.
The physical interpretation of these quantities relies on a concept of
primitive observables. It extends the familiar framework of observable algebras
and avoids some counter intuitive features of that setting. Primitive
observables admit a consistent statistical interpretation of corresponding
measurements and their impact on states is described by a variant of the von
Neumann-L\""uders projection postulate.

and multi-electrode arrays, enable recordings of spiking activity from hundreds
of neurons simultaneously. Of primary importance in systems neuroscience is the
identification of cell assemblies: groups of neurons that cooperate in some
form within the recorded population.
  New Method: We introduce a simple, integrated framework for the detection of
cell-assemblies from spiking data without a priori assumptions about the size
or number of groups present. We define a biophysically-inspired measure to
extract a directed functional connectivity matrix between both excitatory and
inhibitory neurons based on their spiking history. The resulting network
representation is analyzed using the Markov Stability framework, a graph
theoretical method for community detection across scales, to reveal groups of
neurons that are significantly related in the recorded time-series at different
levels of granularity.
  Results and comparison with existing methods: Using synthetic spike-trains,
including simulated data from leaky-integrate-and-fire networks, our method is
able to identify important patterns in the data such as hierarchical structure
that are missed by other standard methods. We further apply the method to
experimental data from retinal ganglion cells of mouse and salamander, in which
we identify cell-groups that correspond to known functional types, and to
hippocampal recordings from rats exploring a linear track, where we detect
place cells with high fidelity.
  Conclusions: We present a versatile method to detect neural assemblies in
spiking data applicable across a spectrum of relevant scales that contributes
to understanding spatio-temporal information gathered from systems neuroscience
experiments.

distinctive processes, $B_- \rightarrow \bar{B^0}$ and $\bar{B^0}\rightarrow

examine event number difference of these two processes. In contrast to the
BaBar asymmetry, the asymmetry of events number includes the overall
normalization difference for rates. Time dependence of the asymmetry is more
general and it includes terms absent in one used by BaBar collaboration. Both
of the BaBar asymmetry and ours are naively thought to be T-odd since two
processes compared are related with flipping time direction. We investigate the
time reversal transformation property of our asymmetry. Using our notation, one
can see that the asymmetry is not precisely a T-odd quantity, taking into
account indirect CP and CPT violation of K meson systems. The effect of
$\epsilon_K$ is extracted and gives rise to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$
contribution. The introduced parameters are invariant under rephasing of quarks
so that the coefficients of our asymmetry are expressed as phase convention
independent quantities. Some combinations of the asymmetry enable us to extract
parameters for wrong sign decays of $B_d$ meson, CPT violation, etc. We also
study the reason why the T-even terms are allowed to contribute to the
asymmetry, and find that several conditions are needed for the asymmetry to be
a T-odd quantity.

the natural gas expansion, lower capital costs and renewable portfolio
standards are driving an expansion of intermittent renewable generation
capacity such as wind and photovoltaic generation. These two changes may
potentially combine to create new threats to the reliability of these
interdependent energy infrastructures. Natural gas-fired generators are often
used to balance the fluctuating output of wind generation. However, the
time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying natural gas
burn rates that impact the pressure in interstate transmission pipelines.
Fluctuating pressure impacts the reliability of natural gas deliveries to those

characterized as basis functions for irreducible representations of the

polynomials are expansion coefficients for one eigenbasis of a symmetry
operator $L_1$ of $H$ in terms of an eigenbasis of another symmetry operator
$L_2$, but the exact relationship appears not to have been made explicit. We
work out the details of the expansion to show, explicitly, how the polynomials

recurrence relation, 2nd order difference equation, duality of these relations,
permutation symmetry, intertwining operators and an alternate derivation of
Wilson functions -- follow from the symmetry of this quantum system. There is
active interest in the relation between multivariable Wilson polynomials and
the quantum superintegrable system on the $n$-sphere with generic potential,
and these results should aid in the generalization. Contracting function space
realizations of irreducible representations of this quadratic algebra to the
other superintegrable systems one can obtain the full Askey scheme of
orthogonal hypergeometric polynomials. All of these contractions of
superintegrable systems with potential are uniquely induced by Wigner Lie
algebra contractions of $so(3, C )$ and $e(2, C)$. All of the polynomials
produced are interpretable as quantum expansion coefficients. It is important
to extend this process to higher dimensions.

Akin to the construction of quasicrystals, we embed a non-crystallographic
group $G$ into the point group $\mathcal{P}$ of a higher dimensional lattice
and construct the chains of all $G$-containing subgroups. We determine the
orbits of lattice points under such subgroups, and show that their projection
into a lower dimensional $G$-invariant subspace consists of nested point sets
with $G$-symmetry at each radial level. The number of different radial levels
is bounded by the index of $G$ in the subgroup of $\mathcal{P}$. In the case of
icosahedral symmetry, we determine all subgroup chains explicitly and
illustrate that these point sets in projection provide blueprints that
approximate the organisation of simple viral capsids, encoding information on
the structural organisation of capsid proteins and the genomic material
collectively, based on two case studies. Contrary to the affine extensions
previously introduced, these orbits endow virus architecture with an underlying
finite group structure, which lends itself better for the modelling of its

container submitted to an impulse. We show that when foam is placed on top of
the liquid the oscillations of the free interface are significantly damped. The
ability to reduce sloshing and associated splashing could find applications in

studied both theoretically and by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The
force arises in deformable bodies linked to the free end of a grafted
polyelectrolyte chain which is exposed to electric field that favours its
adsorption. We consider a few target bodies with different force-deformation
relations including (i) linear and (ii) cubic dependences as well as (iii)
Hertzian-like force. Such force-deformation relations mimic the behaviour of
(i) coiled and (ii) stretched polymer chains, respectively, or (iii) that of a
squeezed colloidal particle. The magnitude of the arising force varies over a
wide interval although the electric field alters within a relatively narrow
range only. The predictions of our theory agree quantitatively well with the
results of numerical simulations. Both cases of zero and finite electrical
current are investigated and we do not obtain substantial differences in the
force generated. The phenomenon studied could possibly be utilised to design,
e.g., vice-like devices to fix nano-sized objects.

subtleties due to the issues of selection bias and confounding. In addition,
more complex questions of interest, such as effects of treatment on the treated
and mediated effects may not always be identified even in data where treatment
assignment is known and under investigator control, or may be identified under
one causal model but not another.
  Increasingly complex effects of interest, coupled with a diversity of causal
models in use resulted in a fragmented view of identification. This
fragmentation makes it unnecessarily difficult to determine if a given
parameter is identified (and in what model), and what assumptions must hold for
this to be the case. This, in turn, complicates the development of estimation
theory and sensitivity analysis procedures.
  In this paper, we give a unifying view of a large class of causal effects of
interest in terms of a hierarchy of interventions, and show that identification
theory for this large class reduces to an identification theory of random
variables under interventions from this hierarchy. Moreover, we show that one
type of intervention in the hierarchy is naturally associated with queries
identified under the Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpretable Structure
Tree Graph (FFRCISTG) model of Robins (via the extended g-formula), and another
is naturally associated with queries identified under the Non-Parametric
Structural Equation Model with Independent Errors (NPSEM-IE) of Pearl, via a
more general functional we call the edge g-formula.
  Our results motivate the study of estimation theory for the edge g-formula,
since we show it arises both in mediation analysis, and in settings where
treatment assignment has unobserved causes, such as models associated with
Pearl's front-door criterion.

that the line solitons suffer from instability with respect to periodic

spatial translation for the massive Thirring model and by the gauge rotation

instability holds for the transverse perturbations of any period in the massive
Thirring model and exhibits a finite threshold on the period of the transverse
perturbations in the massive Gross--Neveu model.

it has been recently that observability in complex networks has seriously
attracted the attention of researchers. This paper examines the
state-of-the-art and discusses some issues raised due to ""complexity"" and
""stochasticity"". These unresolved issues call for a new practical methodology.
For stochastic systems, a degree of observability may be defined and the
observability problem is not a binary (i.e., yes-no) question anymore. Here, we
propose to employ a goal-seeking system to play a supervisory role in the
network. Hence, improving the degree of observability would be a valid
objective for the supervisory system. Towards this goal, the supervisor
dynamically optimizes the observation process by reconfiguring the sensory
parts in the network. A cognitive dynamic system is suggested as a proper
choice for the supervisory system. In this framework, the network itself is
viewed as the environment with which the cognitive dynamic system interacts.
Computer experiments confirm the potential of the proposed approach for
addressing some of the issues raised in networks due to complexity and
stochasticity.
