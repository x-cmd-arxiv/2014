great homogeneity and high luminosity, which make it possible to use them as
standardizable candles for the determination of cosmological parameters. In
2011, the physics Nobel prize was awarded for the discovery of the accelerating
expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. This is a
pedagogical article, aimed at those starting their study of that subject, in
which we dwell on some topics related to the analysis of SNe Ia and their use
in luminosity distance estimators. Here we investigate their spectral
properties and light curve standardization, paying careful attention to the
fundamental quantities directly related to the SNe Ia observables. Finally, we
describe our own step-by-step implementation of a classical light curve fitter,
the stretch, applying it to real data from the Carnegie Supernova Project.

lossless source encoder (entropy coder). In this paper, we generalize Ziv's
scheme to the multi-user setting. For this generalized universal scheme, upper
bounds are derived on the redundancies, defined as the differences between the
actual rates and the closest corresponding rates on the boundary of the rate
region. It is shown that this scheme can achieve redundancies of no more than
0.754 bits per sample for each user. These bounds are obtained without
knowledge of the multi-user rate region, which is an open problem in general.
As a direct consequence of these results, inner and outer bounds on the
rate-distortion achievable region are obtained.

The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival

thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation
of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for
numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing
Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times
such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a
constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking
experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress;
characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting
strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the

when the communicating parties share randomness that is independent of the
inputs to the communication task. Natural communication processes (say between
humans) however often involve large amounts of shared correlations among the
communicating players, but rarely allow for perfect sharing of randomness. Can
the communication complexity benefit from shared correlations as well as it
does from shared randomness? This question was considered mainly in the context
of simultaneous communication by Bavarian et al. (ICALP 2014). In this work we
study this problem in the standard interactive setting and give some general
results. In particular, we show that every problem with communication
complexity of $k$ bits with perfectly shared randomness has a protocol using
imperfectly shared randomness with complexity $\exp(k)$ bits. We also show that
this is best possible by exhibiting a promise problem with complexity $k$ bits
with perfectly shared randomness which requires $\exp(k)$ bits when the
randomness is imperfectly shared. Along the way we also highlight some other
basic problems such as compression, and agreement distillation, where shared
randomness plays a central role and analyze the complexity of these problems in
the imperfectly shared randomness model.
  The technical highlight of this work is the lower bound that goes into the
result showing the tightness of our general connection. This result builds on
the intuition that communication with imperfectly shared randomness needs to be
less sensitive to its random inputs than communication with perfectly shared
randomness. The formal proof invokes results about the small-set expansion of
the noisy hypercube and an invariance principle to convert this intuition to a
proof, thus giving a new application domain for these fundamental results.

proposing a complete framework for reliable simulations of soft energy

connecting the capacitor, stretched periodically by a source of mechanical
work, in parallel with a battery through a diode and with an electrical load

simulating the effect of the electrodes and of the conductivity current
invariably present through the dielectric film. As these devices undergo a high
number of electro-mechanical loading cycles at large deformation, the

of the polymer and the possible change of permittivity with strains are
analysed carefully by means of a proposed coupled electro-viscoelastic
constitutive model, calibrated on experimental data available in the literature

showing the importance of time-dependent behaviour on the evaluation of
performance of DEGs for different loading conditions, namely equi-biaxial and

two redshift 0.91 galaxies that have been lensed by foreground galaxy cluster
Abell 2390. These data probe spatial scales as small as 0.3 kpc, providing a
magnified look at the morphology of star formation at an epoch when the global
star formation rate was high. However, dust attenuates our spatially resolved
star formation rate (SFR) indicators, the H alpha and rest-UV emission, and we
lack a direct measurement of extinction. Other studies have found that ionized
gas in galaxies tends to be roughly 50 percent more obscured than stars;
however, given an unextincted measurement of the SFR we can quantify the
relative stellar to nebular extinction and the extinction in H{\alpha}. We
infer SFRs from Spitzer and Herschel mid- to far-infrared observations and
compare these to integrated H alpha and rest-UV SFRs; this yields stellar to
nebular extinction ratios consistent with previous studies. We take advantage
of high spatial resolution and contextualize these results in terms of the
source-plane morphologies, comparing the distribution of H alpha to that of the
rest-frame UV and optical light. In one galaxy, we measure separate SFRs in
visually distinct clumps, but can set only a lower limit on the extinction and
thus the star formation. Consequently, the data are also consistent with there
being an equal amount of extinction along the lines of sight to the ionized gas
as to the stars. Future observations in the far-infrared could settle this by
mapping out the dust directly.

  As our collective coordinate approximation does not allow for the radiation
of energy out the system we look also, in some detail, at how good this

on the studies of the interactions and scatterings in two soliton systems.

true for the trajectories of the solitons and even for their quasi-conserved

...bca... <--> ...cab... (rotation transformations), such that whenever the
Knuth and rotation transformations at positions i-1, i, i+1 are available at a

graph is the sum of the quasisymmetric functions associated to the descent sets
of its vertices. Assaf studied D_0 graphs in the paper *Dual equivalence and
Schur positivity* and showed that they provide a rich source of examples of the
D graphs defined in the paper *Dual equivalence graphs and a combinatorial
proof of LLT and Macdonald positivity*. A key construction of Assaf expresses
the coefficient of q^t in an LLT polynomial as the generating function of a
certain D_0 graph. LLT polynomials are known to be Schur positive by work of
Grojnowski-Haiman, and experimentation shows that many D_0 graphs have Schur
positive generating functions, which suggests a vast generalization of LLT
positivity in this setting.
  As part of a series of papers, we study D_0 graphs using the Fomin-Greene
theory of noncommutative Schur functions. We construct a D_0 graph whose
generating function is not Schur positive by solving a linear program related
to a certain noncommutative Schur function. We go on to construct a D graph on
the same vertex set as this D_0 graph.

  cage with time-varying exterior charges and masses","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.supr-con gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In this paper we investigate the scalar Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in two of
its forms, i.e., its electric form and its gravitational form. The standard
form of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons)
move in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials.
When a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase,
which can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with
itself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has
quasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter
fringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the
electric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB
effect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell,
and potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar AB
effect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region
but subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system
will not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB
experiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a
spatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal
interference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are
non-classical. We present two versions of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal
interferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical shell with a
time-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the
atomic spectrum acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical
shell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally varying with time. The former leads
to a time-varying internal magnetic field, and the latter leads to a
time-varying gravitational redshift.

previously which asks for a minimal cost ordering of the vertices of a graph,
where the cost of visiting a node is a function of the number of neighbors that
have already been visited. This problem has applications in resource management
and disaster recovery. In this paper we analyze the computational hardness of
NANIP. In particular we show that this problem is NP-hard even when restricted

  AIAA Conference",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation and accretion of ice on the leading edge of a wing can be
detrimental to airplane performance. Complicating this reality is the fact that
even a small amount of uncertainty in the shape of the accreted ice may result
in a large amount of uncertainty in aerodynamic performance metrics (e.g.,
stall angle of attack). The main focus of this work concerns using the
techniques of Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) to quantify icing uncertainty
much more quickly than traditional methods (e.g., Monte Carlo). First, we
present a brief survey of the literature concerning the physics of wing icing,
with the intention of giving a certain amount of intuition for the physical
process. Next, we give a brief overview of the background theory of PCE.
Finally, we compare the results of Monte Carlo simulations to PCE-based
uncertainty quantification for several different airfoil icing scenarios. The
results are in good agreement and confirm that PCE methods are much more
efficient for the canonical airfoil icing uncertainty quantification problem
than Monte Carlo methods.

transverse plane that may translate to azimuthal asymmetries in primordial

outstanding problems at the interface of particle physics and cosmology.
Gravitational leptogenesis (baryogenesis) provides a possible mechanism through
explicit couplings of spacetime curvature to appropriate lepton (or baryon)
currents. In this paper, the idea that these strong equivalence principle
violating interactions could be generated automatically through quantum loop
effects in curved spacetime is explored, focusing on the realisation of the
discrete symmetries C, CP and CPT which must be broken to induce
matter-antimatter asymmetry. The related issue of quantum corrections to the
dispersion relation for neutrino propagation in curved spacetime is considered
within a fully covariant framework.

with the GADGET-3 TreePM+SPH code, where star formation and stellar feedback
are described using our MUlti Phase Particle Integrator (MUPPI) model. This
description is based on simple multi-phase model of the interstellar medium at
unresolved scales, where mass and energy flows among the components are
explicitly followed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations.
Thermal energy from SNe is injected into the local hot phase, so as to avoid
that it is promptly radiated away. A kinetic feedback prescription generates
the massive outflows needed to avoid the over-production of stars. We use two
sets of zoomed-in initial conditions of isolated cosmological halos with masses
(2-3) * 10^{12} Msun, both available at several resolution levels. In all cases
we obtain spiral galaxies with small bulge-over-total stellar mass ratios (B/T
\approx 0.2), extended stellar and gas disks, flat rotation curves and
realistic values of stellar masses. Gas profiles are relatively flat, molecular
gas is found to dominate at the centre of galaxies, with star formation rates
following the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. Stars kinematically
belonging to the bulge form early, while disk stars show a clear inside-out
formation pattern and mostly form after redshift z=2. However, the baryon
conversion efficiencies in our simulations differ from the relation given by
Moster et al. (2010) at a 3 sigma level, thus indicating that our stellar disks
are still too massive for the Dark Matter halo in which they reside. Results
are found to be remarkably stable against resolution. This further demonstrates
the feasibility of carrying out simulations producing a realistic population of
galaxies within representative cosmological volumes, at a relatively modest
resolution.

$Spitzer$ MIPS 24 $\mu$m photometry. The radio flux densities were measured

this value with either redshift or environment. However, a higher percentage of
galaxies in this cluster show an excess in their radio fluxes when compared to
low redshift clusters ($27^{+23}_{-13}\%$ to $11\%$), suggestive of a cluster
enhancement of radio-excess sources at this earlier epoch. In addition, the
far-infrared-radio relationship for blue galaxies, where $q_{\rm FIR}$ =

computational approach is extremely efficient and works well in cases close to
spherical symmetry, such as in star formation problems. Unfortunately, the

paper, it was shown that by scaling the angle between the D3-branes and the

effective field theory which consists of a single tower of Regge trajectory
states and yet is ultraviolet complete and non-singular. In this article, we
study this model by further studying a limit which recovers the MPS dynamics
from this non-singular construction. We approach this issue from a holographic
perspective, where we consider a stack of $N$ D3-branes overlapping with a
single D3'-brane, and treat that D3'-brane as a probe in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$

non-singular soliton configuration, but in the limit where the MPS dynamics is
recovered, the soliton degenerates. This is consistent with the idea that the

linearly with temperature. Furthermore, despite the fact that the resistivity
and specific heat exhibit the non-Fermi liquid behavior expected at a QCP, the
correlation length, correlation time, and staggered susceptibility of the spin
fluctuations remain finite at low temperature. We suggest that these deviations
from the divergent behavior expected for a QCP may result from alloy disorder.

that exhibit translational invariance and finite-range spatial correlation.
Each approximation within the hierarchy is a set of ordinary differential
equations that considers spatial correlations of varying lattice distance; the
assumption is that the full system will have finite spatial correlations and
thus the behavior of the models within the hierarchy will approach that of the
full system. We provide evidence of this convergence in the context of one- and
two-dimensional numerical examples. Lower levels within the hierarchy that
consider shorter spatial correlations, are shown to be up to three orders of
magnitude faster than traditional kinetic Monte Carlo methods (KMC) for
one-dimensional systems, while predicting similar system dynamics and steady
states as KMC methods. We then test the hierarchy on a two-dimensional model
for the oxidation of CO on RuO2(110), showing that low-order truncations of the
hierarchy efficiently capture the essential system dynamics. By considering
sequences of models in the hierarchy that account for longer spatial
correlations, successive model predictions may be used to establish empirical
approximation of error estimates. The hierarchy may be thought of as a class of
generalized phenomenological kinetic models since each element of the hierarchy
approximates the master equation and the lowest level in the hierarchy is
identical to a simple existing phenomenological kinetic models.

if contributions to the common pool are too small. This fact alone, however,
does not always deter selfish individuals from defecting. The temptations to
free-ride on the prosocial efforts of others are strong because we are
hardwired to maximize our own fitness regardless of the consequences this might
have for the public good. Here we show that the addition of risky assets to the
personal endowments, both of which are lost if the collective target is not
reached, can contribute to solving the collective-risk social dilemma. In
infinite well-mixed populations risky assets introduce new stable and unstable
mixed steady states, whereby the stable mixed steady state converges to full
cooperation as either the risk of collective failure or the amount of risky
assets increases. Similarly, in finite well-mixed populations the introduction
of risky assets enforces configurations where cooperative behavior thrives. In
structured populations cooperation is promoted as well, but the distribution of
assets amongst the groups is crucial. Surprisingly, we find that the completely
rational allocation of assets only to the most successful groups is not
optimal, and this regardless of whether the risk of collective failure is high
or low. Instead, in low-risk situations bounded rational allocation of assets
works best, while in high-risk situations the simplest uniform distribution of
assets among all the groups is optimal. These results indicate that prosocial
behavior depends sensitively on the potential losses individuals are likely to
endure if they fail to cooperate.

variable environmental conditions on observed levels of genetic diversity

under selection that fluctuates in space and time, and derive an analytical
condition for when these fluctuations promote genetic diversification. As
ecological scenario we use a generalized island model with soft selection
within patches in which we incorporate generation overlap. We allow for
arbitrary fluctuations in the environment including spatio-temporal
correlations and any functional form of selection on the trait. Using the
concepts of invasion fitness and evolutionary branching, we derive a simple and
transparent condition for the adaptive evolution and maintenance of genetic
diversity. This condition relates the strength of selection within patches to
expectations and variances in the environmental conditions across space and
time. Our results unify, clarify, and extend a number of previous results on
the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation under fluctuating selection.
Individual-based simulations show that our results are independent of the
details of the genetic architecture and on whether reproduction is clonal or
sexual. The onset of increased genetic variance is predicted accurately also in
small populations in which alleles can go extinct due to environmental
stochasticity.

summarized in this review, our approach provides a unified treatment of the
linear cosmological perturbations about a FLRW universe, obtained by a
systematic expansion of our general action up to quadratic order. This shows
that the behaviour of these linear perturbations is generically characterized
by five time-dependent functions. We derive the full equations of motion in the

three algorithms significantly outperform it. We also evaluate the human
classification accuracy in performing a similar classification task. The best
performing algorithm achieves a mean accuracy that matches the median accuracy
obtained by humans, and common pairs of classes are misclassified by both
computers and humans. However, all acoustic scenes are correctly classified by
at least some individuals, while there are scenes that are misclassified by all

synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (SED) to each star

therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity
distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic

mass estimates by applying the SED fitting code FAST to the synthetic galaxy

systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that

predominantly anti-correlated velocities. This is consistent with a scenario in
which $\sim 50$% of satellite galaxies belong to kinematically-coherent
rotating planar structures, similar to those detected around the giant galaxies
of the Local Group. Here we extend this analysis, examining the incidence of
satellites of giant galaxies drawn from an SDSS photometric redshift catalog.
We find that there is a $\sim 17$% overabundance ($> 3 \sigma$ significance) of
candidate satellites at positions diametrically opposite a spectroscopically
confirmed satellite. We show that cosmological simulations do not possess this
property when the contamination is included, and that there are in fact, after
subtracting contamination, 2 to 3 times more satellites diametrically opposed
to a spectroscopically confirmed satellite than at $90\deg$ from it. We also
examine the correlation between the satellite pair positions and the
orientation of the host galaxy major axis. We find that those satellite pairs
with anti-correlated velocities have a strong preference ($\sim 3:1$) to align
with the major axis of the host whereas those with correlated velocities
display the opposite behavior. This correlation of the satellite alignments
appears to be stronger than the well-documented preference of satellites to be
located close to the major axis of their host. We finally show that repeating a
similar analysis to Ibata et al. (2014) with same-side satellites is generally
hard to interpret, but is not inconsistent with our previous results when
strong quality-cuts are applied on the sample. All these unexpected
correlations strongly suggest that a substantial fraction of satellite galaxies
are causally-linked in their formation and evolution.

We present a simple phenomenological model that links the evolving galaxy mass

testable predictions for the distribution of host galaxy masses for AGN of
different luminosities. We show that the $\phi^{*}$ normalisations of the
galaxy mass function and of the AGN luminosity function closely track each
other over a wide range of redshifts, implying a constant ""duty cycle"" of AGN
activity. The strong redshift evolution in the AGN $L^*$ can be produced by
either an evolution in the distribution of Eddington ratios, or in the
$m_{bh}/m_{*}$ mass ratio, or both. To try to break this degeneracy we look at
the distribution of AGN in the SDSS ($m_{bh},L$) plane, showing that an
evolving ratio $m_{bh}/m_{*} \propto (1+z)^2$ reproduces the observed data and
also reproduces the local relations which connect the black hole population
with the host galaxies for both quenched and star-forming populations. We
stress that observational studies that compare the masses of black holes in
active galaxies at high redshift with those in quiescent galaxies locally will
always see much weaker evolution. Evolution of this form would produce, or
could be produced by, a redshift-independent $m_{bh} - \sigma$ relation and
could explain why the local $m_{bh} - \sigma$ relation is tighter than $m_{bh}
- m_{*}$ even if $\sigma$ is not directly linked to black hole growth.
Irrespective of the evolution of $m_{bh}/m_{*}$, the model reproduces both the
appearance of ""downsizing"" and the so-called ""sub-Eddington boundary"" without
any mass-dependence in the evolution of black hole growth rates.

supersymmetric mass term is if it is the Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) of a
nonlinear sigma model. However, it is well known that nonlinear sigma models
(NLSMs) with nontrivial K\""ahler transformations are problematic to couple to
supergravity. An additional field is necessary to make the K\""ahler potential
of the NLSM invariant in supergravity. This field must have a shift symmetry
--- making it a candidate for the inflaton (or axion). We give an explicit
example of such a model for the coset space $SU(3)/SU(2) \times U(1)$, with the
Higgs as the NGB, including breaking the inflaton's shift symmetry and
producing a chaotic inflation potential. This construction can also be applied
to other models, such as one based on $E_7/SO(10) \times U(1) \times U(1)$
which incorporates the first two generations of (light) quarks as the
Nambu-Goldstone multiplets, and has an axion in addition to the inflaton. Along
the way we clarify and connect previous work on understanding NLSMs in
supergravity and the origin of the extra field (which is the inflaton here),
including a connection to Witten-Bagger quantization. This framework has wide
applications to model building; a light particle from a NLSM requires, in
supergravity, exactly the structure for chaotic inflaton or an axion.

cooling phases are present during the white-light flare decay, providing
fundamental constraints for models of flare physics. The template is also used
as a basis function to decompose complex multi-peaked flares, allowing us to
study the energy distribution of these events. Only a small number of flare

We show that the brightness and color of the resulting kilonova transients

neutrino irradiation raises the electron fraction to Ye > 0.25, r-process
nucleosynthesis halts before producing high-opacity, complex ions (the
lanthanides). The kilonova light curves thus show two distinct components: a
brief (~2 day) blue optical transient produced in the outer lanthanide-free
ejecta, and a longer (~10 day) infrared transient produced in the inner,
lanthanide line-blanketed region. Mergers producing a longer-lived neutron
star, or a more rapidly spinning black hole, have stronger neutrino
irradiation, generate more lanthanide-free ejecta, and are optically brighter
and bluer. At least some optical emission is produced in all disk wind models,
which should enhance the detectability of electromagnetic counterparts to
gravitational wave sources. However, the presence of even a small amount

angles. Because the disk outflows have moderate velocities (~10,000 km/s),
numerous resolved line features are discernible in the spectra, distinguishing

work. We show that the disk turning motion is unaffected by structural
properties of the galaxies such as the presence or absence of a bulge or bar.

the disks by about 40 degrees between z=1 and z=0, over the coarse of 6 Gyr. We
also investigate the impact of the disks on substructures, and conversely, the
disk heating rate caused by the dark matter halo substructures. The presence of
disks reduces the central subhalo abundance by a about a factor of two, due to
an increased evaporation rate by gravitational shocks from disk passages. We

residual jamming can still severely limit system performance. This motivates
the consideration of routing approaches that account for the differences in the
jamming environment between different paths. First, we take a straightforward
approach where an equal outage probability is allocated to each link along a
path and develop a minimum energy routing solution. Next, we demonstrate the
shortcomings of this approach and then consider the joint problem of outage
allocation and routing by employing an approximation to the link outage
probability. This yields an efficient and effective routing algorithm that only
requires knowledge of the measured jamming at each node. Numerical results
demonstrate that the amount of energy saved by the proposed methods with
respect to a standard minimum energy routing algorithm, especially for
parameters appropriate for terrestrial wireless networks, is substantial.

dynamical interactions between the cores will not be dynamically significant in
either Cha I or III, but the subregion Cha I North may experience collisions
between cores within ~0.7 Myr. Turbulence dissipation in the cores of both

the HC3N to N2H+ abundance ratio is a good evolutionary indicator in the
prestellar phase for both gravitationally bound and unbound cores. In the
framework of these models, we find that the cores in Cha III and the southern
part of Cha I are in a similar evolutionary stage and are less chemically
evolved than the central region of Cha I. The measured HC3N/N2H+ abundance
ratio and the evidence for contraction motions seen towards the Cha III
starless cores suggest that Cha III is younger than Cha I Centre and that some
of its cores may form stars in the future. The cores in Cha I South may on the
other hand be transient structures. (abridged)

first 3D observations at any redshift). F05189-2524, a nearby (z=0.043) ultra
luminous infrared galaxy powered by a quasar, was observed with the integral
field unit on the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini North. NaI
D absorption in the system traces dusty filaments on the near side of an
extended, AGN-driven galactic wind (with projected velocities up to 2000 km/s).
These filaments (A_V < 4) and N(H) < 10^22 cm^-2) simultaneously obscure the
stellar continuum and NaI D emission lines. The NaI D emission lines serve as a
complementary probe of the wind; they are strongest in regions of low
foreground obscuration and extend up to the limits of the field of view
(galactocentric radii of 4 kpc). An azimuthally symmetric Sersic model
extincted by the same foreground screen as the stellar continuum reproduces the
NaI D emission line surface brightness distribution except in the inner regions
of the wind, where some emission-line filling of absorption lines may occur.
The presence of detectable NaI D emission in F05189-2524 may be due to its high
continuum surface brightness at the rest wavelength of NaI D. These data
uniquely constrain current models of cool gas in galactic winds and serve as a
benchmark for future observations and models.

  near-inertial waves and mean flow","25 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wind forcing of the ocean generates a spectrum of inertia-gravity waves that
is sharply peaked near the local inertial (or Coriolis) frequency. The
corresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a
significant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse
this role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between
NIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the
generalised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of
Soward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between
the two types of motion to average over the short NIW period.
  We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham
averaging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs
and mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces
this system to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation
for NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the
mean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the
NIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the
relation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity -
through a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Buhler &
McIntyre (1998).
  The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action
and energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new
interaction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from
the balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential
advection and refraction so that their potential energy increases. A rough
estimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant sink of
energy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the
ocean.

representation that applies to many real-world domains. Many sets of network
data such as e-mail networks, social networks, or internet traffic networks are
best represented by a dynamic network due to the temporal component of the
data. One important application in the domain of dynamic network analysis is
anomaly detection. Here the task is to identify points in time where the
network exhibits behavior radically different from a typical time, either due
to some event (like the failure of machines in a computer network) or a shift
in the network properties. This problem is made more difficult by the fluid
nature of what is considered ""normal"" network behavior. The volume of traffic
on a network, for example, can change over the course of a month or even vary
based on the time of the day without being considered unusual. Anomaly
detection tests using traditional network statistics have difficulty in these
scenarios due to their Density Dependence: as the volume of edges changes the
value of the statistics changes as well making it difficult to determine if the
change in signal is due to the traffic volume or due to some fundamental shift
in the behavior of the network. To more accurately detect anomalies in dynamic
networks, we introduce the concept of Density-Consistent network statistics. On
synthetically generated graphs anomaly detectors using these statistics show a
a 20-400% improvement in the recall when distinguishing graphs drawn from
different distributions. When applied to several real datasets
Density-Consistent statistics recover multiple network events which standard

However, the unavoidable limitations that emerge due to the lack of control on

the maximum extractable work with limited control over the working system and
its interaction with the heat bath. We derive a general second law when the set

then apply our bound to particular scenarios that are important in realistic

show that the optimal work extraction is not achieved by simple thermal
contacts. Our results do not only generalize the second law to scenarios of
practical relevance, but also take first steps in the direction of local

keyword-based search, they are not always adequate for complex domain specific
information needs. The domain of prescription drug abuse, for example, requires
knowledge of both ontological concepts and 'intelligible constructs' not
typically modeled in ontologies. These intelligible constructs convey essential
information that include notions of intensity, frequency, interval, dosage and
sentiments, which could be important to the holistic needs of the information
seeker. We present a hybrid approach to domain specific information retrieval
(or knowledge-aware search) that integrates ontology-driven query
interpretation with synonym-based query expansion and domain specific rules, to
facilitate search in social media. Our framework is based on a context-free
grammar (CFG) that defines the query language of constructs interpretable by
the search system. The grammar provides two levels of semantic interpretation:
1) a top-level CFG that facilitates retrieval of diverse textual patterns,
which belong to broad templates and 2) a low-level CFG that enables
interpretation of certain specific expressions that belong to such patterns.
These low-level expressions occur as concepts from four different categories of
data: 1) ontological concepts, 2) concepts in lexicons (such as emotions and
sentiments), 3) concepts in lexicons with only partial ontology representation,
called lexico-ontology concepts (such as side effects and routes of
administration (ROA)), and 4) domain specific expressions (such as date, time,
interval, frequency and dosage) derived solely through rules. Our approach is
embodied in a novel Semantic Web platform called PREDOSE developed for
prescription drug abuse epidemiology.

singularities when summing up the virtual- and real-radiation corrections,
while this was not the case when keeping all powers in $s_3$ in the gluon
bremsstrahlung process due to the configurations allowing collinear photon
emission from the (massless) $s$-quark. Lastly, we compare our analytical

day, much shorter than what has been observed in other roAp stars. High
spectral and time resolution data obtained using the VLT in 2008 confirm the
presence of $\nu_2$ and short term modulations in the radial velocity
amplitudes of rare earth elements. This suggests growth and decay times shorter
than a day, more typical of solar-like oscillations. The driving mechanism of
roAp stars and the Sun are different, and the growth and decay seen in the Sun

roAp stars usually leads to mode stability on a longer time-scale than in the

discover that with only 2.4% geometrical coverage, the micron-length nanorod
arrays strongly interact with light across an extra-wide band from visible to
mid-infrared resulting in less than 10% transmission. Simulations show
excellent agreement with our experimental observation. Near-field profile
obtained from simulation reveals the electric field is mainly localized on the
surfaces of the nanorods at all the resonances. Theoretical analysis is then
applied to explain the resonances and it was found that the resonances in the
visible are different from those in the infrared. When the light arrives at the
array, part of the light wave propagates through the free space in between the

large-scale robust stability problems on the simplex. Our approach is to
formulate the robust stability problem as an optimization problem with
polynomial variables and polynomial inequality constraints. We use Polya's
theorem to convert the polynomial optimization problem to a set of highly
structured Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). We then use a slight modification
of a common interior-point primal-dual algorithm to solve the structured LMI
constraints. This yields a set of extremely large yet structured computations.
We then map the structure of the computations to a decentralized computing
environment consisting of independent processing nodes with a structured
adjacency matrix. The result is an algorithm which can solve the robust
stability problem with the same per-core complexity as the deterministic
stability problem with a conservatism which is only a function of the number of
processors available. Numerical tests on cluster computers and supercomputers
demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to efficiently utilize hundreds and
potentially thousands of processors and analyze systems with 100+ dimensional
state-space. The proposed algorithms can be extended to perform stability
analysis of nonlinear systems and robust controller synthesis.

as the antenna resonances of the nanorod are highly tunable through material

the small optical mode volume gives a very high Purcell factor, which could
potentially be applied to various enhanced nonlinear photonics or

harvested as no index-matching is necessary. The resonances maintain their
high-Q factor with the change of the environmental refractive index, which is
of great interest for molecular sensing.

investigated by measuring Rayleigh scattering of aerosol clusters along with
atomic emission from phase-selective laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy

the scattering cross-section of TiO_2 clusters begins to decrease, concurrent
with the onset of atomic emission of Ti, indicating a scattering-to-ablation
transition and the formation of nanoplasmas. To better clarify the process,
time-resolved measurements of scattering signals are examined for different
excitation laser intensities. For increasing laser intensities, the
cross-sections of clusters decrease during a single pulse, evincing the shorter
ablation delay time and larger ratios of ablation clusters. Assessment of the
electron energy distribution during the ablation process is conducted by
non-dimensionalizing the Fokker-Planck equation, with analogous Strouhal Sl_E,
Peclet Pe_E, and Damkohler Da_E numbers defined to characterize the
laser-induced aerothermochemical environment. For conditions of Sl_E>>1,
Pe_E>>1, and Da_E<<1, the electrons are excited to the conduction band by
two-photon absorption, then relax to bottom of the conduction band by
collisional electron energy loss to the lattice, and finally serve as the
energy transfer media between laser field and lattice. The relation between
delay time and excitation intensity is well predicted by this simplified model
with quasi-steady assumption.

type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), as well as the origin of a peculiar extinction
property toward SNe Ia for cosmological application. It has been suggested that
multiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard
reddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN
photons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows
the observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size
and the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared
(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived
even under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated
with the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar
reddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe
Ia. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to
be responsible for the non-standard extinction law. Furthermore, deeper limits
can be obtained using the standard nature of SN Ia NIR light curves. In this
application, an upper limit of Mdot ~10^{-8}-10^{-7} Msun/yr (for the wind
velocity of ~10 km/s) is obtained for a mass loss rate from a progenitor up to

Minhash is designed for estimating set resemblance and is known to be
suboptimal in many applications where the desired measure is set overlap (i.e.,
inner product between binary vectors) or set containment. Minhash has inherent
bias towards smaller sets, which adversely affects its performance in
applications where such a penalization is not desirable. In this paper, we
propose asymmetric minwise hashing (MH-ALSH), to provide a solution to this

of traditional minhash towards smaller sets, making the final ""collision
probability"" monotonic in the inner product. Our theoretical comparisons show
that for the task of retrieving with binary inner products asymmetric minhash
is provably better than traditional minhash and other recently proposed hashing
algorithms for general inner products. Thus, we obtain an algorithmic
improvement over existing approaches in the literature. Experimental
evaluations on four publicly available high-dimensional datasets validate our

communication with patient non-preemptable or impatient invocations, or
asynchronous communication. Correspondingly relations between behavioural
contracts and choreographic descriptions are considered, where a contract for
each communicating party is, e.g., derived by projection. The considered
relations are induced as the maximal preoders which preserve contract
compliance and global traces: we show maximality to hold (permitting services
to be discovered/substituted independently for each party) when contract
refinement preorders with all the above asymmetric communication means are
considered and, instead, not to hold if the standard symmetric CCS/pi-calculus
communication is considered (or when directly relating choreographies to
behavioral contracts via a preorder, no matter the communication mean). The
obtained maximal preorders are then characterized in terms of a new form of
testing, called compliance testing, where not only tests must succeed but also
the system under test (thus relating to controllability theory), and compared
with classical preorders such as may/must testing, trace inclusion, etc.
Finally, recent work about adaptable choreographies and behavioural contracts
is presented, where the theory above is extended to update mechanisms allowing
choreographies/contracts to be modified at run-time by internal

cascade propagation at any node depends on the load at the failed neighbor, the
degree of the neighbor as well as the load at that node. Each node in the
network bears an initial load that is below the capacity of the node. The
trigger for the cascade emanates at a single node or a small fraction of the
nodes from some external shock. Upon failure, the load at the failed node gets
divided randomly and added to the existing load at those neighboring nodes that
have not yet failed. Subsequently, a neighboring node fails if its accumulated
load exceeds its capacity. The failed node then plays no further part in the
process. The cascade process stops as soon as the accumulated load at all nodes
that have not yet failed is below their respective capacities. The model is
shown to operate in two regimes, one in which the cascade terminates with only
a finite number of node failures. In the other regime there is a positive
probability that the cascade continues indefinitely. Bounds are obtained on the
critical parameter where the phase transition occurs.

genotypic or phenotypic transitions that can occur upon cell division, such as
during symmetric or asymmetric cell differentiation, or upon spontaneous
mutation. Waiting times between transitions can be nonexponentially distributed
and reflect e.g., the cell cycle. Here, we use a multi-type branching processes
to study first passage time statistics for a single cell to appear in a
specific state. We present results for a sequential evolutionary process in

the wind torque spinning down the star is almost compensated by the tidal
torque spinning it up. We introduce dimensionless variables to characterize the
tidal evolution of observed hot Jupiter systems and discuss their spin and

show that their orbital properties are related to the effective temperature of
their host stars. The long-term evolution of planets orbiting F- and G-type
stars is significantly different owing to the combined effect of magnetic
braking and tidal dissipation. The existence of a quasi-stationary state, in
the case of short-period planets, can significantly delay their tidal evolution
that would otherwise bring the planet to fall into its host star. Most of the
planets known to orbit F-type stars are presently found to be near this
stationary state, probably in a configuration not too far from that they had
when their host star settled on the zero-age main sequence. Considering the
importance of angular momentum loss in the early stages of stellar evolution,
our results indicate that it has to be taken into account also to properly test

quantity $\mathbf{E}_w[g_w(x)]$. We prove that the SCGD converge almost surely
to an optimal solution for convex optimization problems, as long as such a
solution exists. The convergence involves the interplay of two iterations with
different time scales. For nonsmooth convex problems, the SCGD achieve a
convergence rate of $O(k^{-1/4})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-2/3})$ in the
strongly convex case, after taking $k$ samples. For smooth convex problems, the
SCGD can be accelerated to converge at a rate of $O(k^{-2/7})$ in the general
case and $O(k^{-4/5})$ in the strongly convex case. For nonconvex problems, we
prove that any limit point generated by SCGD is a stationary point, for which
we also provide the convergence rate analysis. Indeed, the stochastic setting

common in practice. The proposed SCGD methods find wide applications in

the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic
cardinalities, within a network. We demonstrate that this distribution changes
when a burst occurs, and is naturally immunized against spamming social-bot
attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can reliably
detect bursts in OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN
users, we design an efficient sample-estimate solution to estimate the triadic

applications like wireless communications and image processing. This problem is
generally ill-posed, and there have been efforts to use sparse models for
regularizing blind deconvolution to promote signal identifiability. Part I of
this two-part paper characterizes the ambiguity space of blind deconvolution
and shows unidentifiability of this inverse problem for almost every pair of
unconstrained input signals. The approach involves lifting the deconvolution
problem to a rank one matrix recovery problem and analyzing the rank two null
space of the resultant linear operator. A measure theoretically tight
(parametric and recursive) representation of the key rank two null space is
stated and proved. This representation is a novel foundational result for
signal and code design strategies promoting identifiability under convolutive
observation models. Part II of this paper analyzes the identifiability of
sparsity constrained blind deconvolution and establishes surprisingly strong
negative results on scaling laws for the sparsity-ambiguity trade-off.

  Barlow","Spectrally Accurate Causality Enforcement using SVD-based Fourier
  Continuations for High Speed Digital Interconnects",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce an accurate and robust technique for accessing causality of
network transfer functions given in the form of bandlimited discrete frequency
responses. These transfer functions are commonly used to represent the
electrical response of high speed digital interconnects used on chip and in
electronic package assemblies. In some cases small errors in the model
development lead to non-causal behavior that does not accurately represent the
electrical response and may lead to a lack of convergence in simulations that
utilize these models. The approach is based on Hilbert transform relations or
Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations and a construction of causal Fourier
continuations using a regularized singular value decomposition (SVD) method.
Given a transfer function, non-periodic in general, this procedure constructs
highly accurate Fourier series approximations on the given frequency interval
by allowing the function to be periodic in an extended domain. The causality
dispersion relations are enforced spectrally and exactly. This eliminates the
necessity of approximating the transfer function behavior at infinity and
explicit computation of the Hilbert transform. We perform the error analysis of
the method and take into account a possible presence of a noise or
approximation errors in data. The developed error estimates can be used in
verifying causality of the given data. The performance of the method is tested
on several analytic and simulated examples that demonstrate an excellent
accuracy and reliability of the proposed technique in agreement with the
obtained error estimates. The method is capable of detecting very small
localized causality violations with amplitudes close to the machine precision.

exponential model. A greater scale of the total neutrino mass, $\Sigma
m_{\nu}$, is allowed in the viable $f(R)$ models than that in the $\Lambda$CDM

this model by demonstrating its ability in several aspects. We show that our
model can outperform state-of-art performances of gated Boltzmann machines

underlying integration nodes we consider randomized Halton sequences in prime
bases $\boldsymbol{p}=(p_1,...,p_s)$ for which we study the root mean square
(RMS) worst-case error. The randomization method is a $\boldsymbol{p}$-adic
shift which is based on $\boldsymbol{p}$-adic arithmetic.
  The obtained error bounds are optimal in the order of magnitude of the number
of sample nodes. Furthermore we obtain conditions on the coordinate weights
under which the error bounds are independent of the dimension $s$. In terms of
the field of Information-Based Complexity this means that the corresponding QMC
rule achieves a strong polynomial tractability error bound. Our findings on the
RMS worst-case error of randomized Halton sequences can be carried over to the
RMS $L_2$-discrepancy.

regions, observed with the SMA and the CSO covering pc-scale clouds to
mpc-scale cores, are analyzed in order to quantify the magnetic field
importance. The magnetic field misalignment $\delta$ -- the local angle between
magnetic field and dust emission gradient -- is found to be a prime observable,
revealing distinct distributions for sources where the magnetic field is
preferentially aligned with or perpendicular to the source minor axis.
Source-averaged misalignment angles $\langle|\delta|\rangle$ fall into
systematically different ranges, reflecting the different source-magnetic field
configurations. Possible bimodal $\langle|\delta|\rangle$-distributions are
found for the separate SMA and CSO samples. Combining both samples broadens the
distribution with a wide maximum peak at small $\langle|\delta|\rangle$-values.
Assuming the 50 sources to be representative, the prevailing source-magnetic
field configuration is one that statistically prefers small magnetic field
misalignments $|\delta|$. When interpreting $|\delta|$ together with an MHD
force equation, as developed in the framework of the polarization-intensity
gradient method, a sample-based scaling fits the magnetic field
tension-to-gravity force ratio $\langle\Sigma_B\rangle$ versus
$\langle|\delta|\rangle$ with $\langle\Sigma_B\rangle = 0.116 \cdot
\exp(0.047\cdot \langle|\delta|\rangle)\pm 0.20$ (mean error), providing a way
to estimate the relative importance of the magnetic field, only based on
measurable field misalignments $|\delta|$. The force ratio $\Sigma_B$
discriminates systems that are collapsible on average ($\langle \Sigma_B\rangle
<1$) from other molecular clouds where the magnetic field still provides enough
resistance against gravitational collapse ($\langle \Sigma_B\rangle >1$)
(abridged).

the topological magnetoelectric coupling for a given broken time-reversal

dipoles to accumulate along the edges, realizing the facet-edge magnetic

only on the work function difference between facets, is in fact a manifestation
of the axion electrodynamics in real solids.

These may lead to formation of massive clusters hence massive stars to make the
integrated galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) top heavy (i.e.
proportion of massive stars is higher than less massive stars). We investigate
the joint effect of evolving IMF and several measures of SFR in dependence of
galaxy wide IMF. The resulting IGIMF have slopes $\alpha_{2,IGIMF}$ in the high
mass regime, which is highly dependent on the minimum mass of the embedded
cluster ($M_{ecl,min}$), star formation rates and mass spectrum indices of
embedded clusters (viz. $\beta$). It is found that for z $\sim$ 0 - 2,
$\alpha_{2,IGIMF}$ becomes steeper (i.e. bottom heavy), for z $\sim$ 2 - 4,
$\alpha_{2,IGIMF}$ becomes flatter (i.e. top heavy ) and from z $\sim$ 4

higher values of $\beta$. $\alpha_{2,IGIMF}$ is flatter also for higher values
of $M_{ecl,min}$. All these effects might be counted for the joint effect of
increasing temperature of the ambient medium as well as varying SFR with

Using the VLBI and HST results, which are essentially not affected by dust
extinction, three individual methods provide similar estimates for the black
hole mass: (0.76--5.4)x10^6 M_sun, 1.5x10^6 M_sun, and 4.1x10^6 M_sun. These
masses are in a range that is preferential for typical NLS1 galaxies rather

short-range attraction and long-range repulsion (SALR) potential is studied for
thermodynamic states corresponding to local ordering of clusters or layers in

effective potential between the confining surfaces are obtained for a
one-dimensional lattice model introduced in [J. P\k{e}kalski et al. $J. Chem.
Phys.$ ${\bf 140}$, 144903 (2013)].The simple asymptotic formulas are shown to
be in good quantitative agreement with exact results for slits containing at
least 5 layers. We observe that the incommensurability of the system size and
the average distance between the clusters or layers in the bulk leads to
structural deformations that are different for different values of the chemical
potential $\mu$. The change of the type of defects is reflected in the
dependence of density on $\mu$ that has a shape characteristic for phase
transitions. Our results may help to avoid misinterpretation of the change of
the type of defects as a phase transition in simulations of inhomogeneous
systems. Finally, we show that a system confined by soft elastic walls may
exhibit bistability such that two system sizes that differ approximately by the
average distance between the clusters or layers are almost equally probable.
This may happen when the equilibrium separation between the soft boundaries of
an empty slit corresponds to the largest stress in the confined self-assembling
system.

It has been argued that promise problems should be seen as partial decision
problems and as such that they are more fundamental than decision problems and
formal languages that used to be considered as the basic ones for complexity
theory. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the promise problems
accepted by classical, quantum and also semi-quantum finite automata. More
specifically, we first introduce two acceptance modes of promise problems,
recognizability and solvability, and explore their basic properties.
Afterwards, we show several results concerning descriptional complexity on
promise problems. In particular, we prove: (1) there is a promise problem that
can be recognized exactly by measure-once one-way quantum finite automata
(MO-1QFA), but no deterministic finite automata (DFA) can recognize it; (2)
there is a promise problem that can be solved with error probability
$\epsilon\leq 1/3$ by one-way finite automaton with quantum and classical
states (1QCFA), but no one-way probability finite automaton (PFA) can solve it
with error probability $\epsilon\leq 1/3$; and especially, (3) there are
promise problems $A(p)$ with prime $p$ that can be solved {\em with any error
probability} by MO-1QFA with only two quantum basis states, but they can not be
solved exactly by any MO-1QFA with two quantum basis states; in contrast, the
minimal PFA solving $A(p)$ with any error probability (usually smaller than
$1/2$) has $p$ states. Finally, we mention a number of problems related to
promise for further study.

amplitude~$W$ are examples of such systems. When one of OP, say~$\Delta$, has a
form of a topological defect, like, e.g., vortex or domain wall between the
domains with the phases~$0$ and~$\pi$, the other OP~$W$ is determined by the
Gross--Pitaevskii equation and is localized at the center of the defect. We
consider in detail the domain wall defect for~$\Delta$ and show that the shape
of the associated solution for~$W$ depends on temperature and doping (or on the
curvature of the Fermi surface)~$\mu$. It turns out that, provided temperature
or doping level are close to some discrete values~$T_{n}$ and~$\mu_{n}$, the
spacial dependence of the function~$W(x)$ is determined by the form of the
eigenfunctions of the linearized Gross--Pitaevskii equation. The spacial
dependence of~$W_{0}$ corresponding to the ground state has the form of a
soliton, while other possible solutions~$W_{n}(x)$ have nodes. Inverse
situation~when~$W(x)$ has the form of a topological defect and~$\Delta(x)$ is
localized at the center of this defect is also possible. In particular, we
predict a surface or interfacial superconductivity in a system where a
superconductor is in contact with a material that suppresses~$W$. This
superconductivity should have rather unusual temperature dependence existing
only in certain intervals of temperature. Possible experimental realizations of
such non-homogeneous states of OPs are discussed.

that arrive online. Such requests are inherently multi-dimensional and
characterized by demand vectors over multiple resources such as processor
cycles, storage space, and network bandwidth. Typically, different resources
require different objectives to be optimized, and $L_r$ norms of loads are
among the most popular objectives considered. To address these problems, we
consider the online vector scheduling problem in this paper. Introduced by
Chekuri and Khanna (SIAM J of Comp. 2006), vector scheduling is a
generalization of classical load balancing, where every job has a vector load
instead of a scalar load. In this paper, we resolve the online complexity of
the vector scheduling problem and its important generalizations. Our main
results are:
  -For identical machines, we show that the optimal competitive ratio is
$\Theta(\log d / \log \log d)$ by giving an online lower bound and an algorithm
with an asymptotically matching competitive ratio. The lower bound is
technically challenging, and is obtained via an online lower bound for the
minimum mono-chromatic clique problem using a novel online coloring game and
randomized coding scheme.
  -For unrelated machines, we show that the optimal competitive ratio is
$\Theta(\log m + \log d)$ by giving an online lower bound that matches a
previously known upper bound. Unlike identical machines, however, extending
these results, particularly the upper bound, to general $L_r$ norms requires
new ideas. In particular, we use a carefully constructed potential function
that balances the individual $L_r$ objectives with the overall (convexified)
min-max objective to guide the online algorithm and track the changes in
potential to bound the competitive ratio.

low-level input variables into high-level input variables, reducingthe

Iterative QuantifiedFuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic
programming. IQFRL is able to learn rules with differentstructures, and can
manage linguistic variables with multiple granularities. The algorithm has been
testedwith the implementation of the wall-following behavior both in several
realistic simulated environmentswith different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT
robot in two real environments. Results have beencompared with several
well-known learning algorithms combined with different data

multi-dimensional parameter space is crucial in computing-intensive
matched-filtering searches for gravitational waves, but also in similar
searches in other fields of astronomy. To generate efficient coverings of
arbitrary parameter spaces, stochastic template banks have been advocated,
where templates are placed at random while rejecting those too close to others.
However, in this simple scheme, for each new random point its distance to every
template in the existing bank is computed. This rapidly increasing number of
distance computations can render the acceptance of new templates
computationally prohibitive, particularly for wide parameter spaces or in large
dimensions. This work presents a neighboring cell algorithm that can
dramatically improve the efficiency of constructing a stochastic template bank.
By dividing the parameter space into sub-volumes (cells), for an arbitrary
point an efficient hashing technique is exploited to obtain the index of its
enclosing cell along with the parameters of its neighboring templates. Hence
only distances to these neighboring templates in the bank are computed,
massively lowering the overall computing cost, as demonstrated in simple
examples. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on this technique to
increase the fraction of covered parameter space solely by directed template
shifts, without adding any templates. As is demonstrated in examples, this
method can be highly effective..

measured by linear regression, and the standard deviation $\sigma$ around the

length scale of monthly local and annual reconstructed global climate records.
Extending previous work by Lennartz and Bunde \cite{Lennartz2011} we show
explicitely that $P$ follows the student-t distribution $P\propto
[1+(x/a)^2/l]^{-(l+1)/2}$, where the scaling parameter $a$ depends on both $L$

  In more detail: Semichiral sigma models have $(2,2)$ supersymmetry and
Generalized K\""ahler target space geometry by construction. They can also
support $(4,4)$ supersymmetry and Generalized Hyperk\""ahler geometry, but when
the target space is four dimensional indications are that the geometry is
restricted to Hyperk\""ahler. To investigate this further, we reduce the model
to $(1,1)$ superspace and construct the extra (on-shell) supersymmetries there.
We then find the conditions for a lift to $(2,2)$ super space and semichiral
fields to exist. Those conditions are shown to hold for Hyperk\""ahler
geometries. The $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ WZW model, which has $(4,4)$ supersymmetry

magnitude of negative contributions is investigated as a function of hadron
mass, collision energy in the range of $E_{\rm lab} = 5$--$160A$ GeV, collision
centrality and the energy density transition criterion defining the
hypersurface. The microscopic results are compared to negative contributions
expected from hydrodynamical treatment assuming local thermal equilibrium.
  The main conclusion is that the number of actual microscopic particles flying
inward is smaller than the negative contribution one would expect in an
equilibrated scenario. The largest impact of negative contributions is found to
be on the pion rapidity distribution at midrapidity in central collisions. For
this case negative contributions in equilibrium constitute 8--13\% of positive
contributions depending on collision energy, but only 0.5--4\% in cascade
calculation. The dependence on the collision energy itself is found to be
non-monotonous with a maximum at 10-20$A$ GeV.

dynamical phase transition the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which gives
the upper bound on the achievable precision of any measurement of the system
and environment, becomes quadratic in observation time (cf. ""Heisenberg
scaling""). In fact, the QFI is identical to the variance of the dynamical
observable that characterises the phases that coexist at the transition, and
enhanced scaling is a consequence of the divergence of the variance of this
observable at the transition point. This identification allows to establish the
finite time scaling of the QFI. Near the transition the QFI is quadratic in
time for times shorter than the correlation time of the dynamics. In the regime
of enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the QFI
involves measuring both system and output. As a particular realisation of these
ideas, we describe a theoretical scheme for quantum enhanced phase estimation
using the photons being emitted from a quantum system near the coexistence of

respond to pictures (and related stimuli) of just one particular person out of

to just a single concept. However, a direct experimental test of the concept
cell idea appears impossible, because it would need the measurement of the
response of each cell to enormous numbers of other stimuli. Here we propose a
new statistical method for analysis of the data, that gives a more powerful way
to analyze how close data are to the concept-cell idea. It exploits the large
number of sampled neurons, to give sensitivity to situations where the average
response sparsity is to much less than one response for the number of presented
stimuli. We show that a conventional model where a single sparsity is
postulated for all neurons gives an extremely poor fit to the data. In contrast
a model with two dramatically different populations give an excellent fit to
data from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In the hippocampus, one
population has 7% of the cells with a 2.6% sparsity. But a much larger fraction
93% respond to only 0.1% of the stimuli. This results in an extreme bias in the
reported responsive of neurons compared with a typical neuron. Finally, we show
how to allow for the fact that some of reported identified units correspond to
multiple neurons, and find that our conclusions at the neural level are
quantitatively changed but strengthened, with an even stronger difference
between the two populations.

modelling. In the Bayesian framework, these problems are typically solved using
one of the following two methods: i) by executing a Monte Carlo algorithm (such
as Nested Sampling) once for each possible value of $N$, and calculating the
marginal likelihood or evidence as a function of $N$; or ii) by doing a single
run that allows the model dimension $N$ to change (such as Markov Chain Monte
Carlo with birth/death moves), and obtaining the posterior for $N$ directly. In
this paper we present a general approach to this problem that uses
trans-dimensional MCMC embedded within a Nested Sampling algorithm, allowing us
to explore the posterior distribution and calculate the marginal likelihood

difficult features such as multimodality. We present two example problems,
finding sinusoidal signals in noisy data, and finding and measuring galaxies in
a noisy astronomical image. Both of the examples demonstrate phase transitions

the complexity of kinodynamic motion planning. The difficult trajectory
planning problem is solved in two separate, simpler, steps: first, find a path
in the configuration space that satisfies the geometric constraints (path
planning), and second, find a time-parameterization of that path satisfying the
kinodynamic constraints. A fundamental requirement is that the path found in
the first step should be time-parameterizable. Most existing works fulfill this
requirement by enforcing quasi-static constraints in the path planning step,
resulting in an important loss in completeness. We propose a method that
enables path-velocity decomposition to discover truly dynamic motions, i.e.
motions that are not quasi-statically executable. At the heart of the proposed
method is a new algorithm -- Admissible Velocity Propagation -- which, given a
path and an interval of reachable velocities at the beginning of that path,
computes exactly and efficiently the interval of all the velocities the system
can reach after traversing the path while respecting the system kinodynamic
constraints. Combining this algorithm with usual sampling-based planners then
gives rise to a family of new trajectory planners that can appropriately handle
kinodynamic constraints while retaining the advantages associated with
path-velocity decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
method on some difficult kinodynamic planning problems, where, in particular,
quasi-static methods are guaranteed to fail.

its firing statistics due to noise in the charging ion current. A mathematical
scheme introduced in advanced nanotechnology is relevant for the analysis of
this mechanism in the simplest case, the integrate-and-fire model with white
noise in the charging ion current.

matrix of a quantum oscillator that is linearly coupled to an environmental
reservoir. Although low-temperature reservoirs thermalize the oscillator to the
usual Boltzmann distribution, reservoirs at intermediate temperatures reduce
this distribution to a single, coherent ground state. Associated with this
state is an imaginary frequency indicating an environment which absorbs energy
from the oscillator through the suppression of all excited modes. Further
increase of the environmental temperature results again in the thermalization
of the quantum oscillator to the expected Boltzmann distribution.
Qualitatively, this result could account for high-temperature quantum effects
including the superconducting properties of graphite grains as well as the
quantum coherence observed in photosynthetic systems.

  11, Pages: 6072 - 6081, 2015","10.1109/TWC.2015.2448074",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Secure communication over a wiretap channel is considered in the
disadvantaged wireless environment, where the eavesdropper channel is (possibly
much) better than the main channel. We present a method to exploit inherent
vulnerabilities of the eavesdropper's receiver to obtain everlasting secrecy.
Based on an ephemeral cryptographic key pre-shared between the transmitter
Alice and the intended recipient Bob, a random jamming signal is added to each
symbol. Bob can subtract the jamming signal before recording the signal, while
the eavesdropper Eve is forced to perform these non-commutative operations in
the opposite order. Thus, information-theoretic secrecy can be obtained, hence
achieving the goal of converting the vulnerable ""cheap"" cryptographic secret
key bits into ""valuable"" information-theoretic (i.e. everlasting) secure bits.
We evaluate the achievable secrecy rates for different settings, and show that,
even when the eavesdropper has perfect access to the output of the transmitter
(albeit through an imperfect analog-to-digital converter), the method can still
achieve a positive secrecy rate. Next we consider a wideband system, where
Alice and Bob perform frequency hopping in addition to adding the random
jamming to the signal, and we show the utility of such an approach even in the
face of substantial eavesdropper hardware capabilities.
