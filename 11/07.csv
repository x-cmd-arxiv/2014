algorithms of sequence data, are popular to analyze complex data objects and to
cover domain specific data properties. Without an underlying vector space these
data are given as pairwise (dis-)similarities only. The few available methods
for such data focus widely on similarities and do not scale to large data sets.
Kernel methods are very effective for metric similarity matrices, also at large
scale, but costly transformations are necessary starting with non-metric (dis-)
similarities. We propose an integrative combination of Nystroem approximation,
potential double centering and eigenvalue correction to obtain valid kernel
matrices at linear costs in the number of samples. By the proposed approach
effective kernel approaches, become accessible. Experiments with several larger
(dis-)similarity data sets show that the proposed method achieves much better
runtime performance than the standard strategy while keeping competitive model
accuracy. The main contribution is an efficient and accurate technique, to
convert (potentially non-metric) large scale dissimilarity matrices into
approximated positive semi-definite kernel matrices at linear costs.

suppression, which are based on our recently developed dynamical energy loss
formalism, show a robust agreement with various experimental data, which spans
across different probes, experiments (RHIC and LHC) and experimental conditions
(i.e. all available centrality regions). This formalism includes several key
ingredients, such as inclusion of dynamical scattering centers, finite size QCD
medium, collisional energy loss, finite magnetic mass and running coupling.
While these effects have to be included based on theoretical grounds, it is
currently unclear what is their individual importance in accurately
interpreting the experimental data, in particular because other approaches to
suppression predictions commonly neglect some - or all - of these effects. To
address this question, we here study the relative importance of these effects
in obtaining accurate suppression predictions for D mesons (clear energy loss
probe) at top RHIC and LHC energies. We obtain that several different
ingredients are responsible for the accurate predictions, i.e. the robust
agreement with the data is a cumulative effect of all the ingredients, though
inclusion of the dynamical scattering centers has the largest relative
importance.

$\Phi=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(x) f(x)dx$ of an unknown deconvolution
density $f$ on the basis of i.i.d. observations $Y_i = \theta_i + \xi_i$ where
$\xi_i$ has a known pdf $g$ and $f$ is the pdf of $\theta_i$. Although various
aspects and particular cases of this problem have been treated by a number of
authors, there are still many gaps. In particular, there are no minimax lower
bounds for an estimator of $\Phi$ for an arbitrary function $\varphi$. The
general upper risk bounds cover only the case when the Fourier transform of
$\varphi$ exists. Moreover, no theory exists for estimating $\Phi$ when vector
of observations is sparse. In addition, until now, the related problem of
estimation of functionals $\Phi_n = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(\theta_i)$ in
indirect observations have been treated as a separate problem with no
connection to estimation of $\Phi$. The objective of the present paper is to
fill in the gaps and develop the general minimax theory of estimation of $\Phi$
and $\Phi_n$. We offer a general approach to estimation of $\Phi$ (and
$\Phi_n$) and provide the upper and the minimax lower risk bounds in the case
when function $\varphi$ is square integrable. Furthermore, we extend the theory
to the case when Fourier transform of $\varphi$ does not exist and $\Phi$ can
be presented as a linear functional of the Fourier transform of $f$ and its
derivatives. Finally, we generalize our results to handle the situation when
vector $\theta$ is sparse. As a direct application of the proposed theory, we
obtain multiple new results and automatically recover existing ones for a
variety of problems such as estimation of the $(2M+1)$-th absolute moment or a
generalized moment of the deconvolution density, estimation of the mixing cdf
or estimation of the mixing pdf with classical and Berkson errors.

of knowledge about the star beneath the disk, which is often found to be
rapidly rotating. Rapid rotation complicates modelling because fundamental
properties like the stellar luminosity and effective temperature require
knowledge of the angle of inclina- tion at which the star is observed.
Furthermore our knowledge of the structure of rapidly rotating stars is on a
less sure foundation than for non-rotating stars. The uncertainties in the
inclination and the surface properties of a few rapidly rotating stars have
been substantially reduced by interferometric observations over the last
decade, and these stars can be used as tests of rotating stellar models, even
if those stars themselves may not be Be stars. Vega, as an MK standard, is
historically a very important star because it is used for calibration purposes.
However, several studies have suggested that Vega is a rapidly rotating star
viewed at a very low inclination angle, raising questions as to how well we
really know its properties. Appropriate modelling has been challenging and
there is still room for debate over the actual properties of Vega, as opposed
to its observed properties. We have previously shown that under certain
conditions both the stellar surface properties and the deduced surface
properties scale from one model to another with the same surface shape. We used
this scaling algorithm with realistic 2D models to compute high-resolution
spectral energy distributions and interferometric visibilities to determine the
best rotating model fit to Vega. Detailed comparisons between the computed and
observed data will be presented.

somewhat under-luminous relative to the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation,
which may be attributable to its dynamical state. We present a preliminary

source is a blazar, and we propose that it is either a flat spectrum radio
quasar or a low-frequency peaked BL Lac object. We find four other fainter
sources in the field, which we study and tentatively identify. Only one, which
we propose is a foreground Galactic X-ray binary, is hard enough to contribute
to IGR J17448-3232, but it is too faint to be significant. We thus determine

rolled without slipping. This simple idea underlies the mathematics of Cartan
geometry. The Cartan-geometric description of gravity consists of a SO(1,4)
gauge connection $A^{AB}(x)$ and a symmetry-breaking field $V^A(x)$. The clear
similarity with symmetry-broken Yang-Mills theory suggests strongly the
existence of a new field in nature: the gravitational Higgs field $V^A$. By
treating $V^A$ as a genuine dynamical field we arrive at a natural
generalization of General Relativity with a wealth of new phenomenology and
with General Relativity reproduced exactly in the limit where $V^2$ tends to a
positive constant. We show that in regions wherein $V^2(x)$ varies, but has a
definite sign, the Cartan-geometric formulation is a form of a scalar-tensor
theory. A specific choice of action yields the Peebles-Ratra quintessence model
whilst more general actions are shown to exhibit propagation of torsion.
Regions where the sign of $V^2$ changes correspond to a change in signature of
the geometry; a simple choice of action with FRW symmetry yields, without any
additional ad hoc assumptions, a classical analogue of the Hartle-Hawking
no-boundary proposal. Solutions from more general actions are discussed. A
gauge prescription for coupling matter to gravity is described and matter
actions are presented which reduce to standard ones in the limit
$V^2\rightarrow const$. It becomes clear that Cartan geometry may function as a
novel platform for inspiring and exploring modified theories of gravity with
applications to dark energy, black holes, and early-universe cosmology. We end
by listing a set of open problems.

grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on YSZ (111) and Al2O3 (0001) substrates.
Using a set of complementary probes including neutron diffraction, we find that
the system magnetically orders into a ferromagnetically-canted
antiferromagnetic state via a single transition between 138-155 K, while a
paraelectric to ferroelectric transition occurs above 1000 K. The symmetry of
the magnetic structure in the ferroelectric state implies that this material is
a strong candidate for linear magnetoelectric coupling and control of the
ferromagnetic moment directly by an electric field.

dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are the two-dimensional (2D) materials most intensively
studied in recent years. Recently, black phosphorus emerged as a promising new
2D material due to its widely tunable and direct bandgap, high carrier mobility
and remarkable in-plane anisotropic electrical, optical and phonon properties.
However, current progress is primarily limited to its thin-film form, and its
unique properties at the truly 2D quantum confinement have yet to be
demonstrated. Here, we reveal highly anisotropic and tightly bound excitons in
monolayer black phosphorus using polarization-resolved photoluminescence
measurements at room temperature. We show that regardless of the excitation
laser polarization, the emitted light from the monolayer is linearly polarized
along the light effective mass direction and centers around 1.3 eV, a clear
signature of emission from highly anisotropic bright excitons. In addition,
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy suggests a quasiparticle bandgap of
2.2 eV, from which we estimate an exciton binding energy of around 0.9 eV,
consistent with theoretical results based on first-principles. The experimental
observation of highly anisotropic, bright excitons with exceedingly large
binding energy not only opens avenues for the future explorations of
many-electron effects in this unusual 2D material, but also suggests a
promising future in optoelectronic devices such as on-chip infrared light
sources.

any present variables in these clusters, especially RRLyrae stars, can help to
greatly improve the accuracy of their physical parameters. It can also help to
shed some light on the interrogations brought by the intriguing Oosterhoff
dichotomy in the Galactic globular cluster system. In a series of papers we
plan to explore the variable stars in the globular clusters falling inside the
field of the VVV survey. In this first paper we search and study the variables
present in two highly-reddened, moderately metal-poor, faint, inner Galactic
globular clusters: 2MASS-GC02 and Terzan10. We report the discovery of sizable
populations of RR Lyrae stars in both globular clusters. We use near-infrared
period-luminosity relations to determine the color excess of each RR Lyrae
star, from which we obtain both accurate distances to the globular clusters and
the ratios of the selective to total extinction in their directions. We find
the extinction towards both clusters to be elevated, non-standard, and highly
differential. We also find both clusters to be closer to the Galactic center
than previously thought, with Terzan10 being on the far side of the Galactic
bulge. Finally, we discuss their Oosterhoff properties, and conclude that both
clusters stand out from the dichotomy followed by most Galactic globular
clusters.

problem) in a random Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph on $n$ nodes and $\lfloor cn
\rfloor$ edges. It is shown in Coppersmith et al. ~\cite{Coppersmith2004} that
the size of the maximum cut in this graph normalized by the number of nodes
belongs to the asymptotic region $[c/2+0.37613\sqrt{c},c/2+0.58870\sqrt{c}]$
with high probability (w.h.p.) as $n$ increases, for all sufficiently large
$c$.
  In this paper we improve both upper and lower bounds by introducing a novel
bounding technique. Specifically, we establish that the size of the maximum cut
normalized by the number of nodes belongs to the interval
$[c/2+0.47523\sqrt{c},c/2+0.55909\sqrt{c}]$ w.h.p. as $n$ increases, for all
sufficiently large $c$. Instead of considering the expected number of cuts
achieving a particular value as is done in the application of the first moment
method, we observe that every maximum size cut satisfies a certain local
optimality property, and we compute the expected number of cuts with a given
value satisfying this local optimality property. Estimating this expectation
amounts to solving a rather involved two dimensional large deviations problem.
We solve this underlying large deviation problem asymptotically as $c$
increases and use it to obtain an improved upper bound on the Max-Cut value.
The lower bound is obtained by application of the second moment method, coupled
with the same local optimality constraint, and is shown to work up to the
stated lower bound value $c/2+0.47523\sqrt{c}$. It is worth noting that both
bounds are stronger than the ones obtained by standard first and second moment
methods.
  Finally, we also obtain an improved lower bound of $1.36000n$ on the Max-Cut
for the random cubic graph or any cubic graph with large girth, improving the
previous best bound of $1.33773n$.

goes from a metallic state, to a Mott core, and to a Mott ring; the coverage of
Mott atoms reaches a maximum at the core-ring transition. A `phase diagram' in
terms of an effective density and the on-site repulsion is proposed, as a guide
to maximize the Mott coverage. We also predict that the usual experimentally

Hawking radiation and cosmological pair production, have not been directly
tested and involve ultra high energy configurations. As a consequence, they
should be considered with caution. Using the analogy with condensed matter
systems, their analogue versions could be tested in the lab. Moreover, the high
energy behavior of these systems is known and involves dispersion and
dissipation, which regulate the theory at short distances. When considering
experiments which aim to test the above predictions, there will also be a
competition between the stimulated emission from thermal noise and the
spontaneous emission out of vacuum. In order to measure these effects, one
should thus compute the consequences of UV dispersion and dissipation, and
identify observables able to establish that the spontaneous emission took
place. In this thesis, we first analyze the effects of dispersion and
dissipation on both Hawking radiation and pair particle production. To get
explicit results, we work in the context of de Sitter space. Using the extended
symmetries of the theory in such a background, exact results are obtained.
These are then transposed to the context of black holes using the
correspondence between de Sitter space and the black hole near horizon region.
To introduce dissipation, we consider an exactly solvable model producing any
decay rate. We also study the quantum entanglement of the particles so
produced. In a second part, we consider explicit condensed matter systems,
namely Bose Einstein condensates and exciton-polariton systems. We analyze the
effects of dissipation on entanglement produced by the dynamical Casimir
effect. As a final step, we study the entanglement of Hawking radiation in the
presence of dispersion for a generic analogue system.

imbalance gets suppressed in the superconductor bulk due to electron scattering

transverse momentum spectra within a unified model for chemical and kinetic
freezeout. The study has been done within two different schemes of freezeout,
single freezeout where all the hadrons freezeout together versus double
freezeout where those hadrons with non-zero strangeness content have different
freezeout parameters compared to the non-strange ones. We demonstrate that the
data is better described within the latter scenario. We obtain a strange
freezeout hypersurface which is smaller in volume and hotter compared to the
non-strange freezeout hypersurface for all centralities with a reduction in
$\chi^2/N_{df}$ around $40\%$. We observe from the extracted parameters that
the ratio of the transverse size to the freezeout proper time is invariant
under expansion from the strange to the non-strange freezeout surfaces across
all centralities. Moreover, except for the most peripheral bins, the ratio of
the non-strange and strange freezeout proper times is close to $1.3$.

properties in the presence of electric and magnetic fields. Using
group-theoretical methods, we derive an invariant expansion of the Hamiltonian
for electron states near the K point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast to
known materials, including single-layer graphene, any possible coupling of
physical quantities to components of the external electric (magnetic) field has
a counterpart where the analogous component of the magnetic (electric) field
couples to exactly the same combination of quantities. For example, a purely
electric spin splitting appears as the magneto-electric analogue of the
familiar magnetic Zeeman spin splitting. The measurable thermodynamic response
induced by magnetic and electric fields is thus completely symmetric. The Pauli
magnetization induced by a magnetic field takes exactly the same functional
form as the polarization induced by an electric field. Our findings thus reveal
unconventional behavior of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in their
coupling to external fields. We explain how these counterintuitive couplings
are consistent with fundamental principles such as time reversal symmetry. For
example, only a magnetic field can give rise to a macroscopic spin
polarization, whereas only a perpendicular electric field can induce a
macroscopic polarization of the sublattice-related pseudospin degree of freedom
characterizing the intravalley orbital motion in bilayer graphene. These rules
enforced by symmetry for the matter-field interactions clarify the nature of
spins versus pseudospins. We also provide numerical values of prefactors for
relevant coupling terms. While our theoretical arguments use bilayer graphene
as an example, they are generally valid for any material with similar
symmetries.

a randomly rough surface of an elastically isotropic solid is analyzed within
the small perturbation approach. In the limiting case of a large correlation
length $L$ compared with the acoustic wavelength, the specularity reduction is
given by $4\eta^2k^2$, where $\eta$ is the RMS roughness and $k$ is the
acoustic wavevector, which is in agreement with the well-known Kirchhoff
approximation result often referred to as Ziman's equation [J. M. Ziman,
Electrons and Phonons (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960)]. In the opposite
limiting case of a small correlation length, the specularity reduction is found
to be proportional to $\eta^2k^4L^2$, with the fourth power dependence on
frequency as in Rayleigh scattering. Numerical calculations for a Gaussian
autocorrelation function of surface roughness connect these limiting cases and
reveal a maximum of diffuse scattering at an intermediate value of $L$. This
maximum becomes increasingly pronounced for the incident longitudinal wave as
the Poisson's ratio of the medium approaches 1/2 as a result of increased
scattering into transverse and Rayleigh surface waves. The results indicate
that thermal transport models using Ziman's formula are likely to overestimate
the heat flux dissipation due to boundary scattering, whereas modeling
interface roughness as atomic disorder is likely to underestimate scattering.

torsion of its homology. It is a classical result in reduced homology of finite
groups that the order of a group annihilates its homology. From the very
beginning of the rack homology (between 1990 and 1995) the analogous result was
suspected. The first general results in this direction were obtained
independently about 2001 by R.A.Litherland and S.Nelson, and P.Etingof and
M.Grana. In Litherland-Nelson paper it is proven that if (Q;*) is a finite
homogeneous rack (this includes quasigroup racks) then the torsion of homology
is annihilated by |Q|^n. In Etingof-Grana paper it is proven that if (X;A) is a
finite rack and N=|G^0_Q| is the order of a group of inner automorphisms of Q,
then only primes which can appear in the torsion of homology are those dividing
N (the case of connected Alexander quandles was proven before by T.Mochizuki).
The result of Litherland-Nelson is generalized by Niebrzydowski and Przytycki
and in particular, they prove that the torsion part of the homology of the
dihedral quandle R_3 is annihilated by 3. In Niebrzydowski-Przytycki paper it
is conjectured that for a finite quasigroup quandle, torsion of its homology is
annihilated by the order of the quandle. The conjecture is proved by T.Nosaka
for finite Alexander quasigroup quandles. In this paper we prove the conjecture
in full generality. For this version, we rewrote the Section 3 totally and
introduced the concept of the precubic homotopy. In Section 2, the main
addition is Corollary 2.2 which summarizes identities observed in the proof of
the main theorem as we use it later in Section 3.

understanding of their deep interiors, as it has happened with the Earth, the
Sun, and many main-sequence and evolved stars. The study of giant planets'
composition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their
formation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own.
Unfortunately, its determination is complicated by the fact that their interior
is thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of
atmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a
whole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely
on indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid
and convective, which makes their seismology much closer to that of solar-like
stars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology techniques
naturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can
be used: photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and
ring seismology in the specific case of Saturn. The current decade has been
promising thanks to the detection of Jupiter's acoustic oscillations with the
ground-based imaging-spectrometer SYMPA and indirect detection of Saturn's
f-modes in its rings by the NASA Cassini orbiter. This has motivated new
projects of ground-based and space-borne instruments that are under
development. In this chapter, we review the science that seismology could help
understand about the four giant planets, the instrumental and modeling
approaches, and the most recent observational results.

described in terms of a graph. By carefully exploiting the properties of this
graph (in particular, its chordal completions), more efficient algorithms can
be developed. To this end, we develop a new technique, which we refer to as
chordal elimination, that relies on elimination theory and Gr\""obner bases. By
maintaining graph structure throughout the process, chordal elimination can
outperform standard Gr\""obner basis algorithms in many cases. The reason is
that all computations are done on ""smaller"" rings, of size equal to the
treewidth of the graph. In particular, for a restricted class of ideals, the
computational complexity is linear in the number of variables. Chordal
structure arises in many relevant applications. We demonstrate the suitability
of our methods in examples from graph colorings, cryptography, sensor

that relies on the network structure and the average bias of all agents in the

concrete BPoA bounds for a variety of specific behaviors (e.g., varied levels

emit under normal conditions is in front of bright continuum sources and
therefore is seen in absorption instead. The data set has been made public at
http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/26818. Conclusions. (1) The dense gas fraction in
the W51 A and B clouds shows that W51 A will continue to form stars vigorously,
while star formation has mostly ended in W51 B. The lack of dense, star-forming
gas around W51 C indicates that collect-and-collapse is not acting or is
inefficient in W51. (2) Ongoing high-mass star formation is correlated with n ~
1x10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ gas. Gas with n > 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ is weakly correlated with
low and moderate mass star formation, but does not strongly correlate with
high-mass star formation. (3) The nondetection of H$_2$CO emission implies that
the emission detected in other galaxies, e.g. Arp 220, comes from high-density
gas that is not directly affiliated with already-formed massive stars. Either
the non-star-forming ISM of these galaxies is very dense, implying the star
formation density threshold is higher, or H II regions have their emission
suppressed.

evolution of stellar systems in arbitrary geometry. The orbits of stars are
followed in a smooth potential represented by a basis-set expansion and
perturbed after each timestep using local velocity diffusion coefficients from
the standard two-body relaxation theory. The potential and diffusion
coefficients are updated after an interval of time that is a small fraction of
the relaxation time, but may be longer than the dynamical time. Thus our
approach is a bridge between the Spitzer's formulation of the Monte Carlo
method and the temporally smoothed self-consistent field method. The primary
advantages are the ability to follow the secular evolution of shape of the
stellar system, and the possibility of scaling the amount of two-body
relaxation to the necessary value, unrelated to the actual number of particles
in the simulation. Possible future applications of this approach in galaxy
dynamics include the problem of consumption of stars by a massive black hole in
a non-spherical galactic nucleus, evolution of binary supermassive black holes,
and the influence of chaos on the shape of galaxies, while for globular

first comment by Boyarsky et al. confirms the absence of a line from M31 in the
3-4 keV energy range, but criticizes the energy range for spectral fitting on
the basis that (i) the background model adopted between 3-4 keV is invalid
outside that range and that (ii) extending the energy range multiple features
appear, including a 3.5 keV line. Point (i) is manifestly irrelevant (the 3-4
keV background model was not meant to extend outside that range), while closer
inspection of point (ii) shows that the detected features are inconsistent and
likely unphysical. We demonstrate that the existence of an excess near 3.5 keV
in the M31 data requires fitting a broad enough energy range such that the
background modeling near 3.5 keV is poor to a level that multiple spurious
residual features become significant. Bulbul et al. criticize our use of
WebGuide instead of the full AtomDB package. While a technically correct
remark, this is only a red herring: our predictions are based on line ratios,
and not on absolute emissivities; line ratios, for atomic transitions with
similar peak temperatures, are largely temperature-independent, thus the line
ratios we employed to draw our conclusions are substantially correct. Bulbul et
al. also present a new analysis of their data at lower energy, which excludes a
significant Cl contamination to the 3.5 keV line. Cl emission was however
predicted to be subdominant in our original study. Both of the Bulbul et al.'s
criticisms are thus inconsequential to the conclusions of our original study.
Finally, we demonstrate that the multi-temperature models employed in Bulbul et
al. are, in fact, inconsistent, based on the Ca XX to Ca XIX line ratio: we
show that the overestimated cluster plasma temperatures they employ lead to
gross underestimates of the K XVIII line emissivity.

required for an efficient gravitational wave emission. Recent N-body
simulations have suggested that a departure from spherical symmetry in the
nucleus of the galaxy may keep the rate of interaction of stars with the binary
at a high enough level so that the binary continues to shrink rather rapidly.
However, a major problem of all these simulations is that they do not probe the
regime where collisionless effects are dominant - in other words, the number of
particles in the simulation is still not sufficient to reach the asymptotic
behaviour of the system. I present a novel Monte Carlo method for simulating
both collisional and collisionless evolution of non-spherical stellar systems,
and apply it for the problem of binary supermassive black hole evolution. I
show that in triaxial galaxies the final-parsec problem is largely
non-existent, while in the axisymmetric case it seems to still exist in the
limit of purely collisionless regime relevant for real galaxies, but disappears
in the N-body simulations where the feasible values of N are still too low to
get rid of collisional effects.

  Methods: We calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between
the two quantities and its associated p-value. The correlation coefficient was
calculated for both the full dataset and the star-planet pairs that follow the
conditions proposed by Hartman (2010). In order to do so, we considered
effective temperatures both as collected from the literature and from the
SWEET-Cat catalog, which provides a more homogeneous and accurate effective
temperature determination.
  Results: The analysis delivers significant correlation coefficients, but with
a lower value than those obtained by Hartman (2010). Yet, the two datasets are
compatible, and we show that a correlation coefficient as large as previously
published can arise naturally from a small-number statistics analysis of the
current dataset. The correlation is recovered for star-planet pairs selected
using the different conditions proposed by Hartman (2010). Remarkably, the
usage of SWEET-Cat temperatures leads to larger correlation coefficient values.
We highlight and discuss the role of the correlation betwen different
parameters such as effective temperature and activity index. Several additional
effects on top of those discussed previously were considered, but none fully

unstable to wind formation via momentum deposition by radiation pressure or
other momentum sources like supernova explosions, even if the system is below
the average Eddington limit. This conclusion follows from the fact that the
critical momentum injection rate per unit mass for unbinding gas from a
self-gravitating system is proportional to the gas surface density and that a
turbulent medium presents a broad distribution of column densities to the
sources. For an average Eddington ratio of <Gamma>~0.1 and for turbulent Mach
numbers >30, we find that ~1% of the gas is ejected per dynamical timescale at
velocities larger than the local escape velocity. Because of the lognormal
shape of the surface density distribution, the mass loss rate is highly
sensitive to the average Eddington ratio, reaching 20-40% of the gas mass per
dynamical time for <Gamma>=1. Using this model we find a large scatter in the
mass-loading factor for star-forming galaxies, ranging from 0.001-10, but with
significant uncertainties. Implications for the efficiency of star formation in
giant molecular clouds are highlighted. For radiation pressure feedback alone,

  Aims. The active K1-giant component of the long-period RS CVn-type binary
system sigma Gem and its global surface flow pattern is revisited.
  Methods. We refine the differential rotation law from recovering the spot
migration pattern. We apply a detailed cross-correlation technique to a unique
set of 34 time-series Doppler images recovered using data from 1996/97. By
increasing the number of the available cross-correlation function maps from the
formerly used 4 to 17 we expect a more robust determination of the differential
surface rotation law. In addition, we present a new time-series Doppler imaging
study of sigma Gem using our advanced surface reconstruction code iMap for a
dataset collected in 2006/07.
  Results. Results from the reprocessed cross-correlation study confirm that
the star performs antisolar-type differential rotation with a surface shear
alpha of -0.04 +/- 0.01, i.e., almost a factor of two stronger compared to the
previously claimed value. We also confirm the evidence of a global poleward
spot migration with an average velocity of 0.21 +/- 0.03 km/s, in accordance
with theoretical predictions. From the new observations we obtain three

We suggest a molecular design consisting of two masses coupled to each other

constant) between the masses, it is possible to either reduce, or perhaps more
surprisingly enhance the phonon conductance. We investigate a simple model

Poincare-invariant topological gravity in even dimensions is formulated as a
transgression field theory whose gauge connections are associated to linear and
nonlinear realizations of the Poincare group ISO(d-1,1). The resulting theory
is a gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model whereby the transition functions relating
gauge fields belong to the coset ISO(d-1,1)/SO(d-1,1). The supersymmetric
extension leads to topological supergravity in two dimensions starting from a
transgression field theory for the super-Poincare group in three dimensions.
The construction is extended to a three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory of
gravity invariant under the Maxwell algebra, where the corresponding Maxwell
gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model is obtained. II) dimensional reduction of
Chern-Simons theories with arbitrary gauge group in a formalism based on
equivariant principal bundles is considered. For the classical gauge groups the
relations between equivariant principal bundles and quiver bundles is
clarified, and show that the reduced quiver gauge theories are all generically
built on the same universal symmetry breaking pattern. The reduced model is a
novel Chern-Simons-Higgs theory consisting of a Chern-Simons term valued in the
residual gauge group plus a higher order gauge and diffeomorphism invariant
coupling of Higgs fields with the gauge fields. The moduli spaces of solutions
provide in some instances geometric representations of certain quiver varieties
as moduli spaces of flat invariant connections. In the context of dimensional
reductions involving non-compact gauge groups, the reduction of
five-dimensional supergravity induce novel couplings between gravity and
matter. The resulting model is regarded as to a quiver gauge theory of
AdS(3)xU(1) gravity involving a non-minimal coupling to scalar Higgs fermion
fields.

phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor

a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many
datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to
specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been
studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality
versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural
network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons
to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which
was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network
trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may
dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,
middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of
features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task
increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a
network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce
a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target
dataset.

interactions and have velocity dependent viscous forces. We find that the
average contribution of the random and dissipative forces to the pressure is
negligible for long simulations, provided these forces are appropriately
coupled and when the finite time step used in the integration of the equation
of motion is not too small. Finally, we study the properties of the fluid when
the random force is made equal to zero and find that the system freezes as a
result of the competition of the dissipative and conservative forces.

so-called MAT protocol obtained by Maddah-Ali and Tse, which was shown to
provide 33% DoF enhancement over TDMA. While the asymptotic DMT analysis shows
that MAT is always preferable to TDMA, the Pairwise Error Probability analysis
at finite SNR shows that MAT is in fact not always a better alternative to

concatenated with a full-rate full-diversity space-time code. The analysis is
also extended to spatially correlated channels and the influence of transmit
correlation matrices and user pairing strategies on the performance are
discussed. Relying on statistical CSIT, signal constellations are further
optimized to improve the error rate performance of MAT and make it insensitive
to user orthogonality. Finally, other transmission strategies relying on

decreasing temperature parameter which deterministically deforms the objective
during the course of the optimization. A well-known drawback to this annealing
approach is the choice of the cooling schedule. We therefore introduce
variational tempering, a variational algorithm that introduces a temperature
latent variable to the model. In contrast to related work in the Markov chain
Monte Carlo literature, this algorithm results in adaptive annealing schedules.
Lastly, we develop local variational tempering, which assigns a latent
temperature to each data point; this allows for dynamic annealing that varies
across data. Compared to the traditional VI, all proposed approaches find
improved predictive likelihoods on held-out data.

field in the layer just behind the bright rim is running along the rim, quite
different from its ambient magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic field
just behind the tip rim is almost perpendicular to that of the incident UV
radiation, and the magnetic field configuration appears to be symmetric as a
whole with respect to the cloud symmetry axis. We estimated the column and
number densities in the two regions (just inside and far inside the tip rim),
and then derived the magnetic field strength, applying the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method. The estimated magnetic field strength just inside the tip rim, ~90 uG,
is stronger than that far inside, ~30 uG. This suggests that the magnetic field
strength just inside the tip rim is enhanced by the UV radiation induced shock.
The shock increases the density within the top layer around the tip, and thus
increases the strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic pressure seems to be
comparable to the turbulent one just inside the tip rim, implying a significant
contribution of the magnetic field to the total internal pressure. The
mass-to-flux ratio was estimated to be close to the critical value just inside
the tip rim. We speculate that the flat-topped bright rim of SFO 74 could be
formed by the magnetic field effect.

change in the AB and AC phases appearing due to the modified electromagnetic
field. In addition, for a time varying electric field we perform explicit
analytic calculations to derive the exact form of spin electric field and spin
current, which is defect parameter dependent and of oscillating type.
Furthermore, in an asymmetric crystal within the Drude model approach we
investigate the dependence of the cosmic string parameters on cosmic string
induced Hall electric field.

the requirement of accurate channel state information is more stringent.
Previously, for OOK systems, we have developed a receiver that requires few
pilot symbols and can jointly detect the data sequence and estimate the unknown
channel gain implicitly. In this paper, using the same approach, we extend our
previous work and derive a generalized receiver for M-PAM systems. A
Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm coupled with a selective-store strategy
is adopted, resulting in a low implementation complexity and a low memory
requirement. Therefore, the receiver is efficient in terms of energy, spectra,
implementation complexity and memory. Using theoretical analysis, we show that
its error performance approaches that of maximum likelihood detection with
perfect knowledge of the channel gain, as the observation window length
increases. Also, simulation results are presented to justify the theoretical
analysis.

network coding (RLNC). We combine RLNC with unequal error protection (UEP) and
our main purpose is twofold. First, to systematically investigate the benefits
of UEP+RLNC layered approach in servicing users with different reception
capabilities. Second, to study the effect of not using feedback, by comparing
feedback-free schemes with idealistic full-feedback schemes. To these ends, we
study `expected percentage of decoded frames' as a key content-independent
performance metric and propose a general framework for calculation of this
metric, which can highlight the effect of key system, video and channel
parameters. We study the effect of number of layers and propose a scheme that
selects the optimum number of layers adaptively to achieve the highest
performance. Assessing the proposed schemes with real H.264 test streams, the
trade-offs among the users' performances are discussed and the gain of adaptive
selection of number of layers to improve the trade-offs is shown. Furthermore,
it is observed that the performance gap between the proposed feedback-free
scheme and the idealistic scheme is very small and the adaptive selection of
number of video layers further closes the gap.

precisely the inner Oort cloud (IOC). Until recently it was the sole member of
this population. The recent discovery of the detached object 2012 VP113 has
confirmed that there should be more objects in this region. Three additional
IOC candidates with orbits much closer to Neptune have been proposed in the
past decade since Sedna's discovery: 2000 CR105, 2004 VN112 and 2010 GB174.
Sedna and 2012 VP113 have perhelia near 80 AU and semi-major axes over 250 AU.
The latter three have perihelia between 44 AU and 50 AU and semi-major axes
between 200 AU and 400 AU. Here we determine whether the latter three objects
belong to the IOC or are from the Kuiper Belt's Extended Scattered Disc (ESD)
using numerical simulations. We assume that the IOC was formed when the Sun was
in its birth cluster. We analyse the evolution of the IOC and the Scattered
Disc (SD) during an episode of late giant planet migration. We examine the
impact of giant planet migration in the context of four and five planets. We
report that the detached objects 2004 VN112 and 2010 GB174 are likely members
of the IOC that were placed there while the Sun was in its birth cluster or
during an episode of Solar migration in the Galaxy. The origin of 2000 CR105 is
ambiguous but it is likely it belongs to the ESD. Based on our simulations we
find that the maximum perihelion distance of SD objects is 41 AU when the
semi-major axis is higher than 250 AU. Objects closer in are subject to mean
motion resonances with Neptune that may raise their perihelia. The five planet
model yields the same outcome. We impose a conservative limit and state that
all objects with perihelion distance q>45 AU and semi-major axis a>250 AU
belong to the inner Oort cloud.

2MASS, WISE, and SCUBA-2, enabled us to construct SEDs with extended wavelength
coverage. Using sophisticated radiative transfer models, we analyzed the
observed SEDs of the five detected objects with a hybrid fitting strategy that
combines the model grids and the simulated annealing algorithm and evaluated
the constraints on the disk properties via the Bayesian inference method. The
modelling suggests that disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are
generally flatter than their higher mass counterparts, but the range of disk
mass extends to well below the value found in T Tauri stars, and the disk scale
heights are comparable in both groups. The inferred disk properties (i.e., disk
mass, flaring, and scale height) in the low stellar mass regime are consistent
with previous findings from large samples of brown dwarfs and very low-mass
stars. We discuss the dependence of disk properties on their host stellar
parameters and find a significant correlation between the Herschel far-IR
fluxes and the stellar effective temperatures, probably indicating that the
scaling between the stellar and disk masses (i.e., $M_{\rm{disk}} \propto
M_{\star}$) observed mainly in low-mass stars may extend down to the brown

viscoelastic rheology, we compute the instantaneous deformation of celestial
bodies using a differential equation for the gravity field coefficients. This
method allows large eccentricities and it is not limited to quasi-periodic
perturbations. It can take into account an extended class of perturbations,
including chaotic motions and transient events. We apply our model to some
already detected eccentric hot Jupiters and super-Earths in planar
configurations. We show that when the relaxation time of the deformation is
larger than the orbital period, spin-orbit equilibria arise naturally at
half-integers of the mean motion, even for gaseous planets. In the case of
super-Earths, these equilibria can be maintained for very low values of
eccentricity. Our method can also be used to study planets with complex
internal structures and other rheologies.

amplifier flow: global linear stability analysis predicts that it is stable,
but perturbations can undergo large amplification in space and time as a result
of non-normal effects. This amplification potential is best captured by optimal
transient growth analysis, optimal harmonic forcing, or the response to
sustained noise. In view of reducing disturbance amplification in these
globally stable open flows, a variational technique is proposed to evaluate the
sensitivity of stochastic amplification to steady control. Existing sensitivity
methods are extended in two ways to achieve a realistic representation of
incoming noise: (i) perturbations are time-stochastic rather than
time-harmonic, (ii) perturbations are localised at the inlet rather than
distributed in space. This allows for the identification of regions where
small-amplitude control is the most effective, without actually computing any
controlled flows. In particular, passive control by means of a small cylinder
and active control by means of wall blowing/suction are analysed for Reynolds
number $Re=500$ and step-to-outlet expansion ratio $\Gamma=0.5$. Sensitivity
maps for noise amplification appear largely similar to sensitivity maps for
optimal harmonic amplification at the most amplified frequency. This is
observed at other values of $Re$ and $\Gamma$ too, and suggests that the design
of steady control in this noise amplifier flow can be simplified by focusing on
the most dangerous perturbation at the most dangerous frequency.

either in the dissipative nature of the metals as is the case for the

for the latter are the sphere-plane and the sphere-sphere geometry, where
negative Casimir entropies can occur already for perfect metal objects. After
appropriately scaling out the size of the objects, negative Casimir entropies

to the polarization mixing arising in the scattering process. If all involved

the low-energy and low-momentum behavior of the two-point function is very much
different in the microscopic and effective theories: in the field theory it is
dominated by the propagating mode while in model A it is dominated by the
diffusive mode. Also, in the microscopic theory the dynamic critical exponent,
z, depends on whether the kinematics is relativistic or nonrelativistic. In
contrast, at the NLO of the 2PI 1/N expansion the microscopic and effective
theories are equivalent. They satisfy exactly the same Kadanoff-Baym equation.
Also, whether the kinematics is relativistic or nonrelativistic in the
microscopic theory becomes irrelevant. This implies that the diffusive mode
with z = 2 + O(1/N) is dominant at low energies and momenta even in the
microscopic theory at the NLO of the 2PI 1/N expansion, though we do not
explicitly solve the Kadanoff-Baym equation. We also try to improve the

argued that the thermodynamic quantities vary continuously right up to the

thermodynamic spinodals calculated using the same Skyrme parameterizations,
finding that the effect of short-range Coulomb correlations and quantum shell

magnetic susceptibility shows that at sufficiently low temperatures $T<1500K$,

crucial for obtaining ferromagnetic instability in $\alpha $-iron. The main
contribution to the exchange interaction, renormalized by the effects of
electron interaction, comes from the hybridization between $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$
states. We furthermore suggest the effective spin-fermion model for $\alpha

the expected role of the spin-orbit interaction and particle number

to bridge the gap between the strongly idealized Lorentz model and realistic

cherry-pit model with hard-core correlations as well as a soft-potential model.
An ideal gas of tracer particles inserted into these structures is found to
exhibit anomalous transport which extends up to several decades in time. Also,
the self-diffusion of the tracers becomes suppressed upon increasing the
density of the systems. These phenomena are attributed to an underlying
percolation transition. In the soft potential model the transition is rounded,
since each tracer encounters its own critical density according to its energy.
Therefore, the rounding of the transition is a generic occurrence in realistic,
soft systems.

the context of the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and antiferromagnetism

coexistence region exists for the sufficiently large Coulomb repulsion
($U>U_{cr}$), and in the vicinity of the half-filled band (hole doping $\delta
< \delta_{cr}$). The critical hole doping is relatively small ($\delta_{cr}
\approx 0.006$ for $J/|t| = 1/3$) and linear with respect to $J$. The decrease
of $U_{cr}$ is proportional to $J$, except the limit of small $J$ ($J/|t|<
0.03)$, where $U_{cr}$ grows rapidly with decreasing $J$. The effect of the
second nearest hopping is limited -- the phase diagram does not change in a
qualitative manner when the $t'$ value is changed. In the limit of $T
\rightarrow 0$, SC phase is stable even for large hole-doping (such as $\delta

de Sitter expanding Universe. In the context of scalar QED the process is
generated by the first order term in the perturbation theory expansion of the
S-matrix. The partial transition probability is obtained and analysed, and
soft-photon emission is found to dominate overall. It has been argued that an
inertial particle evolving in dS spacetime loses physical momentum just as a
decelerated particle in Minkowski space does. It is thus expected that an
inertial charge will radiate in a similar way. We investigate the radiated
energy and make a qualitative comparison of the angular distribution of the
energy with the radiation pattern in the latter case.

Here, we report a new theory that graphene might be an embryo of protocell
membrane, and found several evidences. Firstly, the graphene oxide and
phospholipid-graphene oxide composite would curl into capsules in strongly
acidic saturated solution of Pb(NO3)2 at low temperature, providing a
protective space for biochemical reactions. Secondly, L-animi acids exhibit
higher reactivity than D-animi acids for graphene oxides in favor of the
formation of left-handed proteins. Thirdly, monolayer graphene with nanopores
prepared by unfocused 84Kr25+ has high selectivity for permeation of the
monovalent metal ions (Rb+ > K+ > Cs+ > Na+ > Li+), but does not allow Cl-
through, which could be attributed to the ion exchange of oxygen-containing
groups on the rim of nanopores. It is similar to K+ channels, which would cause
efflux of some ions from capsule of graphene oxides with the decrease of pH in
the primitive ocean, creating a suitable inner condition for the origin of
life. Consequently, the strongly acidic, high salinity and strong radiation as
well as temperature changes in the early Earth, regarded as negative factors,
would be indispensable for the origin of protocell. In short, graphene bred
life, but digested gradually by the evolution.

challenge is that software correctness depends intrinsically on correct usage

available for analysis, e.g., because they are too large and complex to be
described precisely in a cost-effective way. To overcome this problem, we
propose to identify abstract models of middleware as finite-state automata, and
then to perform verification on the combined middleware and control software
models. Both steps are carried out in a computer-assisted way using
state-of-the-art techniques in automata-based identification and verification.
Our main contribution is to show that the combination of identification and
verification is feasible and useful when considering typical issues that arise

scenarios where the hard $\gamma$-ray emission is of photohadronic origin. If
relativistic protons interact with the synchrotron blazar photons producing
$\gamma$ rays through photopion processes, we show that, besides the $2-20$ PeV
neutrino emission, the typical blazar SED should have an emission feature due
to the synchrotron emission of $pe$ secondaries that bridges the gap betweeen
the low-and high-energy humps of the SED, namely in the energy range 40 keV-40
MeV. We first present analytical expressions for the photopion and $pe$ loss
rates in terms of observable quantities of blazar emission. For the $pe$ loss
rate in particular, we derive a new approximate analytical expression for the
case of a power-law photon distribution, which has an excellent accuracy with
the numerically calculated exact one, especially at energies above the
threshold for pair production. We show that for typical blazar parameters, the
photopair synchrotron emission emerges in the hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray
energy range with a characteristic spectral shape and non negligible flux,
which may be even comparable to the hard $\gamma$-ray flux produced through
photopion processes. We argue that the expected ""$pe$ bumps"" are a natural
consequence of leptohadronic models, and as such, they may indicate that
blazars with a three-hump SED are possible emitters of high-energy neutrinos.

Once the Riemann surface is constructed the weak solution is automatically
global in time, but we have had to leave open the question whether the weak

to the Polubarinova-Galin equation). A certain crucial statement, a kind of

emission peaks is 0.18pc, consistent with simple isothermal Jeans
fragmentation. The 0.1pc-sized cores have low virial parameters on the
criticality borderline, while on the scale of the whole region, we infer that
it is undergoing large-scale collapse. The N$_2$H$^+$ linewidth increases with

models fit to GRS 1739-278 find that the accretion disk extends very close to
the black hole - the least stringent constraint is r = 5 (+3,-4) GM/c^2. Only
two of the models deliver meaningful spin constraints, but a = 0.8 +/-0.2 is
consistent with all of the fits. Overall, the data provide especially
compelling evidence of an association between compact hard X-ray coronae and
the base of relativistic radio jets in black holes.

investigate how the domain of agile governance has evolved, as well as to
derive implications for research and practice. Method: We conducted a
systematic review about the state of art of the agile governance up to and
including 2013. Our search strategy identified 1992 studies in 10 databases, of
which 167 had the potential to answer our research questions. Results: We
organized the studies into four major groups: software engineering, enterprise,
manufacturing and multidisciplinary; classifying them into 16 emerging
categories. As a result, the review provides a convergent definition for agile
governance, six meta- principles, and a map of findings organized by topic and
classified by relevance and convergence. Conclusion: The found evidence lead us
to believe that agile governance is a relatively new, wide and
multidisciplinary area focused on organizational performance and
competitiveness that needs to be more intensively studied. Finally, we made
improvements and additions to the methodological approach for systematic
reviews and qualitative studies.

Hadoop Distributed File System termed as HDFS. The HDFS similar to most
distributed file systems share a familiar problem on data sharing and
availability among compute nodes, often which leads to decrease in performance.
This paper is an experimental evaluation of Hadoop's computing performance
which is made by designing a rack aware cluster that utilizes the Hadoop's
default block placement policy to improve data availability. Additionally, an
adaptive data replication scheme that relies on access count prediction using
Langrange's interpolation is adapted to fit the scenario. To prove, experiments
were conducted on a rack aware cluster setup which significantly reduced the
task completion time, but once the volume of the data being processed increases
there is a considerable cutback in computational speeds due to update cost.
Further the threshold level for balance between the update cost and replication
factor is identified and presented graphically.

black holes dressed by an electric and a magnetic field and whose horizon is an
Einstein space (further constrained by the Einstein-Maxwell equations) -- both
the Weyl and Maxwell type are D. Even dimensions, however, open up more
possibilities. In particular, when 2p=n there exist non-static solutions
describing black holes acquiring (or losing) mass by receiving (or emitting)
electromagnetic radiation. In this case the Weyl type is II (D) and the Maxwell
type can be II (D) or N. Conditions under which the Maxwell field is self-dual
(for odd p) are also discussed, and a few explicit examples presented. Finally,
the case p=1 is special in all dimensions and leads to static metrics with a
non-Einstein transverse space.

of electrically active neurons with time varying amplitude. It is hypothesized
that a microstate implements a functional/physiological state of the brain

hypothesis, brain electrical activity is modeled as a time sequence of
non-overlapping microstates with variable, finite durations (Lehmann and
Skrandies 1980, 1984; Lehmann et al 1987). In this study, EEG recordings from
109 participants during eyes closed resting condition are modeled with four
microstates. In a first part, a new confirmatory statistics method is
introduced for the determination of the cortical distributions of electric
neuronal activity that generate each microstate. All microstates have common
posterior cingulate generators, while three microstates additionally include
activity in the left occipital/parietal, right occipital/parietal, and anterior
cingulate cortices. This appears to be a fragmented version of the
metabolically (PET/fMRI) computed default mode network (DMN), supporting the
notion that these four regions activate sequentially at high time resolution,
and that slow metabolic imaging corresponds to a low-pass filtered version. In
the second part of this study, the microstate amplitude time series are used as
the basis for estimating the strength, directionality, and spectral
characteristics (i.e., which oscillations are preferentially transmitted) of
the connections that are mediated by the microstate transitions. The results
show that the posterior cingulate is an important hub, sending alpha and beta
oscillatory information to all other microstate generator regions.
Interestingly, beyond alpha, beta oscillations are essential in the maintenance
of the brain during resting state.

their buoyancy, or any other mechanism, maintain themselves in a shallow

quantified the compressibility, the preferential concentration of the

imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique (from 100 GeV to 10 TeV) provides
insufficient angular resolution (few arc-minutes) to resolve the M87 emission
region. However, the short time scale variability observed by MAGIC, HESS and
VERITAS suggests the TeV emission is coming from a very small region, most
likely close to the core. We propose that the variable TeV emission may be
produced in a pair-starved region of the central black hole (BH) magnetosphere,
i.e. a region where the density of the electron-positron plasma is not
sufficient to completely screen the accelerating electric field. The funnel, a
low density and magnetically dominated region around the poles, appears as a
favourable site of low-density where a Blandford-Znajek process may explain the
main properties of the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from M87. We produce a
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the resulting radiation and
compare the model with the observed fluxes from the nucleus of M87, for both
low and high $\gamma$-ray activities. We finish with a brief discussion on the
connection between the accretion rate and the intermittence in the formation of

fractional derivative, \[{}^\rho \mathcal{D}_a^\alpha f (x) =
\frac{\rho^{\alpha-n+1}}{\Gamma({n-\alpha})} \, \bigg(x^{1-\rho}
\,\frac{d}{dx}\bigg)^n \int^x_a \frac{\tau^{\rho-1} f(\tau)}{(x^\rho -
\tau^\rho)^{\alpha-n+1}}\, d\tau \] which generalizes two familiar fractional
derivatives, namely, the Riemann-Liouville and the Hadamard fractional
derivatives to a single form. In this paper, we derive the existence and
uniqueness results for a generalized fractional differential equation governed
by the fractional derivative in question.

conditions under which the sum of the payments of all bidders is necessarily
not identically zero, and more generally not constant. Moreover, it explicitly
supplies a construction for a finite minimal set of possible bids on which such
a sum is not constant. In particular, this theorem applies to the important
case of a second-price Vickrey auction, where it reduces to a basic result of
which a novel proof is given. To enhance the confidence in this new theorem, it
has been formalized in Isabelle/HOL: the main results and definitions of the
formal proof are re- produced here in common mathematical language, and are
accompanied by an informal discussion about the underlying ideas.
