absorption that can be used for narrow-band thermal light emission at tunable
frequencies that strongly depend on the doping charge. By virtue of Kirchhoff's
law, thermal light emission is proportional to the absorption, thus resulting
in narrow emission lines associated with the electrically controlled plasmons
of heated graphene. Here we show that realistic designs of graphene plasmonic
structures can release over 90% of the emission through individual infrared
lines with 1% bandwidth. We examine anisotropic graphene structures in which
efficient heating can be produced upon optical pumping tuned to a plasmonic
absorption resonance situated in the blue region relative to the thermal
emission. An incoherent thermal light converter is thus achieved. Our results
open a radically different approach for designing tunable nanoscale infrared
light sources.

  These query complexities relate to (and are motivated by) the extension
complexity of polytopes. The linear extension complexity of a polytope is
characterized by the randomized communication complexity of computing its slack
matrix in expectation, and the semidefinite (psd) extension complexity is
characterized by the analogous quantum model. Since query complexity can be
used to upper bound communication complexity of related functions, we can
derive some upper bounds on psd extension complexity by constructing efficient
quantum query algorithms. As an example we give an exponentially-close
entrywise approximation of the slack matrix of the perfect matching polytope

Multipliers (ADMM) on convex quadratic programs (QPs) with linear equality and
bound constraints. The ADMM formulation alternates between an equality
constrained QP and a projection on the bounds. Under the assumptions of (i)
positive definiteness of the Hessian of the objective projected on the null
space of equality constraints (reduced Hessian), and (ii) linear independence
constraint qualification holding at the optimal solution, we derive an upper
bound on the rate of convergence to the solution at each iteration. In
particular, we provide an explicit characterization of the rate of convergence
in terms of: (a) the eigenvalues of the reduced Hessian, (b) the cosine of the
Friedrichs angle between the subspace spanned by equality constraints and the
subspace spanned by the gradients of the components that are active at the
solution and (c) the distance of the inactive components of solution from the
bounds. Using this analysis we show that if the QP is feasible, the iterates
converge at a Q-linear rate and prescribe an optimal setting for the ADMM
step-size parameter. For infeasible QPs, we show that the primal variables in
ADMM converge to minimizers of the Euclidean distance between the hyperplane
defined by the equality constraints and the convex set defined by the bounds.
The multipliers for the bound constraints are shown to diverge along the range
space of the equality constraints. Using this characterization, we also propose
a termination criterion for ADMM. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate
the theory through experiments.

the surface area $A$ of its apparent horizon: $8\pi S \le A$, with equality for
extremal black holes. In this paper, we explore the extremality of individual
and common apparent horizons for merging, rapidly spinning binary black holes.
We consider simulations of merging black holes with equal masses $M$ and
initial spin angular momenta aligned with the orbital angular momentum,
including new simulations with spin magnitudes up to $S/M^2 = 0.994$. We
measure the area and (using approximate Killing vectors) the spin on the
individual and common apparent horizons, finding that the inequality $8\pi S <
A$ is satisfied in all cases but is very close to equality on the common
apparent horizon at the instant it first appears. We also introduce a
gauge-invariant lower bound on the extremality by computing the smallest value
that Booth and Fairhurst's extremality parameter can take for any scaling.
Using this lower bound, we conclude that the common horizons are at least
moderately close to extremal just after they appear. Finally, following
Lovelace et al. (2008), we construct quasiequilibrium binary-black-hole initial
data with ""overspun"" marginally trapped surfaces with $8\pi S > A$ and for
which our lower bound on their Booth-Fairhurst extremality exceeds unity. These
superextremal surfaces are always surrounded by marginally outer trapped
surfaces (i.e., by apparent horizons) with $8\pi S<A$. The extremality lower

field on the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST). The potential profile measured
by the BPP is shown to significantly differ from the floating potential both in
polarity and profile shape. By combining the BPP potential and the floating
potential the electron temperature can be measured, which is compared with the
Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostic. Excellent agreement between the two
diagnostics is obtained when secondary electron emission is accounted for in
the floating potential. From the BPP profile an estimate of the radial electric
field is extracted which is shown to be of the order ~1kV/m and increases with
plasma current. Corrections to the BPP measurement, constrained by the TS
comparison, introduce uncertainty into the ER measurements. The uncertainty is
most significant in the electric field well inside the separatrix. The electric
field is used to estimate toroidal and poloidal rotation velocities from ExB
motion. This paper further demonstrates the ability of the ball pen probe to
make valuable and important measurements in the boundary plasma of a tokamak.

the Galactic halo (Halo) using RR Lyrae stars (RRL) as tracers of their ancient
stellar component. The comparison is performed using two observables (periods,
luminosity amplitudes) that are reddening and distance independent.
  Fundamental mode RRL in six dwarf spheroidals and eleven ultra faint dwarf
galaxies (1,300) show a Gaussian period distribution well peaked around a mean
period of <Pab>=0.610+-0.001 days (sigma=0.03). The Halo RRL (15,000) are
characterized by a broader period distribution.
  The fundamental mode RRL in all the dwarf spheroidals apart from Sagittarius
are completely lacking in High Amplitude Short Period (HASP) variables, defined
as those having P< 0.48 days and Av> 0.75mag. Such variables are not uncommon
in the Halo and among the globular clusters and massive dwarf irregulars. To
further interpret this evidence, we considered eighteen globulars covering a
broad range in metallicity (-2.3< [Fe/H]< -1.1) and hosting more than 35 RRL
each.
  The metallicity turns out to be the main parameter, since only globulars more
metal--rich than [Fe/H] -1.5 host RRL in the HASP region. This finding suggests
that dSphs similar to the surviving ones do not appear to be the major
building-blocks of the Halo. Leading physical arguments suggest an extreme
upper limit of 50% to their contribution. On the other hand, massive dwarfs
hosting an old population with a broad metallicity distribution (Large
Magellanic Cloud, Sagittarius) may have played a primary role in the formation
of the Halo.

collider energies and for probing larger mass scales due to collinear
logarithmic enhancements of the cross section. In this context, we revisit the
production of a hypothetic heavy Majorana neutrino $(N)$ at hadron colliders.
Particular attention is paid to the fusion process $W\gamma \rightarrow
N\ell^{\pm}$. We systematically categorize the contributions from an initial
state photon in the elastic, inelastic, and deeply inelastic channels.
Comparing with the leading channel via the Drell-Yan production $q
\bar{q}'\rightarrow W^{*}\rightarrow N\ell^{\pm}$ at NNLO in QCD, we find that
the $W\gamma$ fusion process becomes relatively more important at higher
scales, surpassing the DY mechanism at $m_{N} \sim 1 \text{TeV} \ (770

heavy Majorana neutrino signal, including QCD corrections, and quantify the

where a large splitting ($\approx 0.06$ \AA$^{-1}$) can be found in the

that protostellar discs can fragment into objects with masses above a few
Jupiter masses at large semimajor axis. Tidal downsizing may reduce both the
object mass and semimajor axis. However, most studies of tidal downsizing end
when the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its
parent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet
and brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be
explored.
  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in
multi-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.
In both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis
models of tidal downsizing.
  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities. The
ejection rate is around 25%. The ejecta mass distribution is similar to that
for all objects, with a velocity dispersion consistent with those produced by
full hydrodynamic simulations. The semimajor axis distribution after scattering
extends to parsec scales.
  In the cluster simulations, 13% of objects are ejected from their planetary
system, and around 10% experience significant orbit modification. A small
number of objects are recaptured on high eccentricity, high inclination orbits.
The velocity distribution of ejecta is similar to that produced by
fragment-fragment scattering.
  If fragment-fragment scattering and cluster stripping act together, then disc
fragmentation should be efficient at producing free-floating substellar
objects, and hence characterising the free-floating planet population will
provide strong constraints on the frequency of disc fragmentation.

core of the Fornax galaxy cluster, offers a unique opportunity to study those
processes in a level of detail not possible to achieve for galaxies at higher
redshifts. Using HST/ACS and auxiliary VLT/FORS ground-based observations, we
study the properties of the most recent episodes of star formation in this
gas-rich galaxy, the only one of its type near the core of the Fornax cluster.
We study the structural and photometric properties of young star cluster
complexes in NGC 1427A, identifying 12 bright such complexes with exceptionally
blue colors. The comparison of our broadband near-UV/optical photometry with
simple stellar population models yields ages below ~4x10^6 yr and stellar
masses from a few thousand up to ~3x10^4 Msun, slightly dependent on the
assumption of cluster metallicity and IMF. Their grouping is consistent with
hierarchical and fractal star cluster formation. We use deep Ha imaging data to
determine the current Star Formation Rate (SFR) in NGC 1427A and estimate the
ratio, Gamma, of star formation occurring in these star cluster complexes to
that in the entire galaxy. We find Gamma to be among the largest such values
available in the literature, consistent with starburst galaxies. Thus a large
fraction of the current star formation in NGC 1427A is occurring in star
clusters, with the peculiar spatial arrangement of such complexes strongly
hinting at the possibility that the starburst is being triggered by the passage
of the galaxy through the cluster environment.

number of edits (insertions, deletions and substitutions) required to convert

solves this problem in $O(n^3)$ time (ignoring grammar size) where $n$ is the
string length [Aho, Peterson 1972, Myers 1985]. Despite its vast number of
applications, there is no algorithm known till date that computes or
approximates Lan-ED in true sub-cubic time.
  In this paper we give the first such algorithm that computes Lan-ED almost
optimally. For any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n^{\omega}}{poly(\epsilon)})$ time and returns an estimate
within a multiplicative approximation factor of $(1+\epsilon)$, where $\omega$
is the exponent of ordinary matrix multiplication of $n$ dimensional square
matrices. It also computes the edit script. Further, for all substrings of $s$,
we can estimate their Lan-ED within $(1\pm \epsilon)$ factor in
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n^{\omega}}{poly(\epsilon)})$ time with high probability. We
also design the very first sub-cubic ($\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$) algorithm to
handle arbitrary stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) parsing. SCFGs lie at
the foundation of statistical natural language processing, they generalize
hidden Markov models, and have found widespread applications.
  To complement our upper bound result, we show that exact computation of SCFG
parsing, or Lan-ED with insertion as only edit operation in true sub-cubic time
will imply a truly sub-cubic algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths, and hence
to a large range of problems in graphs and matrices. Known lower bound results
on parsing implies no improvement over our time bound of $O(n^\omega)$ is

polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection. There are two main
types of methods: (i) 'outlier' detection methods based on Fst that detect loci
with high differentiation compared to the rest of the genomes, and (ii)
environmental association methods that test the association between allele
frequencies and environmental variables.
  - We present a new Fst-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which
incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental
differentiation'. It is based on the F-model, but, as opposed to existing
approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects; one due to divergent
selection, and another one due to various other processes different from local
adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or
background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is avaible at
http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv.
  - Simulation studies shows that our method has a much lower false positive
rate than an existing Fst-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of
demographic scenarios. Although it has lower power, it leads to a better
compromise between power and false positive rate.
  - We apply our method to human and salmon datasets and show that it can be
used successfully to study local adaptation. We discuss its scope and compare
its mechanics to other existing methods.

Multiple observation sequences are collected, a small subset of which are
outliers. A sequence is considered an outlier if the observations in that
sequence are generated by an ""outlier"" distribution, distinct from a common
""typical"" distribution governing the majority of the sequences. Apart from
being distinct, the outlier and typical distributions can be arbitrarily close.
The goal is to design a universal test to best discern all the outlier
sequences. A universal test with the flavor of the repeated significance test
is proposed and its asymptotic performance is characterized under various
universal settings. The proposed test is shown to be universally consistent.
For the model with identical outliers, the test is shown to be asymptotically
optimal universally when the number of outliers is the largest possible and
with the typical distribution being known, and its asymptotic performance
otherwise is also characterized. An extension of the findings to the model with
multiple distinct outliers is also discussed. In all cases, it is shown that
the asymptotic performance guarantees for the proposed test when neither the
outlier nor typical distribution is known converge to those when the typical
distribution is known.

confounders. Instrumental variables (IV) regression offers a way to control for
unmeasured confounders where, in our case, the sickle cell trait can be used as
an instrument. However, for the instrument to be valid, it may still be
important to account for measured confounders. The most commonly used
instrumental variable regression method, two-stage least squares, relies on
parametric assumptions on the effects of measured confounders to account for
them. Additionally, two-stage least squares lacks transparency with respect to
covariate balance and weighing of subjects and does not blind the researcher to
the outcome data. To address these drawbacks, we propose an alternative method
for IV estimation based on full matching. We evaluate our new procedure on
simulated data and real data concerning the causal effect of malaria on
stunting among children. We estimate that the risk of stunting among children
with the sickle cell trait decrease by 0.22 times the average number of malaria
episodes prevented by the sickle cell trait, a substantial effect of malaria on
stunting (p-value: 0.011, 95% CI: 0.044, 1).

a hypervisor to allow the physical host system to retrieve unused memory from
certain guest virtual machines (VMs) and share it with others. Memory
ballooning allows the total amount ofRAM required by guest VMs to exceed the
amount ofphysical RAM available on the host. Memory overcommitment enables a
higher consolidation ratio in a hypervisor. Using memory overcommitment, users
can consolidate VMs on a physical machine such that physical resources are
utilized in an optimal manner while delivering good performance. Hence memory
reclamation is an integral component ofmemory overcommitment. In this paper, we
address that the basic cause of memory that ballooning is memory overcommitment
from using memory-intensive virtual machines. We compared to others reclamation

Overcommitment. The objective of this paper is to analyse memory ballooning

virtualization software e.g ESXi Server, vCenter Server, vSphere Client are
installed and configured on the Centre for Innovation and Technology (CIT) Lab,

The performance ofmemory ballooning technique is evaluated with two different

et al., ITCS 2013, Canonne et al., SICOMP 2015) enables tremendous savings in
the sample complexity of testing algorithms, by allowing them to condition the
sampling on subsets of the domain. In particular, Canonne, Ron, and Servedio
(SICOMP 2015) showed that, in this setting, testing identity of an unknown
distribution $D$ (whether $D=D^\ast$ for an explicitly known $D^\ast$) can be
done with a constant number of queries, independent of the support size $n$ --
in contrast to the required $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ in the standard sampling model.
It was unclear whether the same stark contrast exists for the case of testing
equivalence, where both distributions are unknown. While Canonne et al.
established a $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$-query upper bound for equivalence
testing, very recently brought down to $\tilde O(\log\log n)$ by Falahatgar et
al. (COLT 2015), whether a dependence on the domain size $n$ is necessary was
still open, and explicitly posed by Fischer at the Bertinoro Workshop on
Sublinear Algorithms (2014). We show that any testing algorithm for equivalence
must make $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log n})$ queries in the conditional sampling
model. This demonstrates a gap between identity and equivalence testing, absent
in the standard sampling model (where both problems have sampling complexity
$n^{\Theta(1)}$).
  We also obtain results on the query complexity of uniformity testing and
support-size estimation with conditional samples. We answer a question of
Chakraborty et al. (ITCS 2013) showing that non-adaptive uniformity testing
indeed requires $\Omega(\log n)$ queries in the conditional model. For the
related problem of support-size estimation, we provide both adaptive and
non-adaptive algorithms, with query complexities $\mathrm{poly}(\log\log n)$
and $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$, respectively.

parallelism in the form of an ultra-wide word processor. We introduce the
Ultra-Wide Word architecture and model, an extension of the word-RAM model that
allows for constant time operations on thousands of bits in parallel. Word
parallelism as exploited by the word-RAM model does not suffer from the more
difficult aspects of parallel programming, namely synchronization and
concurrency. For the standard word-RAM algorithms, the speedups obtained are
moderate, as they are limited by the word size. We argue that a large class of

speedups comparable to multi-threaded computations while keeping the simplicity
of programming of the sequential RAM model. We show that this is the case by
describing implementations of Ultra-Wide Word algorithms for dynamic

model can be used to implement a nonstandard memory architecture, which enables
the sidestepping of lower bounds of important data structure problems such as
priority queues and dynamic prefix sums. While similar ideas about operating on

instance, ZoA galaxies are generally excluded from the whole-sky Tully-Fisher

fine-tuning the near-infrared TF relation, there is no reason not to extend
peculiar velocity surveys deeper into the ZoA. Accurate axial ratios ($b/a$)
are crucial to both the TF sample selection and the resulting TF distances. We
simulate the effect of dust extinction on the geometrical properties of
galaxies. As expected, galaxies appear rounder with increasing obscuration
level, even affecting existing TF samples. We derive correction models and
demonstrate that we can reliably reproduce the intrinsic axial ratio from the
observed value up to extinction level of about $A_J\simeq3$ mag ($A_V\sim11$

Both TF relations exhibit similar scatter at high Galactic latitudes. However,

factors have non-trivial characteristics and will modify Higgs-fermion
couplings from their standard model expectations. A radiatively generated
fermion mass could also potentially contribute to large anomalous magnetic
moments; this is particularly interesting in the case of the muon where a
persistent discrepancy, at the level of around $3\,\sigma$, has existed between
experiment and theory. Deviations in the Higgs-fermion couplings will
eventually be probed to high accuracy in the near future, at the LHC and the
planned ILC, to less than a percent. The prospect of a large, unknown
contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment could be reaffirmed as well,
in future experiments. All these reasons make it worthwhile to revisit models
of radiatively generated fermion masses, and investigate some of their general
characteristics in these contexts.

Edition 1",,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Background: While many infectious disease epidemics are initially
characterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level
Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower
polynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease.
Methods: We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales
(regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time
series of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from
the World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014.
Results: We found significant differences in the growth patterns of EVD cases
at the scale of the country, district, and other subnational administrative
divisions. The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone,
and Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local
epidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more
EVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an
exponential. Conclusions: The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD
outbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes,
success of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as
a high level of clustering. Quantifying the contribution of each of these
factors could help refine estimates of final epidemic size and the relative
impact of different mitigation efforts in current and future EVD outbreaks.

optimally approximate realistic flows as solutions of an inverse problem.
Assuming the model to be incompressible, inviscid and stationary in the frame
of reference moving with the vortex, the ""structure"" of the vortex is uniquely
characterized by the functional relation between the streamfunction and
vorticity. It is demonstrated how the inverse problem of reconstructing this
functional relation from data can be framed as an optimization problem which
can be efficiently solved using variational techniques. In contrast to earlier
studies, the vorticity function defining the streamfunction-vorticity relation
is reconstructed in the continuous setting subject to a minimum number of
assumptions. To focus attention, we consider flows in 3D axisymmetric geometry
with vortex rings. To validate our approach, a test case involving Hill's
vortex is presented in which a very good reconstruction is obtained. In the
second example we construct an optimal inviscid vortex model for a realistic
flow in which a more accurate vorticity function is obtained than produced
through an empirical fit. When compared to available theoretical vortex-ring
models, our approach has the advantage of offering a good representation of
both the vortex structure and its integral characteristics.

of a GRB with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), we did not see an
unambiguous signature of a reverse shock. While a model with both reverse and
forward-shock can correctly describe the observations, the data is not
constraining enough to decide upon the presence of the reverse-shock component.
We model the broad-band data using a simple forward-shock synchrotron scenario
with a transition from a wind environment to a constant density interstellar
medium (ISM) in order to account for the observed features. Within the confines
of this model, we also derive the underlying physical parameters of the
fireball, which are within typical ranges except for the wind density parameter
($A_*$), which is higher than those for bursts with wind-ISM transition, but
typical for the general population of bursts. We note the importance of
early-time radio observations of the afterglow (and of well sampled light

the generation of squeezed states, equal to T=311.13 K. Such a threshold is
estimated to be within temperatures where chemical reactions and biological

morphology-based search on SDSS images with the aim of finding these elusive
XMP galaxies. By using the recently discovered extremely metal-poor galaxy, Leo
P, as a guide, we obtained a collection of faint, blue systems, each with
isolated HII regions embedded in a diffuse continuum, that have remained
optically undetected until now. Here we show the first results from optical
spectroscopic follow-up observations of 12 of ~100 of these blue, diffuse dwarf
(BDD) galaxies yielded by our search algorithm. Oxygen abundances were obtained
via the direct method for eight galaxies, and found to be in the range
7.45<12+log(O/H)<8.0, with two galaxies being classified as XMPs. All BDDs were
found to currently have a young star-forming population (<10 Myr) and
relatively high ionisation parameters of their HII regions. Despite their low
luminosities (-11< M_B < -18) and low surface brightnesses (~23-25 mag
arcsec^-2), the galaxies were found to be actively star-forming, with current
star-formation rates between 0.0003 and 0.078 Msol/yr. From our current
subsample, BDD galaxies appear to be a population of non-quiescent dwarf
irregular (dIrr) galaxies, or the diffuse counterparts to blue compact galaxies
(BCDs) and as such may bridge the gap between these two populations. Our search
algorithm demonstrates that morphology-based searches are successful in
uncovering more diffuse metal-poor star-forming galaxies, which traditional
emission-line based searches overlook.

Supernova 1987A, carried out in 2012. Our dedicated photometric measurements
provide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 micron
compared to previous observations in 2010. Our Herschel spectra show only weak
CO line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [O I] line flux,
eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previously
estimated dust mass. The far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) is
well fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. The newly measured 70 micron
flux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a single
temperature. The far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 Msun of
amorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosynthetic
mass prediction for carbon. The observation of SiO molecules at early and late
phases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the SED
with a combination of 0.3 Msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 Msun of silicates,
totalling 0.8 Msun of dust. Our analysis thus supports the presence of a large
dust reservoir in the ejecta of SN 1987A. The inferred dust mass suggests that
supernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, from
local to high-redshift galaxies.

significant portion of the stars in the Milky Way have been born in stellar
associations or clusters that have lived a few Myr up to several Gyr, we
further restrict our attention to the evolution of star clusters. We have
carried out our simulations in two steps: (1) we create a simulation of
dissolution and mixing processes which yields a close fit to the present-day
Milky Way dynamics and (2) we have evolved three sets of stellar clusters with
masses of 400, 1000 and 15000 M$_{\odot}$ to dissolution. The birth location of
these sets was 4, 6, 8 and 10 kpc for the 400 and 1000 M$_{\odot}$ clusters and
4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 kpc for the 15000 M$_{\odot}$. We have focused our efforts
on studying the state of the escapers from these clusters after 4.5 Gyr of
evolution with particular attention to stars that reach the Solar annulus, i.e.
7.5 $\le$ R$_{\rm{gc}}$ $\le$ 8.5 kpc. We give results for Solar twins and
siblings over a wide range of radii and cluster masses for two dissolution
mechanisms. From kinematics alone, we conclude that the Sun was $\sim$50 per
cent more likely to have been born near its current Galactocentric radius,
rather than have migrated (radially) $\sim$2 kpc since birth. We conclude our
analysis by calculating magnitudes and colours of our single stars for
comparison with the samples that the $Gaia$, $Gaia$-ESO and GALAH-AAO surveys
will obtain. In terms of reconstructing dissolved star clusters we find that on
short time-scales we cannot rely on kinematic evolution alone and thus it will
be necessary to extend our study to include information on chemical space.

equation of state of dark energy by combining synthetic data from the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Planck surveyor.
We use angular clustering of galaxies for DES in 7 redshift shells up to $z\sim
1.7$ including cross-correlations between different redshift shells. We study
models with massless and massive neutrinos and three different dark energy
models: $\Lambda$CDM ($w=-1$), wCDM (constant $w$), and waCDM (evolving
equation of state parameter $w(a)=w_0 + w_{a}(1-a)$). We include the impact of
uncertainties in modeling galaxy bias using a constant and a redshift-evolving
bias model. For the $\Lambda$CDM model we obtain an upper limit for the sum of
neutrino masses from DES+Planck of $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.08$ eV (95\% C.L.) for a
fiducial mass of $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.047$ eV, with a 1$\sigma$ error of 0.02 eV,
assuming perfect knowledge of galaxy bias. For the wCDM model the limit is
$\Sigma m_\nu < 0.10 $ eV. For a wCDM model where galaxy bias evolves with
redshift, the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses increases to 0.19 eV.
DES will be able to place competitive upper limits on the sum of neutrino
masses of 0.1-0.2 eV and could therefore strongly constrain the inverted mass
hierarchy of neutrinos. In a wCDM model the 1$\sigma$ error on constant $w$ is
$\Delta w= 0.03$ from DES galaxy clustering and Planck. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$
as a free parameter increases the error on $w$ by a factor of 2, with $\Delta
w=0.06$. In a waCDM model, in which the dark energy equation of state varies
with time, the errors are $\Delta w_0 = 0.2$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.42$. Including
neutrinos and redshift dependent galaxy bias increases the errors to $\Delta
w_0 = 0.35$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.89$.

exhibiting no difference in their mass distributions. We also find that HEGs
accrete at significantly higher rates than LEGs, with the HEG/LEG division
lying at an Eddington ratio of ~0.04, which is in excellent agreement with
theoretical predictions of where the accretion rate becomes radiatively
inefficient, thus supporting the idea of HEGs and LEGs being powered by
different modes of accretion. Our study also shows that at least up to L_151MHz

conflicting results on the character of the SFR dependence, and whether it
exists, have been reported. To gain insight into the origins of the conflicting
results, we (a) devise a non-parametric, astrophysically motivated analysis
framework based on the offset from the star-forming (""main"") sequence at a
given stellar mass (relative specific SFR), (b) apply this methodology and
perform a comprehensive re-analysis of the local M-Z-SFR relation, based on
SDSS, GALEX, and WISE data, and (c) study the impact of sample selection, and
of using different metallicity and SFR indicators. We show that metallicity is
anti-correlated with specific SFR regardless of the indicators used. We do not
find that the relation is spurious due to correlations arising from biased
metallicity measurements, or fiber aperture effects. We emphasize that the
dependence is weak/absent for massive galaxies ($\log M_*>10.5$), and that the
overall scatter in the M-Z-SFR relation does not greatly decrease from the M-Z
relation. We find that the dependence is stronger for the highest SSFR galaxies
above the star-forming sequence. This two-mode behavior can be described with a
broken linear fit in 12+log(O/H) vs. log (SFR$/M_*$), at a given $M_*$.
Previous parameterizations used for comparative analysis with higher redshift
samples that do not account for the more detailed behavior of the local M-Z-SFR

different relationship.

the LHC reach for such a vector boson allowing for arbitrary couplings. We find
that only couplings to muons can be probed at the LHC because lepton flavor
violating couplings are constrained by rare processes, couplings to electrons
by LEP and the LHC is not sensitive to final states involving taus in this
case. The ILC becomes then complementary to the LHC as it will provide the best
limits on $Z'$ couplings to tau leptons. A prominent example is the case of the
anomaly-free $Z'$ coupling to the muon minus tau lepton number ${\rm L}_\mu -
{\rm L}_\tau$. If no departure from the Standard Model is observed at the LHC,
the most stringent bounds on this vector boson are provided from events with
only three charged leptons plus missing energy. Masses of the order of 1 TeV
can be probed at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC for $Z^\prime$ couplings
of order one. Generic four-lepton operators parametrizing leptophilic
interactions can be also constrained using three and four (or two at the ILC)

carbon/oxygen white dwarf (WD). This mechanism is one possible origin for
supernovae (SNe) with faint and fast-decaying light curves, such as .Ia SNe and
Ca-rich transients. Our initial ejecta conditions at 1d are given by the 0.18B
explosion model COp45HEp2 of Waldman et al.. The 0.2Msun ejecta initially
contains 0.11Msun of He, 0.03Msun of Ca, and 0.03Msun of Ti. We obtain a ~5d
rise to a bolometric maximum of 3.59x10^41 erg/s, primarily powered by 48V
decay. Multi-band light curves show distinct morphologies, with a rise to
maximum magnitude (-14.3 to -16.7mag) that varies between 3 to 9d from the U to
the K bands. Near-IR light curves show no secondary maximum. Because of the
presence of both HeI and SiII lines at early times we obtain a hybrid Type
Ia/Ib classification. During the photospheric phase line blanketing is caused
primarily by TiII. At nebular times, the spectra show strong CaII lines in the
optical (but no [OI] 6300--6364A emission), and TiII in the near-IR. Overall,
these results match qualitatively the very disparate properties of .Ia SNe and
Ca-rich transients. Although the strong TiII blanketing and red colors that we
predict are rarely observed, they are seen, for example, in OGLE-2013- SN-079.
Furthermore, we obtain a faster light-curve evolution than, for example,
PTF10iuv, indicating an ejecta mass >0.2Msun. An alternate scenario may be the
merger of two WDs, one or both composed of He.

environmentally-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently
reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of
identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation
by guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical
failure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the
qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in
quantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from
environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors
with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a
natural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track
errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition
(QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the
failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits
and a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we
tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of
environmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the
many exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting

itself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high
metallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of
the 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel
detector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional
decorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically
different method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which
we call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect
very effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the
fluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and
validate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to
previous analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in
Spitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be
intractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b
eclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating
inefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong
molecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5
micron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by
Spitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All
four eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a
slightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with
extant RV data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and
establishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.
Given the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another
excellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other
three-body mechanism.

same model as removing the elements of the OLS solution with the largest

regression to the preconditioned Lasso; this result is for the high dimensional
setting, p > n. Where the standard Lasso is akin to forward selection [Efron et

akin to backward elimination. These results hold for sparse penalties beyond

magnetic fields of $\sim$1-5 mG associated with three roughly parsec-sized

comparable strengths and the same direction as features at the same velocity

between single dish and VLBI results provides critical validation of previous

The measured magnetic field strengths indicate that magnetic energy densities
are comparable to gravitational energy in OH maser clouds. We also compare our
total intensity results to previously published VLBI observations of OH
megamasers in Arp 220. We find evidence for changes in both structure and

to construct a secondary index map from the space of positive scalar metrics to
a suitable space from the real $K$-theory spectrum. Our main results concern
the nontriviality of this map. We prove that for $2n \geq 6$, the natural
$KO$-orientation from the infinite loop space of the Madsen--Tillmann--Weiss
spectrum factors (up to homotopy) through the space of metrics of positive
scalar curvature on any $2n$-dimensional spin manifold. For manifolds of odd
dimension $2n+1 \geq 7$, we prove the existence of a similar factorisation.
  When combined with computational methods from homotopy theory, these results
have strong implications. For example, the secondary index map is surjective on
all rational homotopy groups. We also present more refined calculations
concerning integral homotopy groups.
  To prove our results we use three major sets of technical tools and results.
The first set of tools comes from Riemannian geometry: we use a parameterised
version of the Gromov--Lawson surgery technique which allows us to apply
homotopy-theoretic techniques to spaces of metrics of positive scalar
curvature. Secondly, we relate Hitchin's secondary index to several other
index-theoretical results, such as the Atiyah--Singer family index theorem, the
additivity theorem for indices on noncompact manifolds and the spectral-flow
index theorem. Finally, we use the results and tools developed recently in the
study of moduli spaces of manifolds and cobordism categories. The key new
ingredient we use in this paper is the high-dimensional analogue of the
Madsen--Weiss theorem, proven by Galatius and the third named author.

than $\sim$ 1 Gyr could have been in runaway greenhouses for several hundred
Myr following their formation due to the star's extended pre-main sequence
phase, provided they form with abundant surface water. Such prolonged runaway
greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth.
During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen
escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from
planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is
energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost
scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux
is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing
potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may
build up hundreds to thousands of bars of abiotically produced O$_2$, resulting
in potential false positives for life. The amount of O$_2$ that builds up also
scales with the planet mass; we find that O$_2$ builds up at a constant rate
that is controlled by diffusion: $\sim$ 5 bars/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up
to $\sim$ 25 bars/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered
super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many
as 2000 bars of O$_2$ due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The
fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the
duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at
which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial
phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial

methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH). At scales larger than 10,000 AU, molecules (e.g.,
SO$_2$ or OCS) mostly with low excitation temperatures in the upper states

thermal (free-free) jet emerging from this object with a similar orientation at
the base. At much smaller scales (about 1000 AU), molecules with high

the exact, but unclosed, equation governing the radial distribution function

$St_r$ is the Stokes number based on the eddy turnover timescale at separation
$r$, the clustering in the inertial range can be understood to be due to the
preferential sampling of the coarse-grained fluid velocity gradient tensor at
that scale. When ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$ this mechanism gives way to a
non-local clustering mechanism. These findings reveal that the clustering
mechanisms in the inertial range are analogous to the mechanisms that we
identified for the dissipation regime (see \emph{New J. Phys.}
\textbf{16}:055013, 2014). Further, we discuss the similarities and differences
between the clustering mechanisms we identify in the inertial range and the
""sweep-stick"" mechanism developed by Coleman \& Vassilicos (Phys. Fluids
21:113301, 2009). We argue that when ${St_r\ll1}$ the sweep-stick mechanism is
equivalent to our mechanism in the inertial range if the particles are
suspended in Navier-Stokes turbulence, but that the sweep-stick mechanism
breaks down for ${St_r\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The argument also explains why
the sweep-stick mechanism is unable to predict particle clustering in kinematic
simulations. We then consider the closed, model equation for the RDF given in
Zaichik \& Alipchenkov (Phys. Fluids. 19:113308, 2007) and use this, together
with the results from our analysis, to predict the analytic form of the RDF in

from high-sensitivity cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.
Gravitational waves can induce a rotational component of the weak-lensing
deflection angle, usually referred to as the curl mode, which would be
imprinted on the CMB maps. Using the technique of reconstructing lensing
signals involved in CMB maps, this curl mode can be measured in an unbiased
manner, offering an independent confirmation of the gravitational waves
complementary to the B-mode polarization experiments. Based on the Fisher
matrix analysis, we first show that with the noise levels necessary to confirm
the consistency relation for the primordial gravitational waves, the future CMB
experiments will be able to detect the gravitational-wave induced lensing
signals. For a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r < 0.1$, even if the consistency
relation is difficult to confirm with a high significance, the
gravitational-wave induced lensing would be detected at more than $3\,\sigma$
significance level. Further, we point out that high-sensitivity experiments
will be also powerful to constrain the gravitational waves generated after the
recombination epoch. Compared to the B-mode polarization, the curl mode is
particularly sensitive to gravitational waves generated at low redshifts ($z <
10$) with a low frequency ($k < 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and it could give a much
tighter constraint on their energy density $\Omega_{\rm GW}$ by more than three

consider the system of regular and fractional D3-branes at the tip. We present
the non-abelian T-duals associated with these backgrounds and study their

studying couplings and the central charge of the dual field theory. We also
analyze the supersymmetry of the dual solutions and show that for the system of

""Suppose that $F_{2, m}$ is a 2-generated associative ring with the identity

$\Psi(n,d,l)=l (nd)^{C \log (nd)}$ and $C$ is a constant. We give the
definitive answer to E. I. Zelmanov by this result. It is the consequence of
one fact, which is based on combinatorics of words. Let $l, n$ and $d>n$ be
positive integers. Then all the words over alphabet of cardinality $l$ which
length is greater than $\Psi(n,d,l)$ are either $n$-divided or contain $d$-th
power of subword, where a word $W$ is $n$-divided, if it can be represented in
the following form $W=W_0 W_1\dots W_n$ such that $W_n \prec
W_{n-1}\prec\cdots\prec W_1$. The symbol $\prec$ means lexicographical order

However, the original problem of WLDA is non-convex and difficult to optimize.
In this paper, we reformulate the optimization problem of WLDA into a sequence

quasi-Newton methods and eigen-decomposition being the core components. The
proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than standard interior-point

small rank, its rank is preserved (up to a constant factor in the lossy case)
by at least one of the maps.
  We then compose a tensoring operation with our lossy rank condenser to
construct constant-degree dimension expanders over polynomially large fields.
That is, we give $O(1)$ explicit linear maps $A_i:\mathbb{F}^n\to \mathbb{F}^n$
such that for any subspace $V \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ of dimension at most
$n/2$, $\dim\bigl( \sum_i A_i(V)\bigr) \ge (1+\Omega(1)) \dim(V)$. Previous
constructions of such constant-degree dimension expanders were based on
Kazhdan's property $T$ (for the case when $\mathbb{F}$ has characteristic zero)
or monotone expanders (for every field $\mathbb{F}$); in either case the
construction was harder than that of usual vertex expanders. Our construction,
on the other hand, is simpler.
  Via an equivalence to linear rank-metric codes, we then construct optimal
lossless two-source condensers. We then use our seeded rank condensers to
obtain near-optimal lossy two-source condensers for constant rank sources.

original model by introducing two pseudo-pressures, one of them is shown to
satisfy a diffusion equation, we then propose a time-stepping algorithm which
decouples (or couples) the reformulated PDE problem at each time step into two
sub-problems, one of which is a generalized Stokes problem for the displacement

distribution and specifying the curved magnetic field lines that constitute a
coronal loop. This loop is described by 2D, ideal magnetohydro- dynamic
equations that are numerically solved by the FLASH code. Results. The vertical
kink oscillations are excited by a periodic driver in the vertical component of
velocity, acting at the top of the photosphere. For this forced driver with its
amplitude 3 km/s, the excited oscillations exhibit about 1.2 km/s amplitude in

  Pooling for Image Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A number of recent studies have shown that a Deep Convolutional Neural
Network (DCNN) pretrained on a large dataset can be adopted as a universal
image description which leads to astounding performance in many visual
classification tasks. Most of these studies, if not all, adopt activations of
the fully-connected layer of a DCNN as the image or region representation and
it is believed that convolutional layer activations are less discriminative.
  This paper, however, advocates that if used appropriately convolutional layer
activations can be turned into a powerful image representation which enjoys
many advantages over fully-connected layer activations. This is achieved by
adopting a new technique proposed in this paper called
cross-convolutional-layer pooling. More specifically, it extracts subarrays of
feature maps of one convolutional layer as local features and pools the
extracted features with the guidance of feature maps of the successive
convolutional layer. Compared with exising methods that apply DCNNs in the
local feature setting, the proposed method is significantly faster since it
requires much fewer times of DCNN forward computation. Moreover, it avoids the
domain mismatch issue which is usually encountered when applying fully
connected layer activations to describe local regions. By applying our method
to four popular visual classification tasks, it is demonstrated that the
proposed method can achieve comparable or in some cases significantly better
performance than existing fully-connected layer based image representations
while incurring much lower computational cost.

exhibit inconsistent behaviors over time. Examples are procrastination where
agents tends to costly postpone easy tasks, and abandonments where agents start
a plan and quit in the middle. These behaviors are undesirable in the sense
that agents make clearly suboptimal decisions over optimal ones. To capture
such behaviors and more importantly, to quantify inefficiency caused by such
behaviors, [Kleinberg & Oren 2014] propose a graph model which is essentially
same as the standard planning model except for the cost structure. Using this
model, they initiate the study of several interesting problems: 1) cost ratio:
the worst ratio between the actual cost of the agent and the optimal cost, over
all graph instances; 2) motivating subgraph: how to motivate the agent to reach
the goal by deleting nodes and edges; 3) Intermediate rewards: how to motivate
agents to reach the goal by placing intermediate rewards. Kleinberg and Oren
give partial answers to these questions, but the main problems are still open.
In fact, they raise these problems explicitly as open problems in their paper.
In this paper, we give answers to all three open problems in [Kleinberg & Oren
2014]. First, we show a tight upper bound of cost ratio for graphs without
Akerlof's structure, thus confirm the conjecture by Kleinberg and Oren that
Akerlof's structure is indeed the worst case for cost ratio. Second, we prove
that finding a motivating subgraph is NP-hard, showing that it is generally
inefficient to motivate agents by deleting nodes and edges in the graph. Last
but not least, we show that computing a strategy to place minimum amount of
total reward is also NP-hard. Therefore, it is computational inefficient to
motivate agents by placing intermediate rewards. The techniques we use to prove
these results are nontrivial and of independent interests.

mass field, the linear galaxies bias, b(z) appears ubiquitously both in
theoretical calculations and in observational measurements related to galaxy
surveys. However, the generic approaches to the galaxy density is a non-local
and stochastic function of the underlying dark matter density and it becomes
difficult to make the analytic form of b(z). Due to this fact, b(z) is known as
a nuisance parameter and the effort has been made to measure bias free
observable quantities. We provide the exact and analytic function of b(z) which
also can be measured from galaxy surveys using the redshift space distortions
parameters, more accurately unbiased observable \beta \sigma_{\rm{gal}} = f

gravity theories. One can generalize these approximate solutions to be exact
when one solves the exact evolutions for the dark matter density fluctuation of
given gravity theories. These analytic solutions for b(z) make it advantage
instead of nuisance.

We consider a spherical shell of the domain wall with tension $\sigma$
collapsing in a spherically-symmetric dust universe, which is initially
separated into the open Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe inside
the shell and the Einstein-de Sitter universe outside. The domain wall shell
collapses due to the tension, and sweeps the dust fluid. The universe after the
collapse becomes inhomogeneous and is described by the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi

dynamical equations obtained from Israel's junction conditions applied to this
system. We find that a black hole forms after the domain wall collapse for any
initial condition, and that the black hole mass at the moment of its formation
is universally given by $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 17 \sigma/H_{\rm hc}$, where $H_{\rm
hc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the time when the shell radius becomes equal to
the Hubble radius. We also find that the dust fluid is distributed as
$\rho\propto R^{3/2}$ near the central region after the collapse, where $R$ is
the area radius. These features would provide observable signatures of a
spherical domain wall generated in the early universe.

  Survival Analysis",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The mean residual life function is a key functional for a survival
distribution. It has a practically useful interpretation as the expected
remaining lifetime given survival up to a particular time point, and it also
characterizes the survival distribution. However, it has received limited
attention in terms of inference methods under a probabilistic modeling
framework. We seek to provide general inference methodology for mean residual
life regression. Survival data often include a set of predictor variables for
the survival response distribution, and in many cases it is natural to include
the covariates as random variables into the modeling. We thus employ Dirichlet
process mixture modeling for the joint stochastic mechanism of the covariates
and survival responses. This approach implies a flexible model structure for
the mean residual life of the conditional response distribution, allowing
general shapes for mean residual life as a function of covariates given a
specific time point, as well as a function of time given particular values of
the covariate vector. To expand the scope of the modeling framework, we extend
the mixture model to incorporate dependence across experimental groups, such as
treatment and control groups. This extension is built from a dependent
Dirichlet process prior for the group-specific mixing distributions, with
common locations and weights that vary across groups through latent bivariate
Beta distributed random variables. We develop properties of the regression
models, and discuss methods for prior specification and posterior inference.
The different components of the methodology are illustrated with simulated data
examples, and the model is also applied to a data set comprising right censored
survival times.

the SO coupling. They can be induced at negative s-wave scattering lengths and
with smaller mass ratios than those without SO coupling. These results are

multilinear arithmetic formulas. Using the known relation between black-box PIT
and lower bounds we obtain lower bounds for these models.
  For depth-3 multilinear formulas, of size $\exp(n^\delta)$, we give a hitting
set of size $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{2/3 + 2\delta/3}))$. This implies a lower bound
of $\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2}))$ for depth-3 multilinear formulas, for some

set of size $\exp(\tilde{O}(n^{2/3 + 4\delta/3}))$. This implies a lower bound
of $\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/4}))$ for depth-4 multilinear formulas, for some
explicit polynomial.
  A regular formula consists of alternating layers of $+,\times$ gates, where
all gates at layer $i$ have the same fan-in. We give a hitting set of size
(roughly) $\exp\left(n^{1- \delta} \right)$, for regular depth-$d$ multilinear
formulas of size $\exp(n^\delta)$, where $\delta = O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}^d})$.
This result implies a lower bound of roughly
$\exp(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}^d}}))$ for such formulas.
  We note that better lower bounds are known for these models, but also that
none of these bounds was achieved via construction of a hitting set. Moreover,
no lower bound that implies such PIT results, even in the white-box model, is
currently known.
  Our results are combinatorial in nature and rely on reducing the underlying
formula, first to a depth-4 formula, and then to a read-once algebraic
branching program (from depth-3 formulas we go straight to read-once algebraic

~30 kG, one of the strongest known for any non-degenerate star. We used
time-series of high-resolution HARPS intensity and circular polarisation
observations. These data were interpreted with the help of magnetic Doppler
imaging and model atmospheres incorporating effects of a non-solar chemical
composition and a strong magnetic field. We refined the rotational period of HD
75049 to Prot=4.048267+/-0.000036 d. We also derived basic stellar parameters,
Teff=10250+/-250 K and logg=4.3+/-0.1. Magnetic Doppler imaging revealed that
the field topology of HD 75049 is poloidal and dominated by a dipolar
contribution with a peak surface field strength of 39 kG. At the same time,
deviations from the classical axisymmetric oblique dipolar configuration are
significant. Chemical surface maps of Si, Cr, Fe, and Nd show abundance
contrasts of 0.5-1.4 dex, which is low compared with many other Ap stars. Nd is
found to be enhanced close to the magnetic pole, whereas Si and Cr are
concentrated predominantly at the magnetic equator. The iron distribution shows
low-contrast features both at the magnetic equator and the pole. The morphology
of the magnetic field and the properties of chemical spots in HD 75049 are
qualitatively similar to those of Ap stars with weaker fields. Consequently,
whatever mechanism forms and sustains global magnetic fields in

modulation is considered and the set of the model parameters is chosen which
allows the description of the observed GCR intensity distributions at the
moments of the maximum GCR intensity in two solar minima (1987 and 1997) normal
for the second half of the last century. Then we try to describe with the above
model and set of parameters the unusually soft GCR energy spectra at the
moments of the maximum GCR intensity in the last solar minimum between cycles
23 and 24 (2009). Our main conclusion is that the most simple way to do so is
to reduce the size of the modulation region and, probably, change the rigidity
dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The change of both parameters is

small groups of equal size. Downlink beamforming is then done in such a way

and is cancelled through successive interference pre-subtraction at the BS

from user selection, since it is a method for precoding of information to the
selected (scheduled) users, and not for selecting which users are to be
scheduled. Through analysis and simulations, the proposed user grouping based
precoder is shown to achieve significant improvement in the achievable sum rate
when compared to the ZF precoder. When users are paired (i.e., each group has
two users), the complexity of the proposed precoder is $O(N_u^3) + O(N_u^2

decrease the Fermi velocity in the linear dispersion relation of the surface

improved by adding redundant parity checks to tighten the LP relaxation. We
prove that for LDPC codes, even if we include all redundant checks,
asymptotically there is no gain in the LP decoder threshold on the BSC under
certain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show that if the graph
has bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic
strength, then including high degree redundant checks in the LP does not
significantly improve the threshold in the following sense: for each constant
delta>0, there is a constant k>0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder
containing all redundant checks of degree at most k improves by at most delta
upon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger than k. We conclude
that if the graph satisfies a rigidity condition, then including all redundant
checks does not improve the threshold of the base LP. We call the graph
asymptotically strong if the LP decoder corrects a constant fraction of errors
even if the LLRs of the correct variables are arbitrarily small. By building on
the work of Feldman et al.(2007) and Viderman(2013), we show that asymptotic
strength follows from sufficiently large expansion. We also give a geometric
interpretation of asymptotic strength in terms pseudocodewords. We call the
graph rigid if the minimum weight of a sum of check nodes involving a cycle
tends to infinity as the block length tends to infinity. Under the assumptions
that the graph girth is logarithmic and the minimum check degree is at least 3,
rigidity is equivalent to the nondegeneracy property that adding at least
logarithmically many checks does not give a constant weight check. We argue
that nondegeneracy is a typical property of random check-regular graphs.

solving general BQPs--spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each
with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and
easy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a
tighter bound, but its computational complexity is high, especially for large
scale problems. In this work, we present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with
two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to
conventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods,
the new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable
dual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral
methods. We then propose two solvers, namely, quasi-Newton and smoothing Newton
methods, for the dual problem. Both of them are significantly more efficiently
than standard interior-point methods. In practice, the smoothing Newton solver
is faster than the quasi-Newton solver for dense or medium-sized problems,
while the quasi-Newton solver is preferable for large sparse/structured
problems. Our experiments on a few computer vision applications including
clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration show the
potential of our SDP formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.

inside a proton are correlated among each other and could represent a tool to
explore the 3D proton structure. In recent papers, double parton correlations
have been studied in the valence quark region, by means of constituent quark
models. This framework allows to understand clearly the dynamical origin of the
correlations and to establish which, among the features of the results, are
model independent. Recent relevant results, obtained in a relativistic
light-front scheme, able to overcome some drawbacks of previous calculations,
such as the poor support, will be presented. Peculiar transverse momentum
correlations, generated by the correct treatment of the boosts, are obtained.
The role of spin correlations will be also shown. In this covariant approach,
the symmetries of the dPDFs are unambiguously reproduced. The study of the QCD
evolution of the model results has been performed in the valence sector,
showing that, in some cases, the effect of evolution does not cancel that of
correlations.

celestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. While already being
investigated at GeV energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse
$\gamma$-ray emission at TeV energies remain sparse. After completion of the
systematic survey of the inner Galaxy, the H.E.S.S. experiment is in a prime
position to observe large-scale diffuse emission at TeV energies. Data of the
H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey are investigated in regions off known
$\gamma$-ray sources. Corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were made
over an extensive grid of celestial locations. Longitudinal and latitudinal
profiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excess
emission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. For the first time
large-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the Galactic Plane using imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes has been observed. While the background
subtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on the
scale of the H.E.S.S. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of the
inverse Compton scatter-induced Galactic diffuse emission, contributions of
neutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources can
be recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. Calculations show that
the minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significant
contribution to the total signal. This detection is interpreted as a mix of
diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

particular, we prove that this strong condition is fulfilled by applying the
so-called conformal Laplace-Beltrami quantization prescription, where the
conformal Laplacian operator contains the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator on
the underlying manifold plus a term proportional to its scalar curvature (which
in both cases has non-constant value). In this way, the eigenvalue problems for
the quantum counterparts of ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ can be
rigorously solved, and it is found that their discrete spectrum is just a

the production of heavy resonances decaying into top-antitop quark pairs in the
semileptonic final state using pp collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 8 TeV recorded with
the CMS detector is presented.
  The analysis focuses on the semileptonic decay channels into electrons or
muons and covers the range of 0.5-3 TeV in the invariant mass of the $t\bar{t}$
pairs where the events present specific and different topologies. Therefore two
dedicated analyses have been performed to achieve the best sensitivity on the
whole invariant mass range: the threshold analysis (0.5-2 TeV) which is
optimized for $t\bar{t}$ production at the kinematic production threshold,
using standard top quark reconstruction techniques, and the boosted analysis
(1-3 TeV) optimized for $t\bar{t}$ produced with high Lorentz boosts, using
dedicated techniques for boosted top quarks reconstruction.
  No evidence of signal has been found. Thus the following limits at 95% C.L.
on the production of non-SM particles in specific models are set: topcolor
Z$^{\prime}$ bosons with a width of 1.2 (10) % of its mass are excluded for
masses below 2.1 TeV (up to 2.7 TeV). In addition, Kaluza-Klein excitations of

We present a method, named photo-type, to identify and accurately

Methods. We created a catalogue of point sources with photometry in 8 bands,
ranging from 0.75 to 4.6 microns, selected from an area of 3344 deg^2, by
combining SDSS, UKIDSS LAS, and WISE data. Sources with 13.0 < J < 17.5, and Y
- J > 0.8, were then classified by comparison against template colours of
quasars, stars, and brown dwarfs. The L and T templates, spectral types L0 to
T8, were created by identifying previously known sources with spectroscopic
classifications, and fitting polynomial relations between colour and spectral
type. Results. Of the 192 known L and T dwarfs with reliable photometry in the
surveyed area and magnitude range, 189 are recovered by our selection and
classification method. We have quantified the accuracy of the classification
method both externally, with spectroscopy, and internally, by creating
synthetic catalogues and accounting for the uncertainties. We find that,
brighter than J = 17.5, photo-type classifications are accurate to one spectral
sub-type, and are therefore competitive with spectroscopic classifications. The
resultant catalogue of 1157 L and T dwarfs will be presented in a companion
paper.

  arXiv:1112.6238 by other authors",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the dynamics of quantum dissension for three qubit states in various
dissipative channels such as amplitude damping, dephasing and depolarizing. Our
study is solely based on Markovian environments where quantum channels are
without memory and each qubit is coupled to its own environment. We start with
mixed GHZ, mixed W, mixture of separable states, a mixed biseparable state, as
the initial states and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is
asymptotic in contrast to sudden death of quantum entanglement in similar
environments. This is a clear indication of the fact that quantum correlation
in general is more robust against the effect of noise. However, for a given
class of initial mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension
for a certain interval of time. More precisely, we observe the revival of
quantum correlation to happen for certain time period. This signifies that the
measure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord, quantum dissension,
defined from the information theoretic perspective is different from the
correlation defined from the entanglement-separability paradigm and can
increase under the effect of the local noise. We also study the effects of
these channels on the monogamy score of each of these initial states.
Interestingly, we find that for certain class of states and channels, there is
change from negative values to positive values of the monogamy score with
classical randomness as well as with time. This gives us an important insight
in obtaining states which are freely sharable (polygamous state) from the
states which are not freely sharable (monogamous). This is indeed a remarkable
feature, as we can create monogamous states from polygamous states Monogamous
states are considered to have more signatures of quantum ness and can be used
for security purpose.

concentrated toward the centers of galactic discs. This suggests that galaxies
should have inhomogeneous metal distributions with strong radial gradients, but
observations of present-day galaxies show only shallow gradients with little
azimuthal variation, implying the existence of a redistribution mechanism. We
study the role of gravitational instability-driven turbulence as a mixing
mechanism by simulating an isolated galactic disc at high resolution, including
metal fields treated as passive scalars. Since any cylindrical field can be
decomposed into a sum of Fourier-Bessel basis functions, we set up initial
metal fields characterized by these functions and study how different modes
mix. We find both shear and turbulence contribute to mixing, but the mixing
strongly depends on the symmetries of the mode. Non-axisymmetric modes have
decay times smaller than the galactic orbital period because shear winds them
up to small spatial scales, where they are erased by turbulence. The decay
timescales for axisymmetric modes are much greater, though for all but the
largest-scale inhomogeneities the mixing timescale is still short enough to
erase chemical inhomogeneities over cosmological times. These different
timescales provide an explanation for why galaxies retain metallicity gradients
while there is almost no variation at a fixed radius. Moreover, the
comparatively long timescales required for mixing axisymmetric modes may
explain the greater diversity of metallicity gradients observed in high
redshift galaxies as compared to local ones: these systems have not yet reached
equilibrium between metal production and diffusion.

bacteria, adhesion polymers play a crucial role for the initiation of
colonization. Some bacteria express, on their surface, attachment organelles
(pili) that comprise subunits formed into stiff helix-like structures that
possess unique biomechanical properties. These helix-like structures possess a
high degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility.
This has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host
surfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like
pili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a
limited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on
the tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria
adhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed
by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic
flows. The results indicate that for moderate flows (~25 mm/s) the force
experienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be
reduced by a factor of ~6 and ~4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides
a bacterium with a ""go with the flow"" possibility that acts as a damping. It is
surmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the
adhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for
bacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing
actions.

Carlo MOCCA simulations of star cluster evolution are compared to the

demonstrated that the observed dependence on cluster mass of both the binary
fraction and the ratio of the binary fractions inside and outside of the half
mass radius are well recovered by the MOCCA simulations. This is due to a rapid
decrease in the initial binary fraction due to the strong density-dependent
destruction of wide binaries described by Marks, Kroupa & Oh (2011). We also
discuss a new scenario for the formation of intermediate mass black holes in
dense star clusters. In this scenario, intermediate mass black holes are formed
as a result of dynamical interactions of hard binaries containing a stellar
mass black hole, with other stars and binaries. We will discuss the necessary
conditions to initiate the process of intermediate mass black hole formation
and the dependence of its mass accretion rate on the global cluster properties.

sequence of the mixture source is chosen from the source $i \in \{1,\ldots

probability vector $\mathbf{w} = (w_1,\ldots,w_K)$. The average minimax
redundancy of the universal compression of a new random sequence of length $n$
is derived when the encoder and the decoder have a common side information of
$T$ sequences generated independently by the mixture source. Necessary and
sufficient conditions on the distribution $\mathbf{w}$ and the mixture
parameter dimensions $\mathbf{d} = (d_1,\ldots,d_K)$ are determined such that
the side information provided by the previous sequences results in a reduction
in the first-order term of the average codeword length compared with the
universal compression without side information. Further, it is proved that the
optimal compression with side information corresponds to the clustering of the
side information sequences from the mixture source. Then, a clustering
technique is presented to better utilize the side information by classifying
the data sequences from a mixture source. Finally, the performance of the
clustering on the universal compression with side information is validated
using computer simulations on real network data traces.

for the (1+1)--dimensional case, namely, for the longitudinally boost invariant
and cylindrically symmetric flow. This new approach is consistent with the well
established framework of Israel and Stewart in the close to equilibrium limit
(where we expect viscous hydrodynamics to work well). If we consider the

in patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different frequencies is
lifted when ever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significant

limit both $\rho$ and $S_g$ depend on temperature ($T$) in a power law fashion

$5$ and $3$ due to DP and PE scattering respectively. On the other hand,
$\nu_T$ is $4$ and $2$ due to DP and PE scattering, respectively for
phonon-drag thermopower. Additionally, we find numerically that $\nu_T$ depends
on Rashba parameter ($\alpha$) and electron density ($n$). The dependence of
$\nu_T$ on $\alpha$ becomes more prominent at lower density. We also study the

cosmological variation of the speed of light and therefore distortions of the
Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum which are known to be very small. The
conformal coupling to baryons leads to a variation of particle masses since Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis which is also tightly constrained. We consider the
background cosmology of Galileon models coupled to Cold Dark Matter (CDM),
photons and baryons and impose that the speed of light and particle masses
respect the observational bounds on cosmological time scales. We find that
requiring that the equation of state for the Galileon models must be close to

combination of the conformal and disformal couplings. This leads to large
variations of particle masses and the speed of light which are not compatible

in computer vision for a long time, as visual features are not stable under
large view point changes. In this paper, given a single input image of an
object, we synthesize new features for other views of the same object. To
accomplish this, we introduce an aligned set of 3D models in the same class as
the input object image. Each 3D model is represented by a set of views, and we
study the correlation of image patches between different views, seeking what we
call surrogates --- patches in one view whose feature content predicts well the
features of a patch in another view. In particular, for each patch in the novel
desired view, we seek surrogates from the observed view of the given image. For
a given surrogate, we predict that surrogate using linear combination of the
corresponding patches of the 3D model views, learn the coefficients, and then
transfer these coefficients on a per patch basis to synthesize the features of
the patch in the novel view. In this way we can create feature sets for all
views of the latent object, providing us a multi-view representation of the
object. View-invariant object comparisons are achieved simply by computing the
$L^2$ distances between the features of corresponding views. We provide
theoretical and empirical analysis of the feature synthesis process, and
evaluate the proposed view-agnostic distance (VAD) in fine-grained image
retrieval (100 object classes) and classification tasks. Experimental results
show that our synthesized features do enable view-independent comparison
between images and perform significantly better than traditional image features
in this respect.

correctly interpret the flux densities imaging was done with two different
methods: multi-scale multi-frequency synthesis and spectral windows stacking.
The final resolutions and sensitivities of these maps are 0.7"" with rms = 4.6
muJy/beam and 0.9"" with rms = 4.8 muJy/beam respectively. With a 7 sigma
detection we find that the entire observed 3 GHz radio emission can be

old synchrotron electron population or shocks generated by the outflow from the

law form of the waiting time distribution of consecutive interactions, is
expected to produce aging effects in the corresponding time-integrated network.
Here we propose an analytically tractable model, in which interactions among
the agents are ruled by a renewal process, and that is able to reproduce this
aging behavior. We develop an analytic solution for the topological properties
of the integrated network produced by the model, finding that the time
translation invariance of the degree distribution is broken. We validate our
predictions against numerical simulations, and we check for the presence of
aging effects in a empirical temporal network, ruled by bursty social
interactions.

  press",,,,"cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic response of loads has a significant effect on system stability and
directly determines the stability margin of the operating point. Inherent
uncertainty and natural variability of load models make the stability
assessment especially difficult and may compromise the security of the system.
We propose a novel mathematical ""robust stability"" criterion for the assessment
of small-signal stability of operating points. Whenever the criterion is
satisfied for a given operating point, it provides mathematical guarantees that
the operating point will be stable with respect to small disturbances for any
dynamic response of the loads. The criterion can be naturally used for
identification of operating regions secure from the occurrence of Hopf
bifurcation. Several possible applications of the criterion are discussed, most
importantly the concept of Robust Stability Assessment (RSA) that could be
integrated in dynamic security assessment packages and used in contingency
screening and other planning and operational studies.

  Graphs","7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a sufficient condition that guarantees
identifiability of linear network dynamic systems exhibiting continuous-time
weighted consensus protocols with acyclic structure. Each edge of the
underlying network graph $\mathcal G$ of the system is defined by a constant
parameter, referred to as the weight of the edge, while each node is defined by
a scalar state whose dynamics evolve as the weighted linear combination of its
difference with the states of its neighboring nodes. Following the classical
definitions of identifiability and indistinguishability, we first derive a
condition that ensure the identifiability of the edge weights of $\mathcal G$
in terms of the associated transfer function. Using this characterization, we
propose a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees identifiability of the
edge weights. We describe our results using several illustrative examples.

partisan and independent voters. Given that partisans are not likely to convert
to a different party, a main goal for a party could be to mobilize independent
voters toward the party with the help of strong leadership, mass media,
partisans, and effects of peer-to-peer influence. Based on the exact solution
of the classical voter model dynamics in the presence of perfectly partisan
voters (i.e., zealots), we propose a computational method to maximize the share
of the party in a social network of independent voters by pinning control
strategy. The party, corresponding to the controller or zealots, optimizes the
nodes to be controlled given the information about the connectivity of
independent voters and the set of nodes that the opponent party controls. We
show that controlling hubs is generally a good strategy, whereas the optimized
strategy is even better. The superiority of the optimized strategy is
particularly eminent when the independent voters are connected as directed
rather than undirected networks.
