means of cellular automata technique. Attitude of members of a group towards
work is measured by an indicator of loyalty to the group (the number of agents
who carry out their tasks), and lack of loyalty (the number of agents, who give
their tasks to other agents). Initially, all agents realize scheduled tasks
one-by-one. Agents with the number of scheduled tasks larger than a given
threshold change their strategy to unloyal one and start avoiding completing
tasks by passing them to their colleagues. Optionally, in some conditions, we
allow agents to return to loyal state; hence the rule is hysteretic. Results
are presented on an influence of i) the density of tasks, ii) the threshold
number of tasks assigned to the agents' forcing him/her for strategy change on
the system efficiency. We show that a `black' scenario of the system stacking
in a `jammed phase' (with all agents preferring unloyal strategy and having
plenty tasks scheduled for realization) may be avoided when return to loyalty
is allowed and either i) the number of agents chosen for task realization, or
ii) the number of assigned tasks, or iii) the threshold value of assigned
tasks, which force the agent to conversion from loyal strategy to unloyal one,

him/her to task redistribution among his/her neighbors, are smartly chosen.

investigating the origin and formation history of our Galaxy by collecting
spectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 Milky Way stars) of all
Galactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. The survey uses
globular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellar
atmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars in
clusters, along with radial velocity determinations. We used precise radial
velocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (NGC 1851, NGC
2808, NGC 4372, NGC 4833, NGC 5927, NGC 6752, and NGC 7078) to validate
pipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internal
kinematics. Radial velocity measurements were extracted from FLAMES/GIRAFFE
spectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal data
release of data products to ESO. We complemented our sample with ESO archival
data obtained with different instrument configurations. Reliable radial
velocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained in
total. We measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,
and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,
providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of the
central velocity dispersion for the cluster NGC~5927. Finally, we explore the
possible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. The
analysis we present here demonstrates that Gaia-ESO survey data are
sufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systems
and stellar populations in the Milky Way.

Estimation is cast as optimization over a dichotomous mixture of variables,
simultaneously determining which regions are inliers with respect to the local
model (binary variables) and the correct co-ordinates in the local model space
for each inlying region (continuous variables). When the regions are organized
into a multi-scale hierarchy, optimization can occur in an efficient and
parallel architecture, where distributed computational units iteratively
perform calculations and share information through sparse connections between

binocular stereo, and it produces a distributional scene representation that is

each node has the same degree $k_i=4$. The periodic boundary conditions are
assumed as well.
  For each node $i$ the links to sites $i+1$ and $i+2$ are rewired to two

  The network's nodes are decorated with spin-like variables $s_i\in\{S,D\}$.
During simulation each $S$ node having a $D$-site in its neighbourhood converts
this neighbour from $D$ to $S$ state. Conversely, a node in $D$ state having at
least one neighbour also in state $D$-state converts all nearest-neighbours of
this pair into $D$-state. The latter is realized with probability $p$.

fixed points in $(\mathcal{C}, p, n_S^0)$ space. The system evolves more often

fixed values $\mathcal{C}$ and $p$) for which their final density is

these matrices to those of graphs that arise as links of $(k-2)$-dimensional
faces. Garland's result concerns the Laplacian; we develop an analogous result
for the adjacency matrix. The same arguments apply to other models of random
complexes which allow for dependencies between the choices of $k$-dimensional
simplices. In the second part of the paper, we apply this to the question of
possible higher-dimensional analogues of the discrete Cheeger inequality, which
in the classical case of graphs relates the eigenvalues of a graph and its edge
expansion. It is very natural to ask whether this generalizes to higher
dimensions and, in particular, whether the higher-dimensional Laplacian spectra
capture the notion of coboundary expansion - a generalization of edge expansion
that arose in recent work of Linial and Meshulam and of Gromov. We show that
this most straightforward version of a higher-dimensional discrete Cheeger
inequality fails, in quite a strong way: For every $k\geq 2$ and $n\in
\mathbb{N}$, there is a $k$-dimensional complex $Y^k_n$ on $n$ vertices that
has strong spectral expansion properties (all nontrivial eigenvalues of the
normalised $k$-dimensional Laplacian lie in the interval
$[1-O(1/\sqrt{n}),1+O(1/\sqrt{n})]$) but whose coboundary expansion is bounded
from above by $O(\log n/n)$ and so tends to zero as $n\rightarrow \infty$;
moreover, $Y^k_n$ can be taken to have vanishing integer homology in dimension
less than $k$.

forced two-layer turbulence with helicity and corresponding large-scale dynamo
action in the lower layer, a magnetic field occurs in the upper layer in the
form of sharply bounded bipolar magnetic spots. Here we extend this model to
spherical wedge geometry covering the northern hemisphere up to 75{\deg}
latitude and an azimuthal extent of 180{\deg}. The kinetic helicity and
therefore also the large-scale magnetic field are strongest at low latitudes.
For moderately strong stratification, several bipolar spots form that fill
eventually the full longitudinal extent. At early times, the polarity of spots
reflects the orientation of the underlying azimuthal field, as expected from
{\Omega}-shaped flux loops. At late times their tilt changes such that there is
a radial field of opposite orientation at different latitudes separated by
about 10{\deg}. Our model demonstrates the spontaneous formation of spots of
sizes much larger than the pressure scale height. Their tendency to produce
filling factors close to unity is argued to be reminiscent of highly active
stars. We confirm that strong stratification and strong scale separation are
essential ingredients behind magnetic spot formation, which appears to be
associated with downflows at larger depths.

model polarization vectors of four ideal-MHD, non-turbulent, cloud core
collapse models. These four models differ by their initial magnetic fields
before collapse; two initially have aligned fields (strong and weak) and two
initially have orthogonal fields (strong and weak) with respect to the rotation
axis of the L1527 core. Only the initial weak orthogonal field model produces
the observed circumstellar disk within L1527. This is a characteristic of
nearly all ideal-MHD, non-turbulent, core collapse models. In this paper we
test whether this weak orthogonal model also has the best agreement between its
magnetic field structure and that inferred from the polarimetry observations of
L1527. We found that this is not the case; based on the polarimetry
observations the most favored model of the four is the weak aligned model.
However, this model does not produce a circumstellar disk, so our result
implies that a non-turbulent, ideal-MHD global collapse model probably does not
represent the core collapse that has occurred in L1527. Our study also
illustrates the importance of using polarization vectors covering a large area
of a cloud core to determine the initial magnetic field orientation before
collapse; the inner core magnetic field structure can be highly altered by a
collapse and so measurements from this region alone can give unreliable
estimates of the initial field configuration before collapse.

routinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and MeV-peaked flat
spectrum radio quasar PKS 1830-211 (z=2.507). Its apparent isotropic gamma-ray
luminosity (E>100 MeV) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peaking
on 2010 October 14/15 at 2.9 X 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightest
high-redshift Fermi blazars. No published model with a single lens can account
for all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radio
observations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 days
after a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. Two large gamma-ray
flares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period
and no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows
us to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the
two lensed images. Swift XRT observations from a dedicated Target of
Opportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significant
correlation of X-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. The spectral energy
distribution can be modeled with inverse Compton scattering of thermal photons
from the dusty torus. The implications of the LAT data in terms of variability,
the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-ray
flux ratios are discussed. Microlensing effects, absorption, size and location
of the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, an
energy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by the
lens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses for
understanding our results.

Rayleigh-Watson and Beran tests deliver a false-alarm probability of 0.5% for

Moving objects, such as vehicles and mobile device users, usually exhibit some
patterns on their velocities, which can be utilized for velocity-based
partitioning to improve performance of the indexes. Existing velocity-based
partitioning techniques rely on some kinds of heuristics rather than
analytically calculate the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel
speed partitioning technique based on a formal analysis over speed values of
the moving objects. We first show that speed partitioning will significantly
reduce the search space expansion which has direct impacts on query performance
of the indexes. Next we formulate the optimal speed partitioning problem based
on search space expansion analysis and then compute the optimal solution using
dynamic programming. We then build the partitioned indexing system where
queries are duplicated and processed in each index partition. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method dramatically improves the performance
of indexes for moving objects and outperforms other state-of-the-art
velocity-based partitioning approaches.

network analysis across various domains, most notably in bioinformatics and

attention. Getting results for 4-vertex patterns is highly challenging, and
there are few practical results known that can scale to massive sizes. Indeed,
even a highly tuned enumeration code takes more than a day on a graph with
millions of edges. Most previous work that runs for truly massive graphs employ
clusters and massive parallelization.
  We provide a sampling algorithm that provably and accurately approximates the
frequencies of all 4-vertex pattern subgraphs. Our algorithm is based on a
novel technique of 3-path sampling and a special pruning scheme to decrease the
variance in estimates. We provide theoretical proofs for the accuracy of our
algorithm, and give formal bounds for the error and confidence of our
estimates. We perform a detailed empirical study and show that our algorithm
provides estimates within 1% relative error for all subpatterns (over a large
class of test graphs), while being orders of magnitude faster than enumeration
and other sampling based algorithms. Our algorithm takes less than a minute (on

four regions of high intensity and the output flux becomes asymmetric due to
the formation of crystalline domains with different orientation. The $\Gamma-M$

suggesting a behavioral game-theoretic model for voters under uncertainty. For
a specific variation of best-response heuristics, they proved initial existence

with different uncertainty levels, simultaneous strategic decisions, and a more
permissive notion of best-response. We prove that a voting equilibrium exists

lies within the region found by lattice inspired calculations. The results show
that in the linear sigma model, the CEP's location in the phase diagram is
expectedly determined solely through chiral symmetry breaking. The same is
likely to be true for all other models which do not exhibit confinement,
provided the proper treatment of the plasma infrared properties for the

promise for learning visual representations. In this paper, we use CNNs for the
task of predicting surface normals from a single image. But what is the right
architecture we should use? We propose to build upon the decades of hard work
in 3D scene understanding, to design new CNN architecture for the task of
surface normal estimation. We show by incorporating several constraints
(man-made, manhattan world) and meaningful intermediate representations (room
layout, edge labels) in the architecture leads to state of the art performance
on surface normal estimation. We also show that our network is quite robust and
show state of the art results on other datasets as well without any
fine-tuning.

phenomenological models of QCD at non-zero temperature and density. Such saddle
points are a consequence of the sign problem, and should be considered in both
theoretical calculations and lattice simulations. Although saddle points in
finite-density QCD are typically in the complex plane, they are constrained by
a symmetry that simplifies analysis. We model the effective potential for
Polyakov loops using two different potential terms for confinement effects, and
consider three different cases for quarks: very heavy quarks, massless quarks
without modeling of chiral symmetry breaking effects, and light quarks with
both deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration effects included in a pair
of PNJL models. In all cases, we find that a single dominant complex saddle
point is required for a consistent description of the model. This saddle point
is generally not far from the real axis; the most easily noticed effect is a
difference between the Polyakov loop expectation values $\left\langle {\rm
Tr}_{F}P\right\rangle $ and $\left\langle {\rm Tr}_{F}P^{\dagger}\right\rangle
$, and that is confined to small region in the $\mu-T$ plane. In all but one
case, a disorder line is found in the region of critical and/or crossover
behavior. The disorder line marks the boundary between exponential decay and
sinusoidally modulated exponential decay of correlation functions. Disorder
line effects are potentially observable in both simulation and experiment.
Precision simulations of QCD in the $\mu-T$ plane have the potential to clearly
discriminate between different models of confinement.

simplified market-sector vine copula framework similar to those introduced by
Heinen and Valdesogo (2008) and Brechmann and Czado (2013), which can be
applied by conditioning asset time series on a market-sector hierarchy of
indexes. While this has been shown by the aforementioned authors to control the
excessive parameterisation of vine copulas in high dimensions, their models
have relied on the provision of externally sourced market and sector indexes,
limiting their wider applicability due to the imposition of restrictions on the
number and composition of such sectors. By implementing the CDCV model, we
demonstrate that such reliance on external indexes is redundant as we can
achieve equivalent or improved performance by deriving a hierarchy of indexes
directly from a clustering of the asset time series, thus abstracting the
modelling process from the underlying data.

A Cauchy ADM formulation is used for the time evolution.
  We find strong evidence that all IVP formulations of pure vacuum Brill
gravitational waves collapse to form singularities/black holes, and we do not
observe critical black hole mass scaling phenomena in the IVP parameter phase
space that has been characterised in non-vacuum systems. A theoretical
framework to prove this result analytically is presented. We discuss the
meaning of Brill metric variables, the topology of trapped surfaces for various
scenarios, and verify other results in the field related to critical values of
initial value parameters and black hole formation approaching spatial infinity.
  The instability of Minkowski (flat) space under Brill wave and more general
perturbations is demonstrated.
  The main numerical tools employed to achieve a stable evolution code are (1)
derivation of appropriate regularity conditions on the lapse function and
metric function q, (2) the move to a 4th order correct discretisation scheme
with appropriate boundary conditions, (3) the use of exponential metric terms,
(4) an understanding of the right mix of free versus constrained evolution and

value pairs (x_1,v_1),(x_2,v_2),...,(x_n,v_n) where the same key may appear
many times. The accumulated value of key x is v(x)=sum{v_i | x_i=x}. For space
reasons, we may not be able to maintain v(x) for every key x, but the sampled
sum is easily maintained as the single value sum{v_i | Sample(x_i)}. Here we
show that when dealing with w-bit integers, if a is a uniform odd w-bit integer
and t is a uniform w-bit integer, then Sample(x)=[ax mod 2^w <= t] is a
distinguisher with probability 1/8. Working with standard units, that is, w=8,
16, 32, 64, we exploit that w-bit multiplication works modulo 2^w, discarding
overflow automatically, and then the sampling decision is implemented by the
C-code a*x<=t. Previous such samplers were much less computer friendly, e.g.,
the distinguisher of Naor and Naor [STOC'90] was more complicated and involved
a 7-independent hash function.

near-infrared survey to investigate the changing relationship be- tween galaxy
stellar mass and the dark matter haloes hosting them to $z\sim2$. We achieve
this by measuring the clustering properties and abundances of a series of
volume-limited galaxy samples selected by stellar mass and star-formation
activity. We interpret these results in the framework of a phenomenological
halo model and numerical simulations. Our measurements span a uniquely large
range in stellar mass and redshift and reach below the characteristic stellar
mass to $z\sim2$. Our results are: 1. At fixed redshift and scale, clustering
amplitude depends monotonically on sample stellar mass threshold; 2. At fixed
angular scale, the projected clustering amplitude decreases with redshift but
the co-moving correlation length remains constant; 3. Characteristic halo
masses and galaxy bias increase with increasing median stellar mass of the
sample; 4. The slope of these relationships is modified in lower mass haloes;
5. Concerning the passive galaxy population, characteristic halo masses are
consistent with a simply less-abundant version of the full galaxy sample, but
at lower redshifts the fraction of satellite galaxies in the passive population
is very different from the full galaxy sample; 6. Finally we find that the
ratio between the characteristic halo mass and median stellar mass at each
redshift bin reaches a peak at ${\log(M_h/M_\odot)}\sim12.2$ and the position
of this peak remains constant out to $z\sim2$. The behaviour of the full and
passively evolving galaxy samples can be understood qualitatively by
considering the slow evolution of the characteristic stellar mass in the
redshift range probed by our survey.

Consequently, the dynamic spin structure factor, $\mathrm{Im}\chi(q,\omega)$,

conventional tensors are replaced by their conformally invariant counterparts,
living in metric measure space. The invariance of the geometrical part of the

identity. In metric measure space, the covariant derivative is the same as it
is in the Riemannian space. Hence, in contrast to the Weyl space, the metricity
and integrability are maintained. However, it is worth noting that in metric
measure space the divergence of a tensor is not simply the contraction of the
covariant derivative operator with the tensor that it acts on. Despite the fact
that metric measure space and integrable Weyl space, are constructed based on
different assumptions, it is shown that some relations in these spaces, such as

of these malware are designed to evade existing security products, traditional
defenses deployed by most enterprises today, e.g., anti-virus, firewalls,

  We address the problem of detecting early-stage infection in an enterprise

graph theory. Belief propagation can be used either with ""seeds"" of compromised
hosts or malicious domains (provided by the enterprise security operation

domain experts. We also apply our algorithms to 38TB of real-world web proxy

evaluating certain sums of dilogarithms which, for a regular polygon, evaluate

of biological problems that involve interactions with surrounding fluid
molecules or the so-called hydrodynamic interactions (HIs). In this paper, an
efficient algorithm is proposed to simulate the motion of a single DNA molecule
in linear flows. The algorithm utilizes the integraing factor to cope with the
effect of the linear flow of the surrounding fluid and applies the Metropolis
method (MM) in [N. Bou-Rabee, A. Donev, and E. Vanden-Eijnden, Multiscale
Model. Simul. 12, 781 (2014)] to achieve more efficient BD simulation. Thus our
method permits much larger time step size than previous methods while still
maintaining the stability of the BD simulation, which is advantageous for
long-time BD simulation. Our numerical results on $\lambda$-DNA agree very well
with both experimental data and previous simulation results. Finally, when
combined with fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method which has
nearly optimal complexity in the total number of beads, the resulting method is
parallelizable, scalable to large systems, and stable for large time step size,
thus making the long-time large-scale BD simulation within practical reach.
This will be useful for the study of membranes, long-chain molecules, and a
large collection of molecules in the fluids.

can be extracted from a single field of view (unlike previous shadowing
observations of the halo with CCD-resolution spectrometers, which consisted of

of foreground models: one representing LB emission, and two representing SWCX
emission. We found that the resulting halo model parameters (temperature $T_h

due to the relative faintness of the foreground emission in this observation.
However, the data do favor the existence of a foreground. The halo parameters
derived from this observation are in good agreement with those from previous
shadowing observations, and from an XMM-Newton survey of the Galactic halo
emission. This supports the conclusion that the latter results are not subject
to systematic errors, and can confidently be used to test models of the halo
emission.

distance uncertainty makes interpretation ambiguous, these may be among the
faintest starforming galaxies known. Additionally, rough estimates comparing
these galaxies to $\Lambda$CDM dark matter simulations suggest consistency in
number density, implying that dark matter halos likely to host these galaxies
are primarily HI-rich. The galaxies may thus be indicative of a large
population of dwarfs at the limit of detectability that are comparable to the

a large dark matter halo to alter their evolution, these galaxies can provide
critical anchors to dwarf galaxy formation models.

discussed. Our results show that (1). In the galaxies with stellar mass $M_{\rm

while H$_2$ gas fraction ($f_{\rm H_2}$ $\equiv$ $M_{\rm H_2}$/$M_{\rm *}$)
remain nearly unchanged. (2). Comparing with $f_{\rm H_2}$, $f_{\rm HI}$
correlates better with both $M_{\rm *}$ and NUV$- r$. (3). A new parameter,
WISE color W3$-$W2 (12\,$\mu$m$-$4.6\,$\mu$m) is introduced, which is similar
to NUV$- r$ in tracing star formation activity, and we find that W3$-$W2 has a
tighter anti-correlation with log $f_{\rm H_2}$ than the anti-correlation of
(NUV$- r$) - $f_{\rm HI}$, (NUV$- r$) - $f_{\rm H_2}$ and (W3$-$W2) - $f_{\rm

gas ratio $M_{\rm H_2}$/$M_{\rm HI}$, only in the intermediate-$M_{\rm *}$
galaxies it appears to depend on $M_{\rm *}$ and NUV$- r$. We find a tight
correlation between the molecular gas mass $M_{\rm H_2}$ and 12\,$\mu$m (W3)
luminosities ($L_{\rm 12\,\mu m}$), and the slope is close to unity (1.03 $\pm$
0.06) for the SMT sample. This correlation may reflect that the cold gas and
dust are well mixed on global galactic scale. Using the all-sky 12\,$\mu$m (W3)

molecular gas observations and can even predict H$_2$ mass for star-forming

evolution of background, the would-be decaying mode of linear scalar
(curvature) perturbations may not be neglected. It can even grow for some
values of the model parameter, while the other mode always remains constant.
However, this always occurs for unstable solutions which are not attractors for
the given potential. The most interesting particular cases of constant-roll
inflation remaining viable with the most recent observational data are
quadratic hilltop inflation (with cutoff) and natural inflation (with an
additional negative cosmological constant). In these cases even-order slow-roll
parameters approach non-negligible constants while the odd ones are
asymptotically vanishing in the quasi-de Sitter regime.

massive black hole (MBH) mergers, where the secondary star is replaced by a MBH

bound to the secondary MBH are frequently ejected with $v_{\infty} > 10^4$ km

the speed of light), for this reason we refer to stars ejected from these

the velocities of these stars are so great that they can cross a significant
fraction of the observable universe in the time since their ejection (several
Gpc). We demonstrate that if a significant fraction of MBH mergers undergo a

fast-moving ($v_{\infty} > 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$) SHS may be as large as $10^{3}$

try to put constraints on the star formation history, post-quenching evolution,
and possible progenitor star-forming populations for such massive quenched
galaxies. By using a set of Lick absorption line indices on a rest-frame
optical composite spectrum, the average age, metallicity [Z/H], and
$\alpha$-to-iron element abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are derived as
$\log(\mathrm{age}/\mathrm{Gyr})=0.04_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$,
$\mathrm{[Z/H]}=0.24_{-0.14}^{+0.20}$, and
$[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]=0.31_{-0.12}^{+0.12}$, respectively. If our sample of
quenched galaxies at $\langle z \rangle = 1.6$ is evolved passively to $z=0$,
their stellar population properties will align in excellent agreement with
local counterparts at similar stellar velocity dispersions, which qualifies
them as progenitors of local massive early-type galaxies. Redshift evolution of
stellar population ages in quenched galaxies combined with low redshift
measurements from the literature suggests a formation redshift of $z_\mathrm{f}
\sim 2.3$ around which the bulk of stars in these galaxies have been formed.
The measured [$\alpha$/Fe] value indicates a star formation timescale of
$\lesssim 1$ Gyr, which can be translated into a specific star formation rate
of $\simeq 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$ prior to quenching. Based on these findings,
we discuss identifying possible progenitor star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq

stemming from the analyses of vector boson and Higgs scattering processes as
well as the inelastic scattering of standard model fermions into electroweak
gauge bosons. We take into account all coupled channels, all possible helicity
amplitudes, and explore a six-dimensional parameter space of anomalous
couplings. Our analysis shows that for those operators affecting the Higgs
couplings, present 90% confidence level constraints from global data analysis
of Higgs and electroweak data are such that unitarity is not violated if
$\sqrt{s}\leq 3.2\;{\rm TeV}$. For the purely gauge-boson operator $O_{WWW}$,
the present bounds from triple-gauge boson analysis indicate that within its
presently allowed 90% confidence level range unitarity can be violated in
$f\bar f' \to V V'$ at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}\geq 2.4\;{\rm TeV}$.

Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). Using high resolution absorption spectra of a
sample of 80 DLAs, we are able to measure the ratio of the upper to lower
fine-structure levels of the ground state of C II and Si II. These ratios are
determined solely by the physical conditions of the gas. We explore the allowed
physical parameter space using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain
simultaneously the temperature, neutral hydrogen density, and electron density
of each DLA. The results indicate that at least 5 % of all DLAs have the bulk
of their gas in a dense, cold phase with typical densities of ~100 cm-3 and
temperatures below 500 K. We further find that the typical pressure of DLAs in
our sample is log(P/k) = 3.4 [K cm-3], which is comparable to the pressure of
the local interstellar medium (ISM), and that the components containing the
bulk of the neutral gas can be quite small with absorption sizes as small as a
few parsec. We show that the majority of the systems are consistent with having
densities significantly higher than expected from a purely canonical WNM,
indicating that significant quantities of dense gas (i.e. n_H > 0.1 cm-3) are
required to match observations. Finally, we identify 8 systems with positive
detections of Si II*. These systems have pressures (P/k) in excess of 20000 K
cm-3, which suggest that these systems tag a highly turbulent ISM in young,
star-forming galaxies.

matter (CDM), to resolve issues such as the apparent lack of satellites around
the Milky Way. Even if WDM is not the answer to observational issues, it is
essential to constrain the nature of the dark matter. The effect of WDM on
haloes has been extensively studied, but the small-scale initial smoothing in
WDM also affects the present-day cosmic web and voids. It suppresses the cosmic
""sub-web"" inside voids, and the formation of both void haloes and subvoids. In
$N$-body simulations run with different assumed WDM masses, we identify voids
with the ZOBOV algorithm, and cosmic-web components with the ORIGAMI algorithm.
As dark-matter warmth increases (i.e., particle mass decreases), void density
minima grow shallower, while void edges change little. Also, the number of
subvoids decreases. The density field in voids is particularly insensitive to
baryonic physics, so if void density profiles and minima could be measured
observationally, they would offer a valuable probe of the nature of dark
matter. Furthermore, filaments and walls become cleaner, as the substructures
in between have been smoothed out; this leads to a clear, mid-range peak in the
density PDF.

with different $s$-process element abundances. They host six sub-populations

helium up to Delta Y~0.07 dex. In contrast with M22, another cluster
characterized by the presence of populations with different metallicities, M2
contains a third stellar component, C, which shows neither evidence for
sub-populations nor an internal spread in light-elements. Population C does not

conclude that M2 resembles M22, but it includes an additional stellar component

companion in a post common envelope binary, SDSSJ1136+0409. Asteroseismology of
these new pulsating systems will provide crucial insight into how binary

France and Switzerland) as a potential host rock for high activity long lived
radioactive waste disposal at great depth. One of the aspects to deal with in
performance assessment is related to the effects on the host rock of the
temperature elevation due to the placement of exothermic wastes. The potential
effects of the thermal impact on the excavated damaged zone in the close field
are another important issue that was the goal of the TIMODAZ European research
project. In this paper, some principles of waste disposal in clayey host rocks
at great depth are first presented and a series of experimental investigations
carried out on specific equipment specially developed to face the problem are
presented. Both drained and undrained tests have been developed to investigate
the drained thermal volume changes of clays and claystone and the thermal
pressurization occurring around the galleries. This importance of proper
initial saturation (under in-situ stresses) and of satisfactory drainage
conditions (in spite of the significantly low permeability of claystones) is
emphasized, leading to the development of a new hollow cylinder apparatus. It
is observed that claystones cannot be considered as overconsolidated clays
given that they can exhibit, as the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone does, a
thermoplastic contraction. Mechanical and thermal hardening are however
observed, extending to claystones the knowledge already gained on clays. A new
method of determining in the laboratory the thermal pressurization coefficient
is described and the data obtained allow completing existing data in the field.
Finally, the hollow cylinder apparatus makes it possible to demonstrate that
the good self-sealing properties of clays and claystones can be extended to
temperature effects, an important conclusion in terms of performance
assessment.

interaction-induced short-range correlations while allowing long-range
inhomogeneities. The system is described by a Hubbard model on the honeycomb

potential, interactions induce local antiferromagnetic correlations around the
impurity and a net total spin $\frac12$ appears, in agreement with Lieb's
theorem. Bound states caused by the impurity are visible in the local density

last few decades due to their potential applications. This type of problems are
NP-hard in general, and still considered a challenge in the design of efficient
approximation algorithms for their solutions. The purpose of this paper is to
investigate the approximability for a class of such problems where the
constraint matrices are {\it completely positive} and have low {\it cp-rank}.
In the first part of the paper, we show that a completely positive rational
factorization of such matrices can be computed in polynomial time, within any
desired accuracy. We next consider binary quadratic programming problems of the
following form: Given matrices $Q_1,...,Q_n\in\mathbb{R}_+^{n\times n}$, and a
system of $m$ constrains $x^TQ_ix\le C_i^2$ ($x^TQ_ix\ge C_i^2$), $i=1,...,m$,
we seek to find a vector $x^*\in \{0,1\}^n$ that maximizes (minimizes) a given
function $f$. This class of problems generalizes many fundamental problems in
discrete optimization such as packing and covering integer programs/knapsack
problems, quadratic knapsack problems, submodular maximization, etc. We
consider the case when $m$ and the cp-ranks of the matrices $Q_i$ are bounded
by a constant.
  Our approximation results for the maximization problem are as follows. For
the case when the objective function is nonnegative submodular, we give an
$(1/4-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, for any $\epsilon>0$; when the
function $f$ is linear, we present a PTAS. We next extend our PTAS result to a
wider class of non-linear objective functions including quadratic functions,
multiplicative functions, and sum-of-ratio functions. The minimization problem
seems to be much harder due to the fact that the relaxation is {\it not}
convex. For this case, we give a QPTAS for $m=1$.

N(HD)/N(\HH) ratios reflect the separate self-shieldings of HD and \HH\ and the

cosmic-ray ionization rate with a much weaker downward dependence on n(H) at
Solar metallicity, but dust-extinction can drive N(HD) higher as with N(\HH).
At z $>$ 1.7, N(HD) is comparable to the Galaxy but with 10x smaller N(\HH) and
somewhat smaller N(\HH)/N(H I). Comparison of our Galaxy and the Magellanic
Clouds shows that smaller \HH/H is expected at sub-Solar metallicity and we
show by modelling that HD/\HH\ increases with density at low metallicity,
opposite to the Milky Way. Observations of HD would be explained with higher
n(H) at low metallicity but high-z systems have high HD/\HH\ at metallicity
0.04 $\la$ Z $\la$ 2 Solar. In parallel we trace dust-extinction and
self-shielding effects. The abrupt \HH\ transition to \HH/H $\approx$ 1-10%
occurs mostly from self-shielding although it is assisted by extinction for
n(H) $\la 16 \pccc$. Interior \HH\ fractions are substantially increased by
dust extinction below $\la 32\pccc$. At smaller n(H), \zetaH, small increases
in \HH\ triggered by dust extinction can trigger abrupt increases in N(HD).

that of the traditional IRLS algorithms, that is, exponentially fast. Moreover,
with the specifically devised preconditioner, the computational cost for each
iteration is significantly less than that of traditional IRLS algorithms, which
enables our approach to handle large scale problems. In addition to the fast
convergence, it is straightforward to apply our method to standard sparsity,
group sparsity, overlapping group sparsity and TV based problems. Experiments
are conducted on a practical application: compressive sensing magnetic

functions and Leontief production sets. We note that these are the first
FIXP-hardness results ever since the introduction of the class FIXP and the
hardness of 3-Nash established therein.
  2. We note that for the problems stated above, the corresponding results
showing membership in FIXP were established after imposing suitable sufficiency
conditions to render the problems total, as is customary in economics. However,
if all instances are under consideration, then in both cases we prove that the
problem of deciding if a given instance admits an equilibrium is
\Exists-R-complete, where \Exists-R is the class of decision problems which can
be reduced in polynomial time to Existential Theory of the Reals.
  3. For Arrow-Debreu markets under Leontief utility functions and a constant
number of agents, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an
equilibrium. This settles part of an open problem of Devanur and Kannan
(FOCS'08).
  We note that PLC utilities are about the most general utilities of interest
in economics and several fundamental utility functions studied within AGT are
special cases of it. Several important problems, which have been shown to be in
FIXP, are waiting for proofs of FIXP-hardness. In this context, our technique
of reducing from 3-Nash to Multivariate Polynomial Equations and then to the

high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral image at
the same geographical location. The fusion is formulated as a convex
optimization problem which minimizes a linear combination of a least-squares
fitting term and a dynamic gradient sparsity regularizer. The former is to
preserve accurate spectral information of the multispectral image, while the
latter is to keep sharp edges of the high-resolution panchromatic image. We
further propose to simultaneously register the two images during the fusing
process, which is naturally achieved by virtue of the dynamic gradient sparsity
property. An efficient algorithm is then devised to solve the optimization
problem, accomplishing a linear computational complexity in the size of the
output image in each iteration. We compare our method against seven
state-of-the-art image fusion methods on multispectral image datasets from four
satellites. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
substantially outperforms the others in terms of both spatial and spectral
qualities. We also show that our method can provide high-quality products from
coarsely registered real-world datasets. Finally, a MATLAB implementation is
provided to facilitate future research.

evolve in a stochastic yet stable fashion. On even longer timescales, however,
planetary orbits can spontaneously transition from bounded to unbound chaotic
states. Large-scale instabilities associated with such behavior appear to play
a dominant role in shaping the architectures of planetary systems, including
our own. Here we show how such transitions are possible, focusing on the
specific case of the long-term evolution of Mercury. We develop a simple
analytical model for Mercury's dynamics and elucidate the origins of its short
term stochastic behavior as well as of its sudden progression to unbounded
chaos. Our model allows us to estimate the timescale on which this transition
is likely to be triggered, i.e. the dynamical lifetime of the Solar System as
we know it. The formulated theory is consistent with the results of numerical
simulations and is broadly applicable to extrasolar planetary systems dominated
by secular interactions. These results constitute a significant advancement in
our understanding of the processes responsible for sculpting of the dynamical
structures of generic planetary systems.

NCs were steadily accumulating in the muscle in the first 30 days p.i., and the

a redistribution and reaccumulation of Au NCs in all blood rich organs. Further

remarkable result for A$_x$(S)$_y$TiNCl compounds ($\alpha$-phase TiNCl
partially intercalated with alkali A and optionally co-intercalated molecular
species S), finding the superconducting transition temperature T$_C$ scales
with $d$$^{-1}$, where the spacing $d$ between TiNCl layered structures depends
on intercalant thickness. Recognizing that this behavior indicates interlayer
coupling, Zhang et al. cite, among other papers, the interlayer Coulombic
pairing mechanism picture [Harshman et al., J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 23,
295701 (2011)]. This Comment shows that superconductivity occurs by
interactions between the chlorine layers of the TiNCl structure and the layers
containing A$_x$, wherein the transverse A$_x$-Cl separation distance {\zeta}
is smaller than $d$. In the absence of pair-breaking interactions, the optimal
transition temperature is modeled by T$_{C0}$ $\propto$
({\sigma}/$A$)$^{1/2}$$\zeta$$^{-1}$, where {\sigma}/$A$ is the fractional
charge per area per formula unit. Particularly noteworthy are the rather
marginally-metallic trends in resistivities of A$_x$(S)$_y$TiNCl, indicating
high scattering rates, which are expected to partially originate from remote
Coulomb scattering (RCS) from the A$_x$ ions. By modeling a small fraction of
the RCS as inducing pair-breaking, taken to cut off exponentially with {\zeta},
observations of T$_C$ < T$_{C0}$ are quantitatively described for compounds
with {\zeta} < 4 {\AA}, and T$_C$ $\approx$ T$_{C0}$ for
Na$_{0.16}$(S)$_y$TiNCl with propylene carbonate and butylene carbonate
co-intercalants for which {\zeta} > 7 {\AA}. Since a spatially separated
alkali-ion layer is not formed in Li$_{0.13}$TiNCl, the observed T$_C$ of 5.9 K
is attributed to an intergrowth phase related to TiN (T$_C$ = 5.6 K).

degrees of freedom. We use diagonalization in a limited functional space (LFS)
to study the non-equilibrium dynamics on a finite one-dimensional chain. This
method agrees with exact diagonalization and the time-evolving block decimation
method, in both the relaxation regime and the long-time stationary state, and
among these three methods it is the most efficient and versatile one for this
problem. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the time evolution by
calculating the electron, phonon and electron-phonon coupling energies, and the
electronic momentum distribution function. The numerical results are compared
to analytical solutions for short times, for a small hopping amplitude and for
a weak electron-phonon coupling. In the latter case, the relaxation dynamics
obtained from the Boltzmann equation agrees very well with the LFS data. We
also study the time dependence of the eigenstates of the single-site reduced
density matrix, which defines so-called optimal phonon modes. We discuss their

analysis shows that the structure of optimal phonon modes contains very useful

  Clinical Knowledge","30 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.ML stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many in-hospital mortality risk prediction scores dichotomize predictive
variables to simplify the score calculation. However, hard thresholding in
these additive stepwise scores of the form ""add x points if variable v is
above/below threshold t"" may lead to critical failures. In this paper, we seek
to develop risk prediction scores that preserve clinical knowledge embedded in
features and structure of the existing additive stepwise scores while
addressing limitations caused by variable dichotomization. To this end, we
propose a novel score structure that relies on a transformation of predictive
variables by means of nonlinear logistic functions facilitating smooth
differentiation between critical and normal values of the variables. We develop
an optimization framework for inferring parameters of the logistic functions
for a given patient population via cyclic block coordinate descent. The
parameters may readily be updated as the patient population and standards of
care evolve. We tested the proposed methodology on two populations: (1) brain
trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the Dell Children's
Medical Center of Central Texas between 2007 and 2012, and (2) adult ICU
patient data from the MIMIC II database. The results are compared with those
obtained by the widely used PRISM III and SOFA scores. The prediction power of
a score is evaluated using area under ROC curve, Youden's index, and
precision-recall balance in a cross-validation study. The results demonstrate
that the new framework enables significant performance improvements over PRISM
III and SOFA in terms of all three criteria.

to do before further analysis. Basically, there are two classes of membership
determination method: parametric and non-parametric. In this study, an
alternative of non-parametric method based on Binned Kernel Density Estimation
that accounts measurements errors (simply called BKDE-e) is proposed. This
method is applied upon proper motions data to determine cluster's membership
kinematically and estimate the average proper motions of the cluster. Monte
Carlo simulations show that the average proper motions determination using this
proposed method is statistically more accurate than ordinary Kernel Density
Estimator (KDE). By including measurement errors in the calculation, the mode
location from the resulting density estimate is less sensitive to non-physical
or stochastic fluctuation as compared to ordinary KDE that excludes measurement
errors. For the typical mean measurement error of 7 mas/yr, BKDE-e suppresses
the potential of miscalculation by a factor of two compared to KDE. With median
accuracy of about 93%, BKDE-e method has comparable accuracy with respect to
parametric method (modified Sanders algorithm). Application to real data from
The Fourth USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC4), especially to NGC 2682 is also
performed. The mode of member stars distribution on Vector Point Diagram is
located at $\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta=-9.94\pm0.85$ mas/yr and

entirely in (or is displaced slightly from) the minimal area of $C_2$. We
discuss the expectation value of such double-winding loops in abelian

dual abelian Higgs model, and argue that in such models an exponential falloff

simulation, and find that the area law falloff follows a difference-in-areas

in some gauge, mainly abelian in character, the spatial distribution of those

However, the question of how this wave energy is dissipated (on which time and

analytic and numerical models have previously shown that Alfv\'enic turbulence
may play a key role not only in the generation of the fast solar wind, but in
the heating of coronal loops. In an effort to bridge the gap between theory and
observations, we expand on a recent study [De Moortel et al., ApJL, 782:L34,
2014] by analyzing thirty-seven clearly isolated coronal loops using data from
the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument. We observe Alfv\'enic
perturbations with phase speeds which range from 250-750 km/s and periods from
140-270 s for the chosen loops. While excesses of high frequency wave-power are
observed near the apex of some loops (tentatively supporting the onset of
Alfv\'enic turbulence), we show that this excess depends on loop length and the
wavelength of the observed oscillations. In deriving a proportional
relationship between the loop length/wavelength ratio and the enhanced wave
power at the loop apex, and from the analysis of the line-widths associated
with these loops, our findings are supportive of the existence of Alfv\'enic
turbulence in coronal loops.

piece"" A (with 6 independent components). Subsequently, we turn to the
physically relevant orthogonal group, thereby using the metric. We find the
finer decomposition of S into pieces with 9+5+1 and of A into those with 5+1
independent components. Some reducible decompositions, discussed earlier by
numerous authors, are shown to be inconsistent. --- Several physical
consequences are discussed. The Cauchy relations are shown to correspond to
A=0. Longitudinal and transverse sound waves are basically related by S and A,
respectively.

dimensional fluid region takes into consideration the pairwise interaction
between the filaments along with an approximation for motion by self-induction.
The same system of equations appears in descriptions of the fine structure of
vortex filaments in the Gross -- Pitaevski model of Bose -- Einstein
condensates. In this paper we construct families of standing waves for this
model, in the form of n co-rotating near-parallel vortex filaments that are
situated in a central configuration. This result applies to any pair of vortex
filaments with the same circulation, corresponding to the case n=2. The model
equations can be formulated as a system of Hamiltonian PDEs, and the
construction of standing waves is a small divisor problem. The methods are a
combination of the analysis of infinite dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical
systems and linear theory related to Anderson localization. The main technique
of the construction is the Nash-Moser method applied to a Lyapunov-Schmidt
reduction, giving rise to a bifurcation equation over a Cantor set of

But the exact nature of this impact has thus far not been well understood in an
analytical setting. In this work, we develop one of the first theoretical
models that analytically studies the impact of individualism-collectivism on
the society. We model the growth of an individual's welfare (wealth, resources
and health) as depending not only on himself, but also on the level of
collectivism, i.e. the level of dependence on the rest of the individuals in
the society, which leads to a co-evolutionary setting. Based on our model, we
are able to predict the impact of individualism-collectivism on various
societal metrics, such as average welfare, average life-time, total population,
cumulative welfare and average inequality. We analytically show that
individualism has a positive impact on average welfare and cumulative welfare,
but comes with the drawbacks of lower average life-time, lower total population
and higher average inequality.

Using the reductive perturbation technique, a Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Burgers

analyzed. It is shown that the KPB equation can admit either compressive or

factors. Intrinsically, both the density of states bottleneck near the Dirac
point and carrier reflection at the graphene-metal interface lead to a high
contact resistance. Moreover, graphene exhibits insulating behavior for
out-of-the-plane conduction. Extrinsically, surface contamination introduced by
photoresist residue or different adsorbed species during standard lithography
processing alters graphene's intrinsic properties by uncontrolled doping and
increased scattering which results in high and inconsistent contact resistance.
Here we demonstrate a femto-second laser assisted direct patterning of graphene
microstructures that enables us to study both intrinsic and extrinsic effects
on the graphene-metal interface. We show that a clean graphene-metal interface
is not sufficient to obtain contact resistance approaching the intrinsic limit
set by the quantum resistance. We also demonstrated that unlike CVD graphene,
edge state conduction (or end-contact) is not spontaneously formed by metal
deposition in case of graphene grown on SiC(0001). We conclude that for
epitaxial graphene, intentional end-contact formation is necessary to obtain
contact resistance near the quantum contact resistance limit.

~O(m+k^2 n), where k is the edge connectivity, but k could be Omega(n).
  At STOC'96 Karger presented a randomized near linear time Monte Carlo

equilibrium, humans often adopt intermittent control strategy: instead of
continuously controlling the system, they repeatedly switch the control on and
off. Paradigmatic example of such a task is stick balancing. Despite the
simplicity of the task itself, the complexity of human intermittent control
dynamics in stick balancing still puzzles researchers in motor control. Here we
attempt to model one of the key mechanisms of human intermittent control,
control activation, using as an example the task of overdamped stick balancing.
In so doing, we focus on the concept of noise-driven activation, a more general
alternative to the conventional threshold-driven activation. We describe
control activation as a random walk in an energy potential, which changes in
response to the state of the controlled system. By way of numerical
simulations, we show that the developed model captures the core properties of
human control activation observed previously in the experiments on overdamped
stick balancing. Our results demonstrate that the double-well potential model
provides tractable mathematical description of human control activation at
least in the considered task, and suggest that the adopted approach can
potentially aid in understanding human intermittent control in more complex
processes.

equation. Comparing the light curves reproduced by our revised magnetar-powered
model to the observed data and/or upper limits of these five SLSNe, we found
that the late-time light curves reproduced by our semi-analytical equation are
in good agreement with the late-time observed data and/or upper limits of SN
2010gx, CSS121015, SN 2013dg and LSQ12dlf and the late-time excess of
SSS120810, indicating that the magnetar-powered model might be responsible for
these SLSNe and that the gamma ray and X-ray leakage are unavoidable when the
hard photons were down-Comptonized to softer photons. To determine the details
of the leakage effect and unveil the nature of SLSNe, more high quality
bolometric light curves and spectra of SLSNe are required.

  version describes the permutation vector and its inverse",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sorted data is usually easier to compress than unsorted permutations of the
same data. This motivates a simple compression scheme: specify the sorted
permutation of the data along with a representation of the sorted data
compressed recursively. The sorted permutation can be specified by recording
the decisions made by quicksort. If the size of the data is known, then the
quicksort decisions describe the data at a rate that is nearly as efficient as
the minimal prefix-free code for the distribution, which is bounded by the
entropy of the distribution. This is possible even though the distribution is
unknown ahead of time. Used in this way, quicksort acts as a universal code in
that it is asymptotically optimal for any stationary source. The Shannon
entropy is a lower bound when describing stochastic, independent symbols.
However, it is possible to encode non-uniform, finite strings below the entropy
of the sample distribution by also encoding symbol counts because the values in
the sequence are no longer independent once the counts are known. The key
insight is that sparse quicksort comparison vectors can also be compressed to
achieve an even lower rate when data is highly non-uniform while incurring only
a modest penalty when data is random.

atmospheric model, we assume CO2-H2O-N2 atmospheres with surface pressures
varying from 20 mb to 3 bar with input solar luminosity reduced to 75% the
modern value.
  Results from the valley network analysis are of the order of a few mm d-1
liquid water precipitation (1.5-10.6 mm d-1, with a median of 3.1 mm d-1).
Atmospheric model results are much lower, from about 0.001-1 mm d-1 of snowfall
(depending on CO2 partial pressure). Hence, the atmospheric model predicts a
significantly lower amount of precipitated water than estimated from the
geomorphological analysis. Furthermore, global mean surface temperatures are
below freezing, i.e. runoff is most likely not directly linked to
precipitation. Therefore, our results strongly favor a cold early Mars with
episodic snowmelt as a source for runoff.
  Our approach is challenged by mostly unconstrained parameters, e.g.
greenhouse gas abundance, global meteorology (for example, clouds) and
planetary parameters such as obliquity- which affect the atmospheric result -
as as well as by inherent problems in estimating discharge and runoff on
ancient Mars, such as a lack of knowledge on infiltration and evaporation rates
and on flooding timescales, which affect the geomorphological data.
Nevertheless, our work represents a first step in combining and interpreting
quantitative tools applied in early Mars atmospheric and geomorphological

measures the natural flux of cosmic muons and its attenuation produced by the
screening effect of the rock mass to image. Gravimetry generally consists in
measurements of the vertical component of the local gravity field. Both methods
are linearly linked to density, but their spatial sensitivity is very
different. Muon tomography essentially works like medical X-ray scan and
integrates density information along elongated narrow conical volumes while
gravimetry measurements are linked to density by a 3-dimensional integral
encompassing the whole studied domain. We develop the mathematical expressions
of these integration formulas -- called acquisition kernels -- to express
resolving kernels that act as spatial filters relating the true unknown density
structure to the density distribution actually recoverable from the available
data. The resolving kernels provide a tool to quantitatively describe the
resolution of the density models and to evaluate the resolution improvement
expected by adding new data in the inversion. The resolving kernels derived in
the joined muon/gravimetry case indicate that gravity data are almost useless
to constrain the density structure in regions sampled by more than two muon
tomography acquisitions. Interestingly the resolution in deeper regions not

particles were measured for different centralities in $Pb+Pb$ collisions. A
strong suppression of the nuclear modification factor in central collisions
around $p_T \sim 6-7$ GeV/c was seen. As a possible explanation, the
hydrodynamic description of the collision process was tentatively proposed.
However, such effect, (albeit much weaker) also exists in the ratio of
data/fits, both in nuclear $Pb+Pb$ collisions, and in the elementary $p+p$ data
in the same range of transverse momenta for which such an explanation is
doubtful. As shown recently, in this case, assuming that this effect is
genuine, it can be attributed to a specific modification of a quasi-power like
formula usually used to describe such $p_T$ data, namely the Tsallis
distribution. Following examples from other branches of physics, one simply has
to allow for the power index becoming a complex number. This results in
specific log-periodic oscillations dressing the usual power-like distribution,
which can fit the $p+p$ data. In this presentation we demonstrate that this
method can also describe $Pb+Pb$ data for different centralities. We compare it
also with a two component statistical model with two Tsallis distributions
recently proposed showing that data at still larger $p_T$ will be sufficient to
discriminate between these two approaches.

bulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the velocity and acceleration of the
expansion of the universe in such a way that
$\zeta=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}+\zeta_{2}\frac{\ddot{a}}{\dot{a}}.$
We show that there exist two limiting conditions in the bulk viscous
coefficients, ($\zeta_{0}$, $\zeta_{1}$, $\zeta_{2}$) which corresponds to a
universe having a Big-Bang at the origin, followed by an early decelerated
epoch and then making a smooth transition into an accelerating epoch. We have
constrained the model using the type Ia Supernovae data, evaluated the best
estimated values of all the bulk viscous parameters and the Hubble parameter
corresponding to the two limiting conditions. We found that even though the
evolution of the cosmological parameters are in general different for the two
limiting cases, they show identical behavior for the best estimated values of
the parameters from both the limiting conditions. A recent acceleration would
occur if $\tilde{\zeta}_{0}+\tilde{\zeta}_{1}>1$ for the first limiting
conditions and if $\tilde{\zeta}_{0}+\tilde{\zeta}_{1}<1$ for the second
limiting conditions. The age of the universe predicted by this model is found
to be less than that predicted from the oldest galactic globular clusters. The
total bulk viscosity seems to be negative in the past and becomes positive when
$z\leq0.8$. So the model violates the local second law of thermodynamics.
However, the model satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics at
the apparent horizon throughout the evolution of the universe. We also made a
statefinder analysis of the model and found that it is distinguishably
different from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at present, but shows a de
Sitter type behavior in the far future of the evolution.

initial value problem and the long-time behavior of solutions for the
two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in the particular case
where the domain occupied by the fluid is the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
the velocity field is only assumed to be bounded. In this context, local
well-posedness is not difficult to establish, and a priori estimates on the
vorticity distribution imply that all solutions are global and grow at most
exponentially in time. Moreover, as was recently shown by S. Zelik, localized
energy estimates can be used to obtain a much better control on the uniformly
local energy norm of the velocity field. The aim of these notes is to present,
in an explanatory and self-contained way, a simplified and optimized version of
Zelik's argument which, in combination with a new formulation of the
Biot-Savart law for bounded vorticities, allows one to show that the uniform
norm of the velocity field grows at most linearly in time. The results do not
rely on the viscous dissipation, and remain therefore valid for the so-called
""Serfati solutions"" of the two-dimensional Euler equations. Finally, a recent
work by S. Slijepcevic and the author shows that all solutions remain uniformly
bounded in the viscous case if the velocity field and the pressure are periodic

in financial economics. In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of
the variation of a log-price process have appeared. These were developed by
many authors and were motivated by the existence of complete records of price
data. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the
most well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated
(co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous. Limit results
such as the weak law of large numbers or the central limit theorem have been
proved in different contexts. In this paper, we propose to study the large
deviation properties of realized (co-)volatility (i.e., when the number of high
frequency observations in a fixed time interval increases to infinity. More
specifically, we consider a bivariate model with synchronous observation
schemes and correlated Brownian motions of the following form: $dX\_{\ell,t} =
\sigma\_{\ell,t}dB\_{\ell,t}+b\_{\ell}(t,\omega)dt$ for $\ell=1,2$, where
$X\_{\ell}$ denotes the log-price, we are concerned with the large deviation
estimation of the vector $V\_t^n(X)=(Q\_{1,t}^n(X), Q\_{2,t}^n(X),
C\_{t}^n(X))$ where $Q\_{\ell,t}^n(X)$ and $C\_{t}^n(X)$ represente the
estimator of the quadratic variational processes
$Q\_{\ell,t}=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{\ell,s}^2ds$ and the integrated covariance
$C\_t=\int\_0^t\sigma\_{1,s}\sigma\_{2,s}\rho\_sds$ respectively, with
$\rho\_t=cov(B\_{1,t}, B\_{2,t})$. Our main motivation is to improve upon the
existing limit theorems. Our large deviations results can be used to evaluate
and approximate tail probabilities of realized (co-)volatility. As an
application we provide the large deviation for the standard dependence measures
between the two assets returns such as the realized regression coefficients up
to time $t$, or the realized correlation. Our study should contribute to the
recent trend of research on the (co-)variance estimation problems, which are
quite often discussed in high-frequency financial data analysis.

that the RSD can be expressed in terms of the correlation function of the

crossover time is related to a weighted average relaxation time for the
diffusivity. Thus the crossover time gives some information on the relaxation
time of fluctuating diffusivity which cannot be extracted from the

the addition of generics---and of wildcards, in particular---to Java, the graph
of the subtyping relation is no longer a simple directed-acyclic graph (DAG),
as in pre-generics Java, but is rather a fractal. Further, this observation
equally applies to other mainstream nominally-typed OO languages (such as C#,
C++ and Scala) where generics and wildcards (or some other form of 'variance
annotations') are standard features. Accordingly, the shape of the subtyping
relation in these OO languages is more complex than a tree or a simple DAG, and
indeed is also a fractal. Given the popularity of fractals, the fractal
observation may help OO software developers keep a useful and intuitive mental
image of their software's subtyping relation, even if it is a little more
frightening, and more amazing one than before. With proper support from IDEs,
the fractal observation can help OO developers in resolving type errors they

accelerated population of electrons interacts with the dense chromospheric
plasma. HXR observations presented by using the Ramaty High-Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) have shown that HXR source sizes are 3-6 times
more extended in height than those predicted by the standard collisional thick
target model (CTTM). Several possible explanations have been put forward
including the multi-threaded nature of flare loops, pitch-angle scattering, and
magnetic mirroring. However, the nonuniform ionisation (NUI) structure along
the path of the electron beam has not been fully explored as a solution to this
problem. Ionised plasma is known to be less effective at producing nonthermal
bremsstrahlung HXRs when compared to neutral plasma. If the peak HXR emission
was produced in a locally ionised region within the chromosphere, the intensity
of emission will be preferentially reduced around this peak, resulting in a
more extended source. Due to this effect, along with the associated density
enhancement in the upper chromosphere, injection of a beam of electrons into a
partially ionised plasma should result in a HXR source which is substantially
more vertically extended relative to that for a neutral target. Here we present
the results of a modification to the CTTM which takes into account both a
localised form of chromospheric NUI and an increased target density. We find 50
keV HXR source widths, with and without the inclusion of a locally ionised
region, of ~3 Mm and ~0.7 Mm, respectively. This helps to provide a theoretical
solution to the currently open question of overly-extended HXR sources.

Considering a stochastic Poisson network model, we establish the CDF

be neglected, in many cases, as long as mobiles are connected to their best
serving base station (BS), i.e. the BS which offers them the most powerful
useful signal. As a consequence, the analysis of performance and quality of

propagation model which takes into account only the pathloss. Moreover, we
establish that the Fluid network model we have proposed can be used to analyze

Short Time Fourier Transform is often used (STFT). However, the wavelet
transform is thought to be a more suitable tool for analyzing non-stationary
signals than the STFT. Given the lack of support for wavelet-based analysis in
HRV toolkits, such analysis must be implemented by the researcher. This has
made this technique underutilized. This paper presents a new algorithm to
perform HRV power spectrum analysis based on the Maximal Overlap Discrete
Wavelet Packet Transform (MODWPT). The algorithm calculates the power in any
spectral band with a given tolerance for the band's boundaries. The MODWPT
decomposition tree is pruned to avoid calculating unnecessary wavelet
coefficients, thereby optimizing execution time. The center of energy shift
correction is applied to achieve optimum alignment of the wavelet coefficients.
This algorithm has been implemented in RHRV, an open-source package for HRV
analysis. To the best of our knowledge, RHRV is the first HRV toolkit with
support for wavelet-based spectral analysis.

this paper we consider deterministic scientific hypotheses as uncertain data.
In the form of mathematical equations, hypotheses symmetrically relate aspects
of the studied phenomena. For computing predictions, however, deterministic
hypotheses are used asymmetrically as functions. We refer to Simon's notion of
structural equations in order to extract the (so-called) causal ordering
embedded in a hypothesis. Then we encode it into a set of functional
dependencies (fd's) that is basic input to a design-theoretic method for the
synthesis of U-relational databases (DB's). The causal ordering captured from a
formally-specified system of mathematical equations into fd's determines not
only the constraints (structure), but also the correlations (uncertainty
chaining) hidden in the hypothesis predictive data. We show how to process it
effectively through original algorithms for encoding and reasoning on the given
hypotheses as constraints and correlations into U-relational DB's. The method
is applicable to both quantitative and qualitative hypotheses and has underwent
initial tests in a realistic use case from computational science.

fashion has become a priority for governments around the world, as the massive
urbanization process we are witnessing is causing high levels of inequalities
which require intervention. Traditionally, deprivation indexes have been
derived from census data, which is however very expensive to obtain, and thus
acquired only every few years. Alternative computational methods have been
proposed in recent years to automatically extract proxies of deprivation at a
fine spatio-temporal level of granularity; however, they usually require access
to datasets (e.g., call details records) that are not publicly available to
governments and agencies.
  To remedy this, we propose a new method to automatically mine deprivation at
a fine level of spatio-temporal granularity that only requires access to freely
available user-generated content. More precisely, the method needs access to
datasets describing what urban elements are present in the physical
environment; examples of such datasets are Foursquare and OpenStreetMap. Using
these datasets, we quantitatively describe neighborhoods by means of a metric,
called {\em Offering Advantage}, that reflects which urban elements are
distinctive features of each neighborhood. We then use that metric to {\em (i)}
build accurate classifiers of urban deprivation and {\em (ii)} interpret the
outcomes through thematic analysis. We apply the method to three UK urban areas

3-manifold $M$ satisfies a Tits alternative: if a closed subgroup $H$ does not
contain a free pro-$p$ subgroup for any $p$, then $H$ is virtually soluble, and
furthermore of a very particular form. In particular, the profinite completion
of the fundamental group of a closed, hyperbolic 3-manifold does not contain a
subgroup isomorphic to $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}^2$. This gives a profinite
characterization of hyperbolicity among irreducible 3-manifolds. We also
characterize Seifert fibred 3-manifolds as precisely those for which the
profinite completion of the fundamental group has a non-trivial procyclic
normal subgroup. Our techniques also apply to hyperbolic, virtually special
groups, in the sense of Haglund and Wise. Finally, we prove that every finitely
generated pro-$p$ subgroup of the profinite completion of a torsion-free,
hyperbolic, virtually special group is free pro-$p$.

any discrepancy. Monitoring schemes comprise of monitoring components that work
together to help schemes in meeting various security requirement parameters for
the networks. These security parameters are breached via various attacks by
manipulation of monitoring components of particular monitoring schemes to

19-parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM). We explore very wide ranges of the
pMSSM parameters but pay particular attention to the higgsino-like neutralino
at the ~ 1 TeV scale, which has been shown to be a well motivated solution in
many constrained supersymmetric models, as well as to a wino-dominated solution
with the mass in the range of 2-3 TeV. After summarising the present bounds on
the parameter space from direct and indirect detection experiments, we focus on
prospects for detection of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). To this end, we
derive a realistic assessment of the sensitivity of CTA to photon fluxes from
dark matter annihilation by means of a binned likelihood analysis for the
Einasto and Navarro-Frenk-White halo profiles. We use the most up to date
instrument response functions and background simulation model provided by the
CTA Collaboration. We find that, with 500 hours of observation, under the
Einasto profile CTA is bound to exclude at the 95% C.L. almost all of the ~ 1
TeV higgsino region of the pMSSM, effectively closing the window for heavy
supersymmetric dark matter in many realistic models. CTA will be able to probe
the vast majority of cases corresponding to a spin-independent scattering cross
section below the reach of 1-tonne underground detector searches for dark
matter, in fact even well below the irreducible neutrino background for direct
detection. On the other hand, many points lying beyond the sensitivity of CTA
will be within the reach of 1-tonne detectors, and some within collider reach.
Altogether, CTA will provide a highly sensitive way of searching for dark
matter that will be partially overlapping and partially complementary with
1-tonne detector and collider searches, thus being instrumental to effectively
explore the nearly full parameter space of the pMSSM.

is how transcendental rules can emerge within the empirical world.
Game-theoretical studies showed that pool punishment, particularly second-order
punishment, plays a key role in understanding the evolution of cooperation.
Second-order pool punishment, however, is tautological in nature; the
punishment system itself is caused by its own effects. The emergence of pool
punishment poses a logical conundrum that, to date, has been overlooked in the
study of the evolution of social norms and institutions. Here, we tackle the
issue by considering the interplay of (a) cognitive biases in reasoning and (b)
Agamben's notion of homo sacer (Agamben, G. 1998, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power
and Bare Life, Stanford University Press); that is, a person who may be killed
without legal consequences. Based on the cognitive disposition of reversing the
cause-and-effect relationship, we propose a new system: the preemptive
punishment of homo sacer. This action can lead to retrospectively forming moral
assessments, particularly for second-order pool punishment. This study
potentially provides new insight into the evolutionary process behind the
emergence of social norms and institutions.

interference between the neutral Higgs bosons. On the other hand, factorising a
more complicated process into production and decay parts by means of the
narrow-width approximation (NWA) simplifies the calculation. The standard NWA,
however, does not account for interference terms. Therefore, we introduce a
generalisation of the NWA (gNWA) which allows for a consistent treatment of
interference effects between nearly mass-degenerate particles. Furthermore, we
apply the gNWA at the tree and 1-loop level to an example process where the
neutral Higgs bosons $h$ and $H$ are produced in the decay of a heavy
neutralino and subsequently decay into a fermion pair. The $h-H$ propagator
mixing is found to agree well with the approximation of Breit-Wigner
propagators times finite wave-function normalisation factors, both leading to a
significant interference contribution. The factorisation of the interference
term based on on-shell matrix elements reproduces the full interference result
within a precision of better than 1% for the considered process. The gNWA also
enables the inclusion of contributions beyond the 1-loop order into the most
precise prediction.

response to a small deformation change. Typically materials have an incremental
stiffness that is fixed and positive, but recent technologies, such as
super-lenses, low frequency band gap materials and acoustic cloaks, are based
on materials with zero, negative or extremely high incremental stiffness. So
far, demonstrations of this behavior have been limited either to a narrow range
of frequencies, temperatures, stiffness or to specific deformations. Here we
demonstrate a mechanism to tune the static incremental stiffness that overcomes
those limitations. This tunability is achieved by driving a nonlinear defect
mode in a lattice. As in thermal expansion, the defect's vibration amplitude
affects the force at the boundary, hence the lattice's stiffness. By using the
high sensitivities of nonlinear systems near bifurcation points, we tune the
magnitude of the incremental stiffness over a wide range: from positive, to
zero, to arbitrarily negative values. The particular deformation where the
incremental stiffness is modified can be arbitrarily selected varying the
defect's driving frequency. We demonstrate this experimentally in a compressed
array of spheres and propose a general theoretical model.

Marron and Yufeng Liu","Large-Margin Classification with Multiple Decision Rules",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Binary classification is a common statistical learning problem in which a
model is estimated on a set of covariates for some outcome indicating the
membership of one of two classes. In the literature, there exists a distinction
between hard and soft classification. In soft classification, the conditional
class probability is modeled as a function of the covariates. In contrast, hard
classification methods only target the optimal prediction boundary. While hard
and soft classification methods have been studied extensively, not much work
has been done to compare the actual tasks of hard and soft classification. In
this paper we propose a spectrum of statistical learning problems which span
the hard and soft classification tasks based on fitting multiple decision rules
to the data. By doing so, we reveal a novel collection of learning tasks of
increasing complexity. We study the problems using the framework of
large-margin classifiers and a class of piecewise linear convex surrogates, for
which we derive statistical properties and a corresponding sub-gradient descent
algorithm. We conclude by applying our approach to simulation settings and a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease

Instability model (GI) is an inefficient radiative cooling of the pre-collapse
fragments. Since fragment contraction times are as long at $10^5 -10^7$ years,
the fragments may be tidally destroyed sooner than they contract into gas giant
planets. Here we explore the role of ""pebble accretion"" onto the pre-collapse
giant planets and find an unexpected result. Despite larger dust opacity at
higher metallicities, addition of metals actually accelerates -- rather than
slows down -- collapse of high opacity, relatively low mass giant gas planets
($M_p$ below a few Jupiter masses). A simple analytical theory that explains
this result exactly in idealised simplified cases is presented. The theory
shows that planets with the central temperature in the range between $\sim$
1000 to 2000K are especially sensitive to pebble accretion: addition of just
$\sim 5$ to 10 % of metals by weight is sufficient to cause their collapse.
These results show that dust grain physics and dynamics is essential for an
accurate modelling of self-gravitating disc fragments and their near
environments in the outer massive and cold protoplanetary discs.

this work is ""pebble accretion"" onto GI fragments which has been recently
demonstrated to accelerate contraction of GI fragments. Driven closer to the

fragments collapse faster than they migrate into the inner $a\sim$ few AU disc

disrupted unless (a) their opacity is $\sim 3$ orders of magnitude less than
the interstellar dust opacity at metallicities typical of the observed giant
planets, or (b) the opacity is high but the fragments accrete large dust grains

($M_{\rm core} < 0.1$ Earth masses) and follow a negative correlation of giant

unambiguously classified as a symbiotic star, because of the presence of unique
emission lines which belong only to symbiotic spectra, the well known O VI
Raman scattered lines. SySt-2 is only possibly a SySt because the Ne VII Raman
scattered line at 4881 A, recently identified in a well studied Galactic
symbiotic as another very conspicuous property of symbiotic, could as well be
identified as N III or [Fe III]. Finally, SySt-3 is likely a symbiotic binary
because in the red part of the spectrum it shows the continuum of a late giant,
and forbidden lines of moderate- to high-ionization, like [Fe v] 4180 A. The

their location in the PN region in the [O III] 4363/H\gamma\ vs [O III]

complicated by the presence of circumstellar matter in these systems. So far,
only a small number of systems with accurate values of component masses, radii,
and other properties are known. Here, we report the first detailed study of a
new representative of this class of binaries, BR CMi, based on the analysis of
radial velocities and multichannel photometry from several observatories, and
compare its physical properties with those for other well-studied systems. BR
CMi is an ellipsoidal variable seen under an intermediate orbital inclination
of ~51 degrees, and it has an orbital period of 12.919059(15) d and a circular
orbit. We used the disentangled component spectra to estimate the effective
temperatures 9500(200) K and 4655(50) K by comparing them with model spectra.
They correspond to spectral types B9.5e and G8III. We also used the
disentangled spectra of both binary components as templates for the 2-D
cross-correlation to obtain accurate RVs and a reliable orbital solution. Some
evidence of a secular period increase at a rate of 1.1+/-0.5 s per year was
found. This, together with a very low mass ratio of 0.06 and a normal mass and
radius of the mass gaining component, indicates that BR CMi is in a slow phase
of the mass exchange after the mass-ratio reversal. It thus belongs to a still
poorly populated subgroup of Be stars for which the origin of Balmer emission
lines is safely explained as a consequence of mass transfer between the binary

network analysis plays an important role in these domains. A powerful and
widespread class of network analysis methods is based on algebraic graph
theory, i.e., representing graphs as square adjacency matrices. However, many
networks are of a very specific form that clashes with that representation:
They are bipartite. That is, they consist of two node types, with each edge
connecting a node of one type with a node of the other type. Examples of
bipartite networks (also called \emph{two-mode networks}) are persons and the
social groups they belong to, musical artists and the musical genres they play,
and text documents and the words they contain. In fact, any type of feature

bipartite network. Although bipartite networks are widespread, most literature
in the area of network analysis focuses on unipartite networks, i.e., those
networks with only a single type of node. The purpose of this article is to
extend a selection of important algebraic network analysis methods to bipartite

that it can cause a charged particle to form interesting trajectories such as
cycloid and helix in presence of electric field, but a changing magnetic field
is rarely discussed. In this work, modeling and characterization of charged
particle trajectories in oscillating magnetic field is reported. The modeling
is performed using Euler method with speed corrector. The result shows that
there are two types of trajectory patterns that will recur for every $180 n
T_0$ ($n = 0, 1, 2, ..$) in increasing of magnetic field oscillation period,
where $T_0$ is about $6.25\times10^{-7}$ s.
