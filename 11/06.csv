the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA). We report the detection of radio emission at the location of HLX-1
during its hard X-ray state using the ATCA. Assuming that the `Fundamental
Plane' of accreting black holes is applicable, we provide an independent
estimate of the black hole mass of $M_{\rm{BH}}\leq2.8^{+7.5}_{-2.1} \times
10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ at 90% confidence. However, we argue that the detected
radio emission is likely to be Doppler-boosted and our mass estimate is an
upper limit. We discuss other possible origins of the radio emission such as
being due to a radio nebula, star formation, or later interaction of the flares
with the large-scale environment. None of these were found adequate. The VLA
observations were carried out during the X-ray outburst. However, no new radio
flare was detected, possibly due to a sparse time sampling. The deepest,
combined VLA data suggests a variable radio source and we briefly discuss the
properties of the previously detected flares and compare them with microquasars
and active galactic nuclei.

modification of Belanger's recursive method, to avoid an expensive
computational cost in inverting error covariance matrices of product of
innovation processes of different lags when the number of observations becomes
large. When we use only product of innovation processes up to one-lag, the
computational cost is indeed comparable to a recently proposed method by
Berry-Sauer's. However, our method is more flexible since it allows for using

  Extensive numerical comparisons between the proposed method and both the
original Belanger's and Berry-Sauer's schemes are shown in various examples,
ranging from low-dimensional linear and nonlinear systems of SDE's and
40-dimensional stochastically forced Lorenz-96 model. Our numerical results
suggest that the proposed scheme is as accurate as the original Belanger's

undirected connected graph, is one of the fundamental problems in distributed
computing. This is the way in which $\textit{leader election}$ is usually
solved. We consider two distinct tasks in which the largest-labeled node is
found deterministically. In $\textit{selection}$, this node must output 1 and
all other nodes must output 0. In $\textit{election}$, the other nodes must
additionally learn the largest label. Our aim is to compare the difficulty of
these two tasks executed under stringent running time constraints. The measure
of difficulty is the amount of information that nodes of the network must
initially possess in order to solve the given task in an imposed amount of
time. Following the standard framework of $\textit{algorithms with advice}$,
this information (a single binary string) is provided to all nodes at the start
by an oracle knowing the entire graph. The length of this string is called the
$\textit{size of advice}$. Consider the class of $n$-node graphs with any
diameter $diam \leq D$. If time is larger than $diam$, then both tasks can be
solved without advice. For the task of $\textit{election}$, we show that if
time is smaller than $diam$, then the optimal size of advice is $\Theta(\log
n)$, and if time is exactly $diam$, then the optimal size of advice is
$\Theta(\log D)$. For the task of $\textit{selection}$, the situation changes
dramatically, even within the class of rings. Indeed, for the class of rings,
we show that, if time is $O(diam^{\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon <1$, then the
optimal size of advice is $\Theta(\log D)$, and, if time is $\Theta(diam)$ (and
at most $diam$) then this optimal size is $\Theta(\log \log D)$.

bulk electrically-detected magnetic resonance has relied on coupling to spin
readout partners such as paramagnetic defects or conduction electrons which

detection of phosphorus donor electron spin resonance by transport through a
silicon device, using optically-driven donor-bound exciton transitions. We use
this method to measure electron spin Rabi oscillations, and, by avoiding use of
an ancillary spin for readout, we are able to obtain long intrinsic electron
spin coherence times, limited only by the donor concentration. We go on to
experimentally address critical issues for adopting this scheme for single spin

important quantity is the maximum WIMP speed in the observer's rest frame, i.e.
in average the sum of the local Galactic escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$ and of the
circular velocity of the Sun $v_c$. While the latter has been receiving
continuous attention, the former is more difficult to constrain. The RAVE
Collaboration has just released a new estimate of $v_{\rm esc}$ (Piffl {\em et

2007), which is of interest in the perspective of reducing the astrophysical
uncertainties in DD. Nevertheless, these new estimates cannot be used blindly
as they rely on assumptions in the dark halo modeling which induce tight
correlations between the escape speed and other local astrophysical parameters.
We make a self-consistent study of the implications of the RAVE results on DD
assuming isotropic DM velocity distributions, both Maxwellian and ergodic.

CRESST-II, and SuperCDMS, we show that: (i) the exclusion curves associated

with respect to standard limits, because the underlying astrophysical
correlations induce a larger local DM density; (ii) the corresponding relative
uncertainties inferred in the low WIMP mass region may be moderate, down to
10-15% below 10 GeV. We finally discuss the level of consistency of these
results with other independent astrophysical constraints. This analysis is

even when they are driven close to dielectric breakdown. Insight from
microscopic theory is therefore needed to characterize materials and provide
guiding principles to search for new ones with enhanced electrocaloric
performance. Here, we derive from well-known microscopic models of
ferroelectricity meaningful figures of merit which provide insight into the
relation between the strength of the effect and the characteristic interactions
of ferroelectrics such as dipole forces. We find that the long range nature of
these interactions results in a small effect. A strategy is proposed to make it
larger by shortening the correlation lengths of fluctuations of polarization.

times and match lengths has been studied from various perspectives in
information theory literature. In this paper, we undertake a finer study of
these quantities under two different scenarios, i) \emph{zero entropy} sources
that are characterized by strong long-term memory, and ii) the processes with
weak memory as described through various mixing conditions.
  For zero entropy sources, a general statement on match length is obtained. It
is used in the proof of almost sure optimality of Fixed Shift Variant of
Lempel-Ziv (FSLZ) and SWLZ algorithms given in literature. Through an example
of stationary and ergodic processes generated by an irrational rotation we
establish that for a window of size $n_w$, a compression ratio given by
$O(\frac{\log n_w}{{n_w}^a})$ where $a$ depends on $n_w$ and approaches 1 as
$n_w \rightarrow \infty$, is obtained under the application of FSLZ and SWLZ
algorithms. Also, we give a general expression for the compression ratio for a
class of stationary and ergodic processes with zero entropy.
  Next, we extend the study of Ornstein and Weiss on the asymptotic behavior of
the \emph{normalized} version of recurrence times and establish the \emph{large
deviation property} (LDP) for a class of mixing processes. Also, an estimator
of entropy based on recurrence times is proposed for which large deviation
principle is proved for sources satisfying similar mixing conditions.

metric evaluations at the four corner nodes and QM uses metric values at all

properties of single layer black phosphorus (BP) depend strongly on the applied
strain. Due to the strong anisotropic atomic structure of BP, its electronic
conductivity and optical response are sensitive to the magnitude and the
orientation of the applied strain. We found that the inclusion of many body
effects is essential for the correct description of the electronic properties
of monolayer BP; for example while the electronic gap of strainless BP is found
to be 0.90 eV by using semilocal functionals, it becomes 2.31 eV when many-body
effects are taken into account within the G0W0 scheme. Applied tensile strain
was shown to significantly enhances electron transport along zigzag direction
of BP. Furthermore, biaxial strain is able to tune the optical band gap of
monolayer BP from 0.38 eV (at -8% strain) to 2.07 eV (at 5.5%). The exciton
binding energy is also sensitive to the magnitude of the applied strain. It is
found to be 0.40 eV for compressive biaxial strain of -8%, and it becomes 0.83
eV for tensile strain of 4%. Our calculations demonstrate that the optical
response of BP can be significantly tuned using strain engineering which
appears as a promising way to design novel photovoltaic devices that capture a

commutative case, in which the scale factor and BD scalar field are in a
power-law form, in the noncommutative case the power-law scalar factor is
multiplied by a dynamical exponential warp factor. This warp factor depends on
the noncommutative parameter as well as the momentum conjugate associated to
the BD scalar field. We show that the BD scalar field and the scale factor
effectively depend on the noncommutative parameter. For very small values of
this parameter, we obtain an appropriate inflationary solution, which can
overcome problems within BD standard cosmology in a more efficient manner.
Furthermore, a graceful exit from an early acceleration epoch towards a
decelerating radiation epoch is provided. For late times, due to the presence
of the noncommutative parameter, we obtain a zero acceleration epoch, which can
be interpreted as the coarse-grained explanation.

decomposition to estimate spatio-temporal covariances. In this work the
addition of a sparse correction factor is considered, which corresponds to a
model of the covariance as a sum of Kronecker products of low (separation) rank
and a sparse matrix. This sparse correction extends the diagonally corrected
Kronecker PCA of [Greenewald et al 2013, 2014] to allow for sparse unstructured
""outliers"" anywhere in the covariance matrix, e.g. arising from variables or
correlations that do not fit the Kronecker model well, or from sources such as
sensor noise or sensor failure. We introduce a robust PCA-based algorithm to
estimate the covariance under this model, extending the rearranged nuclear norm
penalized LS Kronecker PCA approaches of [Greenewald et al 2014, Tsiligkaridis
et al 2013]. An extension to Toeplitz temporal factors is also provided,
producing a parameter reduction for temporally stationary measurement modeling.
High dimensional MSE performance bounds are given for these extensions.
Finally, the proposed extension of KronPCA is evaluated on both simulated and
real data coming from yeast cell cycle experiments. This establishes the
practical utility of robust Kronecker PCA in biological and other applications.

particular points, where the phenomenon of operator resonance takes place. The
operator resonance phenomenon being perturbative, nevertheless, results in
exact identities between some local operators. By applying an algebraic

sinh-Gordon theory, which generalize the quantum equation of motion. We
identify the corresponding descendant operators by comparing them with the

to determine their final destinations and their timescales of clearing. There
are four possible final states of chaotic particles: collision with the planet,
collision with the star, escape, or bounded but non-collision orbits. In our
investigations, within the framework of the planar circular restricted three
body problem for planet-star mass ratio $\mu$ in the range $10^{-9}$ to
$10^{-1.5}$, we find no particles hitting the star. The relative frequencies of
escape and collision with the planet are not scale-free, as they depend upon
the size of the planet. For planet radius $R_p\ge0.001R_H$ where $R_H$ is the
planet's Hill radius, we find that most chaotic zone particles collide with the
planet for $\mu\lesssim10^{-5}$; particle scattering to large distances is
significant only for higher mass planets. For fixed ratio $R_p/R_H$, the
particle clearing timescale, $T_{cl}$, has a broken power-law dependence on
$\mu$. A shallower power-law, $T_{cl}\sim \mu^{-{1/3}}$, prevails at small
$\mu$ where particles are cleared primarily by collisions with the planet; a
steeper power law, $T_{cl}\sim\mu^{-{3/2}}$, prevails at larger $\mu$ where
scattering dominates the particle loss. In the limit of vanishing planet
radius, we find $T_{cl}\approx0.024\mu^{-{3\over2}}$. The interior and exterior
boundaries of the annular zone in which chaotic particles are cleared are
increasingly asymmetric about the planet's orbit for larger planet masses; the
inner boundary coincides well with the classical first order resonance overlap
zone, $\Delta a_{cl,int}\simeq1.2\mu^{0.28}a_p$; the outer boundary is better
described by $\Delta a_{cl,ext}\simeq1.7\mu^{0.31}a_p$, where $a_p$ is the
planet-star separation.

understand the revenue tradeoffs and to develop simple anonymous auctions that

  We consider digital goods settings and show that the optimal anonymous,
dominant strategy incentive compatible auction has an intuitive structure ---
imagine that bidders are randomly permuted before the auction, then infer a
posterior belief about bidder i's valuation from the values of other bidders
and set a posted price that maximizes revenue given this posterior.
  We prove that no anonymous mechanism can guarantee an approximation better
than O(n) to the optimal revenue in the worst case (or O(log n) for regular
distributions) and that even posted price mechanisms match those guarantees.
Understanding that the real power of anonymous mechanisms comes when the
auctioneer can infer the bidder identities accurately, we show a tight O(k)
approximation guarantee when each bidder can be confused with at most k ""higher

integral tropical points of the mirror. Further, the structure constants for
the multiplication rule in this basis should be given by counting broken lines
(certain combinatorial objects, morally the tropicalisations of holomorphic
discs). Here we prove the conjecture in the case of cluster varieties, where
the statement is a more precise form of the Fock-Goncharov dual basis
conjecture. In particular, under suitable hypotheses, for each Y the partial
compactification of an affine cluster variety U given by allowing some frozen
variables to vanish, we obtain canonical bases for the ring of functions on Y
extending to a basis for functions on U. Each choice of seed canonically
identifies the parameterizing sets of these bases with integral points in a
polyhedral cone. These results specialize to basis results of combinatorial
representation theory. For example, by considering the open double Bruhat cell
U in the basic affine space Y we obtain a canonical basis of each irreducible
representation of SL_r, parameterized by a set which each choice of seed
identifies with integral points of a lattice polytope. These bases and
polytopes are all constructed essentially without representation theoretic

the RMIn$_5$ (R=4f or 5f elements, M=Co, Rh, Ir) family, has triggered enormous
amount of research pointing to understand the physical origin of
superconductivity and its relation with magnetism. Although many properties
have been clarified, there are still crutial questions that remain unanswered.
One of these questions is the particular role of the transition metal in
determining the value of critical superconducting temperature (Tc). In this
work, we analyse an interesting regularity that is experimentally observed in
this family of compounds, where the lowest N\'eel temperatures are obtained in
the Co-based materials. We focus our analysis on the GdMIn$_5$ compounds and
perform density-functional-theory based total-energy calculations to obtain the
parameters for the exchange coupling interactions between the magnetic moments
located at the Gd$^{3+}$ ions. Our calculations indicate that the ground state
of the three compounds is a $C$-type antiferromagnet determined by the
competition between the first- and second-neighbor exchange couplings inside
GdIn$_3$ planes and stabilized by the couplings across MIn$_2$ planes. We then
solve a model with these magnetic interactions using a mean-field approximation
and Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The results obtained for the calculated
N\'eel and Curie-Weiss temperatures, the specific heat and the magnetic
susceptibility are in very good agreement with the existent experimental data.
Remarkably, we show that the first neighbor interplane exchange coupling in the
Co-based material is much smaller than in the Rh and Ir analogues due to a more
two dimensional behaviour in the former. This result explains the observed
lower N\'eel temperature in Co-115 systems and may shed light on the fact that
the Co-based 115 superconductors present the highest Tc.

  has been replaced by arXiv:1501.0033",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a strong parallel repetition theorem for the entangled value of
multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product
distribution). Our result is the first parallel repetition theorem for
entangled games involving more than two players. Furthermore, our theorem
applies to games where the players are allowed to output (possibly entangled)
quantum states as answers.
  More specifically, let $G$ be a $k$-player free game, with entangled value
$\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$. We show that the entangled value of the
$n$-fold repetition of $G$, $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$, is at most $(1 -
\epsilon)^{\Omega(n/k^2)}$. In the traditional setting of $k=2$ players, our
parallel repetition theorem is optimal in terms of its dependence on $\epsilon$
and $n$. For an arbitrary number of players, our result is nearly optimal: for
all $k$, we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n > 1$ such that
$\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$. Hence, exponent
of the repeated game value cannot be improved beyond $\Omega(n/k)$.
  Our parallel repetition theorem improves on the prior results of [Jain, et
al. 2014] and [Chailloux, Scarpa 2014] in a number of ways: (1) our theorem
applies to a larger class of games (arbitrary number of players, quantum
outputs); (2) we demonstrate that strong parallel repetition holds for the
entangled value of free games: i.e., the base of the repeated game value is $1
- \epsilon$, rather than $1 - \epsilon^2$; and (3) there is no dependence of
the repeated game value on the input and output alphabets of $G$. In contrast,
it is known that the repeated game value of classical free games must depend on
the output size. Thus our results demonstrate a seperation between the behavior
of entangled games and classical games.

currently unknown, though available measurements show that the detected
nitrogen in solar system rocks and ices is depleted with respect to solar
abundances and the interstellar medium. We use a detailed chemical/physical
model of the chemical evolution of a protoplanetary disk to explore the
evolution and abundance of nitrogen-bearing molecules. Based on this model we
analyze how initial chemical abundances, provided as either gas or ice during
the early stages of disk formation, influence which species become the dominant
nitrogen bearers at later stages. We find that a disk with the majority of its
initial nitrogen in either atomic or molecular nitrogen is later dominated by
atomic and molecular nitrogen as well as NH$_{3}$ and HCN ices, where the
dominant species varies with disk radius.
  When nitrogen is initially in gaseous ammonia, it later becomes trapped in
ammonia ice except in the outer disk where atomic nitrogen dominates. For a
disk with the initial nitrogen in the form of ammonia ice the nitrogen remains
trapped in the ice as NH$_{3}$ at later stages. The model in which most of the
initial nitrogen is placed in atomic N best matches the ammonia abundances
observed in comets. Furthermore the initial state of nitrogen influences the
abundance of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$, which has been detected in protoplanetary disks.
Strong N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission is found to be indicative of an N$_{2}$
abundance greater than $n_{\mathrm{N_{2}}}/n_{\mathrm{H_{2}}}>10^{-6}$, in
addition to tracing the CO snow line. Our models also indicate that NO is

either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based

We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and
also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector

The first is that the measured

bounds of O(10 TeV) on a new-physics scale. The second puzzle is that the
severe suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons,
e.g. mu->3e, tau->e mu mu, etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions
to lepton interactions cannot exist below O(10 - 100 TeV), whereas the 3.6sigma
deviation of the muon g-2 from the standard model can be explained by a
new-physics scale < O(1 TeV). Here, we suggest that it may not be a coincidence
that both the muon g-2 and the relic density can be satisfied by a new-physics
scale < 1 TeV. We consider the possibility of a gauged lepton-flavor
interaction that couples at tree level only to mu- and tau-flavored leptons and
the dark sector. Dark matter thus interacts appreciably only with particles of
mu and tau flavor at tree level and has loop-suppressed couplings to quarks and
electrons. Remarkably, if such a gauged flavor interaction exists at a scale
O(100 GeV - 1 TeV), it allows for a consistent phenomenological framework,
compatible with the muon g-2, the relic density, direct detection, indirect
detection, charged-lepton decays, neutrino trident production, and results from
hadron and e+e- colliders. We suggest experimental tests for these ideas at

inter-stellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be different
from those in the local Universe because of lower gaseous metallicities, higher
gas fractions, and higher star formation activities. In fact, observations
suggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and
harder UV radiation fields are common. In this paper, based on the spectra of
H$\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with Multi-Object
Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on Keck-1 telescope, we measure
electron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio (
[OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the
electron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we
find that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of
SFR ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) are correlated with the electron density at $z=2.5$
for the first time. The $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}-n_e$ relation is likely to be
linked to the star formation law in HII regions (where star formation activity
is regulated by interstellar pressure). Moreover, we discuss the mode of star
formation in those galaxies. The correlation between sSFR and
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with high
sSFR) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation
($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) and thus higher $n_e$ values as well.

higher than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$. The outflow velocity and mass outflow rate
($\dot{M}_{\rm out}$) exhibit positive correlations with galaxy mass and with
the star formation rate (SFR). However, most of the relations present a large
scatter. The outflow mass loading factor ($\eta$) is between $0.2 - 10$. The
comparison Effective model generates a constant outflow velocity, and a
negative correlation of $\eta$ with halo mass. The number fraction of galaxies
where outflow is detected decreases at lower redshifts, but remains more than
$80 \%$ over $z = 1 - 5$. High SF activity at $z \sim 2 - 4$ drives strong
outflows, causing the positive and steep correlations of velocity and
$\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ with SFR. The outflow velocity correlation with SFR becomes
flatter at $z = 1$, and $\eta$ displays a negative correlation with halo mass
in massive galaxies. Our study demonstrates that both the MUPPI and Effective
models produce significant outflows at $\sim 1 / 10$ of the virial radius; at
the same time shows that the properties of outflows generated can be different
from the input speed and mass loading in the Effective model. Our MUPPI model,
using local properties of gas in the sub-resolution recipe, is able to develop
galactic outflows whose properties correlate with global galaxy properties, and
consistent with observations.

uv-stacking is typically the more robust method. An advantage of the
uv-stacking algorithm is the availability of uv-data post stacking, which makes
it possible to identify and remove problematic baselines. For deep VLA surveys
uv-stacking yields a signal-to-noise ratio that is up to 20 per cent higher
than image-stacking. Furthermore, we have investigated stacking of resolved
sources with a simulated VLA data set where 1.5"" (10-12 kpc at z ~ 1-4) sources

visibilities, significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the size
estimates. While scientific motivation for this work is studying faint, high-z

and Fermi during the first three years of Fermi operations. While bright in the
X-ray band, X-ray flares are often undetected at lower (optical), and higher
(MeV to GeV) energies. We show that this disfavors synchrotron self-Compton
processes as origin of the observed X-ray emission. We compare the broadband
properties of X-ray flares with the standard late internal shock model, and
find that, in this scenario, X-ray flares can be produced by a late-time
relativistic (Gamma>50) outflow at radii R~10^13-10^14 cm. This conclusion
holds only if the variability timescale is significantly shorter than the
observed flare duration, and implies that X-ray flares can directly probe the
activity of the GRB central engine.

properties of the main stellar populations of the Milky Way bulge, we conclude
that the bulge of our Galaxy is not a pure stellar bar formed from a
pre-existing thin stellar disk, as some studies have recently suggested. On the
basis of several arguments emphasized in this paper, we propose that the bulge
population which, in the Milky Way, is observed not to be part of the peanut

Milky Way is a pure thin+thick disk galaxy, with only a possible limited

the spectral theorem is a foundational result in applied mathematics. Motivated
by a shared structure found in inferential problems of recent interest---namely
orthogonal tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), topic
models, spectral clustering, and Gaussian mixture learning---we generalize the
eigendecomposition from quadratic forms to a broad class of ""orthogonally
decomposable"" functions. We identify a key role of convexity in our extension,
and we generalize two traditional characterizations of eigenvectors: First, the
eigenvectors of a quadratic form arise from the optima structure of the
quadratic form on the sphere. Second, the eigenvectors are the fixed points of
the power iteration.
  In our setting, we consider a simple first order generalization of the power
method which we call gradient iteration. It leads to efficient and easily
implementable methods for basis recovery. It includes influential Machine
Learning methods such as cumulant-based FastICA and the tensor power iteration
for orthogonally decomposable tensors as special cases.
  We provide a complete theoretical analysis of gradient iteration using the
structure theory of discrete dynamical systems to show almost sure convergence
and fast (super-linear) convergence rates. The analysis also extends to the
case when the observed function is only approximately orthogonally
decomposable, with bounds that are polynomial in dimension and other relevant
parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be
considered as a non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for
perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices.

matter haloes are abundant and satellites of dwarf galaxies are expected to be
predominantly dark. Since low mass galaxies have smaller baryon fractions
interactions with these satellites may leave particularly dramatic imprints. We
uncover the influence of the most massive of these dark satellites on disky
dwarf galaxies and the possible dynamical and morphological transformations
that result from these interactions. We use a suite of carefully set-up,
controlled simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. The primary dwarf galaxies
have solely a stellar disk in the dark matter halo and the secundaries are
completely devoid of baryons. We vary the disk mass, halo concentration,
initial disk thickness and inclination of the satellite orbit. The disky dwarf
galaxies are heated and disrupted due to the minor merger event, more extremely
for higher satellite over disk mass ratios, and the morphology and kinematics
are significantly altered. Moreover, for less concentrated haloes the minor
merger can completely destroy the disk leaving a low-luminosity spheroidal-like
galaxy instead. We conclude that dwarf galaxies are very much susceptible to
being disturbed by dark galaxies and that even a minor merger event can
significantly disrupt and alter the structure and kinematics of a dwarf galaxy.
This process may be seen as a new channel for the formation of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies.

Galactic Open Clusters (OCs). OCs span a sizeable range in metallicity
-0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to disk
stars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements. A
large scatter is observed for Ba, with most OCs showing [Ba/Fe] and [Ba/La]
overabundant with respect to the Sun. The origin of this overabundance is not
clearly understood. With the goal of providing new observational insights we
determined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical composition
of 27 giant stars members of five OCs: Cr 110, Cr 261, NGC 2477, NGC 2506 and
NGC 5822. We used high-resolution spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph
at ESO Paranal. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of these stars to
measure the abundance of up to 22 elements per star. We study the dependence of
element abundance on metallicity and age with unprecedented detail,
complementing our analysis with data culled from the literature. We confirm the
trend of Ba overabundance in OCs, and show its large dispersion for clusters
younger than ~4 Gyr. Finally, the implications of our results for stellar
nucleosynthesis are discussed. We show in this work that the Ba enrichment
compared to other neutron-capture elements in OCs cannot be explained by the
contributions from the slow neutron-capture process and the rapid
neutron-capture process. Instead, we argue that this anomalous signature can be
explained by assuming an additional contribution by the intermediate
neutron-capture process.

consistent with the standard GMC based size-line width relationships, showing
that the scaling laws extend down to size scales of hundredths of a parsec, and

temperature and study a class of conditional dynamics obtained by monitoring
its totally or partially purified environment. More specifically, drawing from
the notion that the thermal state of the environment may be regarded as the
local state of a lossy and noisy two-mode squeezed state, we consider
conditional dynamics (""unravellings"") resulting from the homodyne detection of
the two modes of such a state. Thus, we identify a class of unravellings
parametrised by the loss rate suffered by the environmental two-mode state,
which interpolate between direct detection of the environmental mode alone
(occurring for total loss, whereby no correlation between the two environmental
modes is left) and full access to the purification of the bath (occurring when
no loss is acting and the two-mode state of the environment is pure). We hence
show that, while direct detection of the bath is not able to reach the maximal
steady-state squeezing allowed by general-dyne unravellings, such optimal
values can be obtained when a fully purified bath is accessible. More generally
we show that, within our framework, any degree of access to the bath
purification improves the performance of filtering protocols in terms of
achievable squeezing and entanglement.

spanning the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. The time-averaged spectrum, measured
between 160 and 560\,GeV, is well described by a power law with a spectral
index of $4.33 \pm 0.09$. The time-averaged integral flux above $200\,$GeV
measured for this period was $(1.69 \pm 0.06) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \,
\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, corresponding to 6.9\% of the Crab Nebula
flux. We also present the combined $\gamma$-ray spectrum from the Fermi Large
Area Telescope and VERITAS covering an energy range from 100~MeV to 560~GeV.
The data are well fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff at $\rm {101.9
\pm 3.2 \, \mathrm{GeV}} $. The origin of the cutoff could be intrinsic to
PG~1553+113 or be due to the $\gamma$-ray opacity of our universe through pair
production off the extragalactic background light (EBL). Given lower limits to
the redshift of $\rm z \negthinspace > \negthinspace 0.395$ based on optical/UV
observations of PG~1553+113, the cutoff would be dominated by EBL absorption.
Conversely, the small statistical uncertainties of the VERITAS energy spectrum
have allowed us to provide a robust upper limit on the redshift of PG 1553+113
of $z \negthinspace \leq \negthinspace 0.62$. A strongly-elevated mean flux of
$(2.50 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{ph} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,

is marginally inconsistent with a steady flux, giving a $\chi^2$ probability
for a steady flux of 0.03\%.

estimate simultaneously using as small number of samples as possible.
Conventional methods treat the detection and estimation subproblems separately,
ignoring the intrinsic coupling between them. However, a joint detection and
estimation problem should be solved to maximize the overall performance. We
address the sample size concern through a sequential and Bayesian setup.
Specifically, we seek the optimum triplet of stopping time, detector, and
estimator(s) that minimizes the number of samples subject to a constraint on
the combined detection and estimation cost. A general framework for optimum
sequential joint detection and estimation is developed. The resulting optimum
detector and estimator(s) are strongly coupled with each other, proving that
the separate treatment is strictly sub-optimum. The theoretical results derived
for a quite general model are then applied to several problems with linear
quadratic Gaussian (LQG) models, including dynamic spectrum access in cognitive
radio, and state estimation in smart grid with topological uncertainty.
Numerical results corroborate the superior overall detection and estimation
performance of the proposed schemes over the conventional methods that handle

stochastic model is introduced that couples short-term formalism (during
radiotherapy) and long-term formalism (post treatment). This framework is used
to estimate the risks of second cancer as a function of spontaneous background
and radiation-induced mutation rates of normal and pre-malignant cells. By
fitting the model to available clinical data for spontaneous background risk
together with data of Hodgkins lymphoma survivors (for various organs), the
second cancer mutation rate is estimated. The model predicts a significant
increase in mutation rate for some cancer types, which may be a sign of genomic
instability. Finally, it is shown that the model results are in agreement with
the measured results for excess relative risk (ERR) as a function of exposure
age, and that the model predicts a negative correlation of ERR with increase in
attained age. This novel approach can be used to analyze several radiotherapy
protocols in current clinical practice, and to forecast the second cancer risks

it is within this 4% range constitutes a null hypothesis test of General

the Event Horizon Telescope. We use the results of optical/IR monitoring of
stellar orbits to show that the mass-to-distance ratio for Sgr A* is already
known to an accuracy of +-4%. We investigate our prior knowledge of the
properties of the scattering screen between Sgr A and the Earth, the effects of
which will need to be corrected for in order for the black-hole shadow to
appear sharp against the background emission. Finally, we explore an edge
detection scheme for interferometric data and a pattern matching algorithm

hole at 1.3 mm can be localized, in principle, to within ~9%. All these results
suggest that our prior knowledge of the properties of the black hole, of
scattering broadening, and of the accretion flow can only limit this General

structured databases, especially those in web databases. With this model, a
search query returns top-k tuples according to not just exact matches of
selection conditions, but a suitable ranking function. This paper studies a
novel problem on the privacy implications of database ranking. The motivation
is a novel yet serious privacy leakage we found on real-world web databases
which is caused by the ranking function design. Many such databases feature
private attributes - e.g., a social network allows users to specify certain
attributes as only visible to him/herself, but not to others. While these
websites generally respect the privacy settings by not directly displaying
private attribute values in search query answers, many of them nevertheless
take into account such private attributes in the ranking function design. The
conventional belief might be that tuple ranks alone are not enough to reveal
the private attribute values. Our investigation, however, shows that this is
not the case in reality.
  To address the problem, we introduce a taxonomy of the problem space with two
dimensions, (1) the type of query interface and (2) the capability of
adversaries. For each subspace, we develop a novel technique which either
guarantees the successful inference of private attributes, or does so for a
significant portion of real-world tuples. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our techniques through theoretical analysis, extensive
experiments over real-world datasets, as well as successful online attacks over
websites with tens to hundreds of millions of users - e.g., Amazon Goodreads
and Renren.com.

which the one-stage costs can have arbitrary signs, but the sum of the negative
parts of the one-stage costs is finite for all policies and all initial states.
We refer to this class as the General Convergence (GC for short) total cost
model, and we study the convergence of value iteration for the GC model, in the
Borel MDP framework with universally measurable policies. Our main results
include: (i) convergence of value iteration when starting from certain
functions above the optimal cost function; (ii) convergence of transfinite
value iteration starting from zero, in the special case where the optimal cost
function is nonnegative; and (iii) partial convergence of value iteration
starting from zero, for a subset of initial states.
  These results extend several previously known results about the convergence
of value iteration for either positive costs problems or GC total cost
problems. In particular, the first result on convergence of value iteration
from above extends a theorem of van der Wal for the GC model. The second result
relates to Maitra and Sudderth's analysis of transfinite value iteration for
the positive costs model. It suggests connections between the two total cost
models when the optimal cost function is nonnegative, and it leads to
additional results on the convergence of ordinary non-transfinite value
iteration, with a suitably defined dynamic programming operator, for finite
state or finite control GC problems. The third result on partial convergence of
value iteration is motivated by Whittle's bridging condition for the positive
costs model, and provides a novel extension of the bridging condition to the GC
model, where there are no sign constraints on the costs.

extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too
inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary
mixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the center. As a result, a
C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a
""hybrid"" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D
stellar evolution computations the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich
material, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material
from its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would
be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then
be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the
Chandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes
associated with high abundances of 23Na and 25Mg. They are followed by
off-center C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire
star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data
for their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized
uncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia
progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative
instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of
explosive C ignition, either off or in the center. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor
models have much lower C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C
ignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed

which could be due to different ages or C+N+O content while NGC 6752 is
representative of the least complex globular clusters. For NGC 1851 and NGC
6752, we obtain average values of A(C+N+O) = 8.16 +/- 0.10 (\sigma = 0.34) and
7.62 +/- 0.02 (\sigma = 0.06), respectively. When taking into account the
measurement errors, we find a constant C+N+O abundance sum in NGC 6752. The
C+N+O abundance dispersion is only 0.06 dex, and such a result requires that
the source of the light element abundance variations does not increase the
C+N+O sum in this cluster. For NGC 1851, we confirm a large spread in C+N+O. In
this cluster, the anomalous RGB has a higher C+N+O content than the canonical
RGB by a factor of four (~0.6 dex). This result lends further support to the
idea that the two subgiant branches in NGC 1851 are roughly coeval, but with
different CNO abundances.

  using Euler-Lagrange large eddy simulation",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A volume-filtered Euler-Lagrange large eddy simulation methodology is used to
predict the physics of turbulent liquid-solid slurry flow through a horizontal
pipe. A dynamic Smagorinsky model based on Lagrangian averaging is employed to
account for the sub-filter scale effects in the liquid phase. A fully
conservative immersed boundary method is used to account for the pipe geometry
on a uniform cartesian grid. The liquid and solid phases are coupled through
volume fraction and momentum exchange terms. Particle-particle and
particle-wall collisions are modeled using a soft-sphere approach. A series of
simulations have been performed by varying the superficial liquid velocity to
be consistent with the experimental data by Dahl et al. (2003). Depending on
the liquid flow rate, a particle bed can form and develop different patterns,
which are discussed in the light of regime diagrams proposed in the literature.
The fluctuation in the height of the liquid-bed interface is characterized to
understand the space and time evolution of these patterns. Statistics of
engineering interest such as mean velocity, mean concentration, and mean
streamwise pressure gradient driving the flow are extracted from the numerical
simulations and presented. Sand hold-up calculated from the simulation results
suggest that this computational strategy is capable of accurately predicting
critical deposition velocity.

theoretical ones, which were simulated with the latitude (psi) dependent solar

accelerated by the radiation flux force, but the radiation drag force prevents
the outflow velocity from increasing. The outflow velocity saturates around
30-40% of the light speed around the rotation axis, since then the flux force
balances with the drag force. Our simulations show that the outflow velocity is
kept nearly constant in the regime of \dot{M}_{BH} ~ 100-1000 L_{Edd}/c^2,
where \dot{M}_{BH} is the mass accretion rate, L_{Edd} is the Eddington
luminosity, and c is the light speed. Such a faster outflow is surrounded by a
slower outflow of ~ 0.1c. This velocity is also determined by force balance
between the radiation flux force and the radiation drag. The radiation drag
works to collimate the slower outflow in cooperation with the Lorentz force,
although the faster outflow is mainly collimated by the Lorentz force. The
kinetic energy is carried by the slower outflow rather than by the faster
outflow. The total kinetic luminosity of the outflow as well as the photon
luminosity is ~ L_{Edd}, almost independent of the mass accretion rate.

contributions of the $S_{11}(1535)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{13}(1900)$,
$S_{11}(2090)$ and $P_{11}(2100)$ resonances, we conclude that either a
subthreshold resonance or a broad $P$-wave state in the near threshold range
seems to be indispensable to describe present data of the $\pi N \to \eta'N$.
Furthermore, at least one broad resonance above $\eta'N$ threshold is
preferred. With this detailed analysis, we could give the invariant mass
spectrum and Dalitz plot of the $J/\psi \to p\bar{p}\eta'$ decay for the
purpose of assisting the future detailed partial wave analysis. It is found
that the $J/\psi \to p\bar{p}\eta'$ data are useful for disentangling the above
or below threshold resonant contribution, though it still further needs the
differential cross section data of $\pi N \to \eta'N$ to realize some of the
resonant and the non-resonant contribution. Our results are enlightening for
the $\eta'N$ production mechanism and the properties of the nucleon resonances
with the mass around 2.0~GeV.

97%, depending on the exact design. Such complete control enables the

five days the viability of cells were evaluated. Moreover, ADSCs were cultured

arbitrary wave numbers. The main difference of our approach to ordinary
cosmological perturbation theory is that we do not perturb a dynamical equation
for the density contrast. Rather, we transport the initial phase-space
distribution of a canonical particle ensemble forward in time and extract any
collective information from it at the time needed. Since even small
perturbations of particle trajectories can lead to large fluctuations in
density, our approach allows to reach high density contrast already at first

to identify the instability conditions for the O-mode below those required for

dispersion of galaxies within this latter radius. These parameters can be a
challenge to measure, especially for small groups with few members. In this
study, results are gathered pertaining to particularly well studied groups over
four decades in group mass. Scaling relations anticipated from theory are
demonstrated and coefficients of the relationships are specified. There is an
update of the relationship between light and mass for groups, confirming that
groups with mass of a few times 10^12 Msun are the most lit up while groups
with more and less mass are darker. It is demonstrated that there is an
interesting one-to-one correlation between the number of dwarf satellites in a
group and the group mass. There is the suggestion that small variations in the
slope of the luminosity function in groups are caused by the degree of
depletion of intermediate luminosity systems rather than variations in the
number per unit mass of dwarfs. Finally, returning to the characteristic radii
of groups, the ratio of first to second turnaround depends on the dark matter
and dark energy content of the universe and a crude estimate can be made from
the current observations of Omega_matter ~ 0.15 in a flat topology, with a 68%

for the first time in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. This leads
to significantly sub- and super-Chandrasekhar limiting masses of white dwarfs,
determined by a single model parameter. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae
(SNeIa), a key to unravel the evolutionary history of the universe, are
believed to be triggered in white dwarfs having mass close to the Chandrasekhar
limit. However, observations of several peculiar, under- and over-luminous
SNeIa argue for exploding masses widely different from this limit. We argue
that explosions of the modified gravity induced sub- and super-Chandrasekhar
limiting mass white dwarfs result in under- and over-luminous SNeIa
respectively, thus unifying these two apparently disjoint sub-classes and,
hence, serving as a missing link. Our discovery raises two fundamental
questions. Is the Chandrasekhar limit unique? Is Einstein's gravity the
ultimate theory for understanding astronomical phenomena? Both the answers
appear to be no.

study based on five years of observations, conducted with the 5 largest radio
telescopes in the world, aimed at determining the companion nature. Through the
measurement of three post-Keplerian orbital parameters we find the pulsar mass
to be 1.291(11) M_sol, and the companion mass 1.322(11) M_sol respectively.
These masses fit well in the observed collection of double neutron stars, but
are also compatible with other white dwarfs around young pulsars such as
J1906+0746. Neither radio pulsations nor dispersion-inducing outflows that
could have further established the companion nature were detected. We derive an
HI-absorption distance, which indicates that an optical confirmation of a white
dwarf companion is very challenging. The pulsar is fading fast due to geodetic
precession, limiting future timing improvements. We conclude that young pulsar
J1906+0746 is likely part of a double neutron star, or is otherwise orbited by
an older white dwarf, in an exotic system formed through two stages of mass
transfer.

neighbor ($k$-ANN) problem, we are given a set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$

goal is to preprocess $P$ so that we can efficiently answer approximate
$k$-flat nearest neighbor queries: given a $k$-flat $F$, find a point in $P$
whose distance to $F$ is within a factor $c$ of the distance between $F$ and
the closest point in $P$. The case $k = 0$ corresponds to the well-studied
approximate nearest neighbor problem, for which a plethora of results are
known, both in low and high dimensions. The case $k = 1$ is called approximate
line nearest neighbor. In this case, we are aware of only one provably
efficient data structure, due to Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, and Nguyen. For $k
\geq 2$, we know of no previous results.
  We present the first efficient data structure that can handle approximate
nearest neighbor queries for arbitrary $k$. We use a data structure for
$0$-ANN-queries as a black box, and the performance depends on the parameters
of the $0$-ANN solution: suppose we have an $0$-ANN structure with query time
$O(n^{\rho})$ and space requirement $O(n^{1+\sigma})$, for $\rho, \sigma > 0$.
Then we can answer $k$-ANN queries in time $O(n^{k/(k + 1 - \rho) + t})$ and
space $O(n^{1+\sigma k/(k + 1 - \rho)} + n\log^{O(1/t)} n)$. Here, $t > 0$ is
an arbitrary constant and the $O$-notation hides exponential factors in $k$,
$1/t$, and $c$ and polynomials in $d$. Our new data structures also give an
improvement in the space requirement over the previous result for $1$-ANN: we
can achieve near-linear space and sublinear query time, a further step towards
practical applications where space constitutes the bottleneck.

Data from ten sources in the literature are analysed along with new data from
three hybrid blazars belonging to the MOJAVE sample. Studies of such hybrid
sources displaying both FRI and FRII jet characteristics could provide the key
to resolving the long-standing Fanaroff-Riley dichotomy issue. A majority of
the 13 hybrid sources show FRII-like total radio powers, i.e., they are
""hybrid"" in radio morphology but not in total radio power. VLBI observations of
ten of the 13 sources show that the X-ray jet is on the same side as the
one-sided VLBI jet. X-rays are therefore emitted from relativistically-boosted
approaching jets. This is consistent with the X-ray emission being IC/CMB in
origin in the majority of sources. It is not completely clear from our study
that asymmetries in the surrounding medium can create hybrid sources. Hybrid
radio morphologies could also be indicative of intrinsically asymmetric jets.

structure identification and extraction in social graphs. Although TDs have
historically been used in structural graph theory and scientific computing, we
show that---even with existing TD heuristics developed for those very different
areas---TD methods can identify interesting structure in a wide range of
realistic informatics graphs. Our main contributions are the following: we show
that TD methods can identify structures that correlate strongly with the
core-periphery structure of realistic networks, even when using simple greedy
heuristics; we show that the peripheral bags of these TDs correlate well with
low-conductance communities (when they exist) found using local spectral
computations; and we show that several types of large-scale ""ground-truth""
communities, defined by demographic metadata on the nodes of the network, are
well-localized in the large-scale and/or peripheral structures of the TDs. Our
other main contributions are the following: we provide detailed empirical
results for TD heuristics on toy and synthetic networks to establish a baseline
to understand better the behavior of the heuristics on more complex real-world
networks; and we prove a theorem providing formal justification for the
intuition that the only two impediments to low-distortion hyperbolic embedding
are high tree-width and long geodesic cycles. Our results suggest future
directions for improved TD heuristics that are more appropriate for realistic

the instability of the normal phase and superconductivity are well described by
BCS model, towards the strong coupling region, where superconducting transition
is due to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs, formed at
temperatures much higher than the temperature of superconducting transition. We
have studied two typical models of conduction band with semi-elliptic and flat
densities of states, appropriate for three-dimensional and two-dimensional
systems respectively. For semi-elliptic density of states disorder influence on
all single-particle properties (e.g. density of states) is universal for
arbitrary strength of electronic correlations and disorder and is due only to
the general disorder widening of conduction band. In the case of flat density
of states universality is absent in general case, but still the disorder
influence is due mainly to band widening and universal behavior is restored for
large enough disorder. Using the combination of DMFT+Sigma and Nozieres -
Schmitt-Rink approximations we have studied disorder influence upon
superconducting transition temperature T_c for the range of characteristic
values of U and disorder, including the BCS-BEC crossover region and the limit
of strong coupling. Disorder can either suppress T_c (in the weak coupling

models are necessary tools to precisely evaluate this interaction and to
predict the cable's behavior, e.g. in terms of effective critical current and
magnetization currents. For this purpose, we developed a fully

twisted geometry of these cables, but is also able to account for the contact
resistances of the current terminations. The latter can have profound influence
on the way the current is partitioned among the tapes, especially on short

compute the critical current and the magnetization AC loss of a twisted tape,
showing the differences with the case of a straight tape. Then, we use it to
calculate the current distribution in a TSTC cable, comparing the results with
those experimentally obtained on a cable composed of four straight stacked
tapes. The results show the ability of the model to simulate twisted conductors
and constitutes a first step toward the simulation of TSTC in high-field magnet

in a very eccentric orbit - and the other is OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 (Pietrzynski

is astoundingly low. Having more RR Lyrae stars in binary systems at hand would
be extremely valuable to get independent measurements of the masses. The data
from the Kepler mission with their unprecedented precision and the long time
span of about four years offer a unique possibility to systematically search
for the signatures of binarity in RR Lyrae stars. Using the pulsation as a
clock, we studied the variations in the timing of maximum light to hunt for
possible binary systems in the sample.

follow from an action principle. The particular subset of transformations of a
system's dynamical variables that maintain the form of the action principle
comprises the group of canonical transformations. In the context of canonical
field theory, the adjective ""extended"" signifies that not only the fields but
also the space-time geometry is subject to transformation. Thus, in order to be
physical, the transition to another, possibly noninertial frame of reference
must necessarily constitute an extended canonical transformation that defines
the general mapping of the connection coefficients, hence the quantities that
determine the space-time curvature and torsion of the respective reference
frame. The canonical transformation formalism defines simultaneously the
transformation rules for the conjugates of the connection coefficients and for
the Hamiltonian. As will be shown, this yields unambiguously a particular
Hamiltonian that is form-invariant under the canonical transformation of the
connection coefficients and thus satisfies the general principle of relativity.
This Hamiltonian turns out to be a quadratic function of the curvature tensor.
Its Legendre-transformed counterpart then establishes a unique Lagrangian
description of the dynamics of space-time that is not postulated but derived
from basic principles, namely the action principle and the general principle of
relativity. Moreover, the resulting theory satisfies the principle of scale
invariance and is renormalizable.

Most of the mathematical models in the literature study the production of {\em
one} fixed type of proteins. When several classes of proteins are considered,
an important additional aspect has to be taken into account, the limited common
resources of the cell (polymerases and ribosomes) used by the production
process. Understanding the impact of this limitation is a key issue in this
domain. In this paper we focus on the allocation of ribosomes in the case of
the production of multiple proteins. The cytoplasm of the cell being a
disorganized medium subject to thermal noise, the protein production process
has an important stochastic component. For this reason, a Markovian model of
this process is introduced. Asymptotic results of the equilibrium are obtained
under a scaling procedure and a realistic biological assumption of saturation
of the ribosomes available in the cell. It is shown in particular that, in the
limit, the number of non-allocated ribosomes at equilibrium converges in
distribution to a Poisson distribution whose parameter satisfies a fixed point
equation. It is also shown that the production process of different types of
proteins can be seen as independent production processes but with modified
parameters.

phrased as follows: given a game $G$ with optimal winning probability
$1-\alpha$ and its repeated version $G^n$ (in which $n$ games are played
together, in parallel), can the players use strategies that are substantially
better than ones in which each game is played independently? This question is
relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role
in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this work
the case of multiplayer non-signalling games is considered, i.e., the only
restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during
the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of
questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players we
prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signalling
players win more than a fraction $1-\alpha+\beta$ of the $n$ games is
exponentially small in $n\beta^2$, for every $0\leq \beta \leq \alpha$. For
games with incomplete support we derive a similar statement, for a slightly
modified form of repetition. The result is proved using a new technique, based
on a recent de Finetti theorem, which allows us to avoid central technical
difficulties that arise in standard proofs of parallel repetition theorems.

covariants is constructed in arbitrary dimensions and metric signatures,
generalizing Lounesto's 4D spinor field classification. In such a generalized
classification a basic role is played by the geometric Fierz identities. In 4D
Minkowski spacetime the standard bilinear covariants can be either null or
non-null -- with the exception of the current density which is invariably
different from zero for physical reasons -- and sweep all types of spinor
fields, including Dirac, Weyl, Majorana and more generally flagpoles,
flag-dipoles and dipole spinor fields. To obtain an analogous classification in
higher dimensions we use the Fierz identities, which constrain the covariant
bilinears in the spinor fields and force some of them to vanish. A generalized
graded Fierz aggregate is moreover obtained in such a context simply from the
completeness relation. We analyze the particular and important case of
Riemannian 7-manifolds, where the Majorana spinor fields turn out to have a
quite special place. In particular, at variance with spinor fields in 4D
Minkowski spacetime that are classified in six disjoint classes, spinors in
Riemannian 7-manifolds are shown to be classified, according to the bilinear
covariants: (a) in just one class, in the real case of Majorana spinors; (b) in
four classes, in the most general case. Much like new classes of spinor fields
in 4D Minkowski spacetime have been evincing new possibilities in physics, we
think these new classes of spinor fields in seven dimensions are, in
particular, potential candidates for new solutions in the compactification of
supergravity on a seven-dimensional manifold and its exotic versions.

involved in any atomic transition can have only even values of the total
angular momentum J. This selection rule is an extension of the Landau-Yang
theorem to the photons involved in atomic transitions. 2) second rule (SSSR-2):
three equivalent dipole photons involved in any atomic transition can have only

Infecting bacteria ascend the urethra to the bladder and then kidneys by

adhesins. P pili are associated with pyelonephritis, the more severe infection
of the kidneys. In order to find means to treat pyelonephritis, it is therefore
of interest to investigate the properties P pili. The mechanical behavior of
individual P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli has recently been
investigated using optical tweezers. P pili, whose main part constitutes the
PapA rod, composed of ~1000 PapA subunits in a helical arrangement, are
distributed over the bacterial surface and mediate adhesion to host cells. We
have earlier studied P pili regarding its stretching/elongation properties
where we have found and characterized three different elongation regions, of
which one constitute an unfolding of the quaternary (helical) structure of the
PapA rod. It was shown that this unfolding takes place at an elongation
independent force of 27 pN. We have also recently performed studies on its
folding properties and shown that the unfolding/folding of the PapA rod is
completely reversible. Here we present a study of the dynamical properties of
the PapA rod. We show, among other things, that the unfolding force increases
and that the folding force decreases with the speed of unfolding and folding
respectively. Moreover, the PapA rod can be folded-unfolded a significant
number of times without loosing its characteristics, a phenomenon that is
believed to be important for the bacterium to keep close contact to the host
tissue and consequently helps the bacterium to colonize the host tissue.

cause of diarrhea in young children in developing countries and in travelers,
causing significant mortality in children. Adhesive fimbriae are a prime
virulence factor for ETEC, initiating colonization of the small intestinal
epithelium. Similar to other Gram-negative bacteria, ETEC express one or more
diverse fimbriae, some assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway and others by
the alternate chaperone pathway. Here we elucidate structural and biophysical
aspects and adaptations of each fimbrial type to its respective host niche.
CS20 fimbriae are compared to CFA/I fimbriae, which are two ETEC fimbriae
assembled via different pathways, and to Pfimbriae from uropathogenic E. coli.
Many fimbriae unwind from their native helical filament to an extended linear
conformation under force, thereby sustaining adhesion by reducing load at the
point of contact between the bacterium and the target cell. CFA/I fimbriae
require the least force to unwind, followed by CS20 fimbriae and then
P-fimbriae, which require the highest unwinding force. We conclude from our
electron microscopy reconstructions, modeling, and force spectroscopy data that
the target niche plays a central role in the biophysical properties of fimbriae
that are critical for bacterial pathophysiology.

  1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow.
  2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language
for speed or deployment, and
  3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left
untouched as they are built by the experts.

between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom
treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the
right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation
is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are

technique from computer science, generic programming.

electromagnetic wave bending and delay. Refractive bending and delay through
the Earth's atmosphere at both radio/millimetric and optical/IR wavelengths are
discussed, but with most emphasis on the former, and with Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA) applications in mind. As modern astronomical
measurements often require sub-arcsecond position accuracy, care is required
when selecting refractive bending and delay algorithms. For the
spherically-uniform model atmospheres generally used for all refractive bending
and delay algorithms, positional accuracies $\lesssim 1^{\prime\prime}$ are
achievable when observing at zenith angles $\lesssim 75^\circ$. A number of
computationally economical approximate methods for atmospheric refractive
bending and delay calculation are presented, appropriate for astronomical
observations under these conditions. For observations under more realistic
atmospheric conditions, for zenith angles $\gtrsim 75^\circ$, or when higher
positional accuracy is required, more rigorous refractive bending and delay
algorithms must be employed. For accurate calculation of the refractive
bending, we recommend the Auer & Standish (2000) method, using numerical
integration to ray-trace through a two-layer model atmosphere, with an
atmospheric model determination of the atmospheric refractivity. For the delay
calculation we recommend numerical integration through a model atmosphere.

is nevertheless possible to construct such models that exhibit features
commonly associated with quantum mechanics. These models are also used to
explore the question of {\psi}-ontic versus {\psi}-epistemic theories for
quantum mechanics. Spekkens' toy theory is one such model. It arises from
classical probabilistic mechanics via a limit on the knowledge an observer may
have about the state of a system. The toy theory for the simplest possible
underlying system closely resembles stabilizer quantum mechanics, a fragment of
quantum theory which is efficiently classically simulable but also non-local.
Further analysis of the similarities and differences between those two theories
can thus yield new insights into what distinguishes quantum theory from
classical theories, and {\psi}-ontic from {\psi}-epistemic theories.
  In this paper, we develop a graphical language for Spekkens' toy theory.
Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for the analysis of
quantum mechanics and similar theories. To compare quantum mechanics and a toy
model, it is useful to have similar formalisms for both. We show that our
language fully describes Spekkens' toy theory and in particular, that it is
complete: meaning any equality that can be derived using other formalisms can
also be derived entirely graphically. Our language is inspired by a similar
graphical language for quantum mechanics called the ZX-calculus. Thus Spekkens'
toy bit theory and stabilizer quantum mechanics can be analysed and compared
using analogous graphical formalisms.

algebraic systems. No lower bound for refuting any family of $3$-CNFs was
previously known for the total space in resolution or for the monomial space in
algebraic systems. We prove that every Polynomial Calculus with Resolution
refutation of a random $3$-CNF $\phi$ in $n$ variables requires, with high
probability, $\Omega(n/\log n)$ distinct monomials to be kept simultaneously in
memory. The same construction also proves that every Resolution refutation
$\phi$ requires, with high probability, $\Omega(n/\log n)$ clauses each of
width $\Omega(n/\log n)$ to be kept at the same time in memory. This gives a
$\Omega(n^2/\log^2 n)$ lower bound for the total space needed in Resolution to
refute $\phi$.
  The main technical innovation is a variant of Hall's theorem. We show that in
bipartite graphs $G$ with bipartition $(L,R)$ and left-degree at most 3, $L$
can be covered by certain families of disjoint paths, called $(2,4)$-matchings,
provided that $L$ expands in $R$ by a factor of $(2-\epsilon)$, for $\epsilon <

science such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuring
the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science.
The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of
knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are
challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized
tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge
can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific
features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze
the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science
test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using
standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real
advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I
argue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that,
first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled,
and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems.
In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test
kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests.

We briefly discuss the limitations of including the energy-momentum tensor in

derived from the action. The fact that theories containing non-linear
contractions of the Ricci tensor usually leads to the presence of pathologies
associated with higher-order equations of motion will be shown to constrain the

that the conformal mode for these theories generally has higher-order equations
of motion and that non-minimal couplings to the matter fields usually lead to
higher-order equations of motion. In order to illustrate such limitations we
explicitly study the cases of a canonical scalar field, a K-essence field and a
massive vector field. Whereas for the scalar field cases it is possible to find
healthy theories, for the vector field case the presence of instabilities is
unavoidable.

the intrinsic geometry of a high-dimensional data set $\left\{x_i
\right\}_{i=1}^{n} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The key ingredient is the
construction of a Markov chain on the set, where transition probabilities
depend on the distance between elements, for example where for every $1 \leq j
\leq n$ the probability of going from $x_j$ to $x_i$ is proportional to $$
p_{ij} \sim \exp \left( -\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\|x_i
-x_j\|^2_{\ell^2(\mathbb{R}^d)}\right) \qquad

which increases the self-consistency of such Markov chains before spectral
methods are applied. Instead of directly using a Markov transition matrix $P$,
we set $p_{ii} = 0$ and rescale, thereby obtaining a transition matrix $P^*$
modeling a non-lazy random walk. We then create a new transition matrix $Q =
(q_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n}$ by demanding that for fixed $j$ the quantity $q_{ij}$ be
proportional to $$ q_{ij} \sim \min((P^*)_{ij}, ((P^*)^2)_{ij}, \dots,

in which the clouds engage in global gravitational contraction, and local
collapse events culminate significantly earlier than the global collapse, we
investigate the growth of density perturbations embedded in a collapsing
background, to which we refer as an Inverse Hubble Flow (IHF). We use the
standard procedure for the growth of perturbations in a universe that first
expands (the usual Hubble Flow) and then recollapses (the IHF). We find that
linear density perturbations immersed in an IHF grow faster than perturbations
evolving in a static background (the standard Jeans analysis). A fundamental
distinction between the two regimes is that, in the Jeans case, the time
$\tau_\mathrm{nl}$ for a density fluctuation to become nonlinear increases
without limit as its initial value approaches zero, while in the IHF case
$\tau_\mathrm{nl} \le \tau_\mathrm{ff}$ always, where $\tau_\mathrm{ff}$ is the
free-fall time of the background density. We suggest that this effect, although
moderate, implies that small-scale density fluctuations embedded in
globally-collapsing clouds must collapse earlier than their parent cloud,
regardless of whether the initial amplitude of the fluctuations is moderate or
strongly nonlinear, thus allowing the classical mechanism of Hoyle
fragmentation to operate in multi-Jeans-mass MCs. More fundamentally, our
results show that, contrary to the standard paradigm that fluctuations of all
scales grow at the same rate in the linear regime, the hierarchical nesting of
the fluctuations of different scales does affect their growth even in the
linear stage.

different scenarios of the space of parameters, where decays into dark matter

technologies. Some of the technologies, especially those exploring the
principle of single-molecule sequencing, allow incomplete nucleotide
incorporation in each cycle. We derive statistical distributions for sequencing
by synthesis by taking into account the possibility that nucleotide
incorporation may not be complete in each flow cycle. The statistical
distributions are expressed in terms of nucleotide probabilities of the target
sequences and the nucleotide incorporation probabilities for each nucleotide.
We give exact distributions both for fixed number of flow cycles and for fixed
sequence length. Explicit formulas are derived for the mean and variance of
these distributions. The results are generalizations of our previous work for
pyrosequencing. Incomplete nucleotide incorporation leads to significant change
in the mean and variance of the distributions, but still they can be
approximated by normal distributions with the same mean and variance. The
results are also generalized to handle sequence context dependent
incorporation. The statistical distributions will be useful for instrument and
software development for sequencing by synthesis platforms.

the mean number of positive signals in a pyrogram is approximately twice the

view of the gap that exists between current practice in mainstream climate
science, and the practical needs of policymakers charged with exploring
possible interventions in the context of climate change. By `mainstream' we
mean the type of climate science that dominates in universities and research
centres, which we will term `academic' climate science, in contrast to `policy'
climate science; aspects of this distinction will become clearer in what
follows.
  In a nutshell, we do not think that academic climate science equips climate
scientists to be as helpful as they might be, when involved in climate policy
assessment. Partly, we attribute this to an over-investment in high resolution
climate simulators, and partly to a culture that is uncomfortable with the
inherently subjective nature of climate uncertainty.
