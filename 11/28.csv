Detailed biophysical models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model as well as
simplified neuron models such as the class of integrate-and-fire models relate
the input current to the membrane potential of the neuron. Those types of
models have been extensively fitted to in vitro data where the input current is
controlled. Those models are however of little use when it comes to
characterize intracellular in vivo recordings since the input to the neuron is
not known. Here we propose a novel single neuron model that characterizes the
statistical properties of in vivo recordings. More specifically, we propose a
stochastic process where the subthreshold membrane potential follows a Gaussian
process and the spike emission intensity depends nonlinearly on the membrane
potential as well as the spiking history. We first show that the model has a
rich dynamical repertoire since it can capture arbitrary subthreshold
autocovariance functions, firing-rate adaptations as well as arbitrary shapes
of the action potential. We then show that this model can be efficiently fitted
to data without overfitting. Finally, we show that this model can be used to
characterize and therefore precisely compare various intracellular in vivo
recordings from different animals and experimental conditions.

photonic microcavity structure in the optical communication wavelength range.
The merging and splitting of cavity mode is analyzed with realistic microcavity
structures. The merging of dual cavity resonance into a single cavity resonance
is achieved by changing the number of layers between the two cavities. The
splitting of single cavity resonance into dual cavity resonance is obtained
with an increase in the reflectivity of mirrors in the front and rear side of
the microcavity structure. The threshold condition for the merging and
splitting of cavity mode is established in terms of structural parameters. The
physical origin of the merging of dual cavity modes into a single cavity
resonance is discussed in terms of the electric field intensity distribution in
the microcavity structure. The microcavity structure with dual cavity modes is
useful for the generation of entangled photon pairs, for achieving the
strong-coupling regime between exciton and photon, and for high resolution
multi-wavelength filters in optical communication.

representative subgraph of the large scale network in the training phase and
the model parameters are estimated in the validation stage. The KSC model has a
powerful out-of-sample extension property which allows cluster affiliation for

significant progress has been achieved in last decades with the construction of
large arrays that are currently taking data. One of the most important pieces
of information comes from the chemical composition of primary particles. It is
well known that the muon content of air showers generated by the interaction of
cosmic rays with the atmosphere is rather sensitive to primary mass. Therefore,
the measurement of the number of muons at ground level is an essential
ingredient to infer the cosmic ray mass composition. In this work we present a
new method for reconstructing the muon lateral distribution function with an
array of segmented counters. The energy range from .4 to 2.5 EeV is considered.
For a triangular array spaced at 750 m we found that 450 m is the optimal
distance to evaluate the number of muons. The corresponding statistical and
systematic uncertainties of the new and of a previous reconstruction methods
are compared. Since the statistical uncertainty of the new reconstruction is
less than in the original one, the power to discriminate between heavy and
light cosmic ray primaries is enhanced. The detector dynamic range is also
extended in the new reconstruction, so events falling closer to a detector can
be included in composition studies.

  silver nanowire",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Silver nanowires have great application potential in fields like flexible
electronic devices, solar cells and transparent electrodes. It is critical and
fundamental to study the thermal and electrical transport properties in a
single silver nanowire. In this work, the thermal and electrical transport in
an individual silver nanowire is characterized down to 35 K with the steady
state electro-thermal technique. The results indicate that, at room
temperature, the electrical resistivity increases by around 4 folds compared
from that of its bulk counterpart. After fitting the temperature dependent
electrical resistivity curves with the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen formula, the Debye
temperature (151 K) of the silver nanowire is found 36% lower than that (235 K)
of bulk silver, confirming strong phonon softening. The thermal conductivity is
reduced by 55% compared with that of its bulk counterpart at room temperature
and this reduction becomes larger as the temperature goes down. To explain the
opposite trends of thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) ~ temperature (T) of silver
nanowire and bulk silver, a unified thermal resistivity is used to elucidate
the electron scattering mechanism. A large residual unified thermal resistivity
for the silver nanowire is observed while that of the bulk silver is almost
zero. The same trend of variation against T indicates that the silver nanowire
and bulk silver share the same phonon-electron scattering mechanism.
Additionally, due to phonon-assisted electron energy transfer across the grain
boundaries, the Lorenz number of the silver nanowire is found much larger than
that of bulk silver and decreases with decreasing temperature.

differential spectrophotometry, we observed one transit in 2013 and another in
2014, with average spectral resolutions of ~700 and ~250, spanning the Johnson
BVR photometric bands. We find a white-light planet-to-star radius ratio of
0.0190 -0.0027+0.0023 from the 2013 observations and 0.0200 -0.0018+0.0017 from
the 2014 observations. The two datasets combined results in a radius ratio of
0.0198 -0.0014+0.0013. These values are all in agreement with previous
space-based results. Scintillation noise in the data prevents us from placing
strong constraints on the presence of an extended hydrogen-rich atmosphere.
Nevertheless, our detections of 55 Cnc e in transit demonstrate that
moderate-size telescopes on the ground will be capable of routine follow-up
observations of super-Earth candidates discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) around bright stars. We expect it will be also possible
to place constraints on the atmospheric characteristics of those planets by
devising observational strategies to minimize scintillation noise.

the combined and calibrated data cube, and we perform a first-pass analysis of
the sources detected in the HDF-S imaging. We measured the redshifts of 189
sources up to a magnitude F814W = 29.5, increasing by more than an order of
magnitude the number of known spectroscopic redshifts in this field. We also
discovered 26 Lya emitting galaxies which are not detected in the HST WFPC2
deep broad band images.
  The intermediate spectral resolution of 2.3{\AA} allows us to separate
resolved asymmetric Lya emitters, [O II] emitters, and C III] emitters and the
large instantaneous wavelength range of 4500{\AA} helps to identify single
emission lines. We also show how the three dimensional information of MUSE
helps to resolve sources which are confused at ground-based image quality.
  Overall, secure identifications are provided for 83% of the 227 emission line
sources detected in the MUSE data cube and for 32% of the 586 sources
identified in the HST catalog of Casertano et al 2000. The overall redshift
distribution is fairly flat to z=6.3, with a reduction between z=1.5 to 2.9, in
the well-known redshift desert. The field of view of MUSE also allowed us to
detect 17 groups within the field. We checked that the number counts of [O II]
and Ly-a emitters are roughly consistent with predictions from the literature.
Using two examples we demonstrate that MUSE is able to provide exquisite
spatially resolved spectroscopic information on intermediate redshift galaxies
present in the field.

unknown. These are parametrically small and included in the estimated error

laboratory for understanding the physics of star formation. This galaxy has
been extensively observed in the past, revealing tens of radio-bright compact
objects embedded in a diffuse free-free absorbing medium. Our understanding of
the structure and physics of this medium in M82 can be greatly improved by
high-resolution images at low frequencies where the effects of free-free
absorption are most prominent.
  The aims of this study are, firstly, to demonstrate imaging using
international baselines of the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), and secondly, to
constrain low-frequency spectra of compact and diffuse emission in the central
starburst region of M82 via high-resolution radio imaging at low frequencies.
  The international LOFAR telescope was used to observe M82 at 110-126MHz and
146-162MHz. Images were obtained using standard techniques from very long
baseline interferometry. images were obtained at each frequency range: one only
using international baselines, and one only using the longest Dutch (remote)
baselines.
  The 154MHz image obtained using international baselines is a new imaging
record in terms of combined image resolution (0.3$""$) and sensitivity
($\sigma$=0.15mJy/beam) at low frequencies ($<327$MHz). We detected 16 objects
at 154MHz, six of these also at 118MHz. Four weaker but resolved features are
also found: a linear (50pc) filament and three other resolved objects, of which
two show a clear shell structure. We do not detect any emission from either
supernova 2008iz or from the radio transient source 43.78+59.3. The images
obtained using remote baselines show diffuse emission, associated with the
outflow in M82, with reduced brightness in the region of the edge-on

algorithms or a hybrid of the two previous methodologies. The plug-in
algorithms are based on replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric
estimator, usually the kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental
problem from an applied perspective. However, if some a priori information
about the geometry of the level set is available, then excess mass algorithms
could be useful. Hybrid methods such that granulometric smoothing algorithm
assume a mild geometric restriction on the level set and it requires a pilot
nonparametric estimator of the density. In this work, a new hybrid algorithm is
proposed under the assumption that the level set is r-convex. The main problem
in practice is that r is an unknown geometric characteristic of the set. A
stochastic algorithm is proposed for selecting its optimal value. The resulting
data-driven reconstruction of the level set is able to achieve the same
convergence rates as the granulometric smoothing method. However, they do no
depend on any penalty term because, although the value of the shape index r is
a priori unknown, it is estimated in a data-driven way from the sample points.
The practical performance of the estimator proposed is illustrated through a
real data example.

to study the large exceedance probabilities of the perpetuity sequence $Y_n :=
B_1 + A_1 B_2 + \cdots + (A_1 \cdots A_{n-1}) B_n$, where $(A_i,B_i) \subset
(0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}$. Estimates for the stationary tail distribution
of $\{ Y_n \}$ have been developed in the seminal papers of Kesten (1973) and
Goldie (1991). Specifically, it is well-known that if $M := \sup_n Y_n$, then
${\mathbb P} \left\{ M > u \right\} \sim {\cal C}_M u^{-\xi}$ as $u \to
\infty$. While much attention has been focused on extending this estimate, and
related estimates, to more general processes, little work has been devoted to
understanding the path behavior of these processes. In this paper, we derive
sharp asymptotic estimates for the large exceedance times of $\{ Y_n \}$.
Letting $T_u := (\log\, u)^{-1} \inf\{n: Y_n > u \}$ denote the normalized
first passage time, we study ${\mathbb P} \left\{ T_u \in G \right\}$ as $u \to
\infty$ for sets $G \subset [0,\infty)$. We show, first, that the scaled
sequence $\{ T_u \}$ converges in probability to a certain constant $\rho > 0$.
Moreover, if $G \cap [0,\rho] \not= \emptyset$, then ${\mathbb P} \left\{ T_u
\in G \right\} u^{I(G)} \to C(G)$ as $u \to \infty$ for some ""rate function""
$I$ and constant $C(G)$. On the other hand, if $G \cap [0,\rho] = \emptyset$,
then we show that the tail behavior is actually quite complex, and different
asymptotic regimes are possible. We conclude by extending our results to the
corresponding forward process, understood in the sense of Letac (1986), namely,
the reflected process $M_n^\ast := \max\{ A_n M_{n-1}^\ast + B_n, 0 \}$ for $n

early time behaviour of fast but smooth quantum quenches in a general
$d$-dimensional conformal field theory deformed by a relevant operator of
dimension $\Delta$ with a time-dependent coupling. The quench consists of
changing the coupling from an initial constant value $\lambda_1$ by an amount
of the order of $\delta \lambda$ to some other final value $\lambda_2$, over a
time scale $\delta t$. In the fast quench limit where $\delta t$ is smaller
than all other length scales in the problem, $ \delta t \ll
\lambda_1^{1/(\Delta-d)}, \lambda_2^{1/(\Delta-d)}, \delta
\lambda^{1/(\Delta-d)}$, the energy (density) injected into the system scales
as $\delta{\cal E} \sim (\delta \lambda)^2 (\delta t)^{d-2\Delta}$. Similarly,
the change in the expectation value of the quenched operator at times earlier
than the endpoint of the quench scales as $<{\cal O}_\Delta> \sim \delta
\lambda (\delta t)^{d-2\Delta}$, with further logarithmic enhancements in
certain cases. While these results were first found in holographic studies, we
recently demonstrated that precisely the same scaling appears in fast mass
quenches of free scalar and free fermionic field theories. As we describe in
detail, the universal scaling refers to renormalized quantities, in which the
UV divergent pieces are consistently renormalized away by subtracting
counterterms derived with an adiabatic expansion. We argue that this scaling
law is a property of the conformal field theory at the UV fixed point, valid
for arbitrary relevant deformations and insensitive to the details of the
quench protocol. Our results highlight the difference between smooth fast
quenches and instantaneous quenches where the Hamiltonian abruptly changes at
some time.

stochastic models. We consider situations where the target distribution can be
written as an appropriate limit of distributions, and where conventional
approaches require truncation of such a representation leading to a systematic
bias. For example, the target distribution might be representable as the
$L^2$-limit of a basis expansion in a suitable Hilbert space; or alternatively
the distribution of interest might be representable as the weak limit of a
sequence of random variables, as in MCMC. Our main motivation comes from
infinite-dimensional models which can be parame- terised in terms of a series
expansion of basis functions (such as that given by a Karhunen-Loeve
expansion). We consider schemes for direct unbiased estimation along such an
expansion, as well as those based on MCMC schemes which, due to their
dimensionality, cannot be directly imple- mented, but which can be effectively
estimated unbiasedly. For all our methods we give theory to justify the
numerical stability for robust Monte Carlo implementation, and in some cases we
illustrate using simulations. Interestingly the computational efficiency of our
methods is usually comparable to simpler methods which are biased. Crucial to
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology is the construction of
appropriate couplings, many of which resonate strongly with the Monte Carlo
constructions used in the coupling from the past algorithm and its variants.

update their decision statistics by simultaneously processing latest
observations (innovations) sensed sequentially over time and information
obtained from neighboring agents (consensus). For each pre-specified set of

which ensure that the algorithm achieves the desired error performance and
terminates in finite time almost surely (a.s.) at each network agent. Large
deviation exponents for the tail probabilities of the agent stopping time
distributions are obtained and it is shown that asymptotically (in the number

centralized detector. The expected stopping time for the proposed algorithm at

the expected stopping times is characterized in terms of network connectivity.

models which compute their associated unnormalized density functions using a
special type of arithmetic circuit. When certain sufficient conditions, called
the decomposability and completeness conditions (or ""D&C"" conditions), are
imposed on the structure of these circuits, marginal densities and other useful
quantities, which are typically intractable for other deep generative models,
can be computed by what amounts to a single evaluation of the network (which is
a property known as ""validity""). However, the effect that the D&C conditions
have on the capabilities of D&C SPNs is not well understood.
  In this work we analyze the D&C conditions, expose the various connections
that D&C SPNs have with multilinear arithmetic circuits, and consider the
question of how well they can capture various distributions as a function of
their size and depth. Among our various contributions is a result which
establishes the existence of a relatively simple distribution with fully
tractable marginal densities which cannot be efficiently captured by D&C SPNs
of any depth, but which can be efficiently captured by various other deep
generative models. We also show that with each additional layer of depth
permitted, the set of distributions which can be efficiently captured by D&C
SPNs grows in size. This kind of ""depth hierarchy"" property has been widely
conjectured to hold for various deep models, but has never been proven for any
of them. Some of our other contributions include a new characterization of the
D&C conditions as sufficient and necessary ones for a slightly strengthened
notion of validity, and various state-machine characterizations of the types of
computations that can be performed efficiently by D&C SPNs.

randomly corrupted. In this scenario, there is an unobservable sample with
noise-free labels. However, before being observed, the true labels are
independently flipped with a probability $\rho\in[0,0.5)$, and the random label
noise can be class-conditional. Here, we address two fundamental problems
raised by this scenario. The first is how to best use the abundant surrogate
loss functions designed for the traditional classification problem when there
is label noise. We prove that any surrogate loss function can be used for
classification with noisy labels by using importance reweighting, with
consistency assurance that the label noise does not ultimately hinder the
search for the optimal classifier of the noise-free sample. The other is the
open problem of how to obtain the noise rate $\rho$. We show that the rate is
upper bounded by the conditional probability $P(y|x)$ of the noisy sample.
Consequently, the rate can be estimated, because the upper bound can be easily
reached in classification problems. Experimental results on synthetic and real
datasets confirm the efficiency of our methods.

future design of communication or transportation systems, however both
characteristics are incompatible in many real networks. Recently, it has been
found that the robustness of onion-like structure with positive degree-degree
correlations is optimal against intentional attacks. We show that, by
biologically inspired copying, an onion-like network emerges in the incremental
growth with functions of proxy access and reinforced connectivity on a space.
The proposed network consists of the backbone of tree-like structure by
copyings and the periphery by adding shortcut links between low degree nodes to
enhance the connectivity. It has the fine properties of the statistically
self-averaging unlike the conventional duplication-divergence model,
exponential-like degree distribution without overloaded hubs, strong robustness
against both malicious attacks and random failures, and the efficiency with
short paths counted by the number of hops as mediators and by the Euclidean
distances. The adaptivity to heal over and to recover the performance of
networking is also discussed for a change of environment in such disasters or
battlefields on a geographical map. These properties will be useful for a
resilient and scalable infrastructure of network systems even in emergent
situations or poor environments.

to probe the geometric phase, which corresponds to the exchange of two Majorana
zero modes positioned at the ends of a three-site chain. Finally, we
demonstrate the immunity of quantum information encoded in the Majorana zero

the way for the efficient realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes

wide band gap, the highest thermal conductivity, and a very high Debye
temperature. In 2004, Ekimov et al. discovered that heavily boron-doped
(B-doped) diamond becomes a superconductor around 4 K. Our group successfully
controlled the boron concentration and synthesized homoepitaxially grown
superconducting diamond films by a CVD method. By CVD method, we found that
superconductivity appears when the boron concentration (nB) exceeds a
metal-insulator transition concentration of 3.0x10^20 cm^-3 and its Tczero
increases up to 7.4 K with increasing nB. We additionally elucidated that the
holes formed at the valence band are responsible for the metallic states
leading to superconductivity. The calculations predicted that the hole doping
into the valence band induces strong attractive interaction and a rapid
increase in Tc with increasing boron concentration. According to the
calculations, if substitutional doped boron could be arranged periodically or
the degree of disorder is reduced, a Tc of approximately 100 K could be
achieved via minimal percent doping. In this work, we have successfully
observed zero resistivity above 10 K and an onset of resistivity reduction at
25.2 K in heavily B-doped diamond film. However, the effective carrier
concentration is similar to that of superconducting diamond with a lower Tc. We
found that the carrier has a longer mean free path and lifetime than previously
reported, indicating that this highest Tc diamond has better crystallinity
compared to that of other superconducting diamond films. In addition, the
susceptibility shows a small transition above 20 K in the high quality diamond,
suggesting a signature of superconductivity above 20 K. These results strongly
suggest that heavier carrier doped defect-free crystalline diamond could give
rise to high Tc diamond.

size (from the trivial direct product). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first nontrivial construction for SO(3)^n, SE(3)^n and the hypertorus T^n.
  We also construct new low discrepancy samplings of S^2 and SO(3). The central
component in our construction for SO(3) is an explicit construction of N points
in S^2 with discrepancy \tilde{\O}(1/\sqrt{N}) with respect to convex sets,
matching the bound achieved for the special case of spherical caps in
\cite{ABD_12}. We also generalize the discrepancy of Cartesian product sets

be distinguished from disorder by the different dependence of their Raman
intensity on laser excitation energy. Similarly, the type of disorder can
potentially be identified not only by the intensity ratio
$I_{\mathrm{D}}/I_{\mathrm{D}^{\prime}}$, but also by its laser energy
dependence. Also discussed is a quantitative analysis of quantum interference
effects of the graphene wavefunctions, which determine the most important
phonon wavevectors and scattering processes responsible for the D and
D$^{\prime}$ bands.

Kepler-64 and Kepler-413. In addition to their intrinsic interest, the study of
such systems is an opportunity to test our understanding of planetary system
formation and evolution around binaries. The investigation is done by means of
numerical simulations. We perform numerical integrations of the full equations
of motion of each system with the aim of checking the stability of the
planetary orbit. The investigation of the stability of the above systems
consists of three numerical experiments. In the first one we perform a long
term (1Gyr) numerical integration of the nominal solution of the six Kepler
systems under investigation. In the second experiment, we look for the critical
semimajor axis of the six planetary orbits, and finally, in the third
experiment, we construct two dimensional stability maps on the
eccentricity-pericentre distance plane. Additionally, using numerical
integrations of the nominal solutions we checked if this solutions were close
to the exact resonance.

variations. We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction

with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by
massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is
pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework
not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals
valuable facts on learning face representation.
  (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute
prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies.
  (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with
image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong
indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face
localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes
or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works.
  (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet
automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face
identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with
attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear
combination of these concepts.

Within a simple approximation based on symmetries, we obtain the fixed point
solution of the NPRG flow equations that corresponds to fully developed
turbulence both in $d=2$ and $d=3$ dimensions. Deviations to the dimensional
scalings (Kolmogorov in $d=3$ or Kraichnan-Batchelor in $d=2$) are found for

for the emergence of intermittency within the NPRG framework. The purpose of
this work is to provide a detailed basis for NPRG studies of NS turbulence, the
determination of the ensuing intermittency exponents is left for future work.

regional estimation and the use of historical flood data. This paper
investigates the combination of both approaches using a multivariate
peaks-over-threshold model, that allows estimating altogether the intersite
dependence structure and the marginal distributions at each site. The joint
distribution of extremes at several sites is constructed using a
semi-parametric Dirichlet Mixture model. The existence of partially missing and
censored observations (historical data) is accounted for within a data
augmentation scheme. This model is applied to a case study involving four
catchments in Southern France, for which historical data are available since
1604. The comparison of marginal estimates from four versions of the model
(with or without regionalizing the shape parameter; using or ignoring
historical floods) highlights significant differences in terms of return level
estimates. Moreover, the availability of historical data on several nearby
catchments allows investigating the asymptotic dependence properties of extreme
floods. Catchments display a a significant amount of asymptotic dependence,
calling for adapted multivariate statistical models.

tracing starspots. This first strong evidence that standard A-type stars can
show surface structures opens a new field of research and asks the question

in the interval $[1/2,1)$, while for $s<1/2$ the equation is shown to be not

phenomenon of stagnation which is then related to the behavior of the block FOM
method. We generalize the block FOM method to generate well-defined
approximations in the case that block FOM would normally break down, and these
generalized solutions are used in our analysis. This behavior is also related
to the principal angles between the column-space of the previous block GMRES
residual and the current minimum residual constraint space. At iteration $j$,
it is shown that the proper generalization of GMRES stagnation to the block
setting relates to the columnspace of the $j$th block Arnoldi vector. Our
analysis covers both the cases of normal iterations as well as block Arnoldi
breakdown wherein dependent basis vectors are replaced with random ones.
Numerical examples are given to illustrate what we have proven, including a
small application problem to demonstrate the validity of the analysis in a less
pathological case.

potential, which combined with measurements of the scale of inflation demands
some degree of fine-tuning. Alternatively, the flatness of the potential could
be due to the inflaton's origin as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, as in Natural
Inflation. Alas, consistency with Planck data places the original proposal of
Natural Inflation in a tight spot, as it requires a trans-Planckian excursion
of the inflaton. Although one can still tune the renormalizable potential to
sub-Planckian values, higher order corrections from quantum gravity or sources
of breaking of the Goldstone symmetry would ruin the predictivity of the model.
In this paper we show how in more realistic models of Natural Inflation one
could achieve inflation without a trans-Planckian excursion of the field. We
show how a variant of Extra-natural inflation with bulk fermions can achieve
the desired goal and discuss its four-dimensional duals. We also present a new

uniformity being measured using gap ratio. We consider discrete spaces like
graph and set of points in the Euclidean space and continuous spaces like the
unit square and path connected spaces. We deduce lower bounds, prove hardness
and approximation hardness results. We show that a general approximation
algorithm framework gives different approximation ratios for different metric

existence of coresets for sampling uniform points from the Euclidean space --

Its coupling with the dust is the key to our understanding planetary formation.
Studying the gas content is therefore a crucial step towards understanding
protoplanetary discs evolution. Such a study can be made through spectroscopic
observations of emission lines in the far-infrared, where some of the most
important gas coolants emit, such as the [OI] 3P1-3 P2 transition at 63.18
microns. We aim at characterising the gas content of protoplanetary discs in
the intermediate-aged Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star forming region. We also aim
at characterising the gaseous detection fractions within this age range, which
is an essential step tracing gas evolution with age in different star forming
regions. We obtained Herschel-PACS line scan spectroscopic observations at 63
microns of 19 Cha II Class I and II stars. The observations were used to trace
[OI] and o-H2O at 63 microns. The analysis of the spatial distribution of [OI],
when extended, can be used to understand the origin of the emission. We have
detected [OI] emission toward seven out of the nineteen systems observed, and
o-H2O emission at 63.32 microns in just one of them, Sz 61. Cha II members show
a correlation between [OI] line fluxes and the continuum at 70 microns, similar
to what is observed in Taurus. We analyse the extended [OI] emission towards
the star DK Cha and study its dynamical footprints in the PACS Integral Field
Unit (IFU). We conclude that there is a high velocity component from a jet
combined with a low velocity component with an origin that may be a combination
of disc, envelope and wind emission. The stacking of spectra of objects not
detected individually in [OI] leads to a marginal 2.6sigma detection that may
indicate the presence of gas just below our detection limits for some, if not
all, of them.

photoionising feedback also show evidence of driving of turbulence by
preserving or recovering a Kolmogorov-type velocity field. On the contrary,
control run simulations without photoionising feedback have a velocity

energy electron accelerators. It could make free electron lasers available to a
broad scientific community, and push further the limits of electron
accelerators for high energy physics. Furthermore the unique femtosecond nature
of the source makes it a promising tool for the study of ultra-fast phenomena.
However, applications are hindered by the lack of suitable lens to transport
this kind of high-current electron beams, mainly due to their divergence. Here
we show that this issue can be solved by using a laser-plasma lens, in which
the field gradients are five order of magnitude larger than in conventional
optics. We demonstrate a reduction of the divergence by nearly a factor of
three, which should allow for an efficient coupling of the beam with a

terms of the metric $g$ and covariant derivatives of the curvature of $g$. We
study the heat kernel coefficients $a_{2k}(r;g)$ of $\H(r;g)$ on closed

refining these arguments, we also give a heat equation proof of the conformal
transformation law of the renormalized volume coefficients itself. The Taylor

functionals with extremal properties at Einstein metrics which are analogous to
those of integrated renormalized volume coefficients. Among the various

derivation from full QCD can be traced stepwise; we see absorption of
renormalons by non-perturbative matrix elements in OPE clearly; a systematic
short-distance expansion of UV contributions can be performed, which predicts a

coupling between electromagnetic field and polarization field. Our most direct

mass X-ray binaries hosting a supergiant donor. We have analyzed in a
systematic way ten years of INTEGRAL data of Vela X-1 (22-50 keV) and we found
that when outside the X-ray eclipse, the source undergoes several luminosity
drops where the hard X-rays luminosity goes below 3x10^35 erg/s, becoming
undetected by INTEGRAL. These drops in the X-ray flux are usually referred to
as ""off-states"" in the literature. We have investigated the distribution of
these off-states along the Vela X-1 ~8.9 d orbit, finding that their orbital
occurrence displays an asymmetric distribution, with a higher probability to
observe an off-state near the pre-eclipse than during the post-eclipse. This
asymmetry can be explained by scattering of hard X-rays in a region of ionized
wind, able to reduce the source hard X-ray brightness preferentially near
eclipse ingress. We associate this ionized large-scale wind structure with the
photoionization wake produced by the interaction of the supergiant wind with
the X-ray emission from the neutron star. We emphasize that this observational
result could be obtained thanks to the accumulation of a decade of INTEGRAL
data, with observations covering the whole orbit several times, allowing us to
detect an asymmetric pattern in the orbital distribution of off-states in Vela
X-1.

process. Initially droplets, or in general aggregates, grow diffusively by
collecting supersaturation from the bulk phase. Subsequently, when the droplets
have grown to a size, where their Peclet number is of order unity, buoyancy
substantially enhances droplet growth. The dynamics approaches a finite-time
singularity where the droplets are removed from the system by precipitation.
The two growth regimes are separated by a bottleneck of minimal droplet growth.
Here, we present a low-dimensional model addressing the time span required to
cross the bottleneck, and we hence determine the time, \Delta t, from initial
droplet growth to rainfall. Our prediction faithfully captures the dependence
of \Delta t on the ramp rate of the droplet volume fraction, \xi, the droplet
number density, the interfacial tension, the mass diffusion coefficient, the
mass density contrast of the coexisting phases, and the viscosity of the bulk
phase. The agreement of observations and the prediction is demonstrated for
methanol/hexane and isobutoxyethanol/water mixtures where we determined \Delta
t for a vast range of ramp rates, \xi, and temperatures. The very good
quantitative agreement demonstrates that it is sufficient for binary mixtures
to consider (i) droplet growth by diffusive accretion that relaxes
supersaturation, and (ii) growth by collisions of sedimenting droplets. An
analytical solution of the resulting model provides a quantitative description
of the dependence of \Delta t on the ramp rate and the material constants.
Extensions of the model that will admit a quantitative prediction of \Delta t

the interaction of isotropic stellar and relativistic pulsar winds along 1 full

grid resolution and size, and of different EoOs: a gamma-constant ideal gas,
and an ideal gas with gamma dependent on temperature. We carry out, with the
code PLUTO, relativistic HD simulations in 2 and 3 D of the interaction of a
slow wind and a relativistic wind with Gamma=2 along 1 full orbit up to ~100 x
the binary size. The different 2-D simulations are carried out with equal and
larger grid resolution and size, and 1 of them is done with a more realistic
equation of state, than in 3 D. The simulations in 3 D confirm previous results
in 2 D. The shocked flows are subject to a faster instabilities growth in 3 D,
which enhances the presence of shocks, mixing, and large-scale disruption. In 2
D, higher resolution simulations confirm lower resolution results, simulations
with larger grid sizes strengthen the case for the loss of global coherence of
the shocked-wind structure, and simulations with 2 different EoOs yield very
similar results. In addition to the KHI, we find that the Richtmyer-Meshkov and
the RTI are likely acting together in the shocked flow evolution. Simulations
in 3 D confirm that the interaction of stellar and pulsar winds yields
structures that evolve non-linearly and get strongly entangled. The evolution
is accompanied by strong kinetic energy dissipation, rapid changes in flow
orientation and speed, and turbulent motion. The results strengthen the case
for the loss of global coherence of the shocked structure on large scales,
although higher pulsar wind speed simulations are needed.

The precision, and thus the sensitivity of magnetometry, scales as $1/\sqrt

role of a key determinant. Adapting a dynamical decoupling scheme that allows
for extending $T_2$ by orders of magnitude and merging it with a magnetic

sensor, we experimentally attain a sensitivity of $4.6$ pT $/\sqrt{Hz}$ for an
alternating-current magnetic field near 14 MHz. Based on the principle
demonstrated here, this unprecedented sensitivity combined with spatial
resolution in the nanometer range and tunability from direct-current to the

temperature dependence within the doping range $0.65 \leq x \leq 1$. The
dramatic change coincides with Lifshitz transition occurred around the critical

disappears with excess hole doping in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ system. It is
suggested that the characteristic temperature $T$* at around $120 \sim 150$ K

  Stores","34 pages",,,,"cs.PF cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In-memory (transactional) data stores are recognized as a first-class data
management technology for cloud platforms, thanks to their ability to match the
elasticity requirements imposed by the pay-as-you-go cost model. On the other
hand, defining the well-suited amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the
degree of in-memory replication of slices of data, in order to optimize
reliability/availability and performance tradeoffs, is far from being a trivial
task. Yet, it is an essential aspect of the provisioning process of cloud
platforms, given that it has an impact on how well cloud resources are actually
exploited. To cope with the issue of determining optimized configurations of
cloud in-memory data stores, in this article we present a flexible simulation
framework offering skeleton simulation models that can be easily specialized in
order to capture the dynamics of diverse data grid systems, such as those
related to the specific protocol used to provide data consistency and/or
transactional guarantees. Besides its flexibility, another peculiar aspect of
the framework lies in that it integrates simulation and machine-learning
(black-box) techniques, the latter being essentially used to capture the
dynamics of the data-exchange layer (e.g. the message passing layer) across the
cache servers. This is a relevant aspect when considering that the actual
data-transport/networking infrastructure on top of which the data grid is
deployed might be unknown, hence being not feasible to be modeled via white-box
(namely purely simulative) approaches. We also provide an extended experimental
study aimed at validating instances of simulation models supported by our
framework against execution dynamics of real data grid systems deployed on top
of either private or public cloud infrastructures.

training object detectors. Starting from a small set of real images, our
algorithm estimates the rendering parameters required to synthesize similar
images given a coarse 3D model of the target object. These parameters can then
be reused to generate an unlimited number of training images of the object of
interest in arbitrary 3D poses, which can then be used to increase
classification performances.
  A key insight of our approach is that the synthetically generated images
should be similar to real images, not in terms of image quality, but rather in
terms of features used during the detector training. We show in the context of
drone, plane, and car detection that using such synthetically generated images
yields significantly better performances than simply perturbing real images or
even synthesizing images in such way that they look very realistic, as is often
done when only limited amounts of training data are available.

a synapse relies on acetylcholine. Ever since the Nobel-prize winning works of
Dale and Loewi, it has been assumed that acetylcholine - subsequent to its
action on a postsynaptic cell - is split into inactive by-products by
acetylcholinesterase. Herein, this widespread assumption is falsified.
Excitable cells (Chara australis internodes), which had previously been
unresponsive to acetylcholine, became acetylcholine-sensitive in presence of
acetylcholinesterase. The latter was evidenced by a striking difference in cell
membrane depolarisation upon exposure to 10 mM intact acetylcholine
(deltaV=-2plus/minus5 mV) and its hydrolysate respectively
(deltaV=81plus/minus19 mV) for 60 sec. This pronounced depolarization, which
also triggered action potentials, was clearly attributed to one of the
hydrolysis products: acetic acid (deltaV=87plus/minus9 mV at pH 4.0; choline
ineffective in range 1-10 mM). In agreement with our findings, numerous studies
in the literature have reported that acids excite gels, lipid membranes, plant
cells, erythrocytes as well as neurons. Whether excitation of the postsynaptic
cell in a cholinergic synapse is due to protons or due to intact acetylcholine
is a most fundamental question that has not been addressed so far.

the recurrent subspace (and the non-equilibrium steady states) in terms of the
dark states associated to the quantum master operator and its general spectral

neuromorphic hardware constitutes a fast and energy efficient substrate for the
implementation of such neural computing architectures in technical applications
and neuroscientific research. The functional performance of neural networks is
often critically dependent on the level of correlations in the neural activity.
In finite networks, correlations are typically inevitable due to shared
presynaptic input. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory
feedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these
shared-input correlations and thereby enable neurons to fire nearly
independently. For networks of spiking neurons, the decorrelating effect of
inhibitory feedback has so far been explicitly demonstrated only for
homogeneous networks of neurons with linear sub-threshold dynamics. Theory,
however, suggests that the effect is a general phenomenon, present in any
system with sufficient inhibitory feedback, irrespective of the details of the
network structure or the neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigate
the effect of network heterogeneity on correlations in sparse, random networks
of inhibitory neurons with non-linear, conductance-based synapses. Emulations
of these networks on the analog neuromorphic hardware system Spikey allow us to
test the efficiency of decorrelation by inhibitory feedback in the presence of
hardware-specific heterogeneities. The configurability of the hardware

generalized axioms for probability theory, according to which the reverse

tool in the study of the spectral theory of (pseudo)differential operators and
of their Fredholmness. We introduce the new concept of an exhausting family of
representations of a C*-algebra A. An {\em exhausting family} of
representations of a C*-algebra A is a set F of representations of A with the
property that every irreducible representation of A is weakly contained in some
\phi \in F. An exhausting family F of representations of A has the property
that `""a \in A is invertible if, and if, \phi(a) is invertible for any \phi \in
F."" Consequently, the spectrum of a is given by \Spec(a) = \cup_{\phi \in F}
\Spec(\phi(a)). In other words, every exhausting family of representations is
invertibility sufficient, a concept introduced by Roch in 2003. We prove
several properties of exhausting families and we provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for a family of representations to be exhausting. Using
results of Ionescu and Williams (2009), we show that the regular
representations of amenable, second countable, locally compact groupoids with a
Haar system form an exhausting family of representations. If $A$ is a separable
C*-algebra, we show that a family F of representations of $A$ is exhausting if,
and only if, it is invertibility sufficient. However, this result is not true,
in general, for non-separable C*-algebras. With an eye towards applications, we
extend our results to the case of unbounded operators. A typical application of
our results is to parametric families of differential operators arising in the
analysis on manifolds with corners, in which case we recover the fact that a
parametric operator F is invertible if, and only if, its Mellin transform is
invertible. In view of possible applications, we have tried to make this paper
accessible to non-specialists in C*-algebras.

rest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical BECs)
but pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy
density and the rest-mass density. At high densities, we get a stiff equation
of state similar to the one considered by Zel'dovich (1961) in the context of
baryon stars in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. We
determine the maximum mass of general relativistic BEC stars described by this
equation of state by using the formalism of Tooper (1965). This maximum mass is
slightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by Chavanis and Harko (2012)
using a fully-relativistic model. We also consider the possibility that dark
matter is made of BECs and apply the partially-relativistic model of BECs to
cosmology. In this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matter
phase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase
(equivalent to a cosmological constant). The same evolution is obtained in
Zel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmological
singularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. Interestingly, the
Friedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a
simple generalization of the $\Lambda$CDM model. We point out, however, the
limitations of the partially-relativistic model for BECs and show the need for

value. In the limit of vanishing friction the theory satisfies a relativity
principle as bodies do not decelerate and, therefore, the absolute frame
becomes unobservable. However, the limit theory is not Newtonian mechanics,
with its Galilei group symmetry, but rather Special Relativity. This result
suggests to regard Special Relativity as the limit of a theory presenting
universal friction and exchange of mass-energy with a reservoir (vacuum). Thus,
quite surprisingly, Special Relativity follows from the absolute space (ether)
concept and could have been discovered following studies of Aristotelian
mechanics and friction. We end the work confronting the full theory with
observations. It predicts the Hubble law through tired light, and hence it is
incompatible with supernova light curves unless both mechanisms of tired light
(locally) and universe expansion (non-locally) are at work. It also nicely
accounts for some challenging numerical coincidences involving phenomena under
low acceleration.

finite distributive lattice $\mathcal{P}$ can be constructed from $\mathcal{P}$
by removing a particular family $\mathcal{I}_L$ of its irreducible intervals.
  Applying this in the case that $\mathcal{P}$ is a product of a finite set
$\mathcal{C}$ of chains, we get a one-to-one correspondence $L \mapsto
\mathcal{D}_\mathcal{P}(L)$ between the sublattices of $\mathcal{P}$ and the
preorders spanned by a canonical sublattice $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ of
$\mathcal{P}$.
  We then show that $L$ is a tight sublattice of the product of chains
$\mathcal{P}$ if and only if $\mathcal{D}_\mathcal{P}(L)$ is asymmetric. This
yields a one-to-one correspondence between the tight sublattices of
$\mathcal{P}$ and the posets spanned by its poset $J(\mathcal{P})$ of non-zero
join-irreducible elements.
  With this we recover and extend, among other classical results, the
correspondence derived from results of Birkhoff and Dilworth, between the tight
embeddings of a finite distributive lattice $L$ into products of chains, and
the chain decompositions of its poset $J(L)$ of non-zero join-irreducible
elements.

crossing symmetry condition is used to modify unitary multichannel $S$
($\pi\pi$, $K \bar K$, and $\eta\eta$) and $P$ ($\pi\pi$, $\rho 2\pi$, and
$\rho\sigma$) wave amplitudes mostly below 1 GeV. Before the modifications,
these amplitudes significantly did not satisfy the crossing symmetry condition
and did not describe the $\pi\pi$ threshold region. Moreover, the pole of the
$S$ wave amplitude related with the $f_0(500)$ meson (former $f_0(600)$ or
$\sigma$) had much smaller imaginary part and bigger real one in comparison
with those in the newest Particle Data Group Tables. Here, these amplitudes are
supplemented by near threshold expansion polynomials and refitted to the
experimental data in the effective two pion mass from the threshold to 1.8 GeV
and to the dispersion relations up to 1.1 GeV. In result the self consistent,
i.e. unitary and fulfilling the crossing symmetry condition, $S$ and $P$ wave
amplitudes are formed and the $\sigma$ pole becomes much narrower and lighter.
To eliminate doubts about the uniqueness of the so obtained sigma pole position
short and purely mathematical proof of the uniqueness of the results is also
presented. This analysis is addressed to a wide group of physicists and aims at
providing a very effective and easy method of modification of, many presently
used, $\pi\pi$ amplitudes with a heavy and broad $\sigma$ meson without
changing of their original mathematical structure.

structured finite subsequences $C^h(s)$ for $s\equiv9\ (mod\ 12)$ or $C^t(s)$
for $s\equiv3,7\ (mod\ 12)$. For starting numbers of specific residue classes
($mod\ 12\cdot2^h$) or ($mod\ 12\cdot2^{t+1}$) the finite subsequences have the
same length $h,t$. It is conjectured that for each $h,t\geq2$ the number of all
admissible residue classes is given exactly by the Fibonacci sequence. This has
been proved for $2\leq h,t\leq50$.
  Collatz's conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that for each
$s\in\mathbb{N},s>1$, there exists $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $T^k(s)<s$. The
least $k\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $T^k(s)<s$ is called the stopping time of $s$,
which we will denote by $\sigma(s)$. It is shown that Collatz's conjecture is
true, if every starting number $s\equiv3,7\ (mod\ 12)$ have finite stopping
time.
  We denote $\tau(s)$ as the number of $C^t(s)$ until $\sigma(s)$ is reached
for a starting number $s\equiv3,7\ (mod\ 12)$. Starting numbers of specific
residue classes ($mod\ 3\cdot2^{\sigma(s)}$) have the same stopping times
$\sigma(s)$ and $\tau(s)$. By using $\tau(s)$ it is shown that almost all
$s\equiv3,7\ (mod\ 12)$ have finite stopping time and statistically two out of
three $s\equiv3,7\ (mod\ 12)$ have $\tau(s)=1$. Further it is shown what
consequences it entails, if a $C(s)$ grows to infinity.

D 92, 103004 (2015)","10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004",,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a simple analytical solution of the Friedmann equations for a
universe made of stiff matter, dust matter, and dark energy. A stiff matter era
is present in the cosmological model of Zel'dovich (1972) where the primordial
universe is assumed to be made of a cold gas of baryons. It also occurs in
certain cosmological models where dark matter is made of relativistic
self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). When the energy density of
the stiff matter is positive, the primordial universe is singular. It starts
from a state with a vanishing scale factor and an infinite density. We consider
the possibility that the energy density of the stiff matter is negative
(anti-stiff matter). This happens, for example, when the BECs have an
attractive self-interaction. In that case, the primordial universe is
non-singular. It starts from a state in which the scale factor is finite and
the energy density is equal to zero. For the sake of generality, we consider a
cosmological constant of arbitrary sign. When the cosmological constant is
positive, the universe asymptotically reaches a de Sitter phase where the scale
factor increases exponentially rapidly. This can account for the accelerating
expansion of the universe that we observe at present. When the cosmological
constant is negative (anti-de Sitter), the evolution of the universe is cyclic.
Therefore, depending on the sign of the energy density of the stiff matter and
of the dark energy, we obtain singular and non-singular expanding or cyclic
universes.
