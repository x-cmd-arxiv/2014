polarized electrons on heavy He-like ions, being initially in the ground state.
The enhancement of the parity violation is achieved by tuning the energy of the
incident electron in resonance with quasidegenerate doubly-excited states of
the corresponding Li-like ion. We consider two possible scenarios. In the first
one we assume that the polarization of the scattered electron is measured,
while in the second one it is not detected.

combination with liquid Argon. The latter emits scintillation photons with a
wavelength of 127 nm that need to be downshifted to be detected by
photomultipliers with glass or quartz windows. TetraPhenyl Butadiene has been
demonstrated to have an extremely high conversion efficiency, possibly higher
than 100 % for 127 nm photons, while there is no precise information about the
time dependence of its emission. It is usually assumed to be exponentially
decaying with a characteristic time of the order of one ns, as an extrapolation
from measurements with exciting radiation in the near UV. This work shows that
TetraPhenyl Butadiene, when excited by 127 nm photons, reemits photons not only
with a very short decay time, but also with slower ones due to triplet states
de-excitations. This fact can strongly contribute to clarify the anomalies in
liquid Argon scintillation light reported in literature since seventies, namely
the inconsistency in the measured values of the long decay time constant and
the appearance of an intermediate component. Similar effects should be also
expected when the TPB is used in combination with Helium and Neon, that emit
scintillation photons with wavelengths shorter than 127 nm.

discontinuous percolation transitions. Much of the past work considers graph
evolution algorithms known as Achlioptas processes in which a single edge is
added to the graph from a set of $k$ randomly chosen candidate edges at each
timestep until a giant component emerges. Several Achlioptas processes seem to
yield a discontinuous percolation transition, but it was proven by Riordan and
Warnke that the transition must be continuous in the thermodynamic limit.
However, they also proved that if the number $k(n)$ of candidate edges
increases with the number of nodes, then the percolation transition may be
discontinuous. Here we attempt to find the simplest such process which yields a
discontinuous transition in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce a process
which considers only the degree of candidate edges and not component size. We
calculate the critical point $t_{c}=(1-\theta(\frac{1}{k}))n$ and rigorously
show that the critical window is of size $O(\frac{n}{k(n)})$. If $k(n)$ grows
very slowly, for example $k(n)=\log n$, the critical window is barely sublinear
and hence the phase transition is discontinuous but appears continuous in
finite systems. We also present arguments that Achlioptas processes with
bounded size rules will always have continuous percolation transitions even
with infinite choice.

normal stretching is presented. The theory is based on a seven-unknowns
kinematic field with five warping functions. Four warping functions are related
to the transverse shear behaviour, the fifth is related to the normal
stretching. The warping functions are issued from exact three-dimensional
solutions. They are related to the variations of transverse shear and normal
stresses computed at specific points for a simply supported bending problem.
Reddy, Cho-Parmerter and (a modified version of) Beakou-Touratier theories have
been retained for comparisons. Extended versions of these theories, able to
manage the normal stretching, are also considered. All these theories can be
emulated by the kinematic field of the present model thanks to the adaptation
of the five warping functions. Results of all these theories are confronted and
compared to analytical solutions, for the bending of simply supported plates.
Various plates are considered, with special focus on very low
length-to-thickness ratios: an isotropic plate, two homogeneous orthotropic
plates with ply orientation of $0$ and $5$ degrees, a $[0/c/0]$ sandwich panel
and a $[-45/0/45/90]_s$ composite plate. Results show that models are more
accurate if their kinematic fields (i) depend on all material properties (not
only the transverse shear stiffnesses) (ii) depend on the length-to-thickness
ratio (iii) present a coupling between the $x$ and $y$ directions.

our approach seems to capture the physical principles governing the forming of

characteristic spatio-temporal dynamics in systems of actively propelled
particles. In this context, the Boltzmann equation plays a pivotal role, since
it provides a natural translation between a particle-level description of the
system's dynamics and the corresponding hydrodynamic fields. Yet, the intricate
mathematical structure of the Boltzmann equation substantially limits the
progress toward a full understanding of this equation by solely analytical
means. Here, we propose a general framework to numerically solve the Boltzmann
equation for self-propelled particle systems in two spatial dimensions and with
arbitrary boundary conditions. We discuss potential applications of this
numerical framework to active matter systems, and use the algorithm to give a
detailed analysis to a model system of self-propelled particles with polar
interactions. In accordance with previous studies, we find that spatially
homogeneous isotropic and broken symmetry states populate two distinct regions
in parameter space, which are separated by a narrow region of spatially
inhomogeneous, density-segregated moving patterns. We find clear evidence that
these three regions in parameter space are connected by first order phase
transitions, and that the transition between the spatially homogeneous
isotropic and polar ordered phases bears striking similarities to liquid-gas
phase transitions in equilibrium systems. Within the density segregated
parameter regime, we find a novel stable limit-cycle solution of the Boltzmann
equation, which consists of parallel lanes of polar clusters moving in opposite
directions, so as to render the overall symmetry of the system's ordered state
nematic, despite purely polar interactions on the level of single particles.

initial LIGO, Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the
interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to
increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced
LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region
around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than
initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is
moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been
replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much
better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the
gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved
mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid- and high- frequencies.
Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in

Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) based on Herschel far-infrared (FIR), H I 21
cm, CO, and Halpha observations. In the diffuse atomic ISM, we derive the
gas-to-dust ratio as the slope of the dust-gas relation and find gas-to-dust
ratios of 380+250-130 in the LMC, and 1200+1600-420 in the SMC, not including
helium. The atomic-to-molecular transition is located at dust surface densities
of 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, corresponding to AV ~
0.4 and 0.2, respectively. We investigate the range of CO-to-H2 conversion
factor to best account for all the molecular gas in the beam of the
observations, and find upper limits on XCO to be 6x1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the
LMC (Z=0.5Zo) at 15 pc resolution, and 4x 1021 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the SMC

in the dense ISM is lower than in the diffuse ISM by a factor ~2, even after
accounting for the effects of CO-dark H2 in the translucent envelopes of
molecular clouds. Coagulation of dust grains and the subsequent dust emissivity
increase in molecular clouds, and/or accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust
grains, and the subsequent dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) increase in
molecular clouds could explain the observations. In the SMC, variations in the
dust-gas slope caused by coagulation or accretion are degenerate with the
effects of CO-dark H2. Within the expected 5--20 times Galactic XCO range, the
dust-gas slope can be either constant or decrease by a factor of several across
ISM phases. Further modeling and observations are required to break the
degeneracy between dust grain coagulation, accretion, and CO-dark H2.

the fixation probability of mutants in a large group of graph structures (known
as isothermal graphs, which include regular graphs) coincides with that for the
mixed population. This result has been proven by Lieberman et al (Nature 433:
312-316, 2005) in the case of BD processes, where mutants differ from the wild
types by their birth rate (and not by their death rate). In this paper we
discuss to what extent the isothermal theorem can be formulated for DB
processes, proving that it only holds for mutants that differ from the wild
type by their death rate (and not by their birth rate). For more general BD and
DB processes with arbitrary birth and death rates of mutants, we show that the
fixation probabilities of mutants are different from those obtained in the
mass-action populations. We focus on spatial lattices and show that the
difference between BD and DB processes on 1D and 2D lattices are non-small even

approach that can be generalized to arbitrary graph structures. Finally, we
discuss several biological applications of the results.

no well-defined transition between an earlier phase where all metal sunk into
the core and a later phase in which the core was a closed entity separated from
the mantle. In addition, the modellers of Earth accretion have introduced the
concept of ""Late Accretion"", which refers to the material accreted by our
planet after the Moon-forming event. Characterising Late Veneer, Late Accretion
and the relationship between the two is the major goal of this chapter.

  models in ecology and epidemiology",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highly non-linear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in
fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases
often display highly non-linear dynamics. However, such models are problematic
from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of
chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in
system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are
two main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information
reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic
Likelihood and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo,
Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to
compare the methods, in order to reach conclusions about how to approach
inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods
is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can
suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model
mis-specification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process
noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem but, under the correct
model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to
substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More
practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different
methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should
probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning
requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to
a state space method, checking results against the information reduction
approach.

an effective extinction cross-section with a power law of index consistent with

collisional and exhibit a number of non-equilibrium features, including
relative drifts between particle species. Two non-collisional mechanisms have
been proposed for limiting differential flow between alpha particles and
protons: plasma instabilities and the rotational force. Both mechanisms
decelerate the alpha particles. In this paper, we derive an analytic expression
for the rate $Q_{\mathrm{flow}}$ at which energy is released by alpha-particle
deceleration, accounting for azimuthal flow and conservation of total momentum.
We show that instabilities control the deceleration of alpha particles at $r<
r_{\mathrm{crit}}$, and the rotational force controls the deceleration of alpha
particles at $r> r_{\mathrm{crit}}$, where $r_{\mathrm{crit}} \simeq 2.5
\,\mathrm{AU}$ in the fast solar wind in the ecliptic plane. We find that
$Q_{\mathrm{flow}}$ is positive at $r<r_{\mathrm{crit}}$ and $Q_{\mathrm{flow}}
= 0$ at $r\geq r_{\mathrm{crit}}$, consistent with the previous finding that
the rotational force does not lead to a release of energy. We compare the value
of~$Q_{\mathrm{flow}}$ at $r< r_{\mathrm{crit}}$ with empirical heating rates
for protons and alpha particles, denoted $Q_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $Q_{\alpha}$,
deduced from in-situ measurements of fast-wind streams from the \emph{Helios}

$Q_{\alpha}$ at $r < 1\,\mathrm{AU}$, and that $Q_{\mathrm{flow}}/Q_{\rm p}$
decreases with increasing distance from the Sun from a value of about one at
$r=0.29 - 0.42\,\mathrm{AU}$ to about 1/4 at 1 AU. We conclude that the
continuous energy input from alpha-particle deceleration at $r<

and we seek a collection of routes for these vehicles that visit all nodes so
as to minimize the total latency incurred, which is the sum of the client
waiting times. We obtain an $8.497$-approximation for the version where
vehicles may be located at multiple depots and a $7.183$-approximation for the
version where all vehicles are located at the same depot, both of which are the
first improvements on this problem in a decade. Perhaps more significantly, our
algorithms exploit various LP-relaxations for minimum-latency problems. We show
how to effectively leverage two classes of LPs---{\em configuration LPs} and
{\em bidirected LP-relaxations}---that are often believed to be quite powerful
but have only sporadically been effectively leveraged for network-design and
vehicle-routing problems. This gives the first concrete evidence of the
effectiveness of LP-relaxations for this class of problems. The
$8.497$-approximation the multiple-depot version is obtained by rounding a
near-optimal solution to an underlying configuration LP for the problem. The
$7.183$-approximation can be obtained both via rounding a bidirected LP for the
single-depot problem or via more combinatorial means. The latter approach uses
a bidirected LP to obtain the following key result that is of independent
interest: for any $k$, we can efficiently compute a rooted tree that is at
least as good, with respect to the prize-collecting objective (i.e., edge cost
+ number of uncovered nodes) as the best collection of $k$ rooted paths. Our
algorithms are versatile and extend easily to handle various extensions

sources and destroyed by interstellar shocks. Because of their extensive
wavelength coverage, proximity, and nearly face-on geometry, the Magellanic
Clouds (MCs) provide a unique opportunity to study these processes in great
detail. In this paper we use the complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs)
in the MCs to calculate the lifetime and destruction efficiencies of silicate
and carbon dust in these galaxies. We find dust lifetimes of 22 +- 13 Myr (30
+- 17 Myr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the LMC, and 54 +- 32 Myr (72 +- 43
Myr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the SMC. The significantly shorter
lifetimes in the MCs, as compared to the Milky Way, are explained as the
combined effect of their lower total dust mass, and the fact that the
dust-destroying isolated SNe in the MCs seem to be preferentially occurring in
regions with higher than average dust-to-gas (D2G) mass ratios. We also
calculate the supernova rate and the current star formation rate in the MCs,
and use them to derive maximum dust injection rates by asymptotic giant branch
stars and core collapse supernovae. We find that the injection rates are an
order of magnitude lower than the dust destruction rates by the SNRs. This
supports the conclusion that, unless the dust destruction rates have been
considerably overestimated, most of the dust must be reconstituted from
surviving grains in dense molecular clouds. More generally, we also discuss the
dependence of the dust destruction rate on the local D2G mass ratio, the
ambient gas density and metallicity, as well as the application of our results

  We complement our findings by showing that for the closely related Connected

unlikely, even though the problem is known to admit a linear kernel on

processes such as intracellular transport, mitotic spindle formation, and
cytokinesis, with important implications for neurodegenerative and cancer
disease pathways. Recently, kinesin has been studied as a paradigm for the
tailored design of nano-bio sensor and other nanoscale systems. As it processes
along a microtubule within the cell, kinesin undergoes a cycle of chemical
state and physical conformation transitions that enable it to take ~100 regular
8.2-nm steps before ending its processive walk. Despite an extensive body of
experimental and theoretical work, a unified microscopic model of kinesin
mechanochemistry does not yet exist. Here we present a methodology that
optimizes a kinetic model for kinesin constructed with a minimum of a priori
assumptions about the underlying processive mechanism. Kinetic models are
preferred for numerical calculations since information about the kinesin
stepping mechanism at all levels, from the atomic to the microscopic scale, is
fully contained within the particular states of the cycle: how states
transition, and the rate constants associated with each transition. We combine
Markov chain calculations and simulated annealing optimization to determine the
rate constants that best fit experimental data on kinesin speed and
processivity.

been studied intensively in recent times. For fooling halfspaces over the
hypercube with polynomially small error, the best construction known requires
seed-length O(log^2 n) (MekaZ13). Getting the seed-length down to O(log(n)) is
a natural challenge in its own right, which needs to be overcome in order to
derandomize RL. In this work we make progress towards this goal by obtaining
near-optimal generators for two important special cases:
  1) We give a near optimal derandomization of the Chernoff bound for
independent, uniformly random bits. Specifically, we show how to generate a x
in {1,-1}^n using $\tilde{O}(\log (n/\epsilon))$ random bits such that for any
unit vector u, <u,x> matches the sub-Gaussian tail behaviour predicted by the
Chernoff bound up to error eps.
  2) We construct a generator which fools halfspaces with {0,1,-1} coefficients
with error eps with a seed-length of $\tilde{O}(\log(n/\epsilon))$. This
includes the important special case of majorities.
  In both cases, the best previous results required seed-length of $O(\log n +
\log^2(1/\epsilon))$.
  Technically, our work combines new Fourier-analytic tools with the iterative
dimension reduction techniques and the gradually increasing independence
paradigm of previous works (KaneMN11, CelisRSW13, GopalanMRTV12).

radiation from the central engine and re-emit in mid-infrared (MIR).
Observations have detected moderate anisotropy in the dust MIR emission, in the
way that type 1 AGNs (type1s) are mildly brighter in MIR comparing with type 2
sources (type2s). However, type1s and type2s were found to follow statistically
the same tight MIR -- hard X-ray correlation, suggesting the MIR emission is
highly isotropic assuming the hard X-ray radiation is inclination independent.
We argue this discrepancy could be solved considering the hard X-ray emission
in AGN is also mildly anisotropic as we recently discovered. To verify this
diagram, we compare the sub-arcsecond 12\mu m flux densities of type1s and
type2s using [OIV]$\lambda$25.89\mu m emission line as an isotropic luminosity
indicator. We find that on average type1s are brighter in nuclei 12\mu m
radiation by a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.6$ than type2s at given
[OIV]$\lambda$25.89\mu m luminosities, confirming the mild anisotropy of the
nuclei 12\mu m emission. We show that the anisotropy of the 12\mu m emission we
detected is in good agreement with radiative transfer models of clumpy torus.
The fact that type 1 and type 2 AGNs follow the same tight MIR -- hard X-ray
correlation instead supports that both the MIR and hard X-ray emission in AGNs
are mildly anisotropic.

singularities in coordinate space, and identify neighborhoods associated
unambiguously with individual subspaces (pinch surfaces) where the integrals
are singular. The set of such regions is finite for any diagram. Within each of
these regions, coordinate-space soft-collinear and hard-collinear
approximations reproduce singular behavior. Based on this classification of
regions and approximations, we develop a series of nested subtraction
approximations by analogy to the formalism in momentum space. This enables us
to rewrite each amplitude as a sum of terms to which gauge theory Ward
identities can be applied, factorizing them into hard, jet and soft factors,
and to confirm the multiplicative renormalizability of products of lightlike
Wilson lines. We study in some detail the simplest case, the color-singlet cusp
linking two Wilson lines, and show that the logarithm of this amplitude, which
is a sum of diagrams known as webs, is closely related to the corresponding
subtracted amplitude order by order in perturbation theory. This enables us to
confirm that the logarithm of the cusp can be written as the integral of an
ultraviolet-finite function over a surface. We study to what extent this result
generalizes to amplitudes involving multiple Wilson lines.

their higher dark matter content. After correcting for the dark matter, as well
as for the contribution of gas and the effects of radial gradients in the disk,
the LSB end falls back on the linear mu-Sigma-relation. The resulting scatter
about the corrected mu-Sigma-relation is 25% at the HSB end, and about 50% at
the LSB end. The intrinsic scatter in the mu-Sigma-relation is estimated to be
10% to 20%. Thus, if the surface brightness is known, the stellar surface mass
density is known to within 10-20% (random error). Assuming disks have an
exponential vertical distribution of mass, the average (M_L)_K is 0.24
Msun/Lsun, with an intrinsic scatter around the mean of at most 0.05 Msun/Lsun.
This value for (M/L)_K is 20% smaller than we found in Martinsson et al.,

means that among the galaxies in our sample variations in scale height,

$GF(2)$ can correct random erasures and random errors with high probability,
and in particular when can they achieve capacity for these two classical
channels. Necessarily, the paper also studies properties of evaluations of
multi-variate $GF(2)$ polynomials on random sets of inputs.
  For erasures, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity both for very high rate
and very low rate regimes. For errors, we prove that RM codes achieve capacity
for very low rate regimes, and for very high rates, we show that they can
uniquely decode at about square root of the number of errors at capacity.
  The proofs of these four results are based on different techniques, which we
find interesting in their own right. In particular, we study the following
questions about $E(m,r)$, the matrix whose rows are truth tables of all
monomials of degree $\leq r$ in $m$ variables. What is the most (resp. least)
number of random columns in $E(m,r)$ that define a submatrix having full column
rank (resp. full row rank) with high probability? We obtain tight bounds for
very small (resp. very large) degrees $r$, which we use to show that RM codes
achieve capacity for erasures in these regimes.
  Our decoding from random errors follows from the following novel reduction.
For every linear code $C$ of sufficiently high rate we construct a new code
$C'$, also of very high rate, such that for every subset $S$ of coordinates, if
$C$ can recover from erasures in $S$, then $C'$ can recover from errors in $S$.
Specializing this to RM codes and using our results for erasures imply our
result on unique decoding of RM codes at high rate.
  Finally, two of our capacity achieving results require tight bounds on the
weight distribution of RM codes. We obtain such bounds extending the recent
\cite{KLP} bounds from constant degree to linear degree polynomials.

required to balance a conductive input to the O V-emitting region with
radiative losses. The analysis shows that for heating by collisional electrons,
it is difficult, or impossible to raise the temperature of the chromosphere to
explain the observed densities without assuming a completely ionised

most synthesis approaches do not support common design tasks, like modifying a
single process without having to re-synthesize or verify the whole system.
Assume-guarantee synthesis (AGS) provides robustness against modifications of
system parts, but thus far has been limited to the perfect information setting.
This means that local variables cannot be hidden from other processes, which
renders synthesis results cumbersome or even impossible to realize. We resolve
this shortcoming by defining AGS in a partial information setting. We analyze
the complexity and decidability in different settings, showing that the problem

Based on these observations, we present a pragmatic algorithm based on bounded

inside a cracking body. In this model a more complete set of physical
properties including elastic and softening behavior are assigned to each point

peridynamic formulation. Here strains are calculated as difference quotients.
The constitutive relation is given by a nonlocal cohesive law relating force to
strain. At each instant of the evolution we identify a process zone where
strains lie above a threshold value. Perturbation analysis shows that jump
discontinuities within the process zone can become unstable and grow. We derive
an explicit inequality that shows that the size of the process zone is
controlled by the ratio given by the length scale of nonlocal interaction
divided by the characteristic dimension of the sample. The process zone is
shown to concentrate on a set of zero volume in the limit where the length
scale of nonlocal interaction vanishes with respect to the size of the domain.
In this limit the dynamic evolution is seen to have bounded linear elastic
energy and Griffith surface energy. The limit dynamics corresponds to the
simultaneous evolution of linear elastic displacement and the fracture set
across which the displacement is discontinuous. We conclude illustrating how
the approach developed here can be applied to limits of dynamics associated

recently uncovered systematic variation of IMF with M$_*$, and 2) for M$_* <

scatter in T$_{\rm N}$ is significantly larger (approaching 2 orders of
magnitude), and there is evidence to support a previous, independent suggestion
of two families of galaxies. The behavior of N$_{\rm CL}$ in the lower mass
systems is more difficult to measure because these systems are inherently
cluster poor, but our results may add to previous evidence that large
variations in cluster formation and destruction efficiencies are to be found
among low mass galaxies. The average fraction of stellar mass in clusters is
$\sim$ 0.0014 for M$_* > 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and can be as large as $\sim 0.02$

prove a sufficient and necessary condition for the noisy reading channel being
less noisy than the test channel in data encoding in the polar WOM coding. Such

consequence of the sufficient and necessary condition, the high entropy set
related to the noisy channel is usually strictly contained in the high entropy

We consider terms of up to third order in the Gaussian perturbation. For the
weakest constraints on the abundance of PBHs in the early universe
(corresponding to a fractional energy density of PBHs of $10^{-5}$ at the time
of formation), in the case of gaussian perturbations, constraints on the power
spectrum are $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}<0.05$ but can significantly tighter when even
a small amount of non-gaussianity is considered, to $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}<0.01$,
and become approximately $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}<0.003$ in more special cases.
Surprisingly, even when there is negative skew (which naively would suggest
fewer areas of high density, leading to weaker constraints), we find that the
constraints on the power spectrum become tighter than the purely gaussian case
- in strong contrast with previous results. We find that the constraints are
highly sensitive to both the non-gaussianity parameters as well as the

and Cry2, participate in a negative feedback loop driving circadian
rhythmicity. Previous work has shown that single, dissociated SCN neurons
respond differently to Cry1 and Cry2 knockouts: Cry1 knockouts are arrhythmic
while Cry2 knockouts display more regular rhythms. These differences have led
to speculation that CRY1 and CRY2 may play different functional roles in the

stochastic model focused on the Period (Per) and Cry feedback loop, and
incorporating intercellular coupling via vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).
Due to the stochastic nature of molecular oscillations, we demonstrate that
single-cell Cry1 knockout oscillations display partially rhythmic behavior, and
cannot be classified as simply rhythmic or arrhythmic. Our model demonstrates
that intrinsic molecular noise and differences in relative abundance, rather

of memory, in which collections of symmetrically-coupled McCulloch-Pitts
neurons interact to perform emergent computation. Although previous researchers
have explored the potential of this network to solve combinatorial optimization
problems and store memories as attractors of its deterministic dynamics, a
basic open problem is to design a family of Hopfield networks with a number of
noise-tolerant memories that grows exponentially with neural population size.
Here, we discover such networks by minimizing probability flow, a recently
proposed objective for estimating parameters in discrete maximum entropy
models. By descending the gradient of the convex probability flow, our networks
adapt synaptic weights to achieve robust exponential storage, even when
presented with vanishingly small numbers of training patterns. In addition to
providing a new set of error-correcting codes that achieve Shannon's channel
capacity bound, these networks also efficiently solve a variant of the hidden
clique problem in computer science, opening new avenues for real-world
applications of computational models originating from biology.

The continuum has a spectral index of 2.7$\pm$0.3, slightly steeper than
blackbody emission from large dust particles. From the imaging data, we
identify two components in the molecular emission. One component is
characterized by a relatively broad line width (~1 km s$^{-1}$ FWHM) exhibiting
a symmetric outgassing pattern with respect to the nucleus position. The second
component has a narrower line width (<0.5 km s$^{-1}$ FWHM) with the line
center red-shifted by 0.1-0.2 km s$^{-1}$ (cometocentric frame), and shows a
velocity shift across the nucleus position with the position angle gradually
changing from 66 to 30 degrees within the four days of observations. We
determine distinctly different CO/HCN ratios for each of the components. For
the broad-line component we find CO/HCN <7, while in the narrow-line component,
CO/HCN = 40$\pm$5. We hypothesize that the narrow-line component originates
from the ice grain halo found in near-nucleus photometry, believed to be
created by sublimating recently released ice grains around the nucleus during
the outburst. In this interpretation, the high CO/HCN ratio of this component
reflects the more pristine volatile composition of nucleus material released in
the outburst.

galaxy and the surrounding medium is a key process that can have a strong
impact on the interstellar medium of the galaxy and hence on galaxy evolution.
The closest laboratory where we can observe and investigate this phenomenon is
the radio galaxy Centaurus A. About 15 kpc north-east of this galaxy, a
particularly complex region is found: the so-called Outer Filament where
jet-cloud interactions have been proposed to occur. We investigate the presence
of signatures of jet-ISM interaction by a detailed study of the kinematics of
the ionized gas, expanding on previous results obtained from the HI. We
observed two regions of the outer filament with VLT/VIMOS in the IFU observing
mode. Emission from Hbeta and [OIII]4959,5007\AA\ is detected in both
pointings. We found two distinct kinematical components of ionized gas that
well match the kinematics of the nearby HI cloud. One component follows the
regular kinematics of the rotating gas while the second shows similar
velocities to those of the nearby HI component thought to be disturbed by an
interaction with the radio jet. We suggest that the ionized and atomic gas are
part of the same dynamical gas structure originating as result of the merger
that shaped Centaurus A and which is regularly rotating around Centaurus A as
proposed by other authors. The gas (ionized and HI) with anomalous velocities
is tracing the interaction of the Large-Scale radio Jet with the ISM,
suggesting that, although poorly collimated as structure, the jet is still
active. However, we can exclude that a strong shock is driving the ionization
of the gas. It is likely that a combination of jet entrainment and
photoionization by the UV continuum from the central engine is needed in order
to explain both the ionization and the kinematics of the gas in the Outer
Filament.

Molecular Zone (CMZ) the star-formation rate calculated from the number of YSOs

estimated from methods based on diffuse emission (such as free-free emission).
Whether this effect is real or whether it indicates problems with either or
both star formation rate measures is not currently known. In this paper, we
investigate whether estimates based on YSOs could be heavily contaminated by
more evolved objects such as main-sequence stars. We present radiative transfer
models of YSOs and of main-sequence stars in a constant ambient medium which
show that the main-sequence objects can indeed mimic YSOs at 24 microns.
However, we show that in some cases the main-sequence models can be marginally
resolved at 24 microns, whereas the YSO models are always unresolved. Based on
the fraction of resolved MIPS 24 microns sources in the sample of YSOs
previously used to compute the star formation rate, we estimate the fraction of
misclassified ""YSOs"" to be at least 63%, which suggests that the star-formation
rate previously determined from YSOs is likely to be at least a factor of three

gives a good fit to the data. (3) The inverse Compton emission from

higher latitudes, $|b|>2^\circ$, both in its spectrum and morphology. We also
present novel constraints on a large number of mixed annihilation channels,

constraints that the causal structure of certain experiments impose on any
classical explanation. It is thus natural to ask to which degree the causal
assumptions -- e.g. locality or measurement independence -- have to be relaxed
in order to allow for a classical description of such experiments. Here, we
develop a conceptual and computational framework for treating this problem. We
employ the language of Bayesian networks to systematically construct
alternative causal structures and bound the degree of relaxation using
quantitative measures that originate from the mathematical theory of causality.
The main technical insight is that the resulting problems can often be
expressed as computationally tractable linear programs. We demonstrate the

two-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barred
galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). The
bar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass and
bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio of their host galaxies. Bars in massive and
bulge-dominated galaxies (B/T$>$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in less
massive, disk-dominated galaxies (B/T$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-like
profile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominated
galaxies. The global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, are
rectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. We speculate
that because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential
(disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxy
bar orbits. This leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. The
narrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that these
bars formed earlier (z$>$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spread
in the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradual
evolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred from
observational studies. Therefore, we expect that the flatness of the bar
profile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the time
elapsed since the bar formation. We argue that cosmic gas accretion is required
to explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the bar
region.

background with the gravitational lensing signal of cosmic shear. This
represents a novel and promising strategy to search for annihilating or
decaying particle dark matter (DM) candidates. In the present work, we
demonstrate the potential of a tomographic-spectral approach: measuring the
cross-correlation in separate bins of redshift and energy significantly
improves the sensitivity to a DM signal. Indeed, the technique proposed here
takes advantage of the different scaling of the astrophysical and DM components
with redshift and, simultaneously, of their different energy spectra and
different angular extensions. The sensitivity to a particle DM signal is
extremely promising even when the DM-induced emission is quite faint. We first
quantify the prospects of detecting DM by cross-correlating the Fermi Large
Area Telescope (LAT) diffuse gamma-ray background with the cosmic shear
expected from the Dark Energy Survey. Under the hypothesis of a significant
subhalo boost, such a measurement can deliver a 5-sigma detection of DM, if the
DM particle is lighter than 300 GeV and has a thermal annihilation rate. We
then forecast the capability of the European Space Agency Euclid satellite
(whose launch is planned for 2020), in combination with an hypothetical future
gamma-ray detector with slightly improved specifications compared to current
telescopes. We predict that the cross-correlation of their data will allow a
measurement of the DM mass with an uncertainty of a factor of 1.5-2, even for
moderate subhalo boosts, for DM masses up to few hundreds of GeV and thermal
annihilation rates.

including lower susceptibility to radiation damage, lower power consumption,
and faster read-out time to avoid pile-up. They are deeply depleted and able to
detect x-rays down to approximately 0.1 keV. The Speedster-EXD has additional
in-pixel features compared to previously published HCDs including: (1) an
in-pixel comparator that enables read out of only the pixels with signal from
an x-ray event, (2) four different gain modes to optimize either full well
capacity or energy resolution, (3) in-pixel CDS subtraction to reduce read
noise, and (4) a low-noise, high-gain CTIA amplifier to eliminate interpixel
capacitance crosstalk. When using the comparator feature, the user can set a
comparator threshold and only pixels above the threshold will be read out. This
feature can be run in two modes including single pixel readout in which only
pixels above the threshold are read out and 3x3 readout where a 3x3 region
centered on the central pixel of the x-ray event is read out. The comparator

illustrating the applicability of this recipe, we also show that when
restricted to the space of full-correlation functions, non-signaling resources
are as powerful as unconstrained signaling resources. Explicit examples of

The between-curve correlation is modeled by correlating functional principal
component scores of the functional data. We propose a Spatial Principal
Analysis by Conditional Expectation framework to explicitly estimate spatial
correlations and reconstruct individual curves. This approach works even when
the observed data per curve are sparse. Assuming spatial stationarity,
empirical spatial correlations are calculated as the ratio of eigenvalues of
the smoothed covariance surface $Cov(X_i(s),X_i(t))$ and cross-covariance
surface $Cov(X_i(s), X_j(t))$ at locations indexed by $i$ and $j$. Then a
anisotropy Mat\'ern spatial correlation model is fit to empirical correlations.
Finally, principal component scores are estimated to reconstruct the sparsely
observed curves. This framework can naturally accommodate arbitrary covariance
structures, but there is an enormous reduction in computation if one can assume
the separability of temporal and spatial components. We propose hypothesis
tests to examine the separability as well as the isotropy effect of spatial
correlation. Simulation studies and applications of empirical data show
improvements in the curve reconstruction using our framework over the method
where curves are assumed to be independent. In addition, we show that the
asymptotic properties of estimates in uncorrelated case still hold in our case
if 'mild' spatial correlation is assumed.

emission from a central radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). To test
this scenario, we have monitored the NGC1097 nucleus in X-ray and UV continuum
with Swift and the H$\alpha$ flux and profile in the optical spectrum using
SOAR and Gemini-South from 2012 August to 2013 February. During the monitoring
campaign, the H$\alpha$ flux remained at a very low level --- 3 times lower
than the maximum flux observed in previous campaigns and showing only limited
($\sim 20\%$) variability. The X-ray variations were small, only $\sim 13\%$
throughout the campaign, while the UV did not show significant variations. We
concluded that the timescale of the H$\alpha$ profile variation is close to the
sampling interval of the optical observations, which results in only marginal
correlation between the X-ray and H$\alpha$ fluxes. We have caught the AGN in
NGC1097 in a very low activity state, in which the ionizing source was very
weak and capable of ionizing just the innermost part of the gas in the disk.
Nonetheless, the data presented here still support the picture in which the gas
that emits the broad double-peaked Balmer lines is illuminated/ionized by a
source of high-energy photons which is located interior to the inner radius of
the line-emitting part of the disk.

flocking, i.e. the alignment of velocities in a group of autonomous agents
having mutual interactions. In the present paper, we consider the mean-field
limit of that model, called the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, which is a
transport partial differential equation involving nonlocal terms. It is known
that flocking is reached asymptotically whenever the initial conditions of the
group of agents are in a favorable configuration. For other initial
configurations, it is natural to investigate whether flocking can be enforced
by means of an appropriate external force, applied to an adequate time-varying
subdomain.
  In this paper we prove that we can drive to flocking any group of agents
governed by the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, by means of a sparse centralized
control strategy, and this, for any initial configuration of the crowd. Here,
""sparse control"" means that the action at each time is limited over an
arbitrary proportion of the crowd, or, as a variant, of the space of
configurations; ""centralized"" means that the strategy is computed by an
external agent knowing the configuration of all agents. We stress that we do
not only design a control function (in a sampled feedback form), but also a
time-varying control domain on which the action is applied. The sparsity
constraint reflects the fact that one cannot act on the whole crowd at every
instant of time.
  Our approach is based on geometric considerations on the velocity field of
the kinetic Cucker-Smale PDE, and in particular on the analysis of the particle
flow generated by this vector field. The control domain and the control
functions are designed to satisfy appropriate constraints, and such that, for
any initial configuration, the velocity part of the support of the measure
solution asymptotically shrinks to a singleton, which means flocking.

turns out that, as in the usual case of explicit extremes, all limit implicit
extreme value laws are implicit max-stable. We characterize the regularly

variables often needs to obey certain hierarchical constraints. The weak or
strong structural hierarchy requires that the existence of an interaction term
implies at least one or both associated main effects to be present in the
model. Lately, this problem has attracted a lot of attention, but existing
computational algorithms converge slow even with a moderate number of
predictors. Moreover, in contrast to the rich literature on ordinary variable
selection, there is a lack of statistical theory to show reasonably low error
rates of hierarchical variable selection.
  This work investigates a new class of estimators that make use of multiple
group penalties to capture structural parsimony. We give the minimax lower
bounds for strong and weak hierarchical variable selection and show that the
proposed estimators enjoy sharp rate oracle inequalities. A general-purpose
algorithm is developed with guaranteed convergence and global optimality.
Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy
of the proposed approach.

are no $x_1,x_2,x_3 \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ satisfying $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$ and
$f(x_1)=f(x_2)=f(x_3)=1$. In testing triangle-freeness, the goal is to
distinguish with high probability triangle-free functions from those that are
$\varepsilon$-far from being triangle-free. It was shown by Green that the
query complexity of the canonical tester for the problem is upper bounded by a
function that depends only on $\varepsilon$ (GAFA, 2005), however the best
known upper bound is a tower type function of $1/\varepsilon$. The best known
lower bound on the query complexity of the canonical tester is
$1/\varepsilon^{13.239}$ (Fu and Kleinberg, RANDOM, 2014).
  In this work we introduce a new approach to proving lower bounds on the query
complexity of triangle-freeness. We relate the problem to combinatorial
questions on collections of vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_D^n$ and to sunflower
conjectures studied by Alon, Shpilka, and Umans (Comput. Complex., 2013). The
relations yield that a refutation of the Weak Sunflower Conjecture over
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ implies a super-polynomial lower bound on the query complexity
of the canonical tester for triangle-freeness. Our results are extended to
testing $k$-cycle-freeness of functions with domain $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for every
$k \geq 3$ and a prime $p$. In addition, we generalize the lower bound of Fu
and Kleinberg to $k$-cycle-freeness for $k \geq 4$ by generalizing the
construction of uniquely solvable puzzles due to Coppersmith and Winograd (J.
Symbolic Comput., 1990).

data-driven closure models by using a multivariate time series of partial
observations from a large-dimensional system; and (ii) comparing these closure
models with the optimal closures predicted by the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism
of statistical physics. Multilayer stochastic models (MSMs) are introduced as
both a generalization and a time-continuous limit of existing multilevel,
regression-based approaches to closure in a data-driven setting; these
approaches include empirical model reduction (EMR), as well as more recent
multi-layer modeling. It is shown that the multilayer structure of MSMs can
provide a natural Markov approximation to the generalized Langevin equation
(GLE) of the MZ formalism.
  A simple correlation-based stopping criterion for an EMR-MSM model is derived
to assess how well it approximates the GLE solution. Sufficient conditions are
derived on the structure of the nonlinear cross-interactions between the
constitutive layers of a given MSM to guarantee the existence of a global
random attractor. This existence ensures that no blow-up can occur for a very
broad class of MSM applications, a class that includes non-polynomial
predictors and nonlinearities that do not necessarily preserve quadratic energy
invariants.
  The approach is applied to conceptual nonlinear models borrowed from climate
dynamics and population dynamics. In both cases, it is shown that the resulting
closure models are able to capture the main statistical features of the
dynamics, even in presence of weak time-scale separation.

Several hypothesized features of this cortical algorithm are reviewed,
including sparse distributed representation, Bayesian inference, hierarchical
organization composed of alternating template matching and pooling layers,
temporal slowness and predictive coding. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is
a family of learning algorithms and corresponding theories of cortical function
that embodies these principles. HTM has previously been applied mainly to
perceptual tasks typical of posterior cortex. In order to evaluate HTM as a
candidate model of cortical function, it is necessary also to investigate its
compatibility with the requirements of frontal cortical function. To this end,
a variety of models of frontal cortical function are reviewed and integrated,
to arrive at the hypothesis that frontal functions including attention, working
memory and action selection depend largely upon the same basic algorithms as do
posterior functions, with the notable additions of a mechanism for the active
maintenance of representations and of multiple cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical
loops that allow communication between regions of frontal cortex to be gated in
an adaptive manner. Computational models of this system are reviewed. Finally,
there is a discussion of how HTM can contribute to the understanding of frontal
cortical function, and of what the requirements of frontal cortical function
mean for the future development of HTM.

accelerators driven with optical or infrared sources have demonstrated
accelerating gradients orders of magnitude above that achievable with
conventional RF structures. However, laser-driven wakefield accelerators
require intense femtosecond sources and direct laser-driven accelerators and
suffer from low bunch charge, sub-micron tolerances and sub-femtosecond timing
requirements due to the short wavelength of operation. Here, we demonstrate the
first linear acceleration of electrons with keV energy gain using
optically-generated terahertz (THz) pulses. THz-driven accelerating structures
enable high-gradient electron or proton accelerators with simple accelerating
structures, high repetition rates and significant charge per bunch. Increasing
the operational frequency of accelerators into the THz band allows for greatly
increased accelerating gradients due to reduced complications with respect to
breakdown and pulsed heating. Electric fields in the GV/m range have been
achieved in the THz frequency band using all optical methods. With recent
advances in the generation of THz pulses via optical rectification of slightly

multi-cycle pulses, increasing accelerating gradients by two orders of
magnitude over conventional linear accelerators (LINACs) has become a

rotating black hole deformed by generic tidal forces created by a remote
distribution of matter. The metric of the deformed black hole is obtained by
integrating the Einstein field equations in a vacuum region of spacetime
bounded by r < r_max, with r_max a maximum radius taken to be much smaller than
the distance to the remote matter. The tidal forces are assumed to be weak and
to vary slowly in time, and the metric is expressed in terms of generic tidal
quadrupole moments E_{ab} and B_{ab} that characterize the tidal environment.
The metric incorporates couplings between the black hole's spin vector and the
tidal moments, and captures all effects associated with the dragging of
inertial frames. In the second part of the article I determine the tidal
moments by immersing the black hole in a larger post-Newtonian system that
includes an external distribution of matter; while the black hole's internal
gravity is allowed to be strong, the mutual gravity between the black hole and
the external matter is assumed to be weak. The post-Newtonian metric that
describes the entire system is valid when r > r_min, where r_min is a minimum
distance that must be much larger than the black hole's radius. The black-hole
and post-Newtonian metrics provide alternative descriptions of the same
gravitational field in an overlap r_min < r < r_max, and matching the metrics
determine the tidal moments, which are expressed as post-Newtonian expansions
carried out through one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order. Explicit expressions
are obtained in the specific case in which the black hole is a member of a
post-Newtonian two-body system.

measurements of many environmental processes, and we apply the method to
precipitation data in south-west Western Australia. A generalised hyperbolic
Bayesian hierarchical model is constructed for the intensity, frequency and
duration of daily precipitation, including the extremes. Unlike models based on
extreme value theory, which only model maxima of finite-sized blocks or
exceedances above a large threshold, the proposed model uses all the data
available efficiently, and hence not only fits the extremes but also models the
entire rainfall distribution. It captures spatial and temporal clustering, as
well as spatially and temporally varying volatility and skewness. The model
assumes that the regional precipitation is driven by a latent process
characterised by geographical and climatological covariates. Effects not fully
described by the covariates are captured by spatial and temporal structure in
the hierarchies. Inference is provided by MCMC using a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm and spatial interpolation method, which provide a natural approach
for estimating uncertainty. Similarly both spatial and temporal predictions
with uncertainty can be produced with the model.

motivates an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM),
which involves a singlet Higgs superfield with a sizable Yukawa coupling to the
doublet Higgs superfields. We examine such singlet-extended SUSY models with a
Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry that originates from an anomalous $U(1)_A$ gauge
symmetry. We focus on the specific scheme that the PQ symmetry is spontaneously
broken at an intermediate scale $v_{\rm PQ}\sim \sqrt{m_{\rm SUSY}M_{\rm Pl}}$
by an interplay between Planck scale suppressed operators and tachyonic soft
scalar mass $m_{\rm SUSY}\sim \sqrt{D_A}$ induced dominantly by the $U(1)_A$
$D$-term, $D_A$. This scheme also results in spontaneous SUSY breaking in the
PQ sector, generating the gaugino masses $M_{1/2}\sim \sqrt{D_A}$ when it is
transmitted to the MSSM sector by the conventional gauge mediation mechanism.
As a result, the MSSM soft parameters in this scheme are induced mostly by the
$U(1)_A$ $D$-term and the gauge mediated SUSY breaking from the PQ sector, so
that the sparticle masses can be near the present experimental bounds without
causing the SUSY flavor problem. The scheme is severely constrained by the
condition that a phenomenologically viable form of the low energy operators of
the singlet and doublet Higgs superfields is generated by the PQ breaking
sector in a way similar to the Kim-Nilles solution of the $\mu$ problem, and
the resulting Higgs mass parameters allow the electroweak symmetry breaking
with small $\tan\beta$. We find two minimal models with two singlet Higgs
superfields, satisfying this condition with a relatively simple form of the PQ
breaking sector, and briefly discuss some phenomenological aspects of the
model.

emphasized planets within 0.05 AU of their stars. Despite this focus, known
EGPs populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot Jupiter
values (0.03-0.05 AU) out to 1 AU and beyond. Unlike typical hot Jupiters,
these more distant EGPs will not in general be synchronously rotating. In
anticipation of observations of this population, we here present
three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics that
emerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxes
appropriate for warm and hot Jupiters. We find that the circulation resides in
one of two basic regimes. On typical hot Jupiters, the strong day-night heating
contrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet and
large day-night temperature differences. At faster rotation rates and lower
incident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes less
important, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading to
eastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude,
and, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. Our most rapidly rotating and
least irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in each
hemisphere--similar to the jets on Jupiter and Saturn--and illuminate the
dynamical continuum between highly irradiated EGPs and the weakly irradiated
giant planets of our own Solar System. We present infrared (IR) light curves
and spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the IR
phase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly on
incident flux and rotation rate. This provides a way to identify the regime
transition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, IR light

the controller and the forwarding element in a software defined network (SDN).
A model based on M/M/1 queues is proposed in [1] to capture the communication
between the forwarding element and the controller. Albeit the model provides
useful insight, it is accurate only for the case when the probability of
expecting a new flow is small. Secondly, it is not straight forward to extend
the model in [1] to more than one forwarding element in the data plane. In this
work we propose a model which addresses both these challenges. The model is
based on Jackson assumption but with corrections tailored to the OpenFlow based

due to the rapid increasing of multimedia data on the Internet. A new approach
to the problem has been raised which intends to match features of different
modalities directly. In this research, there are two critical issues: how to
get rid of the heterogeneity between different modalities and how to match the
cross-modal features of different dimensions. Recently metric learning methods
show a good capability in learning a distance metric to explore the
relationship between data points. However, the traditional metric learning
algorithms only focus on single-modal features, which suffer difficulties in
addressing the cross-modal features of different dimensions. In this paper, we
propose a cross-modal similarity learning algorithm for the cross-modal feature
matching. The proposed method takes a bilinear formulation, and with the
nuclear-norm penalization, it achieves low-rank representation. Accordingly,
the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is successfully imported to find
the optimal solution with a fast convergence rate O(1/t^2). Experiments on
three well known image-text cross-media retrieval databases show that the
proposed method achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art

low mass X-ray binary burster located 10' away from the Galactic center. NuSTAR
detected the source serendipitously as it was emerging from quiescence: its
luminosity was $6\times 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ on 2013 July 31, and $5\times
10^{35}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ in a second observation on 2013 August 3. A bright, 800-s
long, H-triggered mixed H/He thermonuclear Type I burst with mild photospheric
radius expansion (PRE) was present during the second observation. Assuming that
the luminosity during the PRE was at the Eddington level, a H mass fraction
$X=0.7$ in the atmosphere, and a neutron star mass $M=1.4 M_{\odot}$, we
determine a new lower limit on the distance for this source of $6.3 \pm 0.5$
kpc. Combining with previous upper limits, this places GRS 1741.9-2853 at a
distance of 7 kpc. Energy independent (achromatic) variability is observed
during the cooling of the neutron star, which could result from the disturbance
of the inner accretion disk by the burst. The large dynamic range of this burst
reveals a long power-law decay tail. We also detect, at a 95.6\% confidence
level (1.7 $\sigma$), a narrow absorption line at $5.46\pm0.10$ keV during the
PRE phase of the burst, reminiscent of the detection by Waki et al. (1984). We
propose that the line, if real, is formed in the wind above the photosphere of
the neutron star by a resonant K$\alpha$ transition from H-like Cr

appears as scaling limit in a Wright-Fisher model with geometric seed-bank age

total population size $N$. This extends earlier results of Kaj, Krone and
Lascoux [J. Appl. Probab. 38 (2011) 285-300] who show that the genealogy of a

suitably time-changed Kingman coalescent. The qualitatively new feature of the
seed-bank coalescent is that ancestral lineages are independently blocked at a
certain rate from taking part in coalescence events, thus strongly altering the
predictions of classical coalescent models. In particular, the seed-bank
coalescent ""does not come down from infinity,"" and the time to the most recent
common ancestor of a sample of size $n$ grows like $\log\log n$. This is in
line with the empirical observation that seed-banks drastically increase
genetic variability in a population and indicates how they may serve as a
buffer against other evolutionary forces such as genetic drift and selection.

Spheres. First, we confirm that porous dust aggregates are forced by strong
radiation pressure even if they grow to be larger aggregates in contrast to
homogeneous and spherical compact grains to which efficiency of radiation
pressure becomes lower when their sizes increase. In addition, we find that the
outward mass flux of porous dust aggregates with monomer size of 0.1 $\mu$m is
larger than that of compact grains by an order of magnitude at the disk radius
of 1 AU, when their sizes are several microns. This implies that large compact
grains like calcium-aluminum rich inclusions (CAIs) are hardly transported to

transported to comet formation region. Crystalline silicates are possibly

whether to invest this in elements that respond in a correlated manner to

elements that respond in a not necessarily correlated manner. This general
dilemma is investigated here using a high dimensional discrete dynamical system

(ML) estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter over time-varying
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels. Both the data-aided (DA) and the
non-data-aided (NDA) schemes are investigated. Unlike classical techniques
where the channel is assumed to be slowly time-varying and, therefore,
considered as constant over the entire observation period, we address the more
challenging problem of instantaneous (i.e., short-term or local) SNR estimation
over fast time-varying channels. The channel variations are tracked locally
using a polynomial-in-time expansion. First, we derive in closed-form
expressions the DA ML estimator and its bias. The latter is subsequently
subtracted in order to obtain a new unbiased DA estimator whose variance and
the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are also derived in closed
form. Due to the extreme nonlinearity of the log-likelihood function (LLF) in
the NDA case, we resort to the expectation-maximization (EM) technique to
iteratively obtain the exact NDA ML SNR estimates within very few iterations.
Most remarkably, the new EM-based NDA estimator is applicable to any
linearly-modulated signal and provides sufficiently accurate soft estimates
(i.e., soft detection) for each of the unknown transmitted symbols. Therefore,
hard detection can be easily embedded in the iteration loop in order to improve
its performance at low to moderate SNR levels. We show by extensive computer
simulations that the new estimators are able to accurately estimate the
instantaneous per-antenna SNRs as they coincide with the DA CRLB over a wide
range of practical SNRs.

that the electron-phonon interaction enhances the intensity of THG if the
on-site Coulomb interaction is comparable to the band width, but the
enhancement is small for a realistic parameter value of a typical Mott

the optical response if the electron-phonon coupling is neglected. We find that
the THG spectrum can detect the spin excitations even for no electron-phonon
coupling. The introduction of the electron-phonon coupling leads to a slight
increase of low-energy weight in THG without peak structure through
phonon-assisted spin excitation. To fully understand the phonon-assisted spin

numbers of nodes or edges because of a lack of computational resources, often
without explicit mention of the limitations this entails. While reliable
methods have long existed to adjust parameters such that the first-order
statistics of network dynamics are conserved, here we show that limitations
already arise if also second-order statistics are to be maintained. The
temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations in the activity of
recurrent networks is determined by the effective population-level
connectivity. We first show that in general the converse is also true and
explicitly mention degenerate cases when this one-to-one relationship does not
hold. The one-to-one correspondence between effective connectivity and the
temporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations implies that network
scalings should preserve the effective connectivity if pairwise averaged
correlations are to be held constant. Changes in effective connectivity can
even push a network from a linearly stable to an unstable, oscillatory regime
and vice versa. On this basis, we derive conditions for the preservation of
both mean population-averaged activities and pairwise averaged correlations
under a change in numbers of neurons or synapses in the asynchronous regime
typical of cortical networks. We find that mean activities and correlation
structure can be maintained by an appropriate scaling of the synaptic weights,
but only over a range of numbers of synapses that is limited by the variance of
external inputs to the network. Our results therefore show that the
reducibility of asynchronous networks is fundamentally limited.

interacting memory cells (memprocessors for short) to store and process
information on the same physical platform. It was recently proved
mathematically that memcomputing machines have the same computational power of
non-deterministic Turing machines. Therefore, they can solve NP-complete
problems in polynomial time and, using the appropriate architecture, with
resources that only grow polynomially with the input size. The reason for this
computational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by
any universal memcomputing machine, in particular intrinsic parallelism and
information overhead, namely the capability of compressing information in the
collective state of the memprocessor network. Here, we show an experimental
demonstration of an actual memcomputing architecture that solves the
NP-complete version of the subset-sum problem in only one step and is composed
of a number of memprocessors that scales linearly with the size of the problem.
We have fabricated this architecture using standard microelectronic technology
so that it can be easily realized in any laboratory setting. Even though the
particular machine presented here is eventually limited by noise--and will thus
require error-correcting codes to scale to an arbitrary number of
memprocessors--it represents the first proof-of-concept of a machine capable of
working with the collective state of interacting memory cells, unlike the
present-day single-state machines built using the von Neumann architecture.

spectral changes on the day-to-week time scales associated with variation in
the line of sight of the cold absorber. Aims: We intend to model the
polarization fluctuations arising from an obscuration event, thereby offering a
method of determining whether flux variations are due to occultation or extreme
intrinsic emission variability. Methods: Undertaking 1 - 100 keV polarimetric
simulations with the Monte Carlo code STOKES, we simulated the journey of a
variety of cold gas clouds in front of an extended primary source. We varied
the hydrogen column density nH and size of the absorber, as well as the initial
polarization state of the emitting source, to cover a wide range of scenarios.
Results: For unpolarized primary fluxes, large (about 50deg) variations of the
polarization position angle psi are expected before and after an occultation
event, which is associated with very low residual polarization degrees (P lower
than 1 per cent). In the case of an emitting disk with intrinsic,
position-independent polarization, and for a given range of parameters, X-ray
eclipses significantly alter the observed polarization spectra, with most of
the variations seen in psi. Finally, non-uniformly polarized emitting regions
produce very distinctive polarization variations due to the successive covering
and uncovering of different portions of the disk. Plotted against time,
variations in P and psi form detectable P~Cygni type profiles that are
distinctive signatures of non-axisymmetric emission. Conclusions: Polarization
measurements are thus particularly adapted to distinguish between intrinsic
intensity fluctuations and external eclipsing events, constrain the geometry of
the covering medium, and test the hypothesis of non-uniformly emitting disks
predicted by general relativity.

powers, we observe internal quality-factors as high as 700,000. Temperature and
power dependence of the internal quality-factors suggest the presence of the
two level systems from the dielectric substrate dominating the internal loss at
low temperatures. We further test the compatibility of these resonators with
high temperature processes such as for carbon nanotube CVD growth, and their
performance in the magnetic field, an important characterization for hybrid
systems.

the instantaneous stepsize value is estimated in the M step of the EM algorithm

  Field with Random Spin-Orbit Scattering","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anderson localization problem for non-interacting two-dimensional electron
gas subject to strong magnetic field, disordered potential and spin-orbit
coupling is studied numerically on a square lattice. The nature of the
corresponding localization-delocalization transition and the properties of the
pertinent extended states depend on the nature of the spin-orbit coupling
(uniform or fully random). For uniform spin-orbit coupling (such as Rashba
coupling), there is a band of extended states in the center of a Landau band as
in a ""standard"" Anderson metal-insulator transition. However, for fully random
spin-orbit coupling, the familiar pattern of Landau bands disappears. Instead,
there is a central band of critical states with definite fractal structure
separated at two critical energies from two side bands of localized states.
Moreover, finite size scaling analysis suggests that for this novel transition,
on the localized side of a critical energy $E_c$, the localization length
diverges as $\xi(E) \propto\exp(\alpha/\sqrt{|E-E_c|})$, a behavior which,
along with the band of critical states, is reminiscent of a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

which are hard to access experimentally but can generally be well predicted by
first-principles methods. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily so for polar

and that these correlations indicate the presence of fractality, the property
of fractality and its origin have not been analyzed. We use both DFA and MFDFA
to analyze the time series in online viewing activity separating from Movielens
and Netflix. We find long-term correlations at both the individual and communal
level, and that the extent of correlation at the individual level is determined
by the activity level. These long-term correlations also indicate that there is
fractality in the pattern of online viewing. And, we firstly find a
multifractality that results from the combined effect of the fat-tailed
distribution of inter-event times (i.e., the times between successive viewing
actions of individual) and the long-term correlations in online viewing
activity and verify this finding using three synthesized series. Therefore, it
can be concluded that the multifractality in online viewing activity is caused
by both the fat-tailed distribution of inter-event times and the long-term
correlations, and that this enlarges the generic property of human activity to
include not just physical space, but also cyberspace.

and analyze the performance of data networks at flow level. Recently, several
authors have shown that the invariant distribution of such networks admits a
product form distribution under critical loading. Assuming exponential job size
distributions, they leave the case of general job size distributions as an open
question. In this paper we show the conjecture holds for a dense class of
distributions. This yields a key example of a stochastic network in which the
heavy traffic limit has an invariant distribution that does not depend on

published work. In it, we develop a statistical mechanical model to describe a
closed loop plectoneme, applicable for when the closed loop is sufficiently
supercoiled. The model divides the system up into end loops and a braided
section; the end loops are assumed to contribute little to the super-coil
writhe. Within the braided section, the model incorporates interactions that
depend on the structure of the molecule; in particular, we consider those that
depend on helical structure. A method for approximating the steric interactions
is utilized that we had previously used in other publications. We go on to
construct variational approximations for our closed loop plectoneme model in
two cases. The first case is where helix dependent interactions are strong, and
in the second case they are considered weak. In developing these
approximations, we approximate the Fuller-White condition by replacing, in all
expressions that depend on twist, writhe with average writhe, valid when the
braided section is sufficiently long. How this approximation is made and the
conditions when this approximation is valid are also discussed. The
approximation allows for a Legendre transformation of the free energy, which
with the introduction of moment (or torque), effectively allowing for twist and
average writhe to be treated independently in the transformed (Gibbs like) free
energy. Next, we then show how one may compute the average writhe of the
braided section. Lastly, we discuss how some of the approximations considered
may be relaxed, and discuss how the resulting model free energy might be
computed by MC simulation.

  in a heterogeneous population: A case study of HRTs",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we present a method for the statistical analysis of continually
monitored data arising in a recurrent diseases problem. The model enables
individual level inference in the presence of time transience and population
heterogeneity. This is achieved by applying Bayesian hierarchical modelling,
where marked point processes are used as descriptions of the individual data,
with latent variables providing a means of modelling long range dependence and
transience over time. In addition to providing a sound probabilistic
formulation of a rather complex data set, the proposed method is also
successful in prediction of future outcomes. Computational difficulties arising
from the analytic intractability of this Bayesian model were solved by
implementing the method into the BUGS software and using standard computational
facilities.
  We illustrate this approach by an analysis of a data set on hormone
replacement therapies (HRTs). The data contain, in the form of diaries on
bleeding patterns maintained by individual patients, detailed information on
how they responded to different HRTs. The proposed model is able to capture the
essential features of these treatments as well as provide realistic individual
level predictions on the future bleeding patterns.

characterize the net- work interference from FD-mode cells, and derive the HDHN
throughput by accounting for AP spatial density, self-interference cancellation
(IC) capability, and transmission power of APs and users. By quantifying the
HDHN throughput, we present the effect of network parameters and the self-IC
capability on the HDHN throughput, and show the superiority of FD mode for
larger AP densities (i.e., larger network interference and shorter
communication distance) or higher self-IC capability. Furthermore, our results
show operating all APs in FD or HD achieves higher throughput compared to the
mixture of two mode APs in each tier network, and introducing hybrid-duplex for
different tier networks improves the heterogenous network throughput.

  Paradigm",,,,,"q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The two main approaches in credit risk are the structural approach pioneered
in Merton (1974) and the reduced-form framework proposed in Jarrow & Turnbull
(1995) and in Artzner & Delbaen (1995). The goal of this article is to provide
a unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduced-form
approaches under weak assumptions. In particular we do not assume the global
existence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable
times with positive probability, such as coupon payment dates.
  In this generalized framework we study dynamic term structures prone to
default risk following the forward-rate approach proposed in
Heath-Jarrow-Morton (1992). It turns out, that previously considered models
lead to arbitrage possibilities when default may happen at a predictable time
with positive probability. A suitable generalization of the forward-rate
approach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable
times and necessary and sufficient conditions for a suitable no-arbitrage
condition (NAFL) are given. In the view of efficient implementations we develop
a new class of affine models which do not satisfy the standard assumption of
stochastic continuity.
  The chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of
filtrations, to which we provide a small example by means of filtering theory
where the Azema supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps, both at
predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times.

exhibits discontinuity as a function of their frequency: the most frequent
verbs tend to be totally irregular. We aim to qualitatively understand the
origin of this feature by studying simple agent--based models of language
dynamics, where each agent adopts an inflectional state for a verb and may
change it upon interaction with other agents. At the same time, agents are
replaced at some rate by new agents adopting the regular form. In models with
only two inflectional states (regular and irregular), we observe that either
all verbs regularize irrespective of their frequency, or a continuous
transition occurs between a low frequency state where the lemma becomes fully
regular, and a high frequency one where both forms coexist. Introducing a third
(mixed) state, wherein agents may use either form, we find that a third,
qualitatively different behavior may emerge, namely, a discontinuous transition
in frequency. We introduce and solve analytically a very general class of
three--state models that allows us to fully understand these behaviors in a
unified framework. Realistic sets of interaction rules, including the
well-known Naming Game (NG) model, result in a discontinuous transition, in
agreement with recent empirical findings. We also point out that the
distinction between speaker and hearer in the interaction has no effect on the
collective behavior. The results for the general three--state model, although
discussed in terms of language dynamics, are widely applicable.

and the anisotropic magnetoresistance, both of which can be used to create
spin-transfer torques in a similar manner as the spin Hall effect. In this
paper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly
magnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the
anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin
currents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In
systems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane
electric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the
other, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in
non-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic
magnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and
hence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting
layer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of
the orientation of the magnetization in the other layer. The control of the
torques afforded by changing the orientation of the magnetization in a fixed
layer makes it possible to reliably switch a perpendicularly magnetized free
layer. Our calculated critical current densities for a representative
CoFe/Cu/FePt structure show that the switching can be efficient for appropriate
material choices. Similarly, control of the magnetization direction can drive
domain wall motion, as shown for NiFe/Cu/NiFe structures.

orbits in a star cluster rotating around its parent galaxy in a circular orbit.
The gravitational field of the cluster is represented by a smooth, spherically
symmetric Plummer potential, while the tidal approximation was used to model
the steady tidal field of the galaxy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis
distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped
and escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy
levels. It is of particular interest to locate the escape basins towards the
two exit channels and relate them with the corresponding escape times of the
orbits. For this purpose, we split our investigation into three cases depending
on the initial value of the $z$ coordinate which was used for launching the
stars. The most noticeable finding is that the majority of stars initiated very
close to the primary $(x,y)$ plane move in chaotic orbits and they remain
trapped for vast time intervals, while orbits with relatively high values of
$z_0$ on the other hand, form well-defined basins of escape. It was also
observed, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape
rates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the
orbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity. We hope
our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the dissolution
process and the escape mechanism in open star clusters.

for a given Re is a non-monotonic function of rotation number, Ro. For
low-to-moderate turbulent Reynolds numbers we find a maximum that is associated
with flow fields that are dominated by downstream vortices and calculations of
2-d vortices capture the maximum also quantitatively. For higher shear Reynolds
numbers a second stronger maximum emerges at smaller rotation numbers, closer
to non-rotating plane Couette flow. It is carried by flows with a markedly 3-d

increases, this maximum becomes stronger and eventually overtakes the one
associated with the 2-d flow state.

by space charge effects that produce beam instabilities. To increase maximally
the beam power of a `proton driver', it is proposed to build a facility
consisting solely of a 2.5-GeV injector linac (PI) and a 20-GeV pulsed
superconducting linac (SCL). Such a facility could be constructed using the
existing KEK accelerator infrastructure. The PI, based on the European
Spallation Source (ESS) linac, would serve both as an injector to the SCL and a
source of proton beams that could be used to copiously produce, e.g., neutrons
and muons. Protons accelerated by the SCL would be transferred through the KEK
Tristan ring in order to create neutrino, kaon and muon beams for fixed-target
experiments. At a later stage, a 70-GeV proton synchrotron could be installed
inside the Tristan ring. The SCL, comprising 1.3-GHz ILC-type rf cavities,
could also accelerate polarized or unpolarized electron beams. After
acceleration, electrons could be used to produce polarized positrons, or may
traverse an XFEL undulator.

at zero temperature, charge neutral and in beta-equilibrium, considering that
the baryon octet interacts by the exchange of scalar-isoscalar

properties, we constrain the parameters of the model that describe the
intensity of the indirectly density dependent baryon-meson couplings to a small
range of possible values. We then investigate asymmetric hyperonic matter

maintain homeostasis and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for
the brain growth. Shaping the structure of the evolving brain will be
progressively achieved by controlling spatial organization of various types of

substitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know
from neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is
electrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at
the molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and
synaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates
and is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual
process of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to

rather simple object representations such as 2D or 3D bounding boxes. While
such coarse models are robust and allow for reliable object detection, they
discard much of the information about objects' 3D shape and pose, and thus do
not lend themselves well to higher-level reasoning. Here, we propose to base
scene understanding on a high-resolution object representation. An object class
- in our case cars - is modeled as a deformable 3D wireframe, which enables
fine-grained modeling at the level of individual vertices and faces. We augment
that model to explicitly include vertex-level occlusion, and embed all
instances in a common coordinate frame, in order to infer and exploit
object-object interactions. Specifically, from a single view we jointly
estimate the shapes and poses of multiple objects in a common 3D frame. A
ground plane in that frame is estimated by consensus among different objects,
which significantly stabilizes monocular 3D pose estimation. The fine-grained
model, in conjunction with the explicit 3D scene model, further allows one to
infer part-level occlusions between the modeled objects, as well as occlusions
by other, unmodeled scene elements. To demonstrate the benefits of such
detailed object class models in the context of scene understanding we
systematically evaluate our approach on the challenging KITTI street scene
dataset. The experiments show that the model's ability to utilize image
evidence at the level of individual parts improves monocular 3D pose estimation
w.r.t. both location and (continuous) viewpoint.

blocks inside ROI and recovering original ROI with less size authentication and
recovery data and with simple mathematical calculations. In the proposed
method, the medical image is divided into three regions called ROI, RONI
(Region of Non Interest) and border pixels. Later, authentication data of ROI
and Electronic Patient Record (EPR) are compressed using Run Length Encoding
(RLE) technique and then embedded into ROI. Recovery information of ROI is
embedded inside RONI and information of ROI is embedded inside border pixels.
Results of experiments conducted on several medical images reveal that proposed
method produces high quality watermarked medical images, identifies tampered
areas inside ROI of watermarked medical images and recovers the original ROI.

Phillips","Similarity Is Not Enough: Tipping Points of Ebola Zaire Mortalities","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1410.1417",,"10.1016/j.physa.2015.02.056",,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In early 2014 an outbreak of a slightly mutated Zaire Ebola subtype appeared
in West Africa which is less virulent than 1976 and 1994 strains. The numbers
of cases per year appear to be ~ 1000 times larger than the earlier strains,
suggesting a greatly enhanced transmissibility. Although the fraction of the
2014 spike glycoprotein mutations is very small (~3%), the mortality is
significantly reduced, while the transmission appears to have increased
strongly. Bioinformatic scaling had previously shown similar inversely
correlated trends in virulence and transmission in N1 (H1N1) and N2 (H3N2)
influenza spike glycoprotein mutations. These trends appear to be related to
various external factors (migration, availability of pure water, and
vaccination programs). The molecular mechanisms for Ebola's mutational response
involve mainly changes in the disordered mucin-like domain (MLD) of its spike
glycoprotein amino acids. The MLD has been observed to form the tip of an
oligomeric amphiphilic wedge that selectively pries apart cell-cell interfaces
via an oxidative mechanism.
