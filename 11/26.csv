quasars. It is an interesting time to review what we know (and don't know)
about them both empirically and theoretically. These compact sources involving
line emitting plasma show extraordinary luminosities extending to one thousand
times that of our Milky Way in emitting volumes of a few solar system diameters
(bolometric luminosity log L$_{bol} \sim $ 44-48 [erg s$^{-1}$]: D=1-3 light
months $\sim$ $10^3$ - $10^4$ gravitational radii). The advent of 8-10 meter
class telescopes enables us to study them spectroscopically in ever greater
detail.
  In 2000 we introduced a 4D Eigenvector 1 parameters space involving optical,
UV and X-Ray measures designed to serve as a 4D equivalent of the 2D
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram so important for depicting the diversity of stellar
types and evolutionary states. This diagram has revealed a principal sequence
of quasars distinguished by Eddington ratio (proportional to the accretion rate
per unit mass). Thus while stellar differences are primarily driven by the mass
of a star, quasar differences are apparently driven by the ratio of
luminosity-to-mass.
  Out of this work has emerged the concept of two quasars populations A and B
separated at Eddington ratio around 0.2 which maximizes quasar multispectral
differences. The mysterious 8% of quasars that are radio-loud belong to
population B which are the lowest accretors with the largest black hole masses.
Finally we consider the most extreme population A quasars which are the highest
accretors and in some cases are among the youngest quasars. We describe how
these sources might be exploited as standard candles for cosmology.

of the Mg KL_23 L_23 Auger spectra and using multiple scattering calculations,
we first determine the interlayer distances as well as the morphological
parameters of the MgO/Ag(001) system with and without Mg atoms incorporated at
the interface. We find that the Mg atoms incorporation drives a strong
distortion of the interface layers and that its impact on the metal/oxide
electronic structure is an important reduction of the work function (0.5 eV)
related to band-offset variations at the interface. These experimental
observations are in very good agreement with our DFT calculations which
reproduce the induced lattice distortion and which reveal (through a Bader
analysis) that the increase of the interface Mg concentration results in an
electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms of the metallic interface layer. Although
the local lattice distortion appears as a consequence of the attractive
(repulsive) Coulomb interaction between O2- ions of the MgO interface layer and
the nearest positively (negatively) charged Mg (Ag) neighbors of the metallic
interface layer, its effect on the work function reduction is only limited.
Finally, an analysis of the induced work function changes in terms of charge
transfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression contributions is attempted
and reveals that the metal/oxide work function changes induced by interface Mg
atoms incorporation are essentially driven by the increase of the electrostatic
compression effect.

(i) requires the construction of a localized one-electron basis, typically a

the choice of the degrees of freedom for which many-body effects are explicitly
taken into account, the scheme to account for screening effects, or the form of
the double-counting correction. Step (ii) requires the dynamical mean-field

by measuring the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton elastic scattering
cross sections using a simultaneous, tertiary electron-positron beam incident
on a liquid hydrogen target and detecting the scattered particles in the
Jefferson Lab CLAS detector. This novel technique allowed us to cover a wide
range in virtual photon polarization ($\varepsilon$) and momentum transfer
($Q^2$) simultaneously, as well as to cancel luminosity-related systematic
errors. The cross section ratio increases with decreasing $\varepsilon$ at $Q^2
= 1.45 \text{ GeV}^2$. This measurement is consistent with the size of the form
factor discrepancy at $Q^2\approx 1.75$ GeV$^2$ and with hadronic calculations
including nucleon and $\Delta$ intermediate states, which have been shown to
resolve the discrepancy up to $2-3$ GeV$^2$.

long-term memories. Long-term memories remain for a lifetime, while short-term
ones exist from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Within short-term memory
studies, there is debate about what neural structure could implement it.
Indeed, mechanisms responsible for long-term memories appear inadequate for the
task. Instead, it has been proposed that short-term memories could be sustained
by the persistent activity of a group of neurons. In this work, we explore what
topology could sustain short-term memories, not by designing a model from
specific hypotheses, but through Darwinian evolution in order to obtain new
insights into its implementation. We evolved 10 networks capable of retaining
information for a fixed duration between 2 and 11s. Our main finding has been
that the evolution naturally created two functional modules in the network: one
which sustains the information containing primarily excitatory neurons, while
the other, which is responsible for forgetting, was composed mainly of
inhibitory neurons. This demonstrates how the balance between inhibition and
excitation plays an important role in cognition.

fundamentally new emergent many-body states is a central problem of condensed
matter physics. We ask if a Fermi sea can arise in a system of bosons subject
to contact interaction. Based on exact diagonalization studies and variational
wave functions, we predict that such a state is likely to occur when a system
of two-component bosons in two dimensions, interacting via a species
independent contact interaction, is exposed to a synthetic magnetic field of
strength that corresponds to a filling factor of unity. The fermions forming
the SU(2) singlet Fermi sea are bound states of bosons and quantized vortices,
formed as a result of the repulsive interaction between bosons in the lowest
Landau level.

describes the collapse of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable
states as a dynamical process. This provides a basis for the resolution of the
quantum measurement problem. An additional generic consequence of the collapse
mechanism is that it causes particles to exhibit a tiny random diffusive
motion. Here it is shown that for the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL)
model---one of the most well developed collapse models---the diffusions of two
sufficiently nearby particles are positively correlated. An experimental test
of this effect is proposed in which random displacements of pairs of free
nanoparticles are measured after they have been simultaneously released from
nearby traps. The experiment must be carried out at sufficiently low
temperature and pressure in order for the collapse effects to dominate over the
ambient environmental noise. It is argued that these constraints can be
satisfied by current technologies for a large region of the viable parameter
space of the CSL model. The effect disappears as the separation between
particles exceeds the CSL length scale. The test therefore provides a means of
bounding this length scale.

correspondence between the edge and entanglement spectra: the low-energy
spectrum of the system in the presence of a physical edge coincides with the
lowest part of the entanglement spectrum (ES) across a virtual cut of the
system, up to rescaling and shifting. In this paper, we explore whether the
edge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically,
we consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The
unperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and
entanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat
and equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic
calculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the
effective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement
cut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and
H_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk
topological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy
spectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement
the Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance
along the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry
enriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian
space in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model,
whose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT. This is achieved
because the presence of the global symmetry implies that both Hamiltonians, in
addition to being Z_2 symmetric, are Kramers-Wannier self-dual. Thus, the bulk
topological order and the global translational symmetry of the Wen-plaquette
model as a SET imply an edge-ES correspondence at least in some finite domain
in Hamiltonian space.

to alert electromagnetic (EM) observatories so that they can perform follow-up
searches for counterpart transient events. We consider PE accuracy in the
presence of \edit{non-stationary}, non-Gaussian noise. We find that the
character of the noise makes negligible difference to the PE performance
\edit{at a given signal-to-noise ratio}. The source luminosity distance can
only be poorly constrained, the median $90\%$ ($50\%$) credible interval scaled

carry out inference on signals with moderate spins, but the total error is
typically less than $10^{-3} M_\odot$. The median $90\%$ ($50\%$) credible

We prove that several natural quantities, in particular the speed of the

separating split variable selection from split point selection; (2) applying an

  Bounded-Degrees",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For graphs $G$ and $H$, let $G\to (H,H)$ signify that any red/blue edge
coloring of $G$ contains a monochromatic $H$ as a subgraph, and
$\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)=\{H:|V(H)|=n,\Delta(H)\le \Delta\}$. For fixed $\Delta$
and $n$, we say that $G$ is a partition universal graph for
$\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)$ if $G\to (H,H)$ for every $H\in\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)$.
  In 1983, Chv\'atal, R\""odl, Szemer\'edi and Trotter proved that for any
$\Delta\ge2$ there exists a constant $B$ such that, for any $n$, if $N\ge Bn$
then $K_N$ is partition universal for $\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)$. Recently,
Kohayakawa, R\""odl, Schacht and Szemer\'edi proved that the complete graph
$K_N$ in above result can be replaced by sparse graphs. They obtained that for
fixed $\Delta\ge2$, there exist constants $B$ and $C$ such that if $N\ge Bn$
and $p=C(\log N/N)^{1/\Delta}$, then {\bf a.a.s.} $G(N,p)$ is partition
universal graph for $\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)$, where $G(N,p)$ is the standard
random graph on $N$ vertices with $\mathbb{P}(e)=p$ for each edge $e$. From
some results of Bollob\'as and {\L}uczak, we know that {\bf a.a.s.}
$\chi(G(N,p)) = \Theta((N/\log N)^{1-1/\Delta})$.
  In this paper, we shall show that the $G(N,p)$ in above result can be
replaced by random multipartite graph. Let $K_{r}(N)$ be the complete
$r$-partite graph with $N$ vertices in each part, and $G_r(N,p)$ the random
spanning subgraph of $K_r(N)$, in which each edge appears with probability $p$.
It is shown that for fixed $\Delta\ge2$ there exist constants $r, B$ and $C$
depending only on $\Delta$ such that if $N\ge Bn$ and $p=C(\log
N/N)^{1/\Delta}$, then {\bf a.a.s.} $G_r(N,p)$ is partition universal graph for
$\mathcal{H}(\Delta,n)$. The proof mainly uses the sparse multipartite
regularity lemma.

linearly oriented with one characteristic wave vector but varying in its

more structures involving multiple wave vectors.

cryogenic plastic capsules. In both cases, the high-energy RIF ($E_n>$ 15 MeV)
component of the neutron spectrum was found to be about $10^{-4}$ of the total.
The majority of the RIF neutrons were produced in the dense cold fuel
surrounding the burning hotspot of the capsule and the data are consistent with
a compressed cold fuel that is moderately to strongly coupled $(\Gamma\sim$0.6)

of RIF neutrons is controlled by the stopping power in the plasma. Thus, the
current RIF measurements provide a unique test of stopping power models in an

strongly constrain stopping models in warm dense plasma conditions and some

characterize their relaxation dynamics. The observed relaxation consists of a
distinct three-step recovery : (i) femtosecond (fs) hole spin relaxation ~

Born rule from the first principles, like the Schroedinger equation, rather
than postulate it. The Born rule was in certain sense derived in several
articles, e.g. in [D. Deutsch, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A455, 3129 (1999)] and [W.
H. Zurek, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120404 (2003)]. In this work some arguments of
previous authors are simplified and made more ""physical"". It is shown how to
derive the Born rule using the conservation of quantum state norm
$\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle$ that is the unitary evolution property determined by
the Schroedinger equation. It is this property that makes the probability equal
to the square of the amplitude modulus. We also present arguments in the spirit
of the Many-World Interpretation to explain the origin of probabilistic
behavior. Simply speaking, the randomness appears as a result of representing
the wave function by using a detector of discrete nature that is found only in
one state at a time, out of two or more possible states.

  Shannon Capacity Over All Alphabets",,,,,"cs.IT cs.CC math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove a lower estimate on the increase in entropy when two copies of a
conditional random variable $X | Y$, with $X$ supported on
$\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dots,q-1\}$ for prime $q$, are summed modulo $q$.
Specifically, given two i.i.d copies $(X_1,Y_1)$ and $(X_2,Y_2)$ of a pair of
random variables $(X,Y)$, with $X$ taking values in $\mathbb{Z}_q$, we show \[
H(X_1 + X_2 \mid Y_1, Y_2) - H(X|Y) \ge \alpha(q) \cdot H(X|Y) (1-H(X|Y)) \]
for some $\alpha(q) > 0$, where $H(\cdot)$ is the normalized (by factor $\log_2
q$) entropy. Our motivation is an effective analysis of the finite-length
behavior of polar codes, and the assumption of $q$ being prime is necessary.
For $X$ supported on infinite groups without a finite subgroup and no
conditioning, a sumset inequality for the absolute increase in (unnormalized)
entropy was shown by Tao (2010).
  We use our sumset inequality to analyze Ar{\i}kan's construction of polar
codes and prove that for any $q$-ary source $X$, where $q$ is any fixed prime,
and any $\epsilon > 0$, polar codes allow {\em efficient} data compression of
$N$ i.i.d. copies of $X$ into $(H(X)+\epsilon)N$ $q$-ary symbols, as soon as
$N$ is polynomially large in $1/\epsilon$. We can get capacity-achieving source
codes with similar guarantees for composite alphabets, by factoring $q$ into
primes and combining different polar codes for each prime in factorization.
  A consequence of our result for noisy channel coding is that for {\em all}
discrete memoryless channels, there are explicit codes enabling reliable
communication within $\epsilon > 0$ of the symmetric Shannon capacity for a
block length and decoding complexity bounded by a polynomial in $1/\epsilon$.
The result was previously shown for the special case of binary input channels
(Guruswami-Xia '13 and Hassani-Alishahi-Urbanke '13), and this work extends the
result to channels over any alphabet.

broad applications in models of the fireball evolution which are required to
compare to experimental data. An accurate and universal parametrization of the

spectra. Here we provide such a parametrization for photon emission rates from
hadronic matter, including the contributions from in-medium rho mesons (which
incorporate effects from anti-/baryons), as well as Bremsstrahlung from pi-pi
scattering. Individual parametrizations for each contribution are numerically
determined through nested fitting functions for photon energies from 0.2 to 5
GeV in chemically equilibrated matter of temperatures 100-180 MeV and baryon
chemical potentials 0-400 MeV. Special care is taken to extent the
parameterizations to chemical off-equilibrium as encountered in HICs after
chemical freezeout. This provides a functional description of thermal photon

extensively studied in the literature, both from the point of view of QFT
developed using Rindler foliation and using the response of an Unruh-Dewitt
Detector (UDD). In comparison, less attention has been devoted to the study of
inertial non-vacuum states when viewed from the Rindler frame. We provide a
comprehensive study of this issue in this paper. We first present a general
formalism describing characterization of an arbitrary inertial state when
described using (i) an arbitrary foliation and (ii) the response of UDD moving
along an arbitrary trajectory. We use this formalism to explicitly compute the
results for the Rindler frame and uniformly accelerated detectors. Any
arbitrary inertial state will always have a thermal component in the Rindler
frame with additional contributions arising from the non-vacuum nature of the
inertial state. We classify the nature of the additional contributions in terms
of functions characterizing the inertial state. We establish that for all
physically well behaved normalizable inertial states, the correction terms
decay with the energy of the Rindler mode so that the high frequency limit is
dominated by the thermal noise. However, inertial states which are not strictly
normalizable, lead to a constant contribution at all high frequencies in the
Rindler frame. A similar behavior arises in the response of the UDD as well. In
the case of the detector response, we provide a physical interpretation for the
constant contribution at high frequencies in terms of total detection rate of
co-moving inertial detectors. We discuss two different approaches for defining
a transition rate for the UDD, when the two-point function lacks the time
translation invariance and discuss several features of different definitions of
transition rates. The implications are discussed.

extragalactic detection of anomalous microwave emission (AME) reported by
Murphy et al. 2010 in an extranuclear region (Enuc. 4) of the nearby face-on
spiral galaxy NGC 6946. We find the spectral shape and peak frequency of AME in
this region to be consistent with models of spinning dust emission. However,
the strength of the emission far exceeds the Galactic AME emissivity given the
abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in that region. Using our
galaxy-wide 1 cm map (21"" resolution), we identify a total of eight 21""x21""
regions in NGC 6946 that harbour AME at >95% significance at levels comparable
to that observed in Enuc. 4. The remainder of the galaxy has 1 cm emission
consistent with or below the observed Galactic AME emissivity per PAH surface
density. We probe relationships between the detected AME and dust surface
density, PAH emission, and radiation field, though no environmental property
emerges to delineate regions with strong versus weak or non-existent AME. On
the basis of these data and other AME observations in the literature, we
determine that the AME emissivity per unit dust mass is highly variable. We
argue that the spinning dust hypothesis, which predicts the AME power to be
approximately proportional to the PAH mass, is therefore incomplete.

Unfortunately, effective calibration requires an accurate distance to NGC 4151,
which is currently not available. Recently reported distances range from 4 to
29 megaparsecs (Mpc). Strong peculiar motions make a redshift-based distance
very uncertain, and the geometry of the galaxy and its nucleus prohibit
accurate measurements using other techniques. Here we report a dust-parallax
distance to NGC 4151 of $D_A = 19.0^{+2.4}_{-2.6}$ Mpc. The measurement is
based on an adaptation of a geometric method proposed previously using the
emission line regions of active galaxies. Since this region is too small for
current imaging capabilities, we use instead the ratio of the
physical-to-angular sizes of the more extended hot dust emission as determined
from time-delays and infrared interferometry. This new distance leads to an
approximately 1.4-fold increase in the dynamical black hole mass, implying a
corresponding correction to emission line reverberation masses of black holes
if they are calibrated against the two objects with additional dynamical
masses.

1/d for coupled-dimer Heisenberg magnets, where d is the number of space
dimensions. This extension utilizes generalized bond operators describing spin
excitations on top of a reference state involving triplet condensates. We
explicitly consider a model of dimers on a hypercubic lattice which displays,
in addition to the paramagnetic singlet phase, a collinear antiferromagnetic
phase for which we calculate static and dynamic observables at zero
temperature. In particular, we show that the 1/d expansion smoothly connects
the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases and produces sensible results at
and near the quantum phase transition point. Among others, we determine the
dispersion and spectral-weight distribution of the amplitude (i.e. Higgs) mode
of the ordered phase. In the limit of vanishing intra-dimer coupling, we
connect our approach to spin-wave theory.

radii range between $1-7$ kpc, with a median of 2.1 kpc, and lie slightly above
the size-mass relation at these epochs reported in the literature. This is

Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce larger amplitude reflex
motions around lower-mass stars, which helps make M dwarfs excellent targets
for extra-solar planet searches. State of the art velocimeters with $\sim$1m/s
stability can detect very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these
stars. Low-mass, small, planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most known
potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars.
  Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6m
telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this sample.
  Methods. We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time series for three M
dwarfs observed over $\sim5$ years: GJ 3293 (0.42M$_\odot$), GJ 3341
(0.47M$_\odot$), and GJ 3543 (0.45M$_\odot$). We extract those RVs through
minimum $\chi^2$ matching of each spectrum against a high S/N ratio stack of
all observed spectra for the same star. We then vet potential orbital signals
against several stellar activity indicators, to disentangle the Keplerian
variations induced by planets from the spurious signals which result from
rotational modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity
cycles.
  Results. Two Neptune-mass planets - $msin(i)=1.4\pm0.1$ and
$1.3\pm0.1M_{nept}$ - orbit GJ 3293 with periods $P=30.60\pm0.02$ d and

$msin(i)\sim7.9\pm1.4M_\oplus$ - with period $P=48.14\pm0.12\;d$. A super-Earth
- $msin(i)\sim6.1M_\oplus$ - orbits GJ 3341 with $P=14.207\pm0.007\;d$. The RV
variations of GJ 3543, on the other hand, reflect its stellar activity rather
than planetary signals.

significant role on fluid flow in low-permeability porous media, and it is more
pronounced as the Knudsen number increases. Fluid flow in a shale matrix with

greatly enhance the fluid flow and the Klinkenberg's effect leads to higher

model. This simulation spans 1600 yrs and generated 40 regular, sunspot-like
cycles. While the simulated cycle length is too long and the toroidal bands
remain at too high of latitudes, some solar-like aspects of hemispheric
asymmetry are reproduced. The model reproduces the synchrony of polarity
inversions and onset of cycle as the simulated phase lags do not exceed 20% of
the cycle period. Simulated amplitude variations between the N and S
hemispheres are larger than observed in the Sun. The simulations show one
hemisphere persistently leads the other for several successive cycles, placing
an upper bound on the efficiency of transequatorial magnetic coupling
mechanisms. These include magnetic diffusion, cross-equatorial mixing within
elongated convective rolls and transequatorial meridional flow cells. One or
more of these processes may lead to magnetic flux cancellation whereby the
oppositely directed fields come in close proximity and cancel each other across
the magnetic equator late in the solar cycle. We discuss the discrepancies
between model and observations and the constraints they pose on possible
mechanisms of hemispheric coupling.

hitherto unresolved star forming region known as either IRAS14482-5857 or
PMN1452-5910. At radio continuum frequencies, this source is characterised by a
""filled-bubble"" structure reminiscent of a classical HII region, dominated by
three point sources, and surrounded by low-surface-brightness emission out to
the $3'\times4'$ source extent observed at other frequencies in the literature.
The infrared emission corresponds well to the radio emission, with polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission surrounding regions of hot dust towards the radio
bubbles. A bright 4.5 $\mu$m point source is seen towards the centre of the
radio source, suggesting a young stellar object. There is also a linear,
outflow-like structure radiating brightly at 8 and 24 $\mu$m towards the
brightest peak of the radio continuum. In order to estimate the distance to
this source, we have used Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey
$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0) molecular line emission data.
Integrated-intensity, velocity at peak intensity and line-fitting of the
spectra all point towards the peak centred at $v_{LSR}$=-1.1 km/s being
connected to this cloud. This infers a distance to this cloud of ~12.7 kpc.
Assuming this distance, we estimate a column density and mass towards
IRAS14482-5857 of ~$1.5\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $2\times10^4$ $M_\odot$,
implying that this source is a site of massive star formation. Reinforcing this
conclusion, our broadband spectral fitting infers dust temperatures of 19 and
110K, emission measures for the sub-pc radio point-source of emission measure
$EM\sim10^{6-7}$ pc cm$^{-6}$, electron densities of $n_e\sim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$
and photon ionisation rates of $N_{Ly}~10^{46-48}$ s$^{-1}$. The evidence
strongly suggests that IRAS14482-5857 is a distant, and hence intense site of
massive star-formation.

approximations that lessen the computational demand of the transport scheme by
removing the need to invert large matrices. This is especially important for
the implementation and development of moment-like transport methods in two and
three dimensions. A critical component of neutrino transport calculations are
the neutrino-matter interaction coefficients that describe the production,
absorption, scattering, and annihilation of neutrinos. In this article we also
describe our open-source, neutrino interaction library NuLib (available at

these interactions is one of the major steps needed to progress towards robust
models of CCSNe and robust predictions of the neutrino signal. We show, via
comparisons to full Boltzmann neutrino transport simulations of CCSNe, that our
neutrino transport code performs remarkably well. Furthermore, we show that the
methods and approximations we employ to increase efficiency do not decrease the
fidelity of our results. We also test the ability of our general relativistic

to relate the study of Macaulay (1916) inverse systems with the so-called
Riquier (1910)-Janet (1920) initial conditions for the integration of linear
analytic systems of partial differential equations. One paper has been written
by F. Piras (1998) and the other by U. Oberst (2013), both papers being written
in a rather algebraic style though using quite different techniques. It is
however evident that the respective authors, though knowing the computational
works of C. done during the first half of the last century in a way not
intrinsic at all, are not familiar with the formal theory of systems of
ordinary or partial differential equations developped by D.C. Spencer
(1912-2001) and coworkers around 1965 in an intrinsic way, in particular with
its application to the study of differential modules in the framework of
algebraic analysis. As a byproduct, the first purpose of this paper is to
establish a close link between the work done by F. S. Macaulay (1862-1937) on
inverse systems in 1916 and the well-known Cartan-K{\""a}hler theorem (1934).
The second purpose is also to extend the work of Macaulay to the study of
arbitrary linear systems with variable coefficients. The reader will notice how
powerful and elegant is the use of the Spencer operator acting on sections in
this general framework. However, we point out the fact that the literature on
differential modules mostly only refers to a complex analytic structure on
manifolds while the Spencer sequences have been created in order to study any
kind of structure on manifolds defined by a Lie pseudogroup of transformations,
not just only complex analytic ones. Many tricky explicit examples illustrate
the paper, including the ones provided by the two authors quoted but in a quite
different framework.

on quasiparticle scattering. From the conductance spectra taken over a wide
temperature range, we deduce that the band renormalization and hybridization
process begins around 110 K, causing the conductance enhancement with a Fano
background. This temperature, a new scale found in this work, is much higher
than the coherence temperature (34 K). Our observation is in agreement with the
slow crossover scenario discussed recently in the literature. The indirect
hybridization gap appears to open concomitantly with the emergence of a
coherent Fermi liquid. Thus, we suggest its measurement as a more rigorous way
to define the coherence temperature than just taking the temperature for a
resistivity peak.

to the operation of optical holographic devices. Input information is encoded
in the phases of the spin waves generated on the several edges of the magnonic

  This result improves Beckmann's result, which proves the consistency of such
a system without substitution in bounded arithmetic $S^1_2$.
  Our proof relies on the notion of ""computation"" of the terms of
$\mathrm{PV}$.
  In our work, we first prove that, in the system under consideration, if an
equation is proved and either its left- or right-hand side is computed, then
there is a corresponding computation for its right- or left-hand side,
respectively.
  By carefully computing the bound of the size of the computation, the proof of
this theorem inside a bounded arithmetic is obtained, from which the
consistency of the system is readily proven.
  This result apparently implies the separation of bounded arithmetic because
Buss and Ignjatovi\'c stated that it is not possible to prove the consistency
of a fragment of $\mathrm{PV}$ without induction but with substitution in
Buss's $S^1_2$.
  However, their proof actually shows that it is not possible to prove the
consistency of the system, which is obtained by the addition of propositional
logic and other axioms to a system such as ours.
  On the other hand, the system that we have considered is strictly equational,
which is a property on which our proof relies.

contains not a fixed, but a variable number of closed vortex lines. This is

have revealed that the elongation rate of Polymerase II (PolII) in eukaryotes
varies largely across different cell types and genes. However, there is not yet
a consensus whether intrinsic factors such as the position, local mobility or
the engagement by an active molecular mechanism of a genetic locus could be the
determinants of the observed heterogeneity. Employing high-speed 3D
fluorescence nanoimaging we resolve here at the single cell level multiple,
distinct regions of mRNA synthesis within a labeled transgene array. By
employing phasor analysis, a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy technique,
we demonstrate that these regions are active transcription sites that release
mRNA molecules in the nucleoplasm, and we extract the local PolII elongation
rate. While we detect a range of 10-100 bp/s for PolII elongation from cell to
cell, we are now also able to measure up to a four-fold variation in the
average elongation between identical copies of the same gene measured
simultaneously within the same cell. Furthermore, we are able to visualize
changes of PolII elongation as a function of time. We observe a correlation
between the average elongation rate measured in a locus and its local mobility.
Finally, by cross-correlating the transcriptional activity with the nm-sized
movements of the active loci, we provide evidence of an active molecular
mechanism determining displacements of the transcription sites concomitant to
increases in transcriptional activity. Together these observations demonstrate
that local factors, such as chromatin local mobility and the microenvironment
of the transcription site, are an important source of transcription kinetics
variability.

and its first overtone, we observe that the antinode positions of both the
fundamental mode and its first overtone shift towards the weak field region
along the coronal loop. The results indicate that the density stratification
and the temperature difference effects are larger than the magnetic field
variation effect on the period ratio. On the other hand, the magnetic field
variation has a greater effect on the eigenfunction of the first overtone than
the density stratification does for this case.

present proof of work and rewarding them for participation. The Bitcoin digital
currency introduced this mechanism, which is adopted by almost all contemporary
digital currencies and related services.
  A natural process leads participants of such systems to form pools, where
members aggregate their power and share the rewards. Experience with Bitcoin
shows that the largest pools are often open, allowing anyone to join. It has
long been known that a member can sabotage an open pool by seemingly joining it
but never sharing its proofs of work. The pool shares its revenue with the
attacker, and so each of its participants earns less.
  We define and analyze a game where pools use some of their participants to
infiltrate other pools and perform such an attack. With any number of pools,
no-pool-attacks is not a Nash equilibrium. With two pools, or any number of
identical pools, there exists an equilibrium that constitutes a tragedy of the
commons where the pools attack one another and all earn less than they would
have if none had attacked.
  For two pools, the decision whether or not to attack is the miner's dilemma,
an instance of the iterative prisoner's dilemma. The game is played daily by
the active Bitcoin pools, which apparently choose not to attack. If this
balance breaks, the revenue of open pools might diminish, making them
unattractive to participants.

localized lumps, which have three different patterns: bright, intermediate and

conditions and their behaviors are also classified to above three patterns with
different definition. It is shown that the simplest (fundamental) rogue waves
are line localized waves which arise from the constant background with a line
profile and then disappear into the constant background again. In particular,
two-dimensional intermediate and dark counterparts of rogue wave are found with
the different parameter requirements. We demonstrate that multirogue waves

interesting curvy wave patterns appear in the intermediate times. Different
curvy wave patterns form in the interaction of different types fundamental
rogue waves. Higher-order rogue waves exhibit the dynamic behaviors that the
wave structures start from lump and then retreats back to it, and this
transient wave possesses the patterns such as parabolas. Furthermore, different
states of higher-order rogue wave result in completely distinguishing lumps and
parabolas. Moreover, one-dimensional rogue wave solutions with three states are
constructed through the further reduction. Specifically, higher-order rogue
wave in one dimensional case is derived under the parameter constraints.

pairs and cylinder triplets after capillary rise is initially established for
cylinders in contact. For cylinder pairs, numerical computations and a
theoretical model are found to be in good agreement with measurements. The
model provides insight into the relative importance of the contributions to the

separations, surface tension becomes more important. A cross-over between the
two regimes occurs at a separation of around half of a capillary length. The
experimentally measured forces between cylinder triplets are also in good
agreement with numerical computations, and we show that pair-wise contributions
account for nearly all of the attractive force between triplets. For cylinders
with equilibrium capillary rise height greater than the height of the cylinder,
we find that the attractive force depends on the height of the cylinders above
the submersion level, which provides a means to create precisely-controlled
tunable cohesive forces between objects deforming a fluid interface.

minimizing convex functions whose variable consists of two blocks. How to
efficiently solve each subproblems when applying the AM method is the most
concerned task. In this paper, we investigate this task and design two new
variants of the AM method by borrowing proximal linearized techniques. The
first variant is very suitable for the case where half of the subproblems are
hard to be solved and the other half can be directly computed. The second
variant is designed for parallel computation. Both of them are featured by
simplicity at each iteration step. Theoretically, with the help of the proximal
operator we first write the new as well as the existing AM variants into
uniform expressions, and then prove that they enjoy sublinear rates of
convergence under very minimal assumptions.

statistic information is considered for two-stage beamforming for multi-user
massive MIMO downlink, and the problem is approached based on
signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR). To eliminate the dependence on the
instantaneous channel state information, a lower bound on the average SLNR is
derived by assuming zero-forcing (ZF) inner beamforming, and an outer
beamformer design method that maximizes the lower bound on the average SLNR is
proposed. It is shown that the proposed SLNR-based outer beamformer design
problem reduces to a trace quotient problem (TQP), which is often encountered
in the field of machine learning. An iterative algorithm is presented to obtain
an optimal solution to the proposed TQP. The proposed method has the capability
of optimally controlling the weighting factor between the signal power to the
desired user and the interference leakage power to undesired users according to
different channel statistics. Numerical results show that the proposed outer
beamformer design method yields significant performance gain over existing
methods.

$T$,on physical quantities are studied using the linear sigma model in chiral
phase transitions. The Tsallis distribution approaches the Boltzmann-Gibbs
distribution as $q$ approaches $1$. The parameter $T$ dependences of the
condensate and mass for various $q$ are shown, where $T$ is called temperature.
The critical temperature and energy density are described with digamma
function, and the $q$ dependences of these quantities and the extension of
Stefan-Boltzmann limit of the energy density are shown. The following facts are
clarified. The chiral symmetry restoration at $q>1$ occurs at low temperature,
compared with the restoration at $q=1$.The sigma mass and pion mass reflect the
restoration. The critical temperature decreases monotonically as $q$ increases.
The small deviation from the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution results in the large
deviations of physical quantities, especially the energy density. It is
displayed from the energetic point of view that the small deviation from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is realized for $q>1$. The physical quantities are
affected by the Tsallis distribution even when $|q-1|$ is small.

appears in the outer-disk region. The high-velocity jet propagates into the
low-velocity outflow, forming a nested velocity structure in which a narrow
high-velocity flow is enclosed by a wide low-velocity flow. The low-velocity
outflow is in a nearly steady state, while the high-velocity jet appears
intermittently. The time-variability of the jet is related to the episodic
accretion from the disk onto the protostar, which is caused by gravitational
instability and magnetic effects such as magnetic braking and magnetorotational
instability. Although the high-velocity jet has a large kinetic energy, the
mass and momentum of the jet are much smaller than those of the low-velocity
outflow. A large fraction of the infalling gas is ejected by the low-velocity

properties for a particle constrained to move on a truncated cone-like surface.
With longitudinal hard wall boundary condition, the probability densities and
spectra energy shifts are calculated, and are found to be obviously affected by
the surface curvature. The bound-state energy levels and energy differences
decrease as increasing the vertex angle or the ratio of axial length to bottom
radius of the truncated cone. In a two-dimensional (2D) GaAs substrate with
this geometric structure, an estimation of the ground-state energy shift of
ballistic transport electrons induced by the geometric potential (GP) is
addressed, which shows that the fraction of the ground-state energy shift
resulting from the surface curvature is unnegligible under some region of
geometric parameters. Furthermore, we model a truncated cone-like junction
joining two cylinders with different radii, and investigate the effect of the
GP on the transmission properties by numerically solving the open-boundary 2D
Schr\""odinger equation with GP on the junction surface. It is shown that the
oscillatory behavior of the transmission coefficient as a function of the
injection energy is more pronounced when steeper GP wells appear at the two
ends of the junction. Moreover, at specific injection energy, the transmission
coefficient is oscillating with the ratio of the cylinder radii at incoming and
outgoing sides.

  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain
that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Model-driven software development offers a
high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at
the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for
programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a
separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a
holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency,
uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional
general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language
features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful,
systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and
precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the
robotics domain.

witnessed it in the course of time. Born as an innocent child of
renormalization theory it first served the study of asymptotic behavior of
several couplings in a given model. Reduced couplings appeared as functions of
a primary one, compatible with the renormalization group equation and thus
solutions of a specific set of ordinary differential equations. If these
functions have the form of power series the respective theories resemble
standard renormalizable ones and thus widen considerably the area covered until
then by symmetries as a tool for constraining the number of couplings
consistently. Still on the more abstract level reducing couplings enabled one
to construct theories with beta-functions vanishing to all orders of
perturbation theory. Reduction of couplings became physicswise truely
interesting and phenomenologically important when applied to the standard model
and its possible extensions. In particular in the context of supersymmetric
theories it became the most powerful tool known today once it was learned how
to apply it also to couplings having dimension of mass and to mass parameters.
Technically this all relies on the basic property that reducing couplings is a
renormalization scheme independent procedure. Predictions of top and Higgs mass
prior to their experimental finding highlight the fundamental physical
significance of this notion. Twenty-two original articles and one set of
lectures are being commented, put into historical perspective and interrelated
with each other.

highly relevant parameter in phenomena such as wetting or crystal nucleation
and growth. Due to the difficulty of measuring {\gamma} cf experimentally,
computer simulations are often used to study the crystal-fluid interface. Here,
we present a novel simulation methodology for the calculation of {\gamma} cf .
The methodology consists in using a mold composed of potential energy wells to
induce the formation of a crystal slab in the fluid at coexistence conditions.
This induction is done along a reversible pathway along which the free energy
difference between the initial and the final states is obtained by means of
thermodynamic integration. The structure of the mold is given by that of the
crystal lattice planes, which allows to easily obtain the free energy for
different crystal orientations. The method is validated by calculating {\gamma}
cf for previously studied systems, namely, the hard spheres and the
Lennard-Jones systems. Our results for the latter show that the method is
accurate enough to deal with the anisotropy of {\gamma} cf with respect to the
crystal orientation. We also calculate {\gamma} cf for a recently proposed
continuous version of the hard sphere potential and obtain the same {\gamma} cf
as for the pure hard sphere system. The method can be implemented both in Monte
Carlo and Molecular Dynamics. In fact, we show that it can be easily used in
combination with the popular Molecular Dynamics package GROMACS.

photometric variability in correlation with their X-ray activity and derive a
set of secondary standard stars that can be used for time series analysis. We
find that the donors in Be/X-ray binaries exhibit larger amplitude changes in
the magnitudes and colours than those hosting a supergiant companion. The
amplitude of variability increases with wavelength in Be/X-ray binaries and
remains fairly constant in supergiant systems. When time scales of years are
considered, a good correlation between the X-ray and optical variability is
observed. The X-rays cease when optical brightness decreases. These results
reflect the fact that the circumstellar disk in Be/X-ray binaries is the main
source of both optical and X-ray variability. We also derive the colour excess,
E(B-V), selecting data at times when the contribution of the circumstellar disk
was supposed to be at minimum, and we revisit the distance estimates.

However, the molecular dynamics simulations have revealed the existence of
significant structural heterogeneities, extending up to a length scale which is
more than five times the size of the first coordination shell radius. Due to
these significant structural fluctuations in the bulk liquid phases, the use of
larger size clusters in DFT calculations has been suggested. Contrary to the
findings of the DFT calculations on small isolated clusters, the MD simulations
have predicted a preference of Li+ to interact with DMC molecules within its
first solvation shell and not with the highly polar EC and PC ones, in the
binary and ternary mixtures. This behavior has been attributed to the local
tetrahedral packing of the solvent molecules in the first solvation shell of
Li+, which causes a cancellation of the individual molecular dipole vectors,
and this effect seems to be more important in the cases where molecules of the

the first solvation shell of Li+ increases when the local mole fraction of DMC

the nonequilibrium equation of state of a bidimensional assembly of active

show that active colloids behave, in the dilute limit, as an ideal gas with an

to constrain the dark matter content. Deep images in B and R, obtained with the
VIsible MultiObject Spectrograph (VIMOS) at the VLT, form the data base. We
present isotropic and anisotropic Jeans-models and give a morphological
description of the companion dwarf galaxy. The globular cluster system has
about 2000 members, so it is not as rich as those of giant ellipticals in
galaxy clusters with a comparable stellar mass, but richer than many cluster
systems of other isolated ellipticals. The colour distribution of GCs is
bimodal, which does not necessarily mean a metallicity bimodality. The
kinematic literature data are somewhat inconclusive. The velocity dispersion in
the inner parts can be reproduced without dark matter under isotropy. Radially
anisotropic models need a low stellar mass-to-light ratio, which would contrast
with the old age of the galaxy. A MONDian model is supported by X-ray analysis
and previous dynamical modelling, but better data are necessary for a
confirmation. The dwarf companion galaxy NGC 7796-1 exhibits tidal tails,
multiple nuclei, and very boxy isophotes. NGC 7796 is an old, massive isolated
elliptical galaxy with no indications of later major star formation events as
seen frequently in other isolated ellipticals. Its relatively rich globular
cluster system shows that isolation does not always mean a poor cluster system.
The properties of the dwarf companion might indicate a dwarf-dwarf merger.

(14-moment approximation and causal Chapman-Enskog method), standard
Israel-Stewart theory, and anisotropic hydrodynamics framework, in the simple

the failure of Israel-Stewart theory in reproducing exact solutions of the
Boltzmann kinetic equation occurs due to neglecting and/or choosing wrong forms
of some of the second-order transport coefficients. In particular, the
importance of shear--bulk couplings in the evolution equations for dissipative
quantities is shown. One finds that, in the case of the bulk viscous pressure
correction, such coupling terms are as important as the corresponding
first-order Navier-Stokes term and must be included in order to obtain, at
least qualitative, overall agreement with the kinetic theory.

many-body systems and statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. It
is generally believed that the unitary quantum evolution of a sufficiently
complex system leads to an apparent maximum-entropy state that can be described
by thermodynamical ensembles. However, conventional ensembles fail to describe
the large class of systems that exhibit non-trivial conserved quantities.
Instead, generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these
systems. In our experiments we explicitly show that a degenerate
one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a
generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation
functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble
description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural
emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary
quantum evolution.

particularly important for the analysis of mathematical models of physical
systems. We propose a novel, direct geometric method to identify subsets of
phase space that remain strongly coherent over a finite time duration. This new
method is based on a dynamic extension of classical (static) isoperimetric
problems; the latter are concerned with identifying submanifolds with the
smallest boundary size relative to their volume.
  The present work introduces \emph{dynamic} isoperimetric problems; the study
of sets with small boundary size relative to volume \emph{as they are evolved
by a general dynamical system}. We formulate and prove dynamic versions of the
fundamental (static) isoperimetric (in)equalities; a dynamic Federer-Fleming
theorem and a dynamic Cheeger inequality. We introduce a new dynamic Laplacian
operator and describe a computational method to identify coherent sets based on
eigenfunctions of the dynamic Laplacian.
  Our results include formal mathematical statements concerning geometric
properties of finite-time coherent sets, whose boundaries can be regarded as
Lagrangian coherent structures. The computational advantages of our new
approach are a well-separated spectrum for the dynamic Laplacian, and
flexibility in appropriate numerical approximation methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that the dynamic Laplacian operator can be realised as a
zero-diffusion limit of a newly advanced probabilistic transfer operator method
(Froyland, 2013) for finding coherent sets, which is based on small diffusion.
Thus, the present approach sits naturally alongside the probabilistic approach
(Froyland, 2013), and adds a formal geometric interpretation.

local Gorenstein 3-fold, where the fibres of $f$ are at most one dimensional,
so by [VdB1d] there is a noncommutative ring $\Lambda$ derived equivalent to
$X$. For any collection of curves above the origin, we show that this
collection contracts to a point without contracting a divisor if and only if a
certain factor of $\Lambda$ is finite dimensional, improving a result of [DW2].
We further show that the mutation functor of [S6][IW4] is functorially
isomorphic to the inverse of the Bridgeland--Chen flop functor in the case when
the factor of $\Lambda$ is finite dimensional. These results then allow us to
jump between all the minimal models of $\mathrm{Spec}\, R$ in an algorithmic
way, without having to compute the geometry at each stage. We call this process
the Homological MMP.
  This has several applications in GIT approaches to derived categories, and
also to birational geometry. First, using mutation we are able to compute the
full GIT chamber structure by passing to surfaces. We say precisely which
chambers give the distinct minimal models, and also say which walls give flops
and which do not, enabling us to prove the Craw--Ishii conjecture in this
setting. Second, we are able to precisely count the number of minimal models,
and also give bounds for both the maximum and the minimum numbers of minimal
models based only on the dual graph enriched with scheme theoretic
multiplicity. Third, we prove a bijective correspondence between maximal
modifying $R$-module generators and minimal models, and for each such pair in
this correspondence give a further correspondence linking the endomorphism ring
and the geometry. This lifts the Auslander--McKay correspondence to dimension
three.

bins, obtaining strong concentration bounds for standard algorithms combining
statistics from each bin.
  This generic method was originally introduced by Flajolet and
Martin~[FOCS'83] in order to save a factor $\Omega(k)$ of time per element over
$k$ independent samples when estimating the number of distinct elements in a
data stream. It was also used in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of
Flajolet et al.~[AOFA'97] and in large-scale machine learning by Li et
al.~[NIPS'12] for minwise estimation of set similarity.
  The main issue of $k$-partition, is that the contents of different bins may
be highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods
of analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we
show that a tabulation based hash function, mixed tabulation, does yield strong
concentration bounds on the most popular applications of $k$-partitioning
similar to those we would get using a truly random hash function. The analysis
is very involved and implies several new results of independent interest for
both simple and double tabulation, e.g. a simple and efficient construction for
invertible bloom filters and uniform hashing on a given set.

complete subgraph of $G$ and is a well-known lower bound for the chromatic
number of $G$. Every proper $k$-coloring of $G$ may be viewed as a homomorphism
(an edge-preserving vertex mapping) of $G$ to the complete graph of order $k$.
By considering homomorphisms of oriented graphs (digraphs without cycles of
length at most 2), we get a natural notion of (oriented) colorings and oriented
chromatic number of oriented graphs. An oriented clique is then an oriented
graph whose number of vertices and oriented chromatic number coincide. However,
the structure of oriented cliques is much less understood than in the
undirected case.
  In this paper, we study the structure of outerplanar and planar oriented
cliques. We first provide a list of 11 graphs and prove that an outerplanar
graph can be oriented as an oriented clique if and only if it contains one of
these graphs as a spanning subgraph. Klostermeyer and MacGillivray conjectured
that the order of a planar oriented clique is at most 15, which was later
proved by Sen [S. Sen. Maximum Order of a Planar Oclique Is 15. Proc.
IWOCA'2012. {\em Lecture Notes Comput. Sci.} 7643:130--142]. We show that any
planar oriented clique on 15 vertices must contain a particular oriented graph
as a spanning subgraph, thus reproving the above conjecture. We also provide
tight upper bounds for the order of planar oriented cliques of girth $k$ for
all $k \ge 4$.

are obtained for different collision avoidance and spectrum sensing

results suggest that not only is the formation of a firewall the most natural

sum-of-exclusives approach in which 38 of the hadronic final states with
strangeness equal to $+1$, denoted by $X_s$, are reconstructed. The inclusive
branching fraction for $M_{X_s}<$ 2.8 GeV/$c^2$, which corresponds to a minimum
photon energy of 1.9 GeV, is measured to be ${\cal B}(\bar{B} \rightarrow X_s
\gamma)=(3.51\pm0.17\pm0.33)\times10^{-4}$, where the first uncertainty is
statistical and the second is systematic.

  an Expressive Model of the Web","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1403.1866",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  BrowserID is a complex, real-world Single Sign-On (SSO) System for web
applications recently developed by Mozilla. It employs new HTML5 features (such
as web messaging and web storage) and cryptographic assertions to provide
decentralized login, with the intent to respect users' privacy. It can operate
in a primary and a secondary identity provider mode. While in the primary mode
BrowserID runs with arbitrary identity providers (IdPs), in the secondary mode
there is one IdP only, namely Mozilla's default IdP.
  We recently proposed an expressive general model for the web infrastructure
and, based on this web model, analyzed the security of the secondary IdP mode
of BrowserID. The analysis revealed several severe vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we complement our prior work by analyzing the even more
complex primary IdP mode of BrowserID. We do not only study authentication
properties as before, but also privacy properties. During our analysis we
discovered new and practical attacks that do not apply to the secondary mode:
an identity injection attack, which violates a central authentication property
of SSO systems, and attacks that break an important privacy promise of
BrowserID and which do not seem to be fixable without a major redesign of the
system. Some of our attacks on privacy make use of a browser side channel that
has not gained a lot of attention so far.
  For the authentication bug, we propose a fix and formally prove in a slight
extension of our general web model that the fixed system satisfies all the
requirements we consider. This constitutes the most complex formal analysis of
a web application based on an expressive model of the web infrastructure so
far.
  As another contribution, we identify and prove important security properties
of generic web features in the extended web model to facilitate future analysis
efforts of web standards and web applications.

to be spanning the gap between Galactic stellar-mass black holes and the
ultraluminous state, at X-ray luminosities $\approx (1$-$3) \times 10^{39}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ (a factor of two lower than in the 2010-2011 Chandra observations).
From its broadened disk-like spectral shape at that luminosity, and from the
fitted inner-disk radius and temperature, we argue that the accreting object is
an ordinary stellar-mass black hole with $M \sim$$10$-$20 M_{\odot}$. We
suggest that in the 2010-2011 Chandra observations, the source was seen at a
higher accretion rate, resulting in a power-law-dominated spectrum with a soft

a higher spectral efficiency (SE)) is possible at equal reach. By adopting

of jointly sharp preparation of pre- and post-selected quantum states for
measuring incompatible observables during the weak measurement. By defining a
suitable operator whose average in the pre-selected quantum state gives the
weak value, we show that one can have new uncertainty relations for variances
of two such operators corresponding to two non-commuting observables. These
generalize the recent stronger uncertainty relations that give non-trivial
lower bounds for the sum of variances of two observables which fully capture
the concept of incompatible observables. Furthermore, we show that weak values
for two non-commuting projection operators obey a complementarity relation.
Specifically, we show that for a pre-selected state if we measure a projector
corresponding to an observable $A$ weakly followed by the strong measurement of
another observable $B$ (for the post-selection) and, for the same pre-selected
state we measure a projector corresponding to an observable $B$ weakly followed
by the strong measurement of the observable $A$ (for the post-selection), then
the product of these two weak values is always less than one. This shows that
even though individually they are complex and can be large, their product is
always bounded.

structure of the spectral function, self-energy, and optical conductivity. We
discuss the deviations from the simple hybridization picture, which adequately
describes the overall band structure of the system (four quasiparticle branches
in the reduced Brillouin zone), but neglects all effects of the
inelastic-scattering processes. These lead to additional structure inside the
bands, in particular asymmetric resonances or dips that become more pronounced
in the strong-coupling regime close to the antiferromagnet-paramagnetic Kondo
insulator quantum phase transition. These features, which we name ""spin
resonances"", appear generically in all models where the $f$-orbital electrons
are itinerant (large Fermi surface) and there is N\'eel antiferromagnetic order
(staggered magnetization), such as periodic Anderson model and Kondo lattice
model with antiferromagneitc Kondo coupling, but are absent in
antiferromagnetic phases with localized $f$-orbital electrons (small Fermi
surface), such as the Kondo lattice model with ferromagnetic Kondo coupling. We
show that with increasing temperature and external magnetic-field the spin
resonances become suppressed at the same time as the staggered magnetization is
reduced. Optical conductivity $\sigma(\Omega)$ has a threshold associated with
the indirect gap, followed by a plateau of low conductivity and the main peak
associated with the direct gap, while the spin resonances are reflected as a
secondary peak or a hump close to the main optical peak. This work demonstrates
the utility of high-spectral-resolution impurity solvers to study the dynamical

$^{16}$O+$^{204}$Pb, $^{40}$Ar+$^{180}$Hf, $^{82}$Se+$^{138}$Ba,
$^{124}$Sn+$^{96}$Zr reactions are analyzed to study the entrance channel
effects by comparison of the capture, fusion and evaporation residue cross
sections calculated by the combined dinuclear system (DNS) and advanced
statistical models. The difference between evaporation residue (ER) cross
sections can be related to the stages of compound nucleus formation or/and at
its surviving against fission. The sensitivity of the both stages in the
evolution of DNS up to the evaporation residue formation to the angular
momentum of DNS is studied. The difference between fusion excitation functions
are explained by the hindrance to complete fusion due to the larger intrinsic
fusion barrier $B^*_{\rm fus}$ for the transformation of the DNS into a
compound nucleus and the increase of the quasifission contribution due to the
decreasing of quasifission barrier $B_{\rm qf}$ as a function of the angular
momentum. The largest value of the ER residue yields in the very mass
asymmetric $^{16}$O+$^{204}$Pb reaction is related to the large fusion
probability and to the relatively low threshold of the excitation energy of the
compound nucleus. Due to the large threshold of the excitation energy (35 MeV)
of the $^{40}$Ar+$^{180}$Hf reaction, it produces less the ER yields than the
almost mass symmetric $^{82}$Se+$^{138}$Ba reaction having the lowest threshold
value (12 MeV).

minimum factorization rank such that an exact NMF exists. In particular, we
disprove a conjecture on the nonnegative rank of a Kronecker product, propose a
new upper bound on the extension complexity of generic $n$-gons and conjecture

easier to comprehend and manually adapt when crossing the reality gap from

flight tests with the 20-gram DelFly Explorer flapping wing Micro Air Vehicle
equipped with a 4-gram onboard stereo vision system. The experiments show that
the DelFly can fully autonomously search for and fly through a window with only
its onboard sensors and processing. The success rate of the optimised behaviour
in simulation is 88% and the corresponding real-world performance is 54% after
user adaptation. Although this leaves room for improvement, it is higher than
the 46% success rate from a tuned user-defined controller.

included explicitly in the leading term, allowing for a large difference
between the longitudinal and transverse pressures as well as for non trivial
transverse dynamics. Energy and momentum conservation is expressed by the first
moment of the Boltzmann equation. The system of equations is closed by using
the zeroth and second moments of the Boltzmann equation. The
close-to-equilibrium matching with second-order viscous hydrodynamics is
demonstrated. In particular, I show that the coupling between shear and bulk

description of momentum anisotropy and bulk viscous dynamics, does not vanish
in the close-to-equilibrium limit.

Using group catalogues derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7

redshift. We investigate average galaxy stellar mass as a function of
group-centric radius and find evidence for weak mass segregation in SDSS
groups. The magnitude of the mass segregation depends on both galaxy stellar
mass limits and group halo mass. We show that the inclusion of low mass
galaxies tends to strengthen mass segregation trends, and that the strength of
mass segregation tends to decrease with increasing group halo mass. We find the
same trends if we use the fraction of massive galaxies as a function of
group-centric radius as an alternative probe of mass segregation. The magnitude
of mass segregation that we measure, particularly in high-mass haloes,
indicates that dynamical friction is not acting efficiently.

formation to investigate the sensitivity of hydrodynamical instabilities to
numerics, in particular, the hydro solver and the application of adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR). As a simple test problem, we consider an initially spherical
gas cloud in a wind, which is an idealized model for the merger of a subcluster
or galaxy with a big cluster. Based on an entropy criterion, we calculate the
mass stripping from the subcluster as a function of time. Moreover, the
turbulent velocity field is analyzed with a multi-scale filtering technique. We
find remarkable differences between the commonly used PPM solver with
directional splitting in the Enzo code and an unsplit variant of PPM in the Nyx
code, which demonstrates that different codes can converge to systematically
different solutions even when using uniform grids. For the test case of an
unbound cloud, AMR simulations reproduce uniform-grid results for the mass
stripping quite well, although the flow realizations can differ substantially.
If the cloud is bound by a static gravitational potential, however, we find
strong sensitivity to spurious fluctuations which are induced at the cutoff
radius of the potential and amplified by the bow shock. This gives rise to
substantial deviations between uniform-grid and AMR runs performed with Enzo,
while the mass stripping in Nyx simulations of the subcluster is nearly
independent of numerical resolution and AMR. Although many factors related to
numerics are involved, our study indicates that unsplit solvers with advanced
flux limiters help to reduce grid effects and to keep numerical noise under
control, which is important for hydrodynamical instabilities and turbulent
flows.

be more realistic while keeping with the Townsend-Perry attached eddy spectrum
is to add a new wavenumber range to the model at wavenumbers smaller than that
spectrum. This necessary addition can also account for the high Reynolds number
outer peak of the turbulent kinetic energy in the intermediate layer. An
analytic expression is obtained for this outer peak in agreement with extremely
high Reynolds number data by Hultmark, Vallikivi, Bailey & Smits (2012, 2013).
The finding of Dallas, Vassilicos & Hewitt (2009) that it is the eddy turnover
time and not the mean flow gradient which scales with distance to the wall and
skin friction velocity in the intermediate layer implies, when combined with
Townsend's (1976) production-dissipation balance, that the mean flow gradient
has an outer peak at the same location as the turbulent kinetic energy. This is
seen in the data of Hultmark, Vallikivi, Bailey & Smits (2012, 2013). The same
approach also predicts that the mean flow gradient has a logarithmic decay at
distances to the wall larger than the position of the outer peak, a qualitative
prediction which the aforementioned data also support.

spread of vaccination behavior in social networks, not as an isolated binary
opinion spreading on it, but as part of a process of cultural dissemination in
the spirit of Axelrod's model. We particularly focused on the impact of a small
anti-vaccination movement over an initial population of pro-vaccination social
agents. Additionally, we have considered two classes of edges in the underlying
social network: personal edges able to spread both opinions and diseases; and
the non-personal ones representing interactions mediated by information
technologies, which only allow opinion exchanges. We study the clustering of
unvaccinated agents as a dynamical outcome of the model, together with its
direct relation with the increase of the probability of occurrence and the
final size of measles outbreaks. Finally, we illustrate the mitigating effect

harmful action of anti-vaccination movements. We show that the topological
