  First we show that representation embeddings between categories of modules of
finite-dimensional algebras induce embeddings of lattices of pp formulas and
hence are non-decreasing on Krull-Gabriel dimension and uniserial dimension. A
consequence is that the category of modules of any wild finite-dimensional
algebra has width $\infty$ and hence, if the algebra is countable, there is a
superdecomposable pure-injective representation.
  It is conjectured that a stronger result is true: that a representation
embedding from ${\rm Mod}\mbox{-}S$ to ${\rm Mod}\mbox{-}R$ admits an inverse
interpretation functor from its image and hence that, in this case, ${\rm
Mod}\mbox{-}R$ interprets ${\rm Mod}\mbox{-}S$. This would imply, for instance,
that every wild category of modules interprets the (undecidable) word problem
for (semi)groups. We show that the conjecture holds for finitely controlled
representation embeddings.

algebraically closed field and $I:{\rm Mod}\mbox{-}R\rightarrow{\rm
Mod}\mbox{-}S$ is an interpretation functor such that the smallest definable
subcategory containing the image of $I$ is the whole of ${\rm Mod}\mbox{-}S$

explore the existence of equal-time relations in the soft limit which, on the
other hand, depend on the interplay between soft and hard modes. We scrutinize
two approaches in the literature: The time-flow formalism, and a background
method where the soft mode is absorbed into a locally curved cosmology. The
latter has been recently used to set up (angular averaged) `equal-time
consistency relations'. We explicitly demonstrate that the time-flow relations
and `equal-time consistency conditions' are only fulfilled at the linear level,
and fail at next-to-leading order for an Einstein de-Sitter universe. While
applied to the velocities both proposals break down beyond leading order, we
find that the `equal-time consistency conditions' quantitatively approximates
the perturbative results for the density contrast. Thus, we generalize the
background method to properly incorporate the effect of curvature in the
density and velocity fluctuations on short scales, and discuss the reasons
behind this discrepancy. We conclude with a few comments on practical
implementations and future directions.

microscopy with the high resolution of electron microscopy and other microscopy
technologies. Image registration for correlative microscopy is quite
challenging because it is a multi-modal, multi-scale and multi-dimensional
registration problem. In this report, I introduce two methods of image
registration for correlative microscopy. The first method is based on fiducials
(beads). I generate landmarks from the fiducials and compute the similarity
transformation matrix based on three pairs of nearest corresponding landmarks.
A least-squares matching process is applied afterwards to further refine the
registration. The second method is inspired by the image analogies approach. I
introduce the sparse representation model into image analogies. I first train
representative image patches (dictionaries) for pre-registered datasets from
two different modalities, and then I use the sparse coding technique to
transfer a given image to a predicted image from one modality to another based
on the learned dictionaries. The final image registration is between the
predicted image and the original image corresponding to the given image in the
different modality. The method transforms a multi-modal registration problem to
a mono-modal one. I test my approaches on Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) and confocal microscopy images. Experimental results of the methods are
also shown in this report.

photocurrent multiplication through impact ionization in reverse-biased p-n

allowing for photon energy discrimination, while in Geiger mode of operation
the multiplication gain is virtually infinite and a self-sustaining avalanche

varieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic
group. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into
the picture as examples of rational K(H,1)'s, through Teichmueller theory. The
main thrust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)'s the study of
moduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical
results concerning regularity of classifying maps. The Inoue type varieties of
Bauer and Catanese are introduced and studied as a key example, and new results

regions is a promising site for planet formation because solids may become
trapped at the interface itself or in vortices generated by the Rossby wave
instability. The disk thermodynamics and the turbulent dynamics at that
location are entwined because of the importance of turbulent dissipation on
thermal ionization and, conversely, of thermal ionisation on the turbulence.
However, most previous work has neglected this dynamical coupling and have thus
missed a key element of the physics in this region. In this paper, we aim to
determine how the the interplay between ionization and turbulence impacts on
the formation and evolution of vortices at the interface between the active and
the dead zones. Using the Godunov code RAMSES, we have performed a 3D
magnetohydrodynamic global numerical simulation of a cylindrical model of an
MRI--turbulent protoplanetary disk, including thermodynamical effects as well
as a temperature-dependant resistivity. The comparison with an analogous 2D
viscous simulation has been extensively used to help identify the relevant
physical processes and the disk's long-term evolution. We find that a vortex
formed at the interface, due to Rossby wave instability, migrates inward and
penetrates the active zone where it is destroyed by turbulent motions.
Subsequently, a new vortex emerges a few tens of orbits later at the interface,
and the new vortex migrates inward too. The sequence repeats itself, resulting
in cycles of vortex formation, migration, and disruption. This behavior is
successfully reproduced using two different codes. In this paper, we
characterize this vortex life cycle and discuss its implications for planet
formation at the dead/active interface. Our simulations highlight the
importance of thermodynamical processes for the vortex evolution at the dead
zone inner edge.

previously bound to a complementary substrate strand, is an essential mechanism
in active nucleic acid nanotechnology and has also been hypothesized to occur
in vivo. We study the rate of displacement reactions as a function of the
length of the toehold and temperature and make two experimentally testable
predictions: that the displacement is faster if the toehold is placed at the 5'
end of the substrate and that the displacement slows down with increasing
temperature for longer toeholds.

evolution of three MBPs. This reveals that individual features follow
different, generally complex, and rather dynamic scenarios of evolution. Next
we apply statistical methods on roughly 200 observed MBP evolutionary tracks.
MBPs are found to be formed by the strengthening of an equipartition field
patch, which initially exhibits a moderate downflow. During the evolution,
strong downdrafts with an average velocity of 2.4 km/s set in. These flows,
taken together with the concurrent strengthening of the field, suggest that we
are witnessing the occurrence of convective collapses in these features,
although only 30% of them reach kG field strengths. This fraction might turn
out to be larger when the new 4 m class solar telescopes are operational as
observations of MBPs with current state of the art instrumentation could still
be suffering from resolution limitations. Finally, when the bright point
disappears (although the magnetic field often continues to exist) the magnetic
field strength has dropped to the equipartition level and is generally somewhat
weaker than at the beginning of the MBP's evolution. Noteworthy is that in
about 10% of the cases we observe in the vicinity of the downflows small-scale
strong (exceeding 2 km/s) intergranular upflows related spatially and
temporally to these downflows.

their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. We
also review the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on
spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the

measurements of the spin Hall angle. We further connect the spin-current
generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect, which often
accompanies the SHE, in which an electrical current induces a non-equilibrium
spin polarization. These effects share common microscopic origins and can
exhibit similar symmetries when present in ferromagnetic/non-magnetic

accretion discs on time-scales of several millions of years. Small dust
particles stick to each other to form pebbles, pebbles concentrate in the
turbulent flow to form planetesimals and planetary embryos and grow to planets,
which undergo substantial radial migration. All these processes are influenced
by the underlying structure of the protoplanetary disc, specifically the
profiles of temperature, gas scale height and density. The commonly used disc
structure of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebular (MMSN) is a simple power law in all
these quantities. However, protoplanetary disc models with both viscous and
stellar heating show several bumps and dips in temperature, scale height and
density caused by transitions in opacity, which are missing in the MMSN model.
These play an important role in the formation of planets, as they can act as
sweet spots for the formation of planetesimals via the streaming instability
and affect the direction and magnitude of type-I-migration. We present 2D
simulations of accretion discs that feature radiative cooling, viscous and
stellar heating, and are linked to the observed evolutionary stages of
protoplanetary discs and their host stars. These models allow us to identify
preferred planetesimal and planet formation regions in the protoplanetary disc
as a function of the disc's metallicity, accretion rate and lifetime. We derive
simple fitting formulae that feature all structural characteristics of
protoplanetary discs during the evolution of several Myr. These fits are
straightforward to apply for modelling any growth stage of planets where
detailed knowledge of the underlying disc structure is required.

force dipole tensor per unit volume in both continuum and discrete linear
homogeneous media of arbitrary geometries. This relationship is conserved on
average in the presence of disorder, but can be violated in nonlinear elastic

results on semigroups (such as Szemer\'edi's theorem) and this can often be
done using methods of ergodic Ramsey theory. What usually lies at the heart of
such proofs is that, for actions of semigroups, a certain kind of one
recurrence (mixing along a filter) amplifies itself to multiple recurrence.
This amplification is proved using a so-called van der Corput difference lemma
for a suitable filter on the semigroup. Particular instances of this lemma (for
concrete filters) have been proven before (by Furstenberg,
Bergelson--McCutcheon, and others), with a somewhat different proof in each
case. We define a notion of differentiation for subsets of semigroups and
isolate the class of filters that respect this notion. The filters in this
class (call them $\partial$-filters) include all those for which the van der
Corput lemma was known, and our main result is a van der Corput lemma for
$\partial$-filters, which thus generalizes all its previous instances. This is

However, the offloaded users suffer from strong inter-tier interference, which

the system performance. In this paper, we investigate an interference nulling
(IN) scheme in improving the system performance by carefully managing the
inter-tier interference to the offloaded users in downlink two-tier HetNets

first derive a tractable expression for the rate coverage probability of the IN

i.e., the degrees of freedom that can be used for IN, to maximize the rate
coverage probability. Finally, we analyze the rate coverage probabilities of
the simple offloading scheme without interference management and the
multi-antenna version of the almost blank subframes (ABS) scheme in 3GPP LTE,
and compare the performance of the IN scheme with these two schemes. Both
analytical and numerical results show that the IN scheme can achieve good
performance gains over both of these two schemes, especially in the large

optimization problems. As a result, it is common to approximate the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE) using convex relaxations. In some cases, the
relaxation is tight: it recovers the true MLE. Most tightness proofs only apply
to situations where the MLE exactly recovers a planted solution (known to the
analyst). It is then sufficient to establish that the optimality conditions
hold at the planted signal. In this paper, we study an estimation problem
(angular synchronization) for which the MLE is not a simple function of the
planted solution, yet for which the convex relaxation is tight. To establish
tightness in this context, the proof is less direct because the point at which
to verify optimality conditions is not known explicitly.
  Angular synchronization consists in estimating a collection of $n$ phases,
given noisy measurements of the pairwise relative phases. The MLE for angular
synchronization is the solution of a (hard) non-bipartite Grothendieck problem
over the complex numbers. We consider a stochastic model for the data: a
planted signal (that is, a ground truth set of phases) is corrupted with
non-adversarial random noise. Even though the MLE does not coincide with the
planted signal, we show that the classical semidefinite relaxation for it is
tight, with high probability. This holds even for high levels of noise.

singlet vertex operator algebras, and connect several important concepts in the
theory of vertex operator algebras, quantum modular forms, and modular tensor
categories. More precisely, starting from explicit formulae for characters of
modules over the singlet vertex operator algebra, which can be expressed in
terms of false theta functions and their derivatives, we first deform these
characters by using a complex parameter {\epsilon}. We then apply modular
trans- formation properties of regularised partial theta functions to study
asymptotic behaviour of regularised characters of irreducible modules and
compute their regularised quantum dimensions. We also give a purely geometric
description of the regularisation parameter as a uniformisation parameter of
the fusion variety coming from atypical blocks. It turns out that the quantum
dimensions behave very differently depending on the sign of the real part of
{\epsilon}. The map from the space of characters equipped with the Verlinde
product to the space of regularised quantum dimensions turns out to be a
genuine ring isomorphism for positive real part of {\epsilon} while for
sufficiently negative real part of {\epsilon} its surjective image gives the
fusion ring of a rational vertex operator algebra. The category of modules of
this rational vertex operator algebra should be viewed as obtained through the
process of a semi-simplification procedure widely used in the theory of quantum
groups. Interestingly, the modular tensor category structure constants of this
vertex operator algebra, can be also detected from vector valued quantum
modular forms formed by distinguished atypical characters.

temperatures and densities, a scenario that may be tested in heavy ion
collisions. Analytical studies with effective models suggest that QCD may break
parity in dense systems. Besides, P- and CP- odd bubbles may appear in a finite
volume due to local large topological fluctuations in a hot medium. The last
effect may be treated in a quasi-equilibrium description by means of a
non-trivial axial chemical potential. We consider the 'two flavour'
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in the presence of a vector and an axial external
chemical potentials and study the phase structure of the model at zero
temperature. These magnitudes could trigger a phase where parity could be
broken in QCD. Analogies and differences with the expected behaviour in QCD are
discussed besides the limitations of the model. We also consider the low energy
realization of QCD in terms of mesons when an axial chemical potential is
present. The eigenstates of strong interactions do not have a definite parity
and interactions that would otherwise be forbidden compete with the familiar
ones. We focus on scalars and pseudoscalars that are described by a generalized
linear sigma model. Finally, we investigate how local parity breaking may
affect vector physics. A modified dispersion relation is derived for the
lightest vector mesons rho and omega. This effect predicts a natural
overproduction of lepton pairs in the vicinity of the rho-omega resonance peak
as well as a polarization asymmetry around this peak. The dilepton excess seems
relevant to explain the anomalous dielectron yield quoted by PHENIX/STAR. We
present a detailed analysis of the angular distribution associated to the
lepton pairs created from these mesons searching for polarization dependencies.
Two angular variables are found to carry the main information related to the
parity-breaking effect.

comparing them to observational constraints. Our resulting mock galaxy
catalogues manage to reproduce the observed local galaxy luminosity function

function of luminosity and colour. In order to achieve that, the algorithm also
includes scatter in the halo mass - galaxy luminosity relation derived from
direct SHAM and a modified NFW mass density profile to place satellite galaxies
in their host dark matter haloes. Improving on general usage of the HOD that
fits the clustering for given magnitude limited samples, our catalogues are
constructed to fit observations at all luminosities considered and therefore
for any luminosity subsample. Overall, our algorithm is an economic procedure

we study a 4-dimensional model with chaotic dynamics and SO(2) symmetry similar
to those that appear in fluid dynamics problems. A crucial step in the analysis
of such a system is symmetry reduction. We use the model to illustrate
different symmetry-reduction techniques. Its relative equilibria are
conveniently determined by rewriting the dynamics in terms of a
symmetry-invariant polynomial basis. However, for the analysis of its chaotic
dynamics, the `method of slices', which is applicable to very high-dimensional
problems, is preferable. We show that a Poincar\'e section taken on the `slice'
can be used to further reduce this flow to what is for all practical purposes a
unimodal map. This enables us to systematically determine all relative periodic
orbits and their symbolic dynamics up to any desired period. We then present
cycle averaging formulas adequate for systems with continuous symmetry and use
them to compute dynamical averages using relative periodic orbits. The
convergence of such computations is discussed.

possibility of extracting the deuteron momentum distribution. This extraction

models as input.
  Purpose: We present a new method for extracting the momentum distribution
which takes into account a wide variety of model inputs thus providing a
theoretical uncertainty due to the various model constituents.
  Method: The calculations presented here are using a Bethe-Salpeter like
formalism with a wide variety of bound state wave functions, form factors, and
final state interactions. We present a method to extract the momentum
distributions from experimental cross sections, which takes into account the
theoretical uncertainty from the various model constituents entering the
calculation.
  Results: In order to test the extraction pseudo-data was generated, and the
extracted ""experimental"" distribution, which has theoretical uncertainty from
the various model inputs, was compared with the theoretical distribution used
to generate the pseudo-data.
  Conclusions: In the examples we compared, the original distribution was
typically within the error band of the extracted distribution. The input wave
functions do contain some outliers which are discussed in the text, but at
least this procedure can provide an upper bound on the deuteron momentum
distribution. Due to the reliance on the theoretical calculation to obtain this
quantity any extraction method should account for the theoretical error
inherent in these calculations due to model inputs.

Although elusive for direct searches, these theories predict modified couplings

determine relationships among them. Current dense subgraph finding algorithms
usually optimize some objective, and only find a few such subgraphs without
providing any structural relations. We define the nucleus decomposition of a
graph, which represents the graph as a forest of nuclei. Each nucleus is a
subgraph where smaller cliques are present in many larger cliques. The forest
of nuclei is a hierarchy by containment, where the edge density increases as we
proceed towards leaf nuclei. Sibling nuclei can have limited intersections,
which enables discovering overlapping dense subgraphs. With the right
parameters, the nucleus decomposition generalizes the classic notions of
k-cores and k-truss decompositions. We give provably efficient algorithms for
nucleus decompositions, and empirically evaluate their behavior in a variety of
real graphs. The tree of nuclei consistently gives a global, hierarchical
snapshot of dense substructures, and outputs dense subgraphs of higher quality
than other state-of-the-art solutions. Our algorithm can process graphs with
tens of millions of edges in less than an hour.

than at Tcond=1000 K, as obtained by models that include chemisputtering. From
the analysis of the total dust ejecta, we find that the total dust-to-gas

usually assumed. In a broader context, our results are suitable to study the
dust enrichment of the interstellar medium provided by TP-AGB stars in both

  We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate
such linguistic property time series, the culmination of which uses
distributional characteristics inferred from word co-occurrences. Using
recently proposed deep neural language models, we first train vector
representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp the vector
spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a
distance-based distributional time series for each word to track it's
linguistic displacement over time.
  We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change

a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon, and a century of written books using the

briefly touching on normal-form and poly-matrix games. The main technical
contribution is a representation theorem that informally states that to account
for every exact Nash equilibrium using a nearby approximate Nash equilibrium on
a grid over mixed strategies, a uniform discretization size linear on the
inverse of the approximation quality and natural game-representation parameters
suffices. For graphical games, under natural conditions, the discretization is
logarithmic in the game-representation size, a substantial improvement over the
linear dependency previously required. The paper has five other objectives: (1)
given the venue, to highlight the important, but often ignored, role that work
on constraint networks in AI has in simplifying the derivation and analysis of
algorithms for computing approximate Nash equilibria; (2) to summarize the
state-of-the-art on computing approximate Nash equilibria, with emphasis on

sparse-discretization and sparse-support techniques; (4) to illustrate and
advocate for the deliberate mathematical simplicity of the formal proof of the

Two models are presented where the anomalous symmetry manifests itself in the
IR in different ways. In the first model there are massless bifundamental

this model, the $\eta'$ boson relaxes the QCD theta angle to the difference
between the two theta angles - in this case zero. In the second model, the
anomalous U(1) symmetry is realized in the IR as a dynamically generated mass
term that has exactly the phase needed to cancel the theta angle. Both of these
models make the extremely concrete prediction that there exist new colored

traversing particles. Due to the long exposure time of AMS-02 of many years the
measurement of momentum for protons and ions is limited systematically by the
spatial resolution and magnetic field strength of the silicon tracker. The
maximum detectable rigidity for protons is about 1.8~TV, for helium about
3.6~TV. We investigate the possibility to extend the range of the energy
measurement for heavy nuclei ($Z\geq2$) with the transition radiation detector
(TRD). The response function of the TRD shows a steep increase in signal from
the level of ionization at a Lorentz factor $\gamma$ of about 500 to
$\gamma\approx20000$, where the transition radiation signal saturates. For
heavy ions the signal fluctuations in the TRD are sufficiently small to allow
an energy measurement with the TRD beyond the limitations of the tracker. The
energy resolution of the TRD is determined and reaches a level of about 20\%
for boron ($Z=5$). After adjusting the operational parameters of the TRD a
measurement of boron and carbon could be possible up to 5~TeV/nucleon.

presence of an applied chemical potential, $\mu$, at a non-zero temperature,
$T$, and allow us to describe the crossover from `strange metal' physics at $T

an extra gauge field and exploits structure of the Einstein-Maxwell system to
manifestly find 1-parameter families of solutions of the Einstein-matter system
in terms of a small family of functions, obeying a nested set of differential
equations. Using these interpolating geometries, we re-consider holographically
some recent questions of interest about hyperscaling-violating field theories.
Our focus is a more detailed holographic computation of the conductivity of
strange metals, weakly perturbed by disorder coupled to scalar operators,
including both the average conductivity as well as sample-to-sample
fluctuations. Our findings are consistent with previous scaling arguments,
though we point out logarithmic corrections in some special (holographic)

analyze Spitzer mid-IR data of SN 2014J in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}m wavelength

the first composite mid-IR light-curve templates from our sample of SNe~Ia,

observations indicate that SNe Ia form a very homogeneous class of objects at
these wavelengths. Using the low-reddening supernovae for comparison, we
constrain possible thermal emission from circumstellar dust around the highly
reddened SN 2014J. We also study SNe 2006X and 2007le, where the presence of
matter in the circumstellar environment has been suggested. No significant
mid-IR excess is detected, allowing us to place upper limits on the amount of
pre-existing dust in the circumstellar environment. For SN 2014J, $M_{dust} <

the estimation of colors, and we find an excess reddening induced by foreground
galaxies at a level ranging from 10 to 0.5 millimagnitudes on scales ranging

dust around galaxies similar to the findings of Menard et al. 2010. We find
that circumgalactic reddening is a weak function of stellar mass over the range
$6 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ -- $6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and note that this

class of translational-invariant insulators without spin-orbit coupling. These
may be realized in intrinsically spinless systems such as photonic crystals and
ultra-cold atoms. Some of these insulators have no time-reversal symmetry as
well, i.e., the relevant symmetries are purely crystalline. Nevertheless,
topological phases exist which are distinguished by their robust surface modes.
To describe these phases, we introduce the notions of (a) a halved-mirror
chirality: an integer invariant which characterizes half-mirror planes in the
3D Brillouin zone, and (b) a bent Chern number: the traditional
Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs invariant generalized to bent 2D manifolds.
Like other well-known topological phases, their band topology is unveiled by
the crystalline analog of Berry phases, i.e., parallel transport across certain
non-contractible loops in the Brillouin zone. We also identify certain
topological phases without any robust surface modes - they are uniquely
distinguished by parallel transport along bent loops, whose shapes are
determined by the symmetry group. Finally, we describe the Weyl semimetallic
phase that intermediates two distinct, gapped phases.

decline in the values of phi and of alpha with higher redshifts, and a nearly
constant M* up to z~3. We divide the galaxy stellar mass function by colour,
structure, and environment and explore the links between environmental
over-density, morphology, and the quenching of star formation. We find that a
double Schechter function describes galaxies with high Sersic index (n>2.5),
similar to galaxies which are red or passive. The low-mass end of the n>2.5
stellar mass function is dominated by blue galaxies, whereas the high-mass end
is dominated by red galaxies. This hints that possible links between
morphological evolution and star formation quenching are only present in
high-mass galaxies. This is turn suggests that there are strong mass dependent
quenching mechanisms. In addition, we find that the number density of high mass

operators up to dimension 6 which are generated at the mass scale of particles
mediating DM interactions with the SM. We perform a one-loop Renormalization

our results to models with DM velocity-suppressed interactions, DM couplings
only to heavy quarks, leptophilic DM and Higgs portal, which without our
analysis would not get constrained from direct detection bounds. Remarkably, a
large parameter space region for these models is found to be excluded as a
consequence of spin-independent couplings induced by SM loops. In addition to
these examples, we stress that more general renormalizable models for singlet
fermion WIMP can be matched onto our EFT framework, and the subsequent
model-independent RGE can be used to compute direct detection rates. Our
results allow us to properly connect the different energy scales involved in

(M$_{*}\sim10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$), dusty ($A_{V}\sim 1.2$) star-forming galaxy at
z=1.78. The star formation rate calculated from the H$\alpha$ luminosity
(35.6-47.0 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is typical among GRB host galaxies (and
star-forming galaxies generally) at z $>$1; however, the specific star
formation rate is lower than normal star-forming galaxies at redshift $\sim$
1.6, in contrast to the high specific star formation rates measured for many of
other GRB hosts. The metallicity of the host is estimated to be
12+log(O/H)$_{\rm KK04}$$=$8.88. We emphasize that this is one of the most
massive distant host galaxies for which metallcity is measured with
emission-line diagnostics. The metallicity is fairly high among GRB hosts.
However, this is still lower than the metallicity of normal star-forming
galaxies of the same mass at z$\sim$1.6. The metallicity offset from normal
star-forming galaxies is close to a typical value of other GRB hosts and
indicates that GRB host galaxies are uniformly biased toward low metalicity
over a wide range of redshift and stellar mass. The low-metallicity nature of
the GRB 080325 host is likely not attributable to the fundamental metallicity
relation of star-forming galaxies beacuse it is a metal-poor outlier from the

the mechanism that produced this GRB.

characterized by means of near-infrared photometric, astrometric, and
spectroscopic studies. H-band methane images were collected for all three
sources and an additional sample of 15 field T type dwarfs using LIRIS/WHT.
J-band spectra of resolution of ~500 were obtained for SOriJ0538-0213 with
ISAAC/VLT, and JH spectra of resolution of ~50 acquired with WFC3/HST were
employed for the spectroscopic classification of SOri70 and 73. Proper motions
with a typical uncertainty of +/-3 mas/yr and a time interval of ~7-9 yr were
derived. Using the LIRIS observations of the field T dwarfs, we calibrated this
imager for T spectral typing via methane photometry. The three SOri objects
were spectroscopically classified as T4.5+/-0.5 (SOri73), T5+/-0.5
(SOriJ0538-0213), and T7$^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ (SOri70). The similarity between the
observed JH spectra and the methane colors and the data of field ultra-cool
dwarfs of related classifications suggests that SOri70, 73, and
SOriJ053804.65-021352.5 do not deviate significantly in surface gravity in
relation to the field. Additionally, the detection of KI at ~1.25 microns in
SOriJ0538-0213 points to a high-gravity atmosphere. Only the K-band reddish
nature of SOri70 may be consistent with a low gravity atmosphere. The proper
motions of SOri70 and 73 are measurable and are larger than that of the cluster
by >3.5 sigma. The proper motion of SOriJ0538-0213 is consistent with a null
displacement. These observations suggest that none of the three T dwarfs are
likely Sigma Orionis members, and that either planetary-mass objects with
masses below ~4 MJup may not exist free-floating in the cluster or they may lie
at fainter near-infrared magnitudes than those of the targets (this is H>20.6
mag), thus remaining unidentified to date.

which is considered to be one of the causes of Parkinson's disease. This
protein forms amyloid fibrils when in a highly concentrated solution. The
fibril formation of {\alpha}-syn is induced not only by increases in
{\alpha}-syn concentration but also by macromolecular crowding. In order to
investigate the coupled effect of the intrinsic disorder of {\alpha}-syn and
macromolecular crowding, we construct a lattice gas model of {\alpha}-syn in
contact with a crowding agent reservoir based on statistical mechanics. The
main assumption is that {\alpha}-syn can be expressed as coarse-grained
particles with internal states coupled with effective volume; and disordered
states are modeled by larger particles with larger internal entropy than other
states. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, we can exactly calculate the
number of conformations of crowding agents, and this enables us to prove that
the original grand canonical ensemble with a crowding agent reservoir is
mathematically equivalent to a canonical ensemble without crowding agents. In
this expression, the effect of macromolecular crowding is absorbed in the
internal entropy of disordered states; it is clearly shown that the crowding
effect reduces the internal entropy. Based on Monte Carlo simulation, we
provide scenarios of crowding-induced fibril formation. We also discuss the
recent controversy over the existence of helically folded tetramers of
{\alpha}-syn, and suggest that macromolecular crowding is the key to resolving
the controversy.

Asymptotic and numerical solutions are presented for the system governing the

derive the conditions for this phenomena, which depend on the spatial

various causes including bars, nuclear outflows, or gravitational disturbances.
Several galaxies have signatures of kinematically distinct stellar components,

Blocking may be essential to deal with near conformal situations. Typically,
blocking methods have smaller statistical errors but larger systematic errors
than sampling methods. This situation is evolving with recent developments
based on the Tensor RG (TRG) method. We report recent results for spin and
gauge lattice models obtained with this new method regarding searches for fixed

mass is lower than any other excited spin-1/2 baryon. Dalitz and co-workers
speculated that it might be a molecular state of an antikaon bound to a
nucleon. However, a standard quark-model structure is also admissible. Although
the intervening years have seen considerable effort, there has been no
convincing resolution. Here we present a new lattice QCD simulation showing
that the strange magnetic form factor of the Lambda(1405) vanishes, signaling
the formation of an antikaon-nucleon molecule. Together with a Hamiltonian
effective-field-theory model analysis of the lattice QCD energy levels, this
strongly suggests that the structure is dominated by a bound antikaon-nucleon
component. This result clarifies that not all states occurring in nature can be
described within a simple quark model framework and points to the existence of
exotic molecular meson-nucleon bound states.

estimate BH masses in a sample of ULXs with XMM-Newton observations using two
different mass indicators, the X-ray photon index and X-ray variability
amplitude based on the correlations established for active galactic nuclei

those from X-ray photon indices for ULXs with lower luminosities. This suggests
that these ULXs generally accrete at rates different from those of X-ray
luminous AGNs, or they have different power spectral densities of X-ray
variability. We conclude that most of ULXs accrete at super-Eddington rate,

displacement field. While the Basic DIC and VIC 2D are faster, the Extended DIC
delivers the best accuracy of strain reconstruction. The speckle pattern is
found to be playing a critical role in achieving high accuracy for DIC.
Increase in subset size for DIC does not significantly improves the accuracy,

below the resonance energy of the bare exciton state, it has been considered
that an exciton-polariton is created immediately by the scattering process,
because there is no exciton level at that energy. However, according to the
recent time-resolved measurements of P emission originating from inelastic
exciton-exciton scattering, it looks rather natural to consider that the
exciton-polariton is created in a finite time scale which is restricted by a
coherence volume of the exciton after the scattering. In this interpretation,
the exciton remains in this time scale far below its resonance energy as a
transient state in a series of processes. We propose an expression of the
P-emission lifetime depending on the coherence volume of the scattered excitons
through the conversion process from them to the polaritons. The coherence
volume of the scattered excitons appears in the calculation of the inelastic

bottleneck excitons.Time-resolved optical-gain measurements could be a way for
investigating the validity of our interpretation.

one component of Ebola dynamics that is of growing concern -- the transmission
of Ebola from the dead to the living. We do so by applying the toolkit of
mathematical epidemiology to analyze the consequences of post-death
transmission. We show that underlying disease parameters cannot be inferred
with confidence from early-stage incidence data (that is, they are not
""identifiable"") because different parameter combinations can produce virtually
the same epidemic trajectory. Despite this identifiability problem, we find
robustly that inferences that don't account for post-death transmission tend to
underestimate the basic reproductive number -- thus, given the observed rate of
epidemic growth, larger amounts of post-death transmission imply larger
reproductive numbers. From a control perspective, we explain how improvements
in reducing post-death transmission of Ebola may reduce the overall epidemic
spread and scope substantially. Increased attention to the proportion of
post-death transmission has the potential to aid both in projecting the course
of the epidemic and in evaluating a portfolio of control strategies.

in a wider, two-component jet; a cylindrically shaped outer jet surrounding a

However, for the initially most open magnetic field configuration the kink mode
creates a narrow corkscrew-like jet without a clear Keplerian rotation profile

aperture masking interferometry (AMI) has yielded images of faint
protoplanetary companions of nearby stars from the ground. AMI on James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST)'s Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph
(NIRISS) has a lower thermal background than ground-based facilites and does
not suffer from atmospheric instability. NIRISS AMI images are likely to have
90 - 95% Strehl ratio between 2.77 and 4.8 micron. In this paper we quantify
factors that limit the raw point source contrast of JWST NRM. We develop an
analytic model of the NRM point spread function which includes different
optical path delays (pistons) between mask holes and fit the model parameters
with image plane data. It enables a straightforward way to exclude bad pixels,
is suited to limited fields of view, and can incorporate effects such as
intra-pixel sensitivity variations. We simulate various sources of noise to
estimate their effect on the standard deviation of closure phase, sigma_CP (a
proxy for binary point source contrast). If sigma_CP < 10^-4 radians --- a
contrast ratio of 10 magnitudes --- young accreting gas giant planets (e.g. in
the nearby Taurus star-forming region) could be imaged with JWST NIRISS. We
show the feasibility of using NIRISS' NRM with the sub-Nyquist sampled F277W,
which would enable some exoplanet chemistry characterization. In the presence
of small piston errors, the dominant sources of closure phase error (depending
on pixel sampling, and filter bandwidth) are flat field errors and unmodeled
variations in intra-pixel sensitivity. The in-flight stability of NIRISS will
determine how well these errors can be calibrated by observing a point source.
Our results help develop efficient observing strategies for space-based NRM.

around 2012 November--December, XSS J12270-4859 has recently been identified
as, in addition to PSR J1023+0038, another transitional millisecond pulsar
binary. We have carried out detailed analysis of the Fermi Large Area Telescope
data for the binary. While both spectra before and after the disk-disappearance
transition are well described by an exponentially cut-off power law, typical
for pulsars' emission in the Fermi's 0.2-300 GeV, a factor of 2 flux decrease
related to the transition is detected. A weak orbital modulation is seen, but
only detectable in the after-transition data, same to that found at X-rays. In
the long-term light curve of the source before the transition, a factor of 3
flux variations are seen. Comparing to the properties of J1023+0038, we disucss
the implications from these results. We suggest that since the modulation is
aligned with that at X-rays in orbital phase, it possibly arises due to the
occultation of the gamma-ray emitting region by the companion. The origin of
the variations in the long-term light curve is not clear, because the source
field also contains unidentified radio or X-ray sources and their contamination
can not be excluded. Multi-wavelength observations of the source field will
help identify the origin of the variations by detecting any related flux
changes from the in-field sources.

million years ago in the harsh environment of the Galactic center (GC), has
long been a target of interest to those who study the GC and the theory of star
formation. The distinct star-forming conditions in the GC might have caused the
cluster to have a shallower slope or an elevated lower mass cutoff in its IMF.
But its mass function has been revealed only down to 1-2 Msun (the lower limit
of resolved stars), and the low- end mass function of the Arches is still
unknown. To estimate the unresolved part of the Arches mass function, we have
devised a novel photometric method that involves the histogram of pixel
intensities in the observed image, which contains information on the
unresolved, faint stars. By comparing the pixel intensity histograms (PIHs) of
numerous artificial images constructed from model IMFs with the observed PIH,
we find that the best-fit model IMF for the Arches cluster has a cutoff mass
less than or similar to 0.1 Msun and a shape very close to that of the Kroupa
MF. Our findings imply that the IMF of the Arches cluster is similar to those
found in the Galactic disk.

hierarchy problem in the Higgs sector and the dark matter in the Universe. The
discovery of a Higgs boson with mass of about 125 GeV was clearly the most
significant piece of news from CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition
to representing the ultimate triumph of the SM, it shed new light on the
hierarchy problem and opened up new ways of probing new physics. The various
measurements performed at Run I of the LHC constrain the Higgs couplings to SM
particles as well as invisible and undetected decays. In this thesis, the
impact of the LHC Higgs results on various new physics scenarios is assessed,
carefully taking into account uncertainties and correlations between them.
Generic modifications of the Higgs coupling strengths, possibly arising from
extended Higgs sectors or higher-dimensional operators, are considered.
Furthermore, specific new physics models are tested. This includes, in
particular, the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. While a
Higgs boson has been found, no sign of beyond the SM physics was observed at
Run I of the LHC in spite of the large number of searches performed by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The implications of the negative results obtained
in these searches constitute another important part of this thesis. First,
supersymmetric models with a dark matter candidate are investigated in light of
the negative searches for supersymmetry at the LHC using a so-called
""simplified model"" approach. Second, tools using simulated events to constrain
any new physics scenario from the LHC results are presented. Moreover, during
this thesis the selection criteria of several beyond the SM analyses have been
reimplemented in the MadAnalysis 5 framework and made available in a public

the computational hardness of continuous numerical problems

complexity $n(\epsilon,S_d)$ as a function of the accuracy $\epsilon$ and the
dimension $d$. By now a lot of effort was spend on either proving quantitative
positive results (such as, e.g., the concrete dependence on $\epsilon$ and $d$
within the well-established framework of polynomial tractability), or on
qualitative negative results (which, e.g., state that a given problem suffers
from the so-called curse of dimensionality). Although several weaker types of
tractability were introduced recently, the theory of information-based
complexity still lacks a notion which allows to quantify the exact
(sub-/super-)exponential dependence of $n(\epsilon,S_d)$ on both parameters
$\epsilon$ and $d$. In this paper we present the notion of $(s,t)$-weak
tractability which attempts to fill this gap. Within this new framework the

polynomially intractable problems. For linear, compact operators between
Hilbert spaces we provide characterizations of $(s,t)$-weak tractability w.r.t.

the energy in short-wavelength spinwaves. Additionally, this process can lead
to switching of the vortex polarization through the injection of a Bloch point.

intermittency, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to estimate the degree of
intermittency, and the Fourier transform to estimate the power spectral
densities of these fluctuations. Density fluctuations within fast wind are
rather intermittent and their level of intermittency, together with the
amplitude of intermittent events, decreases with distance from the Sun, at odds
with intermittency of both magnetic field and all the other plasma parameters.
Furthermore, the intermittent events are strongly correlated, exhibiting
temporal clustering. This indicates that the mechanism underlying their
generation departs from a time-varying Poisson process. A remarkable,
qualitative similarity with the behavior of plasma density fluctuations
obtained from a numerical study of the nonlinear evolution of parametric
instability in the solar wind supports the idea that this mechanism has an
important role in governing density fluctuations in the inner heliosphere.

that, as in the inflation case, the spectral index and the running parameter

exists between a nearly matter dominated Universe in its contracting phase and
the quasi de Sitter regime in the expanding one. The results obtained also

important problem in environmental epidemiology. Our work is motivated by
multiple studies on the spatio-temporal distribution of mobile source, or
traffic related, particles in the greater Boston area. When multiple sources of
exposure information are available, a joint model that pools information across
sources maximizes data coverage over both space and time, thereby reducing the
prediction error. We consider a Bayesian hierarchical framework in which a
joint model consists of a set of submodels, one for each data source, and a
model for the latent process that serves to relate the submodels to one
another. If a submodel depends on the latent process nonlinearly, inference
using standard MCMC techniques can be computationally prohibitive. The
implications are particularly severe when the data for each submodel are
aggregated at different temporal scales. To make such problems tractable, we
linearize the nonlinear components with respect to the latent process and
induce sparsity in the covariance matrix of the latent process using compactly
supported covariance functions. We propose an efficient MCMC scheme that takes
advantage of these approximations. We use our model to address a temporal
change of support problem whereby interest focuses on pooling daily and
multiday black carbon readings in order to maximize the spatial coverage of the

concatenated multiple sequence alignments from many genes. Unfortunately, the
resulting so-called supermatrix is usually sparse, that is, not every gene
sequence is available for all species in the supermatrix. Due to the missing
sequence information a phylogenetic inference, assuming that each gene evolves
with its own substitution model, suffers from phylogenetic terraces on which
many phylogenetic trees show the same likelihood. Here, we propose a
phylogenetic terrace aware (PTA) data structure for efficient supermatrix based
tree inference under partition models. PTA avoids likelihood computations for
trees belonging to the same terrace. PTA is implemented in the IQ-TREE
software, and leads to an 1.7 to 6-fold speedup for real data sets compared
with a na\""ive implementation. Speedups are independent on terrace sizes but
correlate with the amount of missing data. Thus, the PTA data structure is well
suited for phylogenomic analyses. IQ-TREE source codes, binaries and

the Langevin equation. The key to efficiency is that we describe the equations
of motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer's
fluctuation modes, as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the

same level of discretisation, i.e., when each discretisation element is one
basepair long, our algorithm gains about 5-6 orders of magnitude in the size of
time steps over the inextensible WLC model. Further, we show that our model can
be mapped one-on-one to a discretised version of the extensible WLC model;
implying that the speed-up we achieve in our model must hold equally well for

visual image which is on a user's mind. Our approach is based on the Rapid
Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) of polygon primitives and Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) technology. The presentation of polygons that contribute to
build a target image (because they match the shape and/or color of the target)
trigger attention-related EEG patterns. Accordingly, these target primitives
can be determined using BCI classification of Event-Related Potentials (ERPs).
They are then accumulated in the display until a satisfactory reconstruction is
reached. Selection steps have an average classification accuracy of $75\%$.
$25\%$ of the images could be reconstructed completely, while more than $65\%$
of the available visual details could be captured on average. Most of the
misclassifications were not misinterpretations of the BCI concerning users'
intent; rather, users tried to select polygons that were different than what
was intended by the experimenters. Open problems and alternatives to develop a
practical BCI-based image reconstruction application are discussed.

binary and continuous prediction, we develop a method for adaptive
group-regularized (logistic) ridge regression, which makes structural use of
such 'co-data'. Here, 'groups' refer to a partition of the variables according
to the co-data. We derive empirical Bayes estimates of group-specific
penalties, which possess several nice properties: i) they are analytical; ii)
they adapt to the informativeness of the co-data for the data at hand; iii)
only one global penalty parameter requires tuning by cross-validation. In
addition, the method allows use of multiple types of co-data at little extra
computational effort.
  We show that the group-specific penalties may lead to a larger distinction
between `near-zero' and relatively large regression parameters, which
facilitates post-hoc variable selection. The method, termed GRridge, is
implemented in an easy-to-use R-package. It is demonstrated on two cancer
genomics studies, which both concern the discrimination of precancerous
cervical lesions from normal cervix tissues using methylation microarray data.
For both examples, GRridge clearly improves the predictive performances of
ordinary logistic ridge regression and the group lasso. In addition, we show
that for the second study the relatively good predictive performance is
maintained when selecting only 42 variables.

science, since encryption founds upon the trust in random numbers. Since it is
impossible to prove if an existing random bit string is truly random, it is
relevant that they be generated in a trust worthy process. This requires
specialized hardware for random numbers, for example a die or a tossed coin.
But when all input parameters are known, their outcome might still be
predicted. A quantum mechanical superposition allows for provably true random
bit generation. In the past decade many quantum random number generators
(QRNGs) were realized. A photonic implementation is described as a photon which
impinges on a beam splitter, but such a protocol is rarely realized with
non-classical light or anti-bunched single photons. Instead, laser sources or
light emitting diodes are used. Here we analyze the difference in generating a
true random bit string with a laser and with anti-bunched light. We show that a
single photon source provides more randomness than even a brighter laser. This
gain of usable entropy proves the advantages of true single photons versus
coherent input states of light in an experimental implementation. The
underlying advantage can be adapted to microscopy and sensing.

However, a trade-off is often required, since a narrow field of view improves
background noise rejection but it is linked to an increase in

reported. It is shown that the so called anomalous luminescence of Ce-doped
elpasolite Cs2LiLuCl6, which is characterized mainly by a very large Stokes
shift and a very large band width, corresponds to an IVCT emission in Ce3+-Ce4+
pairs, from the 5deg orbital of Ce3+ to 4f orbitals of Ce4+. Its Stokes shift
is the sum of the large reorganization energies of the Ce4+ and Ce3+ centers
formed after the fixed-nuclei electron transfer and it is equal to the energy
of the IVCT absorption commonly found in mixed-valence compounds, which is
predicted to exist in this material and to be slightly larger than 10000 cm-1.
The large band width is the consequence of the large offset between the minima
of the Ce3+-Ce4+ and Ce4+-Ce3+ pairs along the electron transfer reaction
coordinate. This offset is approximately 2*sqrt(3) times the difference of
Ce-Cl equilibrium distances in the Ce3+ and Ce4+ centers. It is shown that the
energies of the peaks and the widths of IVCT absorption and emission bands can
be calculated ab initio with reasonable accuracy from diabatic energy surfaces
of the ground and excited states and that these can be obtained, in turn, from
independent calculations on the donor and acceptor active centers. We obtained
the energies of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ active centers of Ce-doped Cs2LiLuCl6 by
means of state-of-the-art wave-function-theory spin-orbit coupling relativistic
calculations on the donor cluster (CeCl6Li6Cs8)11+ and the acceptor cluster
(CeCl6Li6Cs8)12+ embedded in a quantum mechanical embedding potential of the
host. The calculations provide interpretations of unexplained experimental
observations as due to higher energy IVCT absorptions, and allow reinterpreting
others. The existence of another IVCT emission of lower energy, at around
14000-16000 cm-1 less than the 5dt2g emission, is also predicted.

difficult to analyse dynamical properties. In particular, for logical models of
biological regulatory networks, it is of real interest to study attractors and
their reachability from specific initial conditions, i.e. to assess the
potential asymptotical behaviours of the system. Beyond the identification of
the reachable attractors, we propose to quantify this reachability.
  Results: Relying on the structure of the state transition graph, we estimate
the probability of each attractor reachable from a given initial condition or
from a portion of the state space. First, we present a quasi-exact solution
with an original algorithm called Firefront, based on the exhaustive
exploration of the reachable state space. Then, we introduce an adapted version
of Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, termed Avatar, better suited to larger
models. Firefront and Avatar methods are validated and compared to other
related approaches, using as test cases logical models of synthetic and
biological networks.

spectra on the fermionic mixing patterns. The quark and lepton mixing matrices
are built in a general framework with their matrix elements expressed in terms

mixing matrices are consistent with data for both quarks and leptons, despite
the large leptonic mixing angles. The minimal assumption we take is the one of
hierarchical masses and minimal flavour symmetry breaking that strongly follows
from phenomenology. No special structure of the mass matrices has to be assumed
that cannot be motivated by this minimal assumption. This analysis allows us to
predict the neutrino mass spectrum and set the mass of the lightest neutrino
well below 0.01 eV. The method also gives the 1 sigma allowed ranges for the
leptonic mixing matrix elements. Contrary to the common expectation, leptonic
mixing angles are found to be determined solely by the four leptonic mass
ratios without any relation to symmetry considerations as commonly used in
flavor model building. Still, our formulae can be used to build up a flavor
model that predicts the observed hierarchies in the masses---the mixing follows
then from the procedure which is developed in this work.

Analytical
solutions to these equations can rarely be obtained. We here derive an
analytical approximation of the time-dependent probability distribution of the
master equation using orthogonal polynomials. The solution is given in two
alternative formulations: a series with continuous and a series with discrete
support both of which can be systematically truncated. While both
approximations satisfy the system size expansion of the master equation, the
continuous distribution approximations become increasingly negative and tend to
oscillations with increasing truncation order. In contrast, the discrete
approximations rapidly converge to the underlying non-Gaussian distributions.
The theory is shown to lead to particularly simple analytical expressions for
the probability distributions of molecule numbers in metabolic reactions and
gene expression systems.

corresponding cosmology of models with regularized branes generated by such a

anisotropic evolution of the warp factor and consequently the Hubble like
parameter are both driven by the radial coordinate on the brane, which leads to
an emergent thick brane-world scenario with spherically symmetric time
dependent warp factor. Meanwhile, the separability of variables depending on
fifth dimension, y, which is exhibited by the equations of motion, allows one
to recover the extra dimensional profiles obtained in the literature, namely
the extra dimensional part of the scale (warp) factor and the scalar field
dependence on y. Therefore, our results are mainly concerned with the time
dependence of a spherically symmetric warp factor. Besides evincing
possibilities for obtaining asymmetric stable brane-world scenarios, the extra
dimensional profiles here obtained can also be reduced to those ones
investigated in the literature.

new atom from a dictionary via the steepest gradient descent and build the
estimator via orthogonal projecting the target function to the space spanned by
the selected atoms in each greedy step. Here, ""greed"" means choosing a new atom
according to the steepest gradient descent principle. OGL then avoids the
overfitting/underfitting by selecting an appropriate iteration number. In this
paper, we point out that the overfitting/underfitting can also be avoided via
redefining ""greed"" in OGL. To this end, we introduce a new greedy metric,
called $\delta$-greedy thresholds, to refine ""greed"" and theoretically verifies
its feasibility. Furthermore, we reveals that such a greedy metric can bring an
adaptive termination rule on the premise of maintaining the prominent learning
performance of OGL. Our results show that the steepest gradient descent is not
the unique greedy metric of OGL and some other more suitable metric may lessen

""retweets"" or messages re-posted verbatim by a user that were originated by
someone else. (This does not include modified tweets that sometimes are
referred to as retweets.) Despite the fact that retweets are routinely studied
and reported, many important questions remain about user motivation for their
use and their significance. In this paper we answer the question of what users
indicate when they retweet. We do so in a comprehensive fashion, by employing a
user survey, a study of user profiles, and a meta-analysis of over 100 research
publications from three related major conferences. Our findings indicate that
retweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the
message and the originator, and agreement with the message contents. However,
the findings are significantly weaker for journalists, some of whom beg to
differ declaring so in their own user profiles. On the other hand, the
inclusion of hashtags strengthens the signal of agreement, especially when the
hashtags are related to politics. While in the past there have been additional
claims in the literature about possible reasons for retweeting, many of them
are not supported, especially given the technical changes introduced recently
by Twitter.

number of essential features with the Kepler system, that is just its Euclidean
version arising in the limit $\eta \to 0$, and for which a SUSYQM approach has

$\eta$ and negative energy the motion is always periodic; it turns out that the
period depends upon $ \eta$ and goes to the Euclidean value as $\eta \to 0$.
Moreover, the maximal superintegrability is preserved by the
$\eta$-deformation, due to the existence of a larger symmetry group related to
an $\eta$-deformed Runge-Lenz vector, which ensures that in $\mathbb{R}^3$
closed orbits are again ellipses. In this context, a deformed version of the
third Kepler's law is also recovered. The closing section is devoted to a
discussion of the $\eta<0$ case, where new and partly unexpected features

the influence of the spiral density wave, we obtained the following components

particles is expected to be incomplete in radiatively inefficient accretion
flows (RIAFs), allowing the existence of non-thermal particles. In this work,
assuming stochastic particle acceleration due to turbulence in RIAFs, we solve
the Fokker-Planck equation and calculate spectra of escaping neutrinos and CRs.
The RIAF in LLAGN can emit CR protons with $\gtrsim10$ PeV energies and TeV-PeV
neutrinos generated via $pp$ and/or $p\gamma$ reactions. We find that, if
$\sim1$\% of the accretion luminosity is carried away by non-thermal ions, the
diffuse neutrino intensity from the cores of LLAGN may be as high as
$E_\nu^2\Phi_\nu\sim3\times{10}^{-8} {\rm GeV} {\rm cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}{\rm

does not contradict either of the diffuse gamma-ray background observed by {\it
Fermi} or observed diffuse cosmic-ray flux. Our model suggests that, although
very-high-energy gamma rays may not escape, radio-quiet AGN with RIAFs can emit
GeV gamma-rays, which could be used for testing the model. We also calculate
the neutron luminosity from RIAFs of LLAGN, and discuss a strong constraint on
the model of jet mass loading mediated by neutrons from the diffuse neutrino
observation.

strong interaction between the stellar and the pulsar winds. The properties of
this interaction, which largely determine the non-thermal radiation in these

clumpy or strongly anisotropic, as in Be stars. We study numerically the
influence of inhomogeneities in the stellar wind on the structure of the
two-wind interaction region. We carried out for the first time axisymmetric,
relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, with Lorentz factors of ~6 and
accounting for the impact of instabilities, to study the impact in the two-wind
interaction structure of an over-dense region of the stellar wind. We also
followed the evolution of this over-dense region or clump as it faces the
impact of the pulsar wind. For typical system parameters, and adopting a
stellar wind inhomogeneity with a density contrast >~10, clumps with radii of a
few percent of the binary size can significantly perturb the two-wind
interaction region, pushing the two-wind interface to <~40% of the initial
distance to the pulsar. After it is shocked, the inhomogeneity quickly expands
and is disrupted when it reaches the smallest distance to the pulsar. It
eventually fragments, being advected away from the binary system. The whole
interaction region is quite unstable, and the shocked pulsar wind can strongly
change under small perturbations. We confirm the sensitive nature of the
two-wind interaction structure to perturbations, in particular when the stellar
wind is inhomogeneous. For realistic over-dense regions of the stellar wind,
the interaction region may shrink by a factor of a few, with the shocked flow
presenting a complex spatial and temporal pattern. This can lead to strong
variations in the non-thermal radiation.

can explain the observed high energy positron excess in the cosmic rays if the
fraction of $UU\zeta$ is $\sim 10^{-6}$ of the total dark matter density, the
mass of $UU^{++}$ about 1 TeV and the lifetime about $10^{20} $s. Optimizing
fit of recent AMS-02 data by model parameters, the predicted mass range of such
long-living double charge particle is challenging for its search at the LHC.

periodic microstructural details without length scale separation, i.e.
considering the complete macroscopic structure and its response, while
resolving all microstructural details, as compared to the often used
homogenisation approach. The approach takes boundary conditions into account
and ensures connected and macroscopically optimised microstructures regardless
of the difference in micro- and macroscopic length scales. This results in
microstructures tailored for specific applications rather than specific
properties.
  Dealing with the complete macroscopic structure and its response is
computationally challenging as very fine discretisations are needed in order to
resolve all microstructural details. Therefore, this article shows the benefits
of applying a contrast-independent spectral preconditioner based on the
multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to large structures with
fully-resolved microstructural details.
  The density-based topology optimisation approach combined with a Heaviside
projection filter and a stochastic robust formulation is used on various
problems, with both periodic and layered microstructures. The presented
approach is shown to allow for the topology optimisation of very large problems
in \textsc{Matlab}, specifically a problem with 26 million displacement degrees
of freedom in 26 hours using a single computational thread.

impurity in a fixed-size host superconductor, we find a decreasing critical
temperature $T_c$ of the host superconductor, which agrees with the results in
condensed matter literatures. More importantly, the phase transition at the
critical impurity strength (or the critical temperature) is of zeroth order.

mutual mathematical equivalence. Ultimately, the algorithms performance is

current article, a transmission overhead analysis of the aforementioned

(ORR) activity of graphene itself, in particular the dependence of the ORR
activity on the number of exposed edge sites remain elusive, mainly due to
limited synthesis routes of achieving small size graphene. In this work, the
synthesis of low oxygen content (< 2.5 +/-0.2 at %), few layer graphene
nanosheets with lateral dimensions smaller than a few hundred nm was achieved
using a combination of ionic liquid assisted grinding of high purity graphite
coupled with sequential centrifugation. We show for the first time, that the
graphene nanosheets possessing a plethora of edges exhibited considerably
higher electron transfer numbers compared to the thicker graphene
nanoplatelets. This enhanced ORR activity was accomplished by successfully
exploiting the plethora of edges of the nanosized graphene as well as the
efficient electron communication between the active edge sites and the
electrode substrate. The graphene nanosheets were characterized by an onset
potential of -0.13 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a current density of -3.85 mA/cm2 at -1 V,
which represent the best ORR performance ever achieved from an undoped carbon
based catalyst. This work demonstrates how low oxygen content nanosized
graphene synthesized by a simple route can considerably impact the ORR
catalytic activity and hence it is of significance in designing and optimizing
advanced metal-free ORR electrocatalysts.

that there is a chierarchy of such mechanisms and that the mutual interplay
between them can result in the synergetic outcome. In particular, we analyze
the biological effects of magnetic fields on soliton mediated charge transport
in the redox processes in living organisms. Such solitons are described by
nonlinear systems of equations and represent electrons that are self-trapped in
alpha-helical polypeptides due to the moderately strong electron-lattice
interaction. They represent a particular type of disssipativeless large
polarons in low-dimensional systems. We show that the effective mass of
solitons in the is different from the mass of free electrons, and that there is
a resonant effect of the magnetic fields on the dynamics of solitons, and,
hence, on charge transport that accompanies photosynthesis and respiration.
These effects can result in non-thermal resonant effects of magnetic fields on
redox processes in particular, and on the metabolism of the organism in
general. This can explain physical mechanisms of therapies based on applying
magnetic fields.
