  Spiller","Experimentally-driven approach for measuring quantum phase uncertainty","We consider that this work is incomplete and have decided to withdraw
  the paper",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new generalised formalism for estimating the quantum phase
uncertainty of pure and mixed continuous-variable quantum states and compare
this with the phase uncertainty given by the quantum Fisher information. In
order to preserve the Hermiticity of the operators, we use the Heisenberg and
Schroedinger uncertainty relations to derive expressions for the phase
uncertainty from generalised Susskind-Glogower operators. This formalism not
only offers the possibility of directly measuring quantum phase uncertainties
in a cavity-QED experiment but also gives a significant computational saving
over the quantum Fisher information approach, which requires diagonalisation of
the density matrix.

  stability of spikes in reaction-diffusion systems","31 pages, 20 figures, submitted to Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena",,"10.1016/j.physd.2014.09.008",,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present three examples of delayed bifurcations for spike solutions of
reaction-diffusion systems. The delay effect results as the system passes
slowly from a stable to an unstable regime, and was previously analysed in the
context of ODE's in [P.Mandel, T.Erneux, J.Stat.Phys, 1987]. It was found that
the instability would not be fully realized until the system had entered well
into the unstable regime. The bifurcation is said to have been ""delayed""
relative to the threshold value computed directly from a linear stability
analysis. In contrast, we analyze the delay effect in systems of PDE's. In
particular, for spike solutions of singularly perturbed generalized
Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) and Gray-Scott (GS) models, we analyze three examples of
delay resulting from slow passage into regimes of oscillatory and competition
instability. In the first example, for the GM model on the infinite real line,
we analyze the delay resulting from slowly tuning a control parameter through a
Hopf bifurcation. In the second example, we consider a Hopf bifurcation on a
finite one-dimensional domain. In this scenario, as opposed to the extrinsic
tuning of a system parameter through a bifurcation value, we analyze the delay
of a bifurcation triggered by slow intrinsic dynamics of the PDE system. In the
third example, we consider competition instabilities of the GS model triggered
by the extrinsic tuning of a feed rate parameter. In all cases, we find that
the system must pass well into the unstable regime before the onset of
instability is fully observed, indicating delay. We also find that delay has an
important effect on the eventual dynamics of the system in the unstable regime.
We give analytic predictions for the magnitude of the delays as obtained
through analysis of certain explicitly solvable nonlocal eigenvalue problems.
The theory is confirmed by numerical solutions of the full PDE systems.

  introduction are rewritten, especially the historical part from the earlier
  verions is completely deleted. This version contains an additional theorem
  (Theorem 5) which summarizes our findings concerning the points of
  discontinuity of the deterministic message transmission capacity",,"10.1063/1.4902930",,"quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work is motivated by a quite general question: Under which circumstances
are the capacities of information transmission systems continuous? The research
is explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We
give an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the
transmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness
between the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific
class of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the
deterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is,
at the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its
positivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted
capacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the
deterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous
only in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is
nonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that
shows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The
continuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had,
among others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP
Hannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous. We also
quantify the interplay between the distribution of finite amounts of randomness
between the legitimate sender and receiver, the (nonzero) decoding error with
respect to the average error criterion that can be achieved over a finite
number of channel uses and the number of messages that can be sent. This part
of our results also applies to entanglement- and strong subspace transmission.
In addition, we give a new sufficient criterion for the entanglement
transmission capacity with randomness assistance to vanish.

presented by Zain et al. (2011a). In addition to this problem, the objective
function to be optimized is an infinitely differentiable quadratic formula with
box constraints, thus instead of using soft computing techniques, gradient
methods that have better convergence property and are usually faster should be
employed first. In particular, we show that the active set method outperforms

$|\bar{g}_{\pi}^{(1)}| \lesssim 1.1\times 10^{-10}$.

  Interaction Testing of Software Product Lines",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As Software Product Lines (SPLs) are becoming a more pervasive development
practice, their effective testing is becoming a more important concern. In the
past few years many SPL testing approaches have been proposed, among them, are
those that support Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT) whose premise is to
select a group of products where faults, due to feature interactions, are more
likely to occur. Many CIT techniques for SPL testing have been put forward;
however, no systematic and comprehensive comparison among them has been
performed. To achieve such goal two items are important: a common benchmark of
feature models, and an adequate comparison framework. In this
research-in-progress paper, we propose 19 feature models as the base of a
benchmark, which we apply to three different techniques in order to analyze the
comparison framework proposed by Perrouin et al. We identify the shortcomings
of this framework and elaborate alternatives for further study.

  models",,,,,"math.NA stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the application of iterative regularization for the development of
ensemble methods for solving Bayesian inverse problems. In concrete, we
construct (i) a variational iterative regularizing ensemble Levenberg-Marquardt
method (IR-enLM) and (ii) a derivative-free iterative ensemble Kalman smoother
(IR-ES). The aim of these methods is to provide a robust ensemble approximation
of the Bayesian posterior. The proposed methods are based on fundamental ideas
from iterative regularization methods that have been widely used for the
solution of deterministic inverse problems [21]. In this work we are interested
in the application of the proposed ensemble methods for the solution of
Bayesian inverse problems that arise in reservoir modeling applications. The
proposed ensemble methods use key aspects of the regularizing
Levenberg-Marquardt scheme developed by Hanke [16] and that we recently applied
for history matching in [18].
  In the case where the forward operator is linear and the prior is Gaussian,
we show that the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES coincide with standard randomized
maximum likelihood (RML) and the ensemble smoother (ES) respectively. For the
general nonlinear case, we develop a numerical framework to assess the
performance of the proposed ensemble methods at capturing the posterior. This
framework consists of using a state-of-the art MCMC method for resolving the
Bayesian posterior from synthetic experiments. The resolved posterior via MCMC
then provides a gold standard against to which compare the proposed IR-enLM and
IR-ES. We show that for the careful selection of regularization parameters,
robust approximations of the posterior can be accomplished in terms of mean and
variance. Our numerical experiments showcase the advantage of using iterative
regularization for obtaining more robust and stable approximation of the
posterior than standard unregularized methods.

with young, high-mass stars have been measured with the BeSSeL Survey, a VLBA
key science project, the EVN, and the Japanese VERA project. These measurements
provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way,
accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging
from 7 to 20 degrees. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the
Galactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the 3-D
position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and
average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic
center, Ro, to be 8.34 +/- 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, To,
to be 240 +/- 8 km/s, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (a slope of -0.2
+/- 0.4 km/s/kpc) between Galactocentric radii of 5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a
""universal"" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin
disk scale length to be 2.44 +/- 0.16 kpc. The parameters Ro and To are not
highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to different forms of the
rotation curve. Adopting a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star
forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global
solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, Vsun = 14.6 +/-
5.0 km/s. While To and Vsun are significantly correlated, the sum of these
parameters is well constrained, To + Vsun = 255.2 +/- 5.1 km/s, as is the
angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, (To + Vsun)/Ro
= 30.57 +/- 0.43 km/s/kpc. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates
of the accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their
Galactic orbits, significantly reducing the uncertainty in tests of
gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.

verification (UV) based continuous speech recognition (CSR). Utterance
verification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a
hypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or
out-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is
implemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that
are presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary
testing, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on
the optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The
second technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state
transducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for
major components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models
(HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical
grammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the
acoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study
presented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a
significant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found
that the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the
UV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared
to existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of
the finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in
training acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning
the formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these
techniques with statistical language models.

growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in a partially ionized
(PI) plasma in the one-fluid description, considering a generalized induction
equation. The governing linear equations and appropriate boundary conditions,
including gravitational terms, are derived and applied to the case of the RTI
in a single interface between two partially ionized plasmas. The boundary
conditions lead to an equation for the frequencies in which some of them have
positive complex parts, marking the appearance of the RTI. We study the
ambipolar term alone first, extending the result to the full induction equation
later. We find that the configuration is always unstable because of the
presence of a neutral species. In the classical stability regime the growth
rate is small, since the collisions prevent the neutral fluid to fully develop
the RTI. For parameters in the classical instability regime the growth rate is
lowered, but for the considered theoretical values of the collision frequencies
and diffusion coefficients for solar prominences the differences with the
compressible MHD case are small. We conclude that PI modifies some aspects of
the linear RTI instability, since it takes into account that neutrals do not
feel the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. For the set of parameters
representative for solar prominences, our model gives the resulting timescale
comparable with observed lifetimes of RTI plumes.

lambda-calculus in terms of (strong) indexed monads which gives a one-to-one
correspondence between indices of the denotations and the effect annotations of
traditional effect systems. Dually, this approach yields indexed comonads which
gives a unified semantics and effect system to contextual notions of effect
(called coeffects), which we have previously described.

either be modelled by a further velocity oscillations, or by a periodic
variation of the mass injection rate at the base of the jet at a latter time.
The fitting of the data fixes different parameters of the model, such as the
mean mass injection rate at the base of the jet and the oscillation frequency
of the flow as measured on the rest frame of the central source.

sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a
probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational

that statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the

assumption. First, we derive an asymptotic (in the large-system limit) weighted
sum rate (WSR) expression for the MIMO MAC with finite alphabet inputs and
general jointly-correlated fading. Subsequently, we obtain necessary conditions
for linear precoders maximizing the asymptotic WSR and propose an iterative
algorithm for determining the precoders of all users. In the proposed
algorithm, the search space of each user for designing the precoding matrices
is its own modulation set. This significantly reduces the dimension of the
search space for finding the precoding matrices of all users compared to the
conventional precoding design for the MIMO MAC with finite alphabet inputs,
where the search space is the combination of the modulation sets of all users.
As a result, the proposed algorithm decreases the computational complexity for
MIMO MAC precoding design with finite alphabet inputs by several orders of
magnitude. Simulation results for finite alphabet signalling indicate that the
proposed iterative algorithm achieves significant performance gains over
existing precoder designs, including the precoder design based on the Gaussian
input assumption, in terms of both the sum rate and the coded bit error rate.

network (GSN) has enormous ecological and economic cost throughout the world.
Previous attempts at quantifying NIS invasions have mostly taken ""bottom-up""
approaches that eventually require the use of multiple simplifying assumptions
due to insufficiency and/or uncertainty of available data. By modeling implicit
species exchanges via a graph abstraction that we refer to as the Species Flow
Network (SFN), a different approach that exploits the power of network science
methods in extracting knowledge from largely incomplete data is presented.
Here, coarse-grained species flow dynamics are studied via a graph clustering
approach that decomposes the SFN to clusters of ports and inter-cluster
connections. With this decomposition of ports in place, NIS flow among clusters
can be very efficiently reduced by enforcing NIS management on a few chosen
inter-cluster connections. Furthermore, efficient NIS management strategy for
species exchanges within a cluster (often difficult due higher rate of travel
and pathways) are then derived in conjunction with ecological and environmental
aspects that govern the species establishment. The benefits of the presented
approach include robustness to data uncertainties, implicit incorporation of
""stepping-stone"" spread of invasive species, and decoupling of species spread
and establishment risk estimation. Our analysis of a multi-year (1997--2006)
GSN dataset using the presented approach shows the existence of a few large
clusters of ports with higher intra-cluster species flow that are fairly stable
over time. Furthermore, detailed investigations were carried out on vessel
types, ports, and inter-cluster connections. Finally, our observations are
discussed in the context of known NIS invasions and future research directions
are also presented.

squared error in satisfying the detailed balance condition is least. The
advantage of this work is that, by studying the LGM analytically, we will be
able to anticipate how the kinetic properties of an arbitrary Ising system
depend on the temperature and the coupling constants. The analytical
expressions for the optimal values of the parameters involved in the linear

two basic predictions of this outflow-regulated cluster formation model, namely
(1) the clump should be close to virial equilibrium and (2) the turbulence

using recent outflow surveys toward 8 nearby cluster-forming clumps (B59,

momentum dissipation rate. In addition, the outflow kinetic energy is
significantly smaller than the clump gravitational energy for intermediate and
massive clumps with $M_{\rm cl} \gtrsim {\rm a \ few} \times 10^2 M_\odot$,
suggesting that the outflow feedback is not enough to disperse the clump as a

sample of low-luminosity SNe IIP (LL SNe IIP) is analyzed together with similar
objects studied in the past. All of them show a flat light curve plateau
lasting about 100 days, an under luminous late-time exponential tail, intrinsic
colours that are unusually red, and spectra showing prominent and narrow
P-Cygni lines. A velocity of the ejected material below 10^3 km/s is inferred
from measurements at the end of the plateau. The 56Ni masses ejected in the
explosion are very small (less than 10^-2 solar masses). We investigate the
correlations among 56Ni mass, expansion velocity of the ejecta and absolute
magnitude in the middle of the plateau, confirming the main findings of Hamuy
(2003), according to which events showing brighter plateau and larger expansion
velocities are expected to produce more 56Ni. We propose that these faint
objects represent the low luminosity tail of a continuous distribution in
parameters space of SNe IIP. The physical properties of the progenitors at the
explosion are estimated through the hydrodynamical modeling of the observables
for two representative events of this class, namely SN 2005cs and SN 2008in. We
find that the majority of LL SNe IIP, and quite possibly all, originate in the
core-collapse of intermediate mass stars, in the mass range 10-15 solar masses.

cohomology of pseudoeffective line bundles on compact K{\""a}hler manifolds, and
related properties of their multiplier ideal sheaves. In case the curvature is
strictly positive, the prototype is the well known Nadel vanishing theorem,
which is itself a generalized analytic version of the fundamental
Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem of algebraic geometry. We are interested
here in the case where the curvature is merely semipositive in the sense of
currents, and the base manifold is not necessarily projective. In this
situation, one can still obtain interesting information on cohomology, e.g. a
Hard Lefschetz theorem with pseudoeffective coefficients, in the form of a
surjectivity statement for the Lefschetz map. More recently, Junyan Cao, in his
PhD thesis defended in Grenoble, obtained a general K{\""a}hler vanishing
theorem that depends on the concept of numerical dimension of a given
pseudoeffective line bundle. The proof of these results depends in a crucial
way on a general approximation result for closed (1,1)-currents, based on the
use of Bergman kernels, and the related intersection theory of currents.
Another important ingredient is the recent proof by Guan and Zhou of the strong
openness conjecture. As an application, we discuss a structure theorem for
compact K{\""a}hler threefolds without nontrivial subvarieties, following a
joint work with F.Campana and M.Verbitsky. We hope that these notes will serve

unifying viewpoints.

detailed predictions necessary for the planned and ongoing large spectroscopic

very uncertain nature of sub-grid physical energy feedback within models,
affecting both star formation rates and chemical enrichment. To avoid these
problems, we have introduced a new approach which consists of fusing disc
chemical evolution models with compatible numerical simulations. We demonstrate
the power of this method by showing that a range of observational results can
be explained by our new model. We show that due to radial migration from
mergers at high redshift and the central bar at later times, a sizable fraction
of old metal-poor, high-[alpha/Fe] stars can reach the solar vicinity. This
naturally accounts for a number of recent observations related to both the thin
and thick discs, despite the fact that we use thin-disc chemistry only. Within
the framework of our model, the MW thick disc has emerged naturally from (i)
stars born with high velocity dispersions at high redshift, (ii) stars
migrating from the inner disc very early on due to strong merger activity, and
(iii) further radial migration driven by the bar and spirals at later times. A
significant fraction of old stars with thick-disc characteristics could have
been born near the solar radius.

results from the Berry curvature arising from the transversality of
electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium. Our investigation therefore acts
to bridge the gap between the advancing field of topological band theory and
classical optical phenomena such as the Spin Hall effect of light. The
effective medium route to topological phases will pave the way for highly

The mass density profile shows no significant upturn at large radius and is
well-approximated by a simple bulge + disk model out to R = 70 kpc,

find that the best-fitting halo mass M_halo ~ 1.7 x 10^8 M_sun. The total

than that of the Milky Way (f_halo ~ 0.02) and M31 (f_halo ~ 0.04). All three
galaxies fall below the f_halo - M_tot,* relation predicted by recent
cosmological simulations that trace the light of disrupted satellites, with
M101's halo mass a factor of ~10 below the median expectation. However, the
predicted scatter in this relation is large, and more galaxies are needed to
better quantify this possible tension with galaxy formation models. Dragonfly
is well suited for this project: as integrated-light surface brightness is

16 SNe IIn for which we have Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) observations

Based on this analysis we find that precursor events among SNe IIn are common:
at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of SNe IIn have at least
one pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, taking
place up to 1/3 yr prior to the SN explosion. The average rate of such
precursor events during the year prior to the SN explosion is likely larger
than one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. We
also find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of the
precursor, and the SN total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.
These correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, and
the early-time light curve of these SNe is powered by interaction of the SN
shock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.

metals despite high surface gravities and short settling times. The current
theoretical model for this pollution is accretion of rocky bodies delivered to
the WD through perturbations by orbiting planets. Using N-body simulations, we
examine the possibility of a single planet as the source of pollution. We
determine the stability of test particles on circular orbits in systems with a
single planet located at 4 au for a range of masses and eccentricities,
comparing the fractions that are ejected and accreted. In particular, we
compare the instabilities that develop before and after the star loses mass to
form a WD, a process which causes orbiting bodies to migrate outward. We
determine that a planet must be eccentric (e > 0.02) to deliver significant (>
0.5 per cent) amounts of material to the host and that the amount increases
with the planetary eccentricity. This result is robust with respect to the
initial eccentricities of the particles for planetary eccentricity above ~0.4
and for randomly-distributed particle long. of pericentre. We also find that
the efficiency of pollution is enhanced as planetary mass is reduced. We
demonstrate that a 0.03 M_Jup planet with substantial eccentricity (e > 0.4)
can account for the observed levels of pollution for initial disc masses of
order 1 M_Earth. Such discs are within the range estimated for initial
planetesimals discs and below that estimated for the solar system. However,
their survival to the WD stage is uncertain as estimates for the collisional
evolution of planetesimal discs suggest they should be ground down below the
required levels on Gyr timescales. Thus, planetary scattering by eccentric,
sub-Jovian planets can explain the observed levels of WD pollution, but only if
current estimates of the collisional erosion of planetesimal discs are in
error.

magnetically-dominated electron-positron plasmas. Our simulations extend to
unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial scales, so we can capture the
asymptotic state of the system beyond the initial transients, and without any
artificial limitation by the boundary conditions. At late times, the
reconnection layer is organized into a chain of large magnetic islands
connected by thin X-lines. The plasmoid instability further fragments each
X-line into a series of smaller islands, separated by X-points. At the
X-points, the particles become unmagnetized and they get accelerated along the
reconnection electric field. We provide definitive evidence that the late-time
particle spectrum integrated over the whole reconnection region is a power-law,
whose slope is harder than -2 for magnetizations sigma>10. Efficient particle
acceleration to non-thermal energies is a generic by-product of the long-term
evolution of relativistic reconnection in both two and three dimensions. In
three dimensions, the drift-kink mode corrugates the reconnection layer at
early times, but the long-term evolution is controlled by the plasmoid
instability, that facilitates efficient particle acceleration, in analogy to
the two-dimensional physics. Our findings have important implications for the
generation of hard photon spectra in pulsar winds and relativistic

stacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame

for each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent
with previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher
than expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR
composite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which
include both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation
rates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the
UV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs - compared to the model SFRs - by more
than ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming
galaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in
specific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific
SFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than
previously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV

conclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar

surfaces coated with a new generation of anti-reflection coatings based on

extended structures to surface brightness levels below 30 mag/arcsec^2 in 10h
integrations (without binning or foreground star removal). This is considerably
deeper than the surface brightness limit of any existing wide-field telescope.
At present no systematic errors limiting the usefulness of much longer

foreground star removal and modest binning the Dragonfly Telephoto Array is
capable of probing structures with surface brightnesses below 32 mag/arcsec^2.
Detection of structures at these surface brightness levels may hold the key to
solving the ""missing substructure"" and ""missing satellite"" problems of
conventional hierarchical galaxy formation models. The Dragonfly Telephoto

fitting synthetic spectra to the observed spectral energy distribution and the
available spectra (ultraviolet and optical), we obtain the physical properties

12% of our sample are more luminous than 10^6 Lsun and contain a significant
amount of hydrogen, 88% of the WN stars, with little or no hydrogen, populate
the luminosity range between log (L/Lsun) = 5.3...5.8. Conclusions: While the
few extremely luminous stars (log (L/Lsun) > 6), if indeed single stars,
descended directly from the main sequence at very high initial masses, the bulk
of WN stars have gone through the red-supergiant phase. According to their
luminosities in the range of log (L/Lsun) = 5.3...5.8, these stars originate
from initial masses between 20 and 40 Msun. This mass range is similar to the
one found in the Galaxy, i.e. the expected metallicity dependence of the
evolution is not seen. Current stellar evolution tracks, even when accounting
for rotationally induced mixing, still partly fail to reproduce the observed
ranges of luminosities and initial masses. Moreover, stellar radii are
generally larger and effective temperatures correspondingly lower than
predicted from stellar evolution models, probably due to subphotospheric
inflation.

from two established properties of accretion disks: the increase in turbulent
stress in disks threaded by a net magnetic field and the ability of thick (but
not thin) disks to advect such a field radially. During quiescence, magnetic
field loops are generated by the magnetorotational instability at the interface
between the inner hot flow and outer thin disk. Vertical flux is advected into
and accumulates stochastically within the inner flow, where it stimulates the
turbulence so that $\alpha \sim 1$. The transition to a geometrically thin
inner disk occurs when $L \sim \alpha^2 L_{\rm Edd} \sim L_{\rm Edd}$, and the
first ""thin"" disk to form is itself moderately thick, strongly magnetized, and
able to advect field inward. These properties favor episodic jet production. As
the accretion rate declines magnetic flux escapes, $\alpha$ decreases to
$\alpha \sim 0.01 - 0.1$, and a hot inner flow is not re-established until $L

higher fractions of very disturbed objects. There is no increase in the
prevalence of merger signatures with AGN luminosity. At 95% confidence we find

measured observable they are differential in the virtuality and/or transverse

momentum fraction. Perturbatively, the beam functions can be calculated by
matching them onto standard quark and gluon parton distribution functions. We
calculate the inclusive virtuality-dependent quark beam function at NNLO, which
is relevant for any observables probing the virtuality of the incoming partons,
including N-jettiness and beam thrust. For such observables, our results are an
important ingredient in the resummation of large logarithms at N3LL order, and
provide all contributions enhanced by collinear t-channel singularities at NNLO
for quark-initiated processes in analytic form. We perform the calculation in
both Feynman and axial gauge and use two different methods to evaluate the
discontinuity of the two-loop Feynman diagrams, providing nontrivial checks of
the calculation. As part of our results we reproduce the known two-loop QCD

for their growth. Using the all-sky Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
survey, and bulge-to-disk decompositions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 7, we report the discovery of a population of local (z<0.3)
bulgeless disk galaxies with extremely red mid-infrared colors highly
suggestive of a dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN), despite having no
optical AGN signatures in their SDSS spectra. Using various mid-infrared
selection criteria from the literature, there are between 30 to over 300
bulgeless galaxies with possible AGNs. Other known scenarios that can heat the
dust to high temperatures do not appear to explain the observed colors of this
sample. If these galaxies are confirmed to host AGNs, this study will provide a
breakthrough in characterizing the properties of SMBHs in the low bulge mass
regime and in understanding their relation with their host galaxies.
Mid-infrared selection identifies AGNs that dominate their host galaxy's
emission and therefore reveal a different AGN population than is uncovered by
optical studies. We find that the fraction of all galaxies identified as
candidate AGNs by WISE is highest at lower stellar masses and drops
dramatically in higher mass galaxies, in striking contrast to the findings from

honeycomb and triangular ones) in a wide range of fermionic densities. We argue
that for a generic doping in this range, superconductivity at weak coupling is
of Kohn-Luttinger type, and, due to the presence of electronic interactions
beyond on-site repulsion, is a threshold phenomenon, with superconductivity
emerging only if the attraction generated by the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism
exceeds the bare repulsion in some channel. For disconnected Fermi pockets, we
predict that Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, if it occurs, is likely to be
$f$-wave. While the Kohn-Luttinger analysis is adequate over most of the doping
range, a more sophisticated analysis is needed near Van Hove doping. We treat
Van Hove doping using a parquet renormalization group, the equations for which
we derive and analyze. Near this doping level, superconductivity is a universal
phenomenon, arising from any choice of bare repulsive interactions. The
strongest pairing instability is into a chiral $d-$wave state ($d+id$). At a
truly weak coupling, the strongest competitor is a spin-density-wave
instability, however, $d-$wave superconductivity still wins. Moreover, the
feedback of the spin density fluctuations into the Cooper channel significantly
enhances the critical temperature over the estimates of the Kohn Luttinger
theory. We analyze renormalization group equations at stronger couplings and
find that the main competitor to $d-$wave supoerconductivity away from weak
coupling is actually ferromagnetism. We also discuss the effect of the edge
fermions and show that they are unimportant in the asymptotic weak coupling
limit, but may give rise to, e.g., a charge-density-wave order at moderate

infer the universal ratio of baryons to photons (or, the present Universe
baryon mass density parameter Omega_B h^2), as well as to constrain the
effective number of neutrinos (N_eff) and the number of equivalent neutrinos
(Delta N_nu). These BBN results are compared to those derived independently
from the Planck CMB data. In the absence of a light WIMP (chi), N_eff = 3.05(1
+ Delta N_nu/3). In this case, there is excellent agreement between BBN and the
CMB, but the joint fit finds that Delta N_nu = 0.40 +/- 0.17, disfavoring
standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN: Delta N_nu = 0) at 2.4 sigma, as well
as a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at 3.5 sigma. In the presence of a light
WIMP, the relation between N_eff and Delta N_nu depends on the WIMP mass,
leading to degeneracies among N_eff, Delta N_nu, and m_chi. The complementary
and independent BBN and CMB data can break some of these degeneracies.
Depending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or
complex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set a lower bound to m_chi in the
range from 0.5 to 5 MeV, and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the
range from 5 to 10 MeV. The joint BBN + CMB analyses find a best fit value for
the number of equivalent neutrinos, Delta N_nu = 0.65, nearly independent of
the nature of the WIMP. The best fit still disfavors the absence of dark
radiation (Delta N_nu = 0 at 95% confidence), while allowing for the presence
of a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1 at less than 1 sigma). For all cases
considered here, the lithium problem persists. These results, presented at the

of stellar halos to adopt one or both of the following simplifying assumptions:
(1) stellar mass can be ""painted"" onto dark matter particles in progenitor
satellites; (2) pure dark matter simulations that do not form a luminous galaxy
can be used. We estimate the magnitude of the systematic errors introduced by
these assumptions using a controlled set of stellar halo models where we
independently vary whether we look at star particles or painted dark matter
particles, and whether we use a simulation in which a baryonic disk galaxy
forms or a matching pure dark matter simulation that does not form a baryonic
disk. We find that the ""painting"" simplification reduces the halo concentration
and internal structure, predominantly because painted dark matter particles
have different kinematics than star particles even when both are buried deep in
the potential well of the satellite. The simplification of using pure dark
matter simulations reduces the concentration further, but increases the
internal structure, and results in a more prolate stellar halo. These
differences can be a factor of 1.5-7 in concentration (as measured by the
half-mass radius) and 2-7 in internal density structure. Given this level of
systematic uncertainty, one should be wary of overinterpreting differences
between observations and the current generation of stellar halo models based on
dark matter only simulations when such differences are less than an order of
magnitude.

High specific star-formation rates either result in a much higher ionization

we can rule out that HD47887 and HD47777 are close binaries. Finally, using the
least-squares deconvolution technique, we found that both stars possess a
large-scale magnetic field with an average longitudinal field strength of about
400 G. From a simultaneous fit of the stellar parameters we determine the
evolutionary masses of HD47887 and HD47777 to be 9.4+/-0.7 M0 and 7.6+/-0.5 M0.
Interestingly, HD47777 shows a remarkable helium underabundance, typical of
helium-weak chemically peculiar stars, while the abundances of HD47887 are
normal, which might imply that diffusion is operating in the lower mass star
but not in the slightly more massive one. Furthermore, we argue that the rather
slow rotation, as well as the lack of nitrogen enrichment in both stars, can be
consistent with both the fossil and the binary hypothesis for the origin of the
magnetic field. However, the presence of two magnetic and apparently single
stars near the top of the cluster mass-function may speak in favour of the
latter.

the exact heat kernel for maximally symmetric spaces, we obtain a partial
differential equation which captures the scale-dependence of $f(R)$ for

different background topologies are studied in detail and it is shown that they
affect the gravitational RG flow in a way that is not visible in

rest-frame timescales of ~10^2 - 10^3 d; three of these also show significant
X-ray variability on rest-frame timescales of ~1-10 d. The X-ray variability
properties of our variable sources are similar to those exhibited by nearby and
far less luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While we do not directly
detect a trend of increasing X-ray variability with redshift, we do confirm
previous reports of luminous AGNs exhibiting X-ray variability above that
expected from their luminosities, based on simplistic extrapolation from lower
luminosity sources. This result may be attributed to luminous sources at the
highest redshifts having relatively high accretion rates. Complementary
UV-optical monitoring of our sources shows that variations in their
optical-X-ray spectral energy distribution are dominated by the X-ray
variations. We confirm previous reports of X-ray spectral variations in one of
our sources, HS 1700+6416, but do not detect such variations in any of our
other sources in spite of X-ray flux variations of up to a factor of ~4. This
project is designed to provide a basic assessment of the X-ray variability
properties of RQQs at the highest accessible redshifts that will serve as a
benchmark for more systematic monitoring of such sources with future X-ray

The transition from the 1-mode case to the current algebra level, in which the

quantization), can be done at Lie algebra level. A way to bypass the
difficulties of constructing a (non trivial) Hilbert space representation is to
try and construct directly a $C^*$-algebra rep- resentation and then to look
for its Hilbert space representations. In usual (linear) quantization, this
corresponds to the construction of the Weyl $C^*$-algebra. In this paper, we
produce such a construction for the above mentioned polynomial extension of the
Weyl $C^*$-algebra. The result of this construction is a factorizable system of
local alge- bras localized on bounded Borel subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and
obtained as induc- tive limit of tensor products of finite sets of copies of
the one mode $C^*$-algebra. The $C^*$-embeddings of the inductive system
require some non{trivial re{scaling of the generators of the algebras involved.
These re{scalings are responsible of a $C^*$-analogue of the ""no-go"" theorems,
first met at the level of Fock second quantization, namely the proof that the
family of Fock states defined on the inductive family of $C^*$-algebras is
projective only in the linear case (i.e. the case of the usual Weyl algebra).

occurs in his bordered Khovanov homology and its difference from that in
Khovanov's tangle homology, without being encumbered by any extra homological
algebra. It also provides a simple framework for showing that these theories
are not related through a simple process, thereby confirming recent work of A.
Manion. Furthermore, using Khovanov's conventions and a state sum approach to
the Jones polynomial, we obtain new invariant for tangles in $\Sigma \times

regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the
covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace
operator in a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. On this approximate eigenbasis
the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions
of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference
to be solved under a computational cost scaling as $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$
(initial) and $\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ (hyperparameter learning) with $m$ basis
functions and $n$ data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent
of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast
hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis
with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact
when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to
infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is
independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability
order of the covariance function is increases appropriately, and for the
squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by ${\sim}1/m$
regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert
spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified

modifications on both sides of the Einstein equation to explain some of the
puzzling new findings. What follows is an examination of the source of gravity
that we usually find on the right hand side of Einstein's equation. The outcome
is a modified version of the stress-energy tensor that is the source of the
gravitational field. The derivation is based on the kinetic theory of a gas of
identical particles with no internal structure.
  The presentation here is in two parts. In Part I, I describe the stress
tensor that Xinzhong Chen and I have proposed for the matter tensor for a
nonrelativistic gas with input from Hongling Rao and Jean-Luc Thiffeault. Our
derivation of the equations of fluid dynamics is based on kinetic theory
without recourse to the standard Chapman-Enskog approximation.
  In Part II, I present the analogous derivation of our form for the
stress-energy tensor in the relativistic case. Then I exhibit its application
to the usual isotropic cosmological model. The result of that, in addition to
the Friedmann solution, is a second solution that arises from terms discarded
in the usual Chapman-Enskog approximation. The new solution is a temporal
analogue of a spatial shock wave.
  Just as the usual shock waves make transitions in properties within a mean
free path, the new solution can change its properties appreciably in a mean
flight time. Whereas the Friedmann solution is not dissipative, the new
solution produces entropy at a rate that may be of cosmological interest. For
the calculation of cosmic entropy production I use a formula derived in the
ultrarelativistic limit in which particle masses are negligible.
  Independently of the cosmological aspects, the fluid dynamical equations that
we derive are causal, even for the heat equation (or Fourier equation).

Alfv\'en wave speed by artificially modifying the momentum equation when the
ratio between Lorentz and hydrodynamic forces becomes too large. However,
recent studies have demonstrated that the Alfv\'en wave speed plays a critical
role in the MHD mode conversion process, particularly in determining the
reflection height of the upward propagating helioseismic fast wave. Using

based upon some robustness criterion. LU elimination steps can be very
efficiently parallelized, and are twice as cheap in terms of floating- point
operations, as QR steps. However, LU steps are not necessarily stable, while QR
steps are always stable. The hybrid algorithms execute a QR step when a
robustness criterion detects some risk for instability, and they execute an LU
step otherwise. Ideally, the choice between LU and QR steps must have a small
computational overhead and must provide a satisfactory level of stability with
as few QR steps as possible. In this paper, we introduce several robustness
criteria and we establish upper bounds on the growth factor of the norm of the
updated matrix incurred by each of these criteria. In addition, we describe the

X-ray binary LMC X-3 make this source a touchstone for penetrating studies of
accretion physics. We analyze a rich, 10-year collection of optical/infrared
(OIR) time-series data in conjunction with all available contemporaneous X-ray
data collected by the ASM and PCA detectors aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. A cross-correlation analysis reveals an X-ray lag of ~2 weeks.
Motivated by this result, we develop a model that reproduces the complex OIR
light curves of LMC X-3. The model is comprised of three components of
emission: stellar light; accretion luminosity from the outer disk inferred from
the time-lagged X-ray emission; and light from the X-ray-heated star and outer
disk. Using the model, we filter a strong noise component out of the
ellipsoidal light curves and derive an improved orbital period for the system.
Concerning accretion physics, we find that the local viscous timescale in the
disk increases with the local mass accretion rate; this in turn implies that
the viscosity parameter alpha decreases with increasing luminosity. Finally, we
find that X-ray heating is a strong function of X-ray luminosity below ~50% of
the Eddington limit, while above this limit X-ray heating is heavily
suppressed. We ascribe this behavior to the strong dependence of the flaring in

to overcome the fundamental challenges of existing cellular networks, e.g.,
higher data rates, excellent end-to-end performance and user-coverage in
hot-spots and crowded areas with lower latency, energy consumption and cost per
information transfer. To address these challenges, 5G systems need to adopt a
multi-tier architecture consisting of macrocells, different types of licensed
small cells, relays, and device-to-device (D2D) networks to serve users with
different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements in a spectrum and
energy-efficient manner. Starting with the visions and requirements of 5G
multi-tier networks, this article outlines the challenges of interference
management (e.g., power control, cell association) in these networks with
shared spectrum access (i.e., when the different network tiers shares the same
licensed spectrum). It is argued that the existing interference management
schemes will not be able to address the interference management problem in
prioritized 5G multi-tier networks where users in different tiers have
different priorities for channel access. In this context, a survey and
qualitative comparison of the potential existing cell association and power
control schemes is provided to demonstrate their limitations for interference
management in 5G networks. Open challenges are highlighted and guidelines are
provided to modify the existing schemes in order to overcome these limitations
and make them suitable for the emerging 5G systems.

network possesses all codebooks used in the network. This assumption is however
impractical in distributed ad-hoc and cognitive networks. This work considers
the two- user Gaussian Interference Channel with one Oblivious Receiver
(G-IC-OR), i.e., one receiver lacks knowledge of the interfering cookbook while
the other receiver knows both codebooks. We ask whether, and if so how much,
the channel capacity of the G-IC- OR is reduced compared to that of the
classical G-IC where both receivers know all codebooks. Intuitively, the
oblivious receiver should not be able to jointly decode its intended message
along with the unintended interfering message whose codebook is unavailable. We
demonstrate that in strong and very strong interference, where joint decoding
is capacity achieving for the classical G-IC, lack of codebook knowledge does
not reduce performance in terms of generalized degrees of freedom (gDoF).
Moreover, we show that the sum-capacity of the symmetric G-IC- OR is to within
O(log(log(SNR))) of that of the classical G-IC. The key novelty of the proposed
achievable scheme is the use of a discrete input alphabet for the non-oblivious
transmitter, whose cardinality is appropriately chosen as a function of SNR.

employing finite element method on a coarse mesh $\mathcal{T} _H$ with mesh
size $H$. Then, in step two, the nonlinear system is linearized around the
coarse grid solution, say, $u_H$, which is similar to Newton's type iteration
and the resulting linear system is solved on a finer mesh $\mathcal{T}_h$ with
mesh size $h$. In step three, a correction is obtained through solving a linear
problem on the finer mesh and an updated final solution is derived. Optimal
error estimates in $L^{\infty}({\bf L}^2)$-norm, when $h=\mathcal{O}

$h=\mathcal{O}(H^{4-\delta})$ for the velocity and in $L^{\infty}(L^2)$-norm,
when $h=\mathcal{O}(H^{4-\delta})$ for the pressure are established for

estimates are proved to be valid uniformly in time. Then based on backward
Euler method, a completely discrete scheme is analyzed and {\it a priori} error
estimates are derived. Finally, the paper is concluded with some numerical

solutions of Burgers possess Markov stochastic processes of (generalized)
Lagrangian trajectories backward in time for which the Burgers velocity is a
backward martingale. This property is shown to guarantee dissipativity of
conservation-law anomalies for general convex functions of the velocity. The
backward stochastic Burgers flows with these properties are not unique,
however. We construct infinitely many such stochastic flows, both by a
geometric construction and by the zero-noise limit of the Constantin-Iyer
stochastic representation of viscous Burgers solutions. The latter proof yields
the spontaneous stochasticity of Lagrangian trajectories backward in time for
Burgers, at unit Prandtl number. It is conjectured that existence of a backward
stochastic flow with the velocity as martingale is an admissibility condition
which selects the unique entropy solution for Burgers. We also study linear
transport of passive densities and scalars by inviscid Burgers flows. We show
that shock solutions of Burgers exhibit spontaneous stochasticity backward in

We fix the mixture component distributions across all time periods to overcome

representing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics through time-varying mixture
weights. We constrain the mixture weights to capture weekly seasonality, and
apply a conditionally autoregressive prior on the mixture weights of each

modeling the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 22 {\it
Fermi} BL Lac objects in the frame of a simple one-zone synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model. We obtained the best-fit model parameters and their
uncertainties for each BL Lac object through the $\chi^2$-minimization
procedure and discussed their implications on the physical processes. The
modeling results show that the one-zone SSC model can successfully fit the SEDs
of high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked
BL Lacs (IBLs), but fails to explain the SEDs of low-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs
(LBLs). The statistical analysis results for model parameters are summarized as
follows. (1) No correlation is found between magnetic field ($B$) and the
broken energy of relativistic electrons distribution ($\gamma^{\prime}_{\rm
b}$) for HBLs and IBLs, but there are inverse correlations between
$\gamma^{\prime}_{\rm b}$ and the radius of emitting blob ($R^{\prime}_{\rm
b}$) as well as the electrons number $K^{\prime}_{\rm e}$ for HBLs and IBLs.
It's therefore concluded that the variation of $\gamma^{\prime}_{\rm b}$ is
mainly caused by that of $R^{\prime}_{\rm b}$ rather than $B$ for HBLs and
IBLs. (2) The Poynting flux in jets can not account for the observed radiations
since the power in Poynting flux is smaller than the radiative power, and the
cold protons could be the primary energy carrier in the jets.

constrain the range of m_WDM, WDM is yet to be fully excluded as a solution for

since WDM with mass m_WDM>10 keV decreases the abundance of minihalos by
suppressing the matter power spectrum on small scales via free-streaming, such
WDM can significantly affect the resultant 21 cm line fluctuations from

illuminating the universe at its earliest epochs. Could such events probe the
properties of the first stars at z $\sim$ 20, the end of the cosmic Dark Ages?
Previous studies of Population III GRBs only considered explosions in the
diffuse relic H II regions of their progenitors, or bursts that are far more
more energetic than those observed to date. But the processes that produce GRBs
at the highest redshifts likely reset their local environments, creating much
more complicated structures than those in which relativistic jets have been
modeled so far. These structures can greatly affect the luminosity of the
afterglow, and hence the redshift at which it can be detected. We have now
simulated Population III GRB afterglows in H II regions, winds, and dense
shells ejected by the star during the processes that produce the burst. Our
model, which has been used in previous work, has been extended to include
contributions from reverse shocks, inverse Compton cooling and the effects of
sphericity and beaming in the blast wave, and is valid in a variety of
circumjet density profiles. We find that GRBs with E$_{\mathrm{iso},\gamma} =$
10$^{ 51}$ - 10$^{53}$ erg will be visible at z $\gtrsim$ 20 to the next
generation of near infrared and radio observatories. In many cases, the
environment of the burst, and hence progenitor type, can be inferred from the
afterglow light curve. Although some Population III GRBs are visible to Swift
and the Very Large Array now, the optimal strategy for their detection will be
future missions like EXIST and JANUS, which have large survey areas and onboard
X-ray and infrared telescopes that can track their near infrared flux from the
moment of the burst, thereby identifying its redshift.

0.01(1-\epsilon )/\epsilon (\tau_\mathrm{SF}/5\times 10^9~\mathrm{yr})^{-1}
(f_\mathrm{VLG}/0.5)(t_\mathrm{shat}/10^8~\mathrm{yr})$, where $\epsilon$ is
the star formation efficiency in dense cores, $\tau_\mathrm{SF}$ the timescale
of gas consumption by star formation, $f_\mathrm{VLG}$ the fraction of dust
mass eventually coagulated into VLGs in dense cores, and $t_\mathrm{shat}$ the
lifetime of VLGs (determined by shattering). Adopting their typical values for
the Galaxy, we obtain $\phi_\mathrm{VLG}\sim 0.02$--0.09. This abundance is
well below the value detected in the heliosphere by Ulysses and Galileo, which
means that local enhancement of VLG abundance in the solar neighborhood is
required if the VLGs originate from dense cores. We also show that the effects
of VLGs on the extinction curve are negligible even with the upper value of the
above range, $\phi_\mathrm{VLG}\sim 0.09$. If we adopt an extreme value,
$\phi_\mathrm{VLG}\sim 0.5$, close to that inferred from the above spacecraft
data, the extinction curve is still in the range of the variation in Galactic
extinction curves, but is not typical of the diffuse ISM.

permeability of the subsurface from hydraulic head measurements, within the
framework of a steady Darcy model of groundwater flow. We study geometrically
defined prior permeability fields, which admit layered, fault and channel
structures, in order to mimic realistic subsurface features; within each layer
we adopt either constant or continuous function representation of the
permeability. This prior model leads to a parameter identification problem for
a finite number of unknown parameters determining the geometry, together with
either a finite number of permeability values (in the constant case) or a
finite number of fields (in the continuous function case). We adopt a Bayesian
framework showing existence and well-posedness of the posterior distribution.
We also introduce novel Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which exploit
the different character of the geometric and permeability parameters, and build
on recent advances in function space MCMC. These algorithms provide rigorous
estimates of the permeability, as well as the uncertainty associated with it,
and only require forward model evaluations. No adjoint solvers are required and
hence the methodology is applicable to black-box forward models. We then use
these methods to explore the posterior and to illustrate the methodology with
numerical experiments.

the high end and show that it bends over at very large SFRs (i.e., dust masses
are lower than predicted for a given SFR). We identify several distinct
evolutionary processes in the diagram: (1) A star-bursting phase in which dust
builds up rapidly at early times. The maximum attainable dust mass in this
process is the cause of the bend-over of the relation. A high dust-formation
efficiency, a bottom-light initial mass function, and negligible supernova
shock dust destruction are required to produce sufficiently high dust masses.
(2) A quiescent star-forming phase in which the subsequent parallel decline in
dust mass and SFR gives rise to the Mdust-SFR relation, through astration and
dust destruction. The dust-to-gas ratio is approximately constant along the
relation. We show that the power-law slope of the Mdust-SFR relation is
inversely proportional to the global Schmidt-Kennicutt law exponent (i.e.,
$\sim 0.9$) in simple chemical evolution models. (3) A quenching phase which
causes star formation to drop while the dust mass stays roughly constant or
drops proportionally. Combined with merging, these processes, as well as the
range in total baryonic mass, give rise to a complex population of the diagram
which adds significant scatter to the original Mdust-SFR relation. (4) At very
high redshifts, a population of galaxies located significantly below the local

the procedure of reducing the correlation between the response times and

the symmetric DoF value per message is given by max(min(M/3,N/7),min(2M/7,N/6))
normalized by space dimensions, i.e., piecewise linear depending on M and N
alternatively. While the information theoretic DoF upper bound is established
for every M and N, the achievability relying on linear signal subspace
alignment is established in the spatially-normalized sense in general. In
addition, by deactivating 4 messages to form a two-way relay MIMO X channel, we
also present the DoF result in the similar piecewise linear type. The central

pioneering experiments on retinal ganglion cells, mathematical models have been
vital for advancing our understanding of the receptive fields of visual
neurons. However, existing models were not designed to describe the most
salient attributes of the highly specialized neurons in the V1 to MT motion
processing stream; and they have not been able to do so. Here, we introduce the
Gabor-Einstein wavelet, a new family of functions for representing the
receptive fields of V1 to MT neurons. We show that the way space and time are
mixed in the visual cortex is analogous to the way they are mixed in the
special theory of relativity (STR). Hence we constrained the Gabor-Einstein
model by requiring: (i) relativistic-invariance of the wave carrier, and (ii)
the minimum possible number of parameters. From these two constraints, the sinc
function emerged as a natural descriptor of the wave carrier. The particular
distribution of lowpass to bandpass temporal frequency filtering properties of
V1 to MT neurons (Foster et al 1985; DeAngelis et al 1993b; Hawken et al 1996)
is clearly explained by the Gabor-Einstein basis. Furthermore, it does so in a
manner innately representative of the motion-processing stream's neuronal
hierarchy. Our analysis and computer simulations show that the distribution of
temporal frequency filtering properties along the motion processing stream is a
direct effect of the way the brain jointly encodes space and time. We uncovered
this fundamental link by demonstrating that analogous mathematical structures
underlie STR and joint cortical spacetime encoding. This link will provide new

approximation. This allows us to generalize the phase diagram to larger $m$ and
$k$, showing that for $k \geq 7 $, the system undergoes three entropy driven
phase transitions with increasing density. The nature of the different phase
transitions are established and the critical exponents for the continuous
transitions are determined using finite size scaling.

forms and evolves in the remnant phase. We later model a dense oxygen-rich
ejecta knot that is crossed by the reverse shock in Cas A to study the
evolution of the clump gas phase and the possibility to reform dust clusters in
the post-reverse shock gas.
  Methods: A chemical network including all processes efficient at high gas
temperatures and densities is considered. The formation of key bimolecular
species (CO, SiO) and dust clusters is described. Stiff, coupled, ordinary,
differential equations are solved for the conditions pertaining to both the SN
ejecta and the post-reverse shock gas.
  Results: We find that the ejecta of Type IIb SNe are unable to form large
amounts of molecules and dust clusters as opposed to their Type II-P
counterparts because of their diffuse ejecta. The gas density needs to be
increased by several orders of magnitude to allow the formation of dust
clusters. We show that the chemical composition of the dust clusters changes
drastically and gains in chemical complexity with increasing gas density.
Hence, the ejecta of the Cas A supernova progenitor must have been in the form
of dense clumps to account for the dust chemical composition and masses
inferred from infrared observations of Cas A. We show that the ejecta molecules
in a clump that is processed by the reverse shock reform in the post-reverse
shock gas with lower abundances than those of the initial ejecta clump, except
SiO. These molecules include CO, SiS and O2. Dust clusters are destroyed by the
reverse shock and do not reform in the post-reverse shock gas, even for the
highest gas density. These results indicate that the synthesis of dust grains
from the gas phase in the dense knots of Cas A and in other supernova remnants
is unlikely.

Numerical results show periodic orbits emerging between two critical values of

potentially toxic zinc peaks in plant cells. Buffering is believed to be an
efficient way to deal with strong transient variations in zinc supply. We
extend the model by a buffer reaction and analyze the stability of the steady

alcohols and ethers in different alcohol-based products, e. g. in whisky,

10^{10}-2x10^{11} M_sun which were morphologically selected in the cluster RDCS
J0848+4453 at z=1.27. Our aim is to assess whether they have completed their
mass growth at their redshift or significant mass and/or size growth can or
must take place until z=0 in order to understand whether elliptical galaxies of
clusters follow the observed size evolution of passive galaxies. To compare our
data with the local universe we considered the Kormendy relation derived from
the early-type galaxies of a local Coma Cluster reference sample and the WINGS
survey sample. The comparison with the local Kormendy relation shows that the
luminosity evolution due to the aging of the stellar content already assembled
at z=1.27 brings them on the local relation. Moreover, this stellar content
places them on the size-mass relation of the local cluster ellipticals. These
results imply that for a given mass, the stellar mass at z~1.3 is distributed
within these ellipticals according to the same stellar mass profile of local
ellipticals. We find that a pure size evolution, even mild, is ruled out for
our galaxies since it would lead them away from both the Kormendy and the
size-mass relation. If an evolution of the effective radius takes place, this
must be compensated by an increase in the luminosity, hence of the stellar mass
of the galaxies, to keep them on the local relations. We show that to follow
the Kormendy relation, the stellar mass must increase as the effective radius.
However, this mass growth is not sufficient to keep the galaxies on the
size-mass relation for the same variation in effective radius. Thus, if we want
to preserve the Kormendy relation, we fail to satisfy the size-mass relation
and vice versa.

that seems to escape a general and consensual understanding. Often mixed up
with other system attributes; traditionally used with different meanings in as
many different disciplines; sought or applied through diverse approaches in
various application domains, resilience in fact is a multi-attribute property
that implies a number of constitutive abilities. To further complicate the
matter, resilience is not an absolute property but rather it is the result of
the match between a system, its current condition, and the environment it is
set to operate in. In this paper we discuss this problem and provide a
definition of resilience as a property measurable as a system-environment fit.
This brings to the foreground the dynamic nature of resilience as well as its
hard dependence on the context. A major problem becomes then that, being a
dynamic figure, resilience cannot be assessed in absolute terms. As a way to
partially overcome this obstacle, in this paper we provide a number of
indicators of the quality of resilience. Our focus here is that of collective
systems, namely those systems resulting from the union of multiple individual
parts, sub-systems, or organs. Through several examples of such systems we
observe how our indicators provide insight, at least in the cases at hand, on
design flaws potentially affecting the efficiency of the resilience strategies.
A number of conjectures are finally put forward to associate our indicators

(SI) may address the Higgs naturalness problem. In this article we attempt to
embed accidental dark matter (DM) into SISM, requiring that the symmetry
protecting DM stability is accidental due to the model structure rather than
imposed by hand. In this framework, if the light SM-like Higgs boson is the
pseudo Goldstone boson of SI spontaneously breaking, we can even pine down the
model, two-Higgs-doublets plus a real singlet: The singlet is the DM candidate
and the extra Higgs doublet triggers electroweak symmetry breaking via the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism; Moreover, it dominates DM dynamics. We study
spontaneously breaking of SI using the Gillard-Weinberg approach and find that
the second doublet should acquire vacuum expectation value near the weak scale.
Moreover, its components should acquire masses around 380 GeV except for a
light CP-odd Higgs boson. Based on these features, we explore viable ways to
achieve the correct relic density of DM, facing stringent constraints from
direct detections of DM. For instance, DM annihilates into $b\bar b$ near the
SM-like Higgs boson pole, or into a pair of CP-odd Higgs boson with mass above
that pole.

simultaneous coverage in the optical/UV that was provided in the present case

flux measurements in the FUV were also used for the present analysis. We
successfully modeled the X-ray spectrum together with the optical/UV fluxes
data points using a Comptonization model. We found that a blackbody temperature
of $T \sim 56$ eV accounts for the optical/UV emission originating in the
accretion disk. This temperature serves as input for the Comptonized components
that model the X-ray continuum. Both a warm ($T_{\rm wc} \sim 0.7 $ keV,
$\tau_{\rm wc} \sim 7 $) and a hot corona ($T_{\rm hc} \sim 160 $ keV,
$\tau_{\rm hc} \sim 0.5$) intervene to upscatter the disk photons to X-ray
wavelengths. With the addition of a partially covering ($C_v\sim50\%$) cold

the variable absorber, getting ionized in response to the variations of the

limit for the absorber density derived in this scenario is typical for the
broad line region clouds. Finally, we critically compare this scenario with all

Euler characteristic of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, with

The
galaxies are selected to be homogeneous in terms of the method used to
determine their distances, the sampling of their rotation curves (RCs) and the

the uncertainties on the mass model results. Those RCs are modeled using the
MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) prescription and the observationally
motivated pseudo-isothermal (ISO) dark matter (DM) halo density distribution.
For the MOND models with fixed (M/L), better fits are obtained when the
constant a$_{0}$ is allowed to vary, giving a mean value of (1.13 $\pm$ 0.50)
$\times$ 10$^{-8}$ cm s$^{-2}$, compared to the standard value of 1.21 $\times$
10$^{-8}$ cm s$^{-2}$. Even with a$_{0}$ as a free parameter, MOND provides
acceptable fits (reduced $\chi^{2}_{r}$ $<$ 2) for only 60% (9/15) of the
sample. The data suggest that galaxies with higher central surface brightnesses
tend to favor higher values of the constant a$_{0}$. This poses a serious
challenge to MOND since a$_{0}$ should be a universal constant. For the DM
models, our results confirm that the DM halo surface density of ISO models is
nearly constant at $ \rho_{0} \ R_{C} \sim 120\ M_{\odot} \ pc^{-2}$. This
means that if the (M/L) is determined by stellar population models, ISO DM
models are left with only one free parameter, the DM halo central surface
density.

observatory revealed the detailed spectral and spatial structure of this SNR in
X-rays. The spectral analysis of Chandra X-ray data of Cas A shows unequal flux
levels for different regions of the shell, which can be attributed to different
magnetic fields in those regions. Additionally, the GeV gamma-ray emission

showed that the hadronic processes are dominating in Cas A, a clear signature

modeled the multi-wavelength spectrum of Cas A. We use synchrotron emission
process to explain the observed non-thermal X-ray fluxes from different regions

then used to explain TeV gamma-ray emission spectrum. We also use hadronic
scenario to explain both GeV and TeV fluxes simultaneously. We show that a
leptonic model alone cannot explain the GeV-TeV data. Therefore, we need to
invoke a hadronic model to explain the observed GeV-TeV fluxes. We found that

sizable polarization signal at large scales without invoking the reionization
scenario. We explicitly evaluated the quadrupole TE and EE correlations. We

determination of the large-scale polarization correlations since the average
temperature polarization could be misinterpreted as foreground emission
leading, thereby, to a considerable underestimate of the cosmic microwave
background polarization signal.

cancelation is possible if and only if the field is perfectly aligned. Here,
this result is finally extended to a 3D geometry. Calculations are conducted

results are retrieved in 3D: the instability can never be completely canceled

larger for wave vectors lying in the plan defined by the flow and the oblique

there is a real threat for the conventional systems using face databases, which
store images of users in raw and unaltered form. If compromised not only it is
irrevocable, but can be misused for cross-matching across different databases.
So it is desirable to generate and store revocable templates for the same user
in different applications to prevent cross-matching and to enhance security,

methods it has been observed that the edge detection based on the Roberts Cross

range of concentrations. This is used in conjunction with a calculation of
thermodynamic parameters of the system, including the temperature dependent
sensible enthalpy, configurational entropy and vibrational entropy of the
different crystals in the system, developed from phonon density of states. It
was found that precipitation of hydrides is not thermodynamically favourable
for Zr-H solid solutions containing less than 300 ppm H, suggesting that a
mechanism must cause local concentration of H atoms to a greater amount than
found globally in experimental samples containing hydrides. Temperature drives
the reaction in the direction of solution, primarily due to entropic effects.
Generally, {\gamma} hydride is the most stable phase, although it is very close
in energy to the {\delta}-phase. The sensible enthalpy of precipitation assists
in stabilising HCP hydrides, and the configurational entropy change during
precipitation favours FCC hydrides. None of the thermodynamic contributions are
found to be negligible in driving precipitation.

position measurements from GPR (Greenwich Photographic Result) and

motion of sunspot groups. The sample was also limited to $\pm$58\degr in
Central Meridian Distance (CMD) in order to avoid solar limb effects. We mainly
investigated velocity patterns depending on solar cycle phase and latitude. We
found that meridional motion of sunspot groups is toward the centre of activity
from all available latitudes and in all phases of the solar cycle. The range of
meridional velocities is $\pm10$ m s$^{-1}$. Horizontal Reynolds stress is
negative at all available latitudes and indicates that there is a minimum value
($q\approx$ - 3000 m$^2$ s$^{-2}$) located at $b\approx\pm$30$^{0}$. In our
convention this means that angular momentum is transported toward the solar
equator in agreement with the observed rotational profile of the Sun.

this problem, in this paper, we propose a new and efficient Keyphrases
extraction method based on the Suffix Tree data structure (KpST), the extracted
Keyphrases are then used in the clustering process instead of Full Text

seven linkage techniques and a variety of distance functions and similarity
measures to perform Arabic Document Clustering task. The obtained results show
that our method for extracting Keyphrases increases the quality of the

gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs). MAGIC observed FSRQ PKS 1510-089 in February-April 2012 during a high
activity state in the high energy (HE, E>100 MeV) gamma-ray band observed by
AGILE and Fermi. MAGIC observations result in the detection of a source with
significance of 6.0 sigma. In agreement with the previous VHE observations of
the source, we find no statistically significant variability during the MAGIC
observations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. The other two known VHE
FSRQs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.
  We study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of MAGIC
observation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (GASP-WEBT
and F-Gamma collaborations, REM, Steward, Perkins, Liverpool, OVRO and VLBA
telescopes), X-ray (Swift satellite) and HE gamma-ray frequencies. The
gamma-ray SED combining AGILE, Fermi and MAGIC data joins smoothly and shows no
hint of a break. The multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin for
the millimeter radio and HE gamma-ray emission and the HE gamma-ray flaring
starts when the new component is ejected from the 43GHz VLBA core. The
quasi-simultaneous multifrequency SED is modelled with a one-zone inverse
Compton model. We study two different origins of the seed photons for the
inverse Compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheath
surrounding the jet around the VLBA core. Both models fit the data well.
However, the fast HE gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelled
large emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. We suggest that
these observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulent
plasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standing
conical shock.

network. Ranking algorithms based on random walks are particularly useful
because they connect topological and diffusive properties of the network.
Previous methods based on random walks, as for example the PageRank, have
focused on static structures. However, several realistic networks are indeed
dynamic, meaning that their structure changes in time. In this paper, we
propose a centrality measure for temporal networks based on random walks which
we call TempoRank. While in a static network, the stationary density of the
random walk is proportional to the degree or the strength of a node, we find
that in temporal networks, the stationary density is proportional to the
in-strength of the so-called effective network. The stationary density also
depends on the sojourn probability q which regulates the tendency of the walker
to stay in the node. We apply our method to human interaction networks and show
that although it is important for a node to be connected to another node with
many random walkers at the right moment (one of the principles of the
PageRank), this effect is negligible in practice when the time order of link
activation is included.

resulting from the mixture of several pure spectral signatures. This new model
not only generalizes the commonly used linear mixing model, but also allows for
possible nonlinear effects to be easily handled, relying on mild assumptions
regarding these nonlinearities. The standard nonnegativity and sum-to-one
constraints inherent to spectral unmixing are coupled with a group-sparse
constraint imposed on the nonlinearity component. This results in a new form of
robust nonnegative matrix factorization. The data fidelity term is expressed as
a beta-divergence, a continuous family of dissimilarity measures that takes the
squared Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence as
special cases. The penalized objective is minimized with a block-coordinate
descent that involves majorization-minimization updates. Simulation results
obtained on synthetic and real data show that the proposed strategy competes
with state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear unmixing methods.

average velocity dispersion of 177km/s, circular rotation with a projected
velocity amplitude of 50km/s and a kinematic major axis at a position angle of
-4degrees (west of north). From the average velocity dispersion we estimate a
black hole mass of M_BH=8_{-6}^{+16}x10^7 M_sun. The gas kinematics is
dominated by non-circular motions, mainly along two spiral arms extending from
the nucleus out to 4arcsec (280pc) to the NW and SE, that are cospatial with a
nuclear dusty spiral seen in a structure map of the nuclear region of the
galaxy. The projected gas velocities along the spiral arms show blueshifts in
the far side and redshifts in the near side, with values of up to 200km/s. This
kinematics can be interpreted as gas inflows towards the nucleus along the
spiral arms if the gas is in the plane of the galaxy. We estimate the mass
inflow rate using two different methods. The first is based of the observed
velocities and geometry of the flow, and gives a mass inflow rate in the
ionised gas of 7x10^-2 M_sun/yr. In the second method, we calculate the net
ionised gas mass flow rate through concentric circles of decreasing radii
around the nucleus resulting in mass inflow rates ranging from 0.4 M_sun/yr at
300pc down to 0.2 M_sun/yr at 100pc from the nucleus. These rates are larger

holes in quasars are in the far-UV or soft X-ray band, which are usually not
observed. However, in the disk corona model, the soft photons from the disk are
Comptonized to high energy in the hot corona, and the hard X-ray spectra
(luminosity and spectral shape) contain the information of the incident spectra
from the disk. The values of black hole spin parameter $a_{\ast}$ are inferred
from the spectral fitting, which spread over a large range, $\sim -0.94$ to
$0.998$. We find that the inclination angles and mass accretion rates are well
determined by the spectral fitting, while the results are sensitive to the
accuracy of black hole mass estimates. No tight constraints on the black hole
spins are achieved, if the uncertainties of black hole mass measurements are a
factor of four, which are typical for the single-epoch reverberation mapping
method. Recently, the accuracy of black hole mass measurement has been
significantly improved to $0.2-0.4$~dex with velocity resolved reverberation
mapping method (Pancoast et al., 2014). The black hole spin can be well
constrained if the mass measurement accuracy is $\la 50$\%. In the accretion
disk corona scenario, a fraction of power dissipated in the disk is transported
into the corona, and therefore the accretion disk is thinner than a bare disk
for the same mass accretion rate, because the radiation pressure in the disk is
reduced. We find that the thin disk approximation, $H/R\la 0.1$, is still valid
if $0.3<\dot{m}<0.5$, provided a half of the dissipated power is radiated in
the corona above the disk.

method calculations of terahertz wave propagation within LiNbO$_{3}$ waveguides
with randomly arranged air-filled circular scatterers exhibit an onset of
Anderson localization at experimentally accessible length scales. Results for
the average transmission as a function of waveguide length and scatterer
density demonstrate a clear crossover from diffusive to localized transport
regime. In addition, we find that transmission fluctuations grow dramatically
when crossing into the localized regime. Our numerical results are in good

consistent coupled condensate and noncondensate number dynamics, to an
$n$-component condensate. The resulting system of equations comprises, for each

Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. Lower-order approximations yield general
formulations for multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations, and systems of
multi-component Gross-Pitaevskii equations coupled to multi-component modified
number-conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The analysis is left general,
such that, in the $n$-component condensate, there may or may not be mutually
coherent components. An expansion in powers of the ratio of noncondensate to
condensate particle numbers for each coherent set is used to derive the
self-consistent, second-order, dynamical equations of motion. The advantage of
the analysis developed in this article is in its applications to dynamical
instabilities that appear when two (or more) components are in conflict and
where a significant noncondensed fraction of atoms is expected to appear.

parametric model for the data, and then estimate the parameters from historical
data. This approach suffers from several problems. Firstly, how is estimation
error to be quantified, and then taken into account when making statements
about the future behaviour of the observed time series? Secondly, decisions may
be taken today committing to future actions over some quite long horizon, as in
the trading of derivatives; if the model is re-estimated at some intermediate
time, our earlier decisions would need to be revised - but the derivative has
already been traded at the earlier price. Thirdly, the exact form of the
parametric model to be used is generally taken as given at the outset; other
competitor models might possibly work better in some circumstances, but the
methodology does not allow them to be factored into the inference. What we
propose here is a very simple (Bayesian) alternative approach to inference and
action in financial econometrics which deals decisively with all these issues.
The key feature is that nothing is being estimated.

distributions, which are respectively the independence and the maximum
dependency. When the variables are dependent given the class, this approach is
expected to reduce the biases of the latent class model. Indeed, it produces a
meaningful dependency model with only a few additional parameters. The
parameters are estimated, by maximum likelihood, by means of an EM algorithm.
Moreover, a Gibbs sampler is used for model selection in order to overcome the
computational intractability of the combinatorial problems involved by the

walk theory concerning the universality of the ubiquitous first-passage-time

number of steps needed for a walker starting at the origin to land on the
positive semi-axes does not depend on the details of the distribution for the
jumps of the walker, provided this distribution is symmetric and continuous,
where in particular $\rho_n \sim n^{-3/2}$ for large number of steps $n$. On
the other hand, there are many physical situations in which the time spent by
the walker in doing one step depends on the length of the step and the interest
concentrates on the time needed for a return, not on the number of steps. Here
we modify the Sparre-Andersen proof to deal with such cases, in rather general
situations in which the time variable correlates with the step variable. As an
example we present a natural process in 2D that shows deviations from normal

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, also known as
massive MIMO, where there are hundreds of antennas at one side of the link.
Motivated by the fact that computational complexity is one of the main
challenges in such systems, a set of low-complexity Bayesian channel
estimators, coined Polynomial ExpAnsion CHannel (PEACH) estimators, are
introduced for arbitrary channel and interference statistics. While the
conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator has cubic complexity in
the dimension of the covariance matrices, due to an inversion operation, our
proposed estimators significantly reduce this to square complexity by
approximating the inverse by a L-degree matrix polynomial. The coefficients of
the polynomial are optimized to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the
estimate.
  We show numerically that near-optimal MSEs are achieved with low polynomial
degrees. We also derive the exact computational complexity of the proposed
estimators, in terms of the floating-point operations (FLOPs), by which we
prove that the proposed estimators outperform the conventional estimators in
large-scale MIMO systems of practical dimensions while providing a reasonable
MSEs. Moreover, we show that L needs not scale with the system dimensions to
maintain a certain normalized MSE. By analyzing different interference
scenarios, we observe that the relative MSE loss of using the low-complexity
PEACH estimators is smaller in realistic scenarios with pilot contamination. On
the other hand, PEACH estimators are not well suited for noise-limited
scenarios with high pilot power; therefore, we also introduce the
low-complexity diagonalized estimator that performs well in this regime.

geographic distance between two users and the photo count of users play an
important role in their dating behaviors. Our results show that it is important
to differentiate between users' true preferences and random selection. Some
user behaviors in choosing attributes in a potential date may largely be a
result of random selection. We also find that both males and females are more
likely to reply to users whose attributes come closest to the stated
preferences of the receivers, and there is significant discrepancy between a
user's stated dating preference and his/her actual online dating behavior.

with a compound antecedent, are true but only trivially so, and provide no new
contingent information about specific quantum systems (except in special cases
already identified in the literature).

externally imposed magnetic field, and a case with self-sustained magnetic
fields. Evidence of long-term memory and $1/f$ noise is observed in experiments
and simulations, in the case with weak magnetic field associated with the

  quantitative analysis of the literature","Accepted for publication in Research Evaluation",,,,"cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the subject of research excellence has received increasing attention (in
science policy) over the last few decades, increasing numbers of bibliometric
studies have been published dealing with excellent papers. However, many
different methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers.
The present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in
order to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an ""average""
or ""most frequent"" bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science
yielded 321 papers dealing with ""highly cited"", ""most cited"", ""top cited"" and
""most frequently cited"". Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study.
In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition
has been provided with which to identify excellent papers. With definitions
which relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers
(58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Around
23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an
arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3%
(median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top
10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be
possible to identify excellent papers based on an ""average"" or ""most frequent""
practice among bibliometricians.

\bar K^o$ meson transitions into $K_S (K^o_1)$ mesons at $CP$ violation in weak
interactions. The first approach uses the standard theory of oscillations and
the second approach supposes that ($K_S, K_L$) states which arise at $CP$
violation are normalized but not orthogonal state functions then there arise
interferences between these states but not oscillations. It is necessary to
remark that the available experimental data are in good agreement with the
second approach. So we came to the conclusion that oscillations do not arise at
$CP$ violation in weak interactions in the system of $K^o$ mesons. Only
interference between two - $K_S, K_L$ states takes place there.

  July 26, 2013",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  This pilot study explored physiological responses to playing and listening to
the Native American flute. Autonomic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and heart
rate variability (HRV) metrics were recorded while participants (N = 15) played
flutes and listened to several styles of music. Flute playing was accompanied
by an 84% increase in HRV (p < .001). EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity increased
while playing flutes (p = .007) and alpha (8-12 Hz) increased while playing
lower-pitched flutes (p = .009). Increase in alpha from baseline to the flute
playing conditions strongly correlated with experience playing Native American
flutes (r = +.700). Wide-band beta (12-25 Hz) decreased from the silence
conditions when listening to solo Native American flute music (p = .013). The
findings of increased HRV, increasing slow-wave rhythms, and decreased beta
support the hypothesis that Native American flutes, particularly those with
lower pitches, may have a role in music therapy contexts. We conclude that the
Native American flute may merit a more prominent role in music therapy and that
a study of the effects of flute playing on clinical conditions, such as
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), hypertension, anxiety, and major depressive disorder, is
warranted.

  regional surface temperature and cloud","30 pages, 15 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work indicates that 27 day variations in cosmic ray flux during 2007
2009 are phase locked to 27 day variations in cloud and surface temperature at
Shetland. Here we extend the study to other regions including Central England,
US and Australia and to several other annual intervals that exhibit strong 27
day variation in cosmic ray flux and sunspot area. Band pass filtering was used
to obtain 27 day components of daily maximum temperature in each region and 27
day components of cloud variation were determined, in Australia only, from
solar exposure records. When cosmic ray flux is the dominant influence phase
locked variations in surface temperature occur in each of the regions with,
however, in phase or anti phase variation in different regions. Similar phase
locking of 27 day variation in surface temperature to sunspot area variation
occurs when sunspot activity is the dominant influence with indications that
changes from in phase to anti phase variation are linked to flipping of sunspot
activity from one active longitude to another. The 27 day component of cloud in
Australia was phase locked to the 27 day component of temperature in Central
England in two of the intervals studied, 1997 and 2005, indicating the global
nature of the connection between solar disturbance and the lower atmosphere. It
was observed that very large swings in 27 day temperature components are often
correlated with 27 day variation in solar activity.

  Negative Opinions",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is about simulating the spread of opinions in a society and about
finding ways to counteract that spread. To abstract away from potentially
emotionally laden opinions, we instead simulate the spread of a zombie outbreak
in a society. The virus causing this outbreak is different from traditional
approaches: it not only causes a binary outcome (healthy vs infected) but
rather a continuous outcome. To counteract the outbreak, a discrete number of
infection-level specific treatments is available. This corresponds to acts of
mild persuasion or the threats of legal action in the opinion spreading use
case. This paper offers a genetic and a cultural algorithm that find the
optimal mixture of treatments during the run of the simulation. They are
assessed in a number of different scenarios. It is shown, that albeit far from
being perfect, the cultural algorithm delivers superior performance at lower
computational expense.

particular it turns out that the spring balance, which keeps the body at rest
