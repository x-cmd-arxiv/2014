detection methods, based on connected image-components, perform very poorly on
this data. An alternative, geometrically-principled method is introduced here,
based on the Hough transform. The projection of a chequerboard is represented
by two pencils of lines, which are identified as oriented clusters in the
gradient-data of the image. A projective Hough transform is applied to each of
the two clusters, in axis-aligned coordinates. The range of each transform is
properly bounded, because the corresponding gradient vectors are approximately
parallel. Each of the two transforms contains a series of collinear peaks; one
for every line in the given pencil. This pattern is easily detected, by
sweeping a dual line through the transform. The proposed Hough-based method is
compared to the standard OpenCV detection routine, by application to several
hundred time-of-flight images. It is shown that the new method detects
significantly more calibration boards, over a greater variety of poses, without
any overall loss of accuracy. This conclusion is based on an analysis of both

extension of) this mapping need not necessarily map the vertices of $P$ to
those $Q$. In this case, one wants to find the ``best"" mapping between these
polygons, i.e., one that minimizes the maximum angle distortion (the
dilatation) over \textit{all} points in $P$. From complex analysis such maps
are known to exist and are unique. They are called extremal quasiconformal
maps, or Teichm\""{u}ller maps.
  Although there are many efficient ways to compute or approximate conformal
maps, there is currently no such algorithm for extremal quasiconformal maps.
This paper studies the problem of computing extremal quasiconformal maps both
in the continuous and discrete settings.
  We provide the first constructive method to obtain the extremal
quasiconformal map in the continuous setting. Our construction is via an
iterative procedure that is proven to converge quickly to the unique extremal
map. To get to within $\epsilon$ of the dilatation of the extremal map, our
method uses $O(1/\epsilon^{4})$ iterations. Every step of the iteration
involves convex optimization and solving differential equations, and guarantees
a decrease in the dilatation. Our method uses a reduction of the polygon
mapping problem to that of the punctured sphere problem, thus solving a more
general problem.
  We also discretize our procedure. We provide evidence for the fact that the
discrete procedure closely follows the continuous construction and is therefore
expected to converge quickly to a good approximation of the extremal
quasiconformal map.

systems (NCS) due to their ubiquitous presence in industrial applications, and,
in the particular case of wireless NCS, because of their architectural
flexibility and low installation and maintenance costs. In wireless NCS the
communication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a
communication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication
delays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical non-idealities
leading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCS
have been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCS under
more complex and general objectives, and in particular results dealing with
verification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more
limited. This work investigates how to address such complex objectives by
constructively deriving symbolic models of NCS, while encompassing the
mentioned network non-idealities. The obtained abstracted (symbolic) models can
then be employed to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing rich logical
specifications over the concrete NCS models. Examples of such general
specifications include properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal
logic (LTL) or as automata on infinite strings. We thus provide a general
synthesis framework that can be flexibly adapted to a number of NCS setups. We
illustrate the effectiveness of the results over some case studies.

assuming that a residual symmetry $S_\nu$ appropriate for describing a massless
neutrino is contained in $G_f$. It is shown that all the groups $G_f$ admitting
three dimensional faithful irreducible representation and generated from a
specific set of $3\times 3$ matrices imply only one of the three flavour
compositions for the massless state namely, unmixed, maximally mixed with equal
probabilities and bimaximally mixed with probabilities (0,1/2,1/2) and their
permutations. This result holds irrespective of the order of $G_f$ and the
choice of $S_{\nu}$ within it. All of these lead to unfavourable leading order
prediction for the solar mixing angle. Neutrino mixing pattern is then
numerically investigated in case of subgroups of $U(3)$ with order less than
512 and it is found that only one of these can lead to a massless neutrino and
leading order predictions for all the mixing angles close to their experimental
values. Ways to correct for the solar angle prediction are proposed and two
concrete examples giving the observed mixing pattern are discussed.

produce mixtures of robust vortices and alternating zonal jets, as seen in the
atmospheres of the gas giant planets. However, simulations that include
Rayleigh friction invariably produce a sub-rotating (retrograde) equatorial jet
for Jovian parameter regimes, whilst observations of Jupiter show a
super-rotating (prograde) equatorial jet that has persisted over several
decades. Super-rotating equatorial jets have recently been obtained in shallow
water simulations that include a Newtonian relaxation of perturbations to the
layer thickness to model radiative cooling to space, and in simulations of the
thermal shallow water equations that include a similar relaxation term in their
temperature equation. Simulations of global quasigeostrophic forms of these
different models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as the parent
models, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for setting the direction
lies within quasigeostrophic theory. We provide such a mechanism by calculating
the effective force acting on the thickness-weighted zonal mean flow due to the
decay of an equatorially trapped Rossby wave. Decay due to Newtonian cooling
creates an eastward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with the
formation of a super-rotating equatorial jet, while decay due to Rayleigh
friction leads to a westward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with
the formation of a sub-rotating equatorial jet. In both cases the meridionally
integrated zonal mean of the absolute zonal momentum is westward, consistent
with the standard result that Rossby waves carry westward pseudomomentum, but
this does not preclude the zonal mean flow being eastward on and close to the
equator.

detectability. In microlensing events, the light centroid shift in the source
trajectory (the astrometric trajectory) falls off much more slowly than the
light amplification as the source distance from the lens position increases. As
a result, perturbations developed with time such as lens orbital motion can
make considerable deviations in astrometric trajectories. The rotation of the
source trajectory due to lens orbital motion produces a more detectable
astrometric deviation because the astrometric cross-section is much larger than
the photometric one. Among binary microlensing events with detectable
astrometric trajectories, those with stellar-mass black holes have most likely
detectable astrometric signatures of orbital motion. Detecting lens orbital
motion in their astrometric trajectories helps to discover further secondary
components around the primary even without any photometric binarity signature
as well as resolve close/wide degeneracy. For these binary microlensing events,
we evaluate the efficiency of detecting orbital motion in astrometric
trajectories and photometric light curves by performing Monte Carlo simulation.
We conclude that astrometric efficiency is 87.3 per cent whereas the
photometric efficiency is 48.2 per cent.

deflagration, together with a modification that takes into account the partial
spin reversal, fits the transverse field dependence of the front speed but not
its dependence on longitudinal field. The most significant result of this study

explaining that the first Symanzik polynomial is the determinant of the period
matrix of the graph, and the second Symanzik polynomial is expressed in terms
of world-line Green's functions. We then review the relation between Feynman
graphs and variations of mixed Hodge structures. Finally, we provide an
algorithm for generating the Picard-Fuchs equation satisfied by the all equal
mass banana graphs in a two-dimensional space-time to all loop orders.

would provide very strong evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM), given
that there are no known astrophysical processes that could mimic such a signal.
From the particle physics perspective, perhaps the simplest explanation for a
gamma ray peak is internal bremsstrahlung in DM annihilation through a charged
t-channel mediator eta close in mass to the DM particle chi. Since DM
annihilation to quarks is already tightly constrained in this scenario, we
focus here on the leptophilic case. We compute the electromagnetic anapole and
dipole moments that DM acquires at 1-loop, and we find an interesting
enhancement of these moments if the DM particle and the mediator are close in
mass. We constrain the DM anapole and dipole moments using direct detection
data, and then translate these limits into bounds on the DM annihilation cross
section. Our bounds are highly competitive with those from astrophysical gamma
ray searches. In the second part of the paper, we derive complementary
constraints on internal bremsstrahlung in DM annihilation using LEP mono-photon
data, measurements of the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the
muon, and searches for lepton flavor violation. We also comment on the impact
of the internal bremsstrahlung scenario on the hyperfine splitting of true
muonium.

resolution cosmological N-body simulation, the Millennium-II run, combined with
a sophisticated semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to explore statistically
whether the local void is allowed within our current knowledge of galaxy
formation in LCDM. We find that about 15 percent of the Local Group analogue
systems (11 of 77) in our simulation are associated with nearby low density
regions having size and 'emptiness' similar to those of the observed Local
Void. This suggests that, rather than a crisis of the LCDM, the emptiness of
the Local Void is indeed a success of the standard LCDM theory. The paucity of
faint galaxies in such voids results from a combination of two factors: a lower
amplitude of the halo mass function in the voids than in the field, and a lower
galaxy formation efficiency in void haloes due to halo assembly bias effects.
While the former is the dominated factor, the later also plays a sizable role.
The halo assembly bias effect results in a stellar mass fraction 25 percent
lower for void galaxies when compared to field galaxies with the same halo
mass.

agents to track the average of their dynamic inputs with some steady-state
error whose size can be controlled using a design parameter. This steady-state
error vanishes for special classes of input signals. We analyze the asymptotic
correctness of the algorithm under time-varying interaction topologies and
characterize the requirements on the stepsize for discrete-time

the local input of each agent. Building on this analysis, we synthesize an
extension of the algorithm that allows individual agents to control their own
rate of convergence towards agreement and handle saturation bounds on the
driving command. Finally, we show that the proposed extension additionally
preserves the privacy of the transient response of the agreement states and the
final agreement value from internal and external adversaries. Numerical

so that we can reach the equivalent of 3 X 3072^3~87 billion particles in a

the latest Planck (2013) results, although we also explore the effect of slight

chosen to be in agreement with the latest Planck results, we built a grid of

these six relevant parameters. We improve upon previous studies by not only
measuring the effect of each parameter individually, but also probing the
impact of the simultaneous variation of each pair of parameters. We thus

optimization provides a promising approach to design geometrically
sophisticated structures which can be directly manufactured. Traditional
topology optimization methods aim at finding the conceptual design but often
lack a sufficient resolution of the geometry and structural response, needed to
directly use the optimized design for manufacturing. To overcome these
limitations, this paper studies the viability and characteristics of the
eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) in combination with the Level-Set Method
(LSM) for topology optimization of three dimensional structural design
problems. The LSM describes the geometry by defining the nodal level set values
via explicit functions of the optimization variables. The structural response
is predicted by a generalized version of the XFEM. The LSM-XFEM approach is
compared against results from a traditional Solid Isotropic Material with
Penalization (SIMP) method for two-phase ``solid-void'' and ``solid-solid''
problems. The numerical results demonstrate that the LSM-XFEM approach can
describe crisply the geometry and predict the structural response of complex
three-dimensional structures with acceptable accuracy even on coarse meshes.
However, the LSM-XFEM studied here lacks a robust and intuitive formulation to
control the minimum feature size, and the optimization results may depend on
the initial design.

exploiting the ``channel hardening'' effect of high dimensional MIMO channels,
we devise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlying

involves time windows, split collection and linear weight-related cost, which
is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time
windows (SDVRPTW). This problem consists of determining least-cost vehicle
routes to serve a set of customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle
capacity and time windows. The travel cost per unit distance is a linear
function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by
multiple vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose a exact
branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, where the pricing subproblem is a
resource-constrained elementary least-cost path problem. We first prove that at
least an optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an
extreme collection pattern, and then design a tailored and novel label-setting
algorithm to solve it. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm
can handle both the SDVRPTW and our problem effectively.

that the foundations of modern cryptography are built from probabilistic

the very reason why cryptographic constructions often resemble low level

detect small metal-rich ejecta features extending out to the outermost boundary
of B0049-73.6, which were not seen in the previous data with a shorter
exposure. The central nebula is dominated by emission from reverse-shocked
ejecta material enriched in O, Ne, Mg, and Si. O-rich ejecta distribution is
relatively smooth throughout the central nebula. In contrast the Si-rich

produced by an asymmetric core-collapse explosion of a massive star. The
estimated abundance ratios among these ejecta elements are in plausible
agreement with the nucleosynthesis products from the explosion of a

nebula extends to $\sim$9 pc from the SNR center. This suggests that the

bounds on the size of deletion-correcting codes. This method is based upon
tools from hypergraph theory. The deletion channel is represented by a
hypergraph whose edges are the deletion balls (or spheres), so that a
deletion-correcting code becomes a matching in this hypergraph. Consequently, a
bound on the size of such a code can be obtained from bounds on the matching
number of a hypergraph. Classical results in hypergraph theory are then invoked
to compute an upper bound on the matching number as a solution to a
linear-programming problem.
  The method by Kulkarni and Kiyavash can be applied not only for the deletion
channel but also for other error channels. This paper studies this method in
its most general setup. First, it is shown that if the error channel is regular
and symmetric then this upper bound coincides with the sphere packing bound and
thus is called the generalized sphere packing bound. Even though this bound is
explicitly given by a linear programming problem, finding its exact value may
still be a challenging task. In order to simplify the complexity of the
problem, we present a technique based upon graph automorphisms that in many
cases reduces the number of variables and constraints in the problem. We then
apply this method on specific examples of error channels. We start with the $Z$
channel and show how to exactly find the generalized sphere packing bound for
this setup. Next studied is the non-binary limited magnitude channel both for
symmetric and asymmetric errors, where we focus on the single-error case. We
follow up on the deletion and grain-error channels and show how to improve upon
the existing upper bounds for single deletion/error. Finally, we apply this
method for projective spaces and find its generalized sphere packing bound for
the single-error case.

technique for tensor completion through explicitly capturing the multilinear
latent factors. The existing CP algorithms require the tensor rank to be
manually specified, however, the determination of tensor rank remains a
challenging problem especially for CP rank. In addition, existing approaches do
not take into account uncertainty information of latent factors, as well as
missing entries. To address these issues, we formulate CP factorization using a
hierarchical probabilistic model and employ a fully Bayesian treatment by
incorporating a sparsity-inducing prior over multiple latent factors and the
appropriate hyperpriors over all hyperparameters, resulting in automatic rank
determination. To learn the model, we develop an efficient deterministic
Bayesian inference algorithm, which scales linearly with data size. Our method
is characterized as a tuning parameter-free approach, which can effectively
infer underlying multilinear factors with a low-rank constraint, while also
providing predictive distributions over missing entries. Extensive simulations
on synthetic data illustrate the intrinsic capability of our method to recover
the ground-truth of CP rank and prevent the overfitting problem, even when a
large amount of entries are missing. Moreover, the results from real-world
applications, including image inpainting and facial image synthesis,
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for both
tensor factorization and tensor completion in terms of predictive performance.

Gravity, an alternative theory of gravitation, which is a direct extension of
General Relativity. Following previous studies in the literature, we introduce
an explicit expression of the Kerr metric in Conformal Gravity, which naturally
reduces to the standard General Relativity Kerr geometry in the absence of
Conformal Gravity effects. As in the standard case, we show that the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation governing geodesic motion in a space-time based on
this geometry is indeed separable and that a fourth constant of motion-similar
to Carter's constant-can also be introduced in Conformal Gravity. Consequently,
we derive the fundamental equations of geodesic motion and show that the
problem of solving these equations can be reduced to one of quadratures. In
particular, we study the resulting time-like geodesics in Conformal Gravity
Kerr geometry by numerically integrating the equations of motion for Earth
flyby trajectories of spacecraft. We then compare our results with the existing
data of the Flyby Anomaly in order to ascertain whether Conformal Gravity
corrections are possibly the origin of this gravitational anomaly. Although
Conformal Gravity slightly affects the trajectories of geodesic motion around a
rotating spherical object, we show that these corrections are minimal and are
not expected to be the origin of the Flyby Anomaly, unless conformal parameters
are drastically different from current estimates. Therefore, our results
confirm previous analyses, showing that modifications due to Conformal Gravity
are not likely to be detected at the Solar System level, but might affect
gravity at the galactic or cosmological scale.

with interacting components. In particular, this concept is commonly used to
model interactions between genes and identify closely associated genes forming
functional modules. In this paper, we focus on gene group interactions and
infer these interactions using appropriate partial correlations between genes,
that is, the conditional dependencies between genes after removing the
influences of a set of other functionally related genes. We introduce a new
method for estimating group interactions using sparse canonical correlation
analysis (SCCA) coupled with repeated random partition and subsampling of the
gene expression data set. By considering different subsets of genes and ways of
grouping them, our interaction measure can be viewed as an aggregated estimate
of partial correlations of different orders. Our approach is unique in
evaluating conditional dependencies when the correct dependent sets are unknown
or only partially known. As a result, a gene network can be constructed using
the interaction measures as edge weights and gene functional groups can be
inferred as tightly connected communities from the network. Comparisons with
several popular approaches using simulated and real data show our procedure
improves both the statistical significance and biological interpretability of
the results. In addition to achieving considerably lower false positive rates,
our procedure shows better performance in detecting important biological
pathways.

  Geometries","27 pages, 72 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new approach for simulating flows over complex geometries is developed by
introducing an accurate virtual interpolation point scheme as well as a virtual
local stencil approach. The present method is based on the concept of point
collocation on a virtual staggered structure together with a fractional step
method. The use of a virtual staggered structure arrangement, which stores all
the variables at the same physical location and employs only one set of nodes
using virtual interpolation points, reduces the geometrical complexity. The
virtual staggered structure consists of the virtual interpolation points and
the virtual local stencil. Also, computational enhancement of the virtual
interpolation point method is considerable since the present method directly
discretizes the strong forms of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
without numerical integration. It makes a key difference from others. In the
virtual interpolation point method, the choice of an accurate interpolation
scheme satisfying the spatial approximation in the complex domain is important
because there is the virtual staggered structure for computation of the
velocities and pressure since there is no explicit staggered structure for
stability. In our proposed method, the high order derivative approximations for
constructing node-wise difference equations are easily obtained. Several
different flow problems (decaying vortices, lid-driven cavity, triangular
cavity, flow over a circular cylinder and a bumpy cylinder) are simulated using
the virtual interpolation point method and the results agree very well with
previous numerical and experimental results. They verify the accuracy of the
present method.

the LHC has heralded a new era in understanding the nature of electroweak
symmetry breaking and possibly completing the standard model of particle
physics. Since the first observation in decays to gamma gamma, WW, and ZZ boson
pairs, an extensive set of measurements of the mass and couplings to W and Z
bosons, as well as multiple tests of the spin-parity quantum numbers, have
revealed that the properties of the new boson are consistent with those of the
long-sought agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. An important
open question is whether the new particle also couples to fermions, and in
particular to down-type fermions, since the current measurements mainly
constrain the couplings to the up-type top quark. Determination of the
couplings to down-type fermions requires direct measurement of the
corresponding Higgs boson decays, as recently reported by the CMS experiment in
the study of Higgs decays to bottom quarks and tau leptons. In this paper we
report the combination of these two channels which results, for the first time,
in strong evidence for the direct coupling of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to
down-type fermions, with an observed significance of 3.8 standard deviations,

phenomena occurring at totally different pulsar systems. In this paper, they
are simply interpreted by the same mechanism, residual Doppler shift. In a
binary system with periodic signals sending to an observer, the drift of the
signal frequency actually changes with the varying orbital velocity, projected
to line of sight at different phases of orbit. And it has been taken for
granted that the net red-shift and blue-shift of an full orbit circle be
cancelled out, so that the effect of Doppler shift to the signal in binary
motion cannot be accumulated over the orbital period. However, taking the
propagation time at each velocity state into account, the symmetry of the
velocity distribution over the orbital phase is broken. Consequently, the net
Doppler shift left in an orbit is non-zero. Understanding this Newtonian second
Doppler effect not only makes pulsars better laboratory in the test of
gravitational effects, but also allows us to extract the angular momentum of
the pulsar of PSR J2051-0827, $\leq 2\times 10^{43}gcm^2$; and the accretion

M-class flare SOL2010-08-07T18:24. We aim to determine the properties of the
heated plasma in the flare ribbons, and to understand the partition of the
power input into radiative and conductive losses. Using GOES, SDO/EVE, SDO/AIA
and RHESSI we measure the temperature, emission measure and differential
emission measure of the flare ribbons, and deduce approximate density values.
The non-thermal emission measure, and the collisional thick target energy input
to the ribbons are obtained from RHESSI using standard methods. We deduce the
existence of a substantial amount of plasma at 10 MK in the flare ribbons,
during the pre-impulsive and early-impulsive phase of the flare. The average
column emission measure of this hot component is a few times 10^28/cm^5, and we
can calculate that its predicted conductive losses dominate its measured
radiative losses. If the power input to the hot ribbon plasma is due to
collisional energy deposition by an electron beam from the corona then a
low-energy cutoff of around 5 keV is necessary to balance the conductive
losses, implying a very large electron energy content. Independent of the
standard collisional thick-target electron beam interpretation, the observed
non-thermal X-rays can be provided if one electron in 10^3 - 10^4 in the 10 MK
(1 keV) ribbon plasma has an energy above 10 keV. We speculate that this could
arise if a non-thermal tail is generated in the ribbon plasma which is being

the information bits conveyed through modulation symbols (e.g.,QAM).
Pseudo-random phase precoding (PRPP) is a technique that can achieve high

modulation bits and the antenna index bits are precoded by pseudo-random
phases. The proposed PRPP-SM system gives significant performance gains over SM

matrix and BPSK modulation, the performance of PRPP-SM using ML detection is
better than SM without PRPP with ML detection by about 9 dB at $10^{-2}$ BER.
This performance advantage gets even better for large precoding sizes.

between different planet formation mechanisms, which predict different
accretion histories. In this Letter, we use \HST/WFC3 UVIS optical photometry
to measure accretion rates onto three accreting objects, GSC06214-00210 b, GQ
Lup b, and DH Tau b, that are at the planet/brown dwarf boundary and are
companions to solar mass stars. The excess optical emission in the excess
accretion continuum yields mass accretion rates of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$
\Msol/yr for these three objects. Their accretion rates are an order of
magnitude higher than expected from the correlation between mass and accretion
rates measured from the UV excess, which is applicable if these wide planetary
mass companions formed by protostellar core fragmentation. The high accretion
rates and large separation from the central star demonstrate the presence of
massive disks around these objects. Models for the formation and evolution of
wide planetary mass companions should account for their large accretion rates.
High ratios of H$\alpha$ luminosity over accretion luminosity for objects with
low accretion rates suggest that searches for H$\alpha$ emission may be an
efficient way to find accreting planets.

Rev. Lett. {\bf 101},

exerts a transverse force and produces a lateral displacement of the fiber's
lower end. The experiment is of obvious theoretical interest in connection with
the electromagnetic theory of media. Suggested explanations given for this
effect in the past include the famous Abraham-Minkowski issue concerning the
""correct"" photon momentum in matter. In our opinion such an explanation can
hardly be right. Instead, we propose instead a very simple description of the
effect implying that the sideways deflection is caused by the radiation force
on the {\it obliquely cut} lower end face of the fiber. From a calculation
based upon geometrical optics, we find quite good agreement with the
observations. We present also, as an alternative approach, a calculation
involving wave optics instead of geometrical optics, and find comparable
results.

Galactic Cepheids with initial masses 5.5M_\odot <= Mzams <= 13M_\odot,
chemical composition X=0.7, Z=0.02 and periods 1.5 day <= P <= 100 day are
obtained from consistent stellar evolution and nonlinear stellar pulsation
computations. Pulsational instability was investigated for three crossings of
the instability strip by the evolutionary track in the HR diagram. The first
crossing occurs at the post-main sequence helium core gravitational contraction
stage which proceeds in the Kelvin--Helmholtz timescale whereas the second and
the third crossings take place at the evolutionary stage of thermonuclear core
helium burning. During each crossing of the instability strip the period of
radial pulsations is a quadratic function of the stellar evolution time.
Theoretical rates of the pulsation period change agree with observations but
the scatter of observational estimates of dP/dt noticeably exceeds the width of
the band (\delta\log |dP/dt| <= 0.6) confining evolutionary tracks in the
period - period change rate diagram. One of the causes of the large scatter
with very high values of dP/dt in Cepheids with increasing periods might be the
stars that cross the instability strip for the first time. Their fraction
ranges from 2% for Mzams=5.5M_\odot to 9% for Mzams=13M_\odot. Variable stars
\alpha UMi and IX Cas seem to belong to such objects.

oscillation is observed in both emerging entities. We propose to call these

their character after collisions. We derived an exact mathematical model for
oscillatons and showed that the well known one soliton solutions are a

greater emphasis on undirected graphs. We then turn our attention to the
stability of graphs which have every edge on a triangle, but with the fresh
outlook provided by TF-automorphisms. Amongst such graphs are strongly regular
graphs with certain parameters. The advantages of this fresh outlook are
highlighted when we ultimately present a method of constructing and generating
unstable graphs with large diameter having every edge lying on a triangle. This
was a rather surprising outcome.
