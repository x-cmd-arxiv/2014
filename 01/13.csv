elongated Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor image patterns. Image correlation
techniques can be used to determine local wavefront slope by correlating each
sub-aperture image with its expected elongated shape, or reference image. Here,
we present a technique which allows the correlation reference images to be
updated while the adaptive optics loop is closed. We show that this can be done
without affecting the resulting point spread functions. On-sky demonstration is
reported. We compare different techniques for obtaining the reference images,
and investigate performance over a wide range of adaptive optics system
parameters. We find that image correlation techniques perform better than the
standard centre-of-gravity algorithm and are highly suited for use with
open-loop multiple object adaptive optics systems.

  2014",,"10.1086/675812",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When simulating sky images, one often takes a galaxy image $F(x)$ defined by
a set of pixelized samples and an interpolation kernel, and then wants to
produce a new sampled image representing this galaxy as it would appear with a
different point-spread function, a rotation, shearing, or magnification, and/or
a different pixel scale. These operations are sometimes only possible, or most
efficiently executed, as resamplings of the Fourier transform $\tilde F(u)$ of
the image onto a $u$-space grid that differs from the one produced by a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the samples. In some applications it is
essential that the resampled image be accurate to better than 1 part in $10^3$,
so in this paper we first use standard Fourier techniques to show that
Fourier-domain interpolation with a wrapped sinc function yields the exact
value of $\tilde F(u)$ in terms of the input samples and kernel. This operation
scales with image dimension as $N^4$ and can be prohibitively slow, so we next
investigate the errors accrued from approximating the sinc function with a
compact kernel. We show that these approximations produce a multiplicative
error plus a pair of ghost images (in each dimension) in the simulated image.
Standard Lanczos or cubic interpolators, when applied in Fourier domain,
produce unacceptable artifacts. We find that errors $<1$ part in $10^3$ can be
obtained by (1) 4-fold zero-padding of the original image before executing the
$x\rightarrow u$ DFT, followed by (2) resampling to the desired $u$ grid using
a 6-point, piecewise-quintic interpolant that we design expressly to minimize
the ghosts, then (3) executing the DFT back to $x$ domain.

circumstances (such as when the period of the potential is close to the crystal
periodicity; the potential is strong enough, etc.) it might adjust itself to
follow the periodicity of the potential, resulting in a, so called,
commensurate state. Such commensurate-incommensurate transitions are ubiquitous
phenomena in many areas of condensed matter physics: from magnetism and
dislocations in crystals, to vortices in superconductors, and atomic layers
adsorbed on a crystalline surface. Of particular interest might be the
properties of topological defects between the two commensurate phases:
solitons, domain walls, and dislocation walls. Here we report a
commensurate-incommensurate transition for graphene on top of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN). Depending on the rotational angle between the two hexagonal
lattices, graphene can either stretch to adjust to a slightly different hBN
periodicity (the commensurate state found for small rotational angles) or
exhibit little adjustment (the incommensurate state). In the commensurate
state, areas with matching lattice constants are separated by domain walls that
accumulate the resulting strain. Such soliton-like objects present significant
fundamental interest, and their presence might explain recent observations when
the electronic, optical, Raman and other properties of graphene-hBN
heterostructures have been notably altered.

C~0.85 as the dimensionless cell size becomes larger than a common value,

diagnostic method to evaluate parasite burden. Typically a sub-sample of the
diluted faeces is examined for eggs. The resulting egg counts are multiplied by
a specific correction factor to estimate the mean parasite burden. To detect
anthelmintic resistance, the mean parasite burden from treated and untreated
animals are compared. However, this standard method has some limitations. In
particular, the analysis of repeated samples may produce quite variable results
as the sampling variability due to the counting technique is ignored. We
propose a hierarchical model that takes this sampling variability as well as
between-animal variation into account. Bayesian inference is done via Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling. The performance of the hierarchical model is
illustrated by a re-analysis of faecal egg count data from a Swedish study
assessing the anthelmintic resistance of nematode parasite in sheep. A
simulation study shows that the hierarchical model provides better
classification of anthelmintic resistance compared to the standard method.

invariance of the laws of gravity from the classical standpoint exclusively.
Actual Weyl invariance requires to replace the underlying Riemannian
geometrical structure of the background spacetimes by Weyl integrable geometry
(WIG). We show that gauge freedom, a distinctive feature of Weyl invariant
theories of gravity, leads to very unusual consequences. For instance, within
the cosmological setting in a WIG-based conformal invariant gravity theory,
also known as conformal general relativity (CGR), a static universe is
physically equivalent to a universe undergoing de Sitter expansion. It happens
also that spherically symmetric black holes are physically equivalent to
singularity-free wormholes. Another outstanding consequence of gauge freedom in
the framework of CGR is that inflation is not required to explain the flatness,
horizon and relict particle abundances, among other puzzles that arise in
standard GR-based cosmology. Besides, the cosmological constant and the mass
hierarchy problems do not arise neither in this setup.

probabilities can be derived as the 'Lebesgue measure' of suitably defined
convex subregions of the simplexes. We consider a very simple and evocative
physical realization of the abstract model, using a material point particle
which is acted upon by elastic membranes, which by breaking and collapsing
produce the different possible outcomes. This easy to visualize mechanical
realization allows one to gain considerable insight into the possible hidden
structure of an arbitrary measurement process. We also show that the UTR-model
can be further generalized into a 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model,
describing conditions of lack of knowledge generated by 'non-uniform'
fluctuations. In this ampler framework, particularly suitable to describe
experiments in cognitive science, we define and motivate a notion of 'universal
measurement', describing the most general possible condition of lack of
knowledge in a measurement, emphasizing that the uniform fluctuations
characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood as an average over
all possible forms of non-uniform fluctuations which can be actualized in a
measurement context. This means that the Born rule of quantum mechanics can be
understood as a first order approximation of a more general non-uniform theory,
thus explaining part of the great success of quantum probability in the
description of different domains of reality. This is the first part of a

most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, so
defining what we have called a 'universal measurement'. In this second part, we
present the formal proof that universal measurements, which are averages over
all possible forms of fluctuations, produce the same probabilities as
measurements characterized by 'uniform' fluctuations on the measurement
situation. Since quantum probabilities can be shown to arise from the presence
of such uniform fluctuations, we have proven that they can be interpreted as
the probabilities of a first-order non-classical theory, describing situations
in which the experimenter lacks complete knowledge about the nature of the
interaction between the measuring apparatus and the entity under investigation.
This same explanation can be applied -- mutatis mutandis -- to the case of
cognitive measurements, made by human subjects on conceptual entities, or in
decision processes, although it is not necessarily the case that the structure
of the set of states would be in this case strictly Hilbertian. We also show
that universal measurements correspond to maximally 'robust' descriptions of
indeterministic reproducible experiments, and since quantum measurements can
also be shown to be maximally robust, this adds plausibility to their
interpretation as universal measurements, and provides a further element of
explanation for the great success of the quantum statistics in the description

fits, based mainly on larger $Q$ Drell-Yan-like processes, have found
substantial contributions from non-perturbative regions in the Collins-Soper
evolution kernel. In this article, we investigate semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering measurements in the region of relatively small $Q$, of the order of
a few GeV, where sensitivity to non-perturbative transverse momentum dependence
may become more important or even dominate the evolution. Using recently
available deep inelastic scattering data from the COMPASS experiment, we
provide estimates of the regions of coordinate space that dominate in TMD
processes when the hard scale is of the order of only a few GeV. We find that
distance scales that are much larger than those commonly probed in large $Q$
measurements become important, suggesting that the details of non-perturbative
effects in TMD evolution are especially significant in the region of
intermediate $Q$. We highlight the strongly universal nature of the
non-perturbative component of evolution, and its potential to be tightly
constrained by fits from a wide variety of observables that include both large

non-perturbative component of the Collins-Soper evolution kernel for future TMD

specific example of a cosmological model characterized by a non-standard
physics of the dark sector of the universe that nevertheless gives an expansion
history which does not significantly differ from the one of the standard
$\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we present the first constraints on the McDE
scenario obtained by comparing the predicted evolution of linear density
perturbations with a large compilation of recent data sets for the growth rate
$f\sigma_{8}$, including 6dFGS, LRG, BOSS, WiggleZ and VIPERS. Confirming
qualitative expectations, growth rate data provide much tighter bounds on the
model parameters as compared to the extremely loose bounds that can be obtained
when only the background expansion history is considered. In particular, the
$95\%$ confidence level on the coupling strength $|\beta |$ is reduced from
$|\beta |\leq 83$ (background constraints only) to $|\beta |\leq 0.88$
(background and linear perturbation constraints). We also investigate how these
constraints further improve when using data from future wide-field surveys such
as supernova data from LSST and growth rate data from Euclid-type missions. In
this case the $95\%$ confidence level on the coupling further reduce to $|\beta
|\leq 0.85$. Such constraints are in any case still consistent with a scalar
fifth-force of gravitational strength, and we foresee that tighter bounds might
be possibly obtained from the investigation of nonlinear structure formation in
McDE cosmologies.[Abridged]

far the most sensitive method is based upon comparison of protein sequence
profiles, which are derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of sequence
homologs in a protein family. A sequence profile is usually represented as a
position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and
accordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This
paper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three
key components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein
family; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an
efficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning
two MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue
correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus,
encode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family.
Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much
more sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that
MRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both
alignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works
particularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the
benchmark SCOP40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM
succeed on 48% and 52% of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on
15% and 27% of proteins, respectively, at fold level. In contrast, MRFalign
succeeds on 57.3% and 42.5% of proteins at superfamily and fold level,
respectively. This study implies that long-range residue interaction patterns
are very helpful for sequence-based homology detection. The software is

the ranking number of $G$, also known as tree-depth. Applications of rankings

three-dimensional landscape of dark electronic spins at and just below the

laterally and 1.5 nm vertically) and single-spin sensitivity. Our measurements
uncover previously unidentified electronic spins on the diamond surface, which
can potentially be used as resources for improved magnetic imaging of samples

quantum field theory to mathematics. Topologically twisted supersymmetric gauge
theories often admit a rigorous mathematical description: for example, the
Donaldson invariants of a 4-manifold can be interpreted as the correlation
functions of a topologically twisted N=2 gauge theory. The aim of these
lectures is to describe a mathematical formulation of partially-twisted
supersymmetric gauge theories (in perturbation theory). These partially twisted
theories are intermediate in complexity between the physical theory and the
topologically twisted theories. Moreover, we will sketch how the operators of

regarding variable selection consistency of penalized regression techniques,
such as the lasso. However, there has been relatively little work on
quantifying the uncertainty in these selection procedures. In this paper, we
propose a new method for inference in high dimensions using a score test based
on penalized regression. In this test, we perform penalized regression of an
outcome on all but a single feature, and test for correlation of the residuals
with the held-out feature. This procedure is applied to each feature in turn.
Interestingly, when an $\ell_1$ penalty is used, the sparsity pattern of the
lasso corresponds exactly to a decision based on the proposed test. Further,
when an $\ell_2$ penalty is used, the test corresponds precisely to a score
test in a mixed effects model, in which the effects of all but one feature are
assumed to be random. We formulate the hypothesis being tested as a compromise
between the null hypotheses tested in simple linear regression on each feature
and in multiple linear regression on all features, and develop reference
distributions for some well-known penalties. We also examine the behavior of
the test on real and simulated data.

For example, delay plays a central role in the dynamics of genetic regulatory
networks as it stems from the sequential assembly of first mRNA and then
protein. Genetic regulatory networks are therefore frequently modeled as
stochastic birth-death processes with delay. Here we examine the relationship
between delay birth-death processes and their appropriate approximating delay
chemical Langevin equations. We prove that the distance between these two
descriptions, as measured by expectations of functionals of the processes,
converges to zero with increasing system size. Further, we prove that the delay
birth-death process converges to the thermodynamic limit as system size tends
to infinity. Our results hold for both fixed delay and distributed delay.
Simulations demonstrate that the delay chemical Langevin approximation is
accurate even at moderate system sizes. It captures dynamical features such as
the spatial and temporal distributions of transition pathways in metastable
systems, oscillatory behavior in negative feedback circuits, and
cross-correlations between nodes in a network. Overall, these results provide a
foundation for using delay stochastic differential equations to approximate the
dynamics of birth-death processes with delay.

grounds of its potential improved effectiveness over inverted file search.
Clustering is a mostly unsupervised procedure and the majority of the
clustering algorithms depend on certain assumptions in order to define the
subgroups present in a data set .A clustering quality measure is a function
that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative
real number representing the quality of that clustering. Moreover, they may
behave in a different way depending on the features of the data set and their
input parameters values. Therefore, in most applications the resulting
clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The
quality of clustering can be enhanced by using a Cellular Automata Classifier
for information retrieval. In this study we take the view that if cellular
automata with clustering is applied to search results (query-specific
clustering), then it has the potential to increase the retrieval effectiveness
compared both to that of static clustering and of conventional inverted file
search. We conducted a number of experiments using ten document collections and
eight hierarchic clustering methods. Our results show that the effectiveness of
query-specific clustering with cellular automata is indeed higher and suggest
that there is scope for its application to IR.

and remains a {\em challenging} task today. {\em Distance} {\em landmarks} have

to apply distance landmarks for fast {\em exact} shortest distance query
answering on large road graphs. However, the {\em direct} application of
distance landmarks is {\em impractical} due to the high space and time cost. To
rectify this problem, we investigate novel techniques that can be seamlessly

{\em agents}, each of which represents a small subgraph and holds good
properties for fast distance query answering. We also show that agents can be
computed in {\em linear time}. Third, we introduce graph partitions to deal
with the remaining subgraph that cannot be captured by agents. Fourth, we
develop a unified framework that seamlessly integrates our proposed techniques

  Parallel Gaussian Interference Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been shown recently by Geng et al. that in a $K$ user Gaussian
interference network, if for each user the desired signal strength is no less
than the sum of the strengths of the strongest interference from this user and
the strongest interference to this user (all signal strengths measured in dB
scale), then power control and treating interference as noise (TIN) is
sufficient to achieve the entire generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region.
Motivated by the intuition that the deterministic model of Avestimehr et al.
(ADT deterministic model) is particularly suited for exploring the optimality
of TIN, the results of Geng et al. are first re-visited under the ADT
deterministic model, and are shown to directly translate between the Gaussian
and deterministic settings. Next, we focus on the extension of these results to
parallel interference networks, from a sum-capacity/sum-GDoF perspective. To
this end, we interpret the explicit characterization of the
sum-capacity/sum-GDoF of a TIN optimal network (without parallel channels) as a
minimum weighted matching problem in combinatorial optimization, and obtain a
simple characterization in terms of a partition of the interference network
into vertex-disjoint cycles. Aided by insights from the cyclic partition, the
sum-capacity optimality of TIN for $K$ user parallel interference networks is
characterized for the ADT deterministic model, leading ultimately to
corresponding GDoF results for the Gaussian setting. In both cases, subject to
a mild invertibility condition the optimality of TIN is shown to extend to
parallel networks in a separable fashion.

providing a direct and dramatic link among geometry and material properties due
to the larger structural flexibility when compared to bulk three-dimensional
materials. We describe methods to understand the local geometrical information
of two-dimensional conformal crystals quantitatively and directly from atomic
positions, even in the presence of atomistic defects. We then discuss direct
relations among the discrete geometry and chemically-relevant quantities
--mean-bond-lengths, hybridization angles and $\sigma-\pi$ hybridization. These
concepts are illustrated for carbon-based materials and ionic crystals. The
piramidalization angle turns out to be linearly proportional to the mean
curvature for relevant crystalline configurations. Discrete geometry provides
direct quantitative information on the potential chemistry of conformal
two-dimensional crystals.

that the second gamma-ray episode and its flares originate from the resumption
of the accretion process due to the fragments from the collapsar falling back,
such a relation may be related to a hyperaccretion disk around a precessed

the single flare, can be explained well by the jet precession model

that the holographic entanglement entropy indeed exhibits the thermodynamic
instability associated with the divergence of the specific heat. When the width
of the strip is large enough, the finite part of the holographic entanglement
entropy as a function of the temperature resembles the thermal entropy, as is
expected. As the width becomes smaller, however, the two entropies behave
differently. In particular, there exists a critical value for the width of the

behavior in the single-charge black holes in $D=4$ and $7$.

significant peaks in the aa index spectrum are due to an 88 day modulation of
27 day period solar activity. The model also predicts the occurrence of
planetary tidal effect maximum in anti-phase with solar cycle maximums around
1970 and we show this is consistent with prior observations of higher solar

proportion of signal variance in the total variance of neural activity
measurements. This explainable variance measure helps neuroscientists assess
the adequacy of predictive models that describe how images are encoded in the
brain. Complicating the estimation problem are strong noise correlations, which
may confound the neural responses corresponding to the stimuli. If not properly
taken into account, the correlations could inflate the explainable variance
estimates and suggest false possible prediction accuracies. We propose a novel
method to estimate the explainable variance in functional MRI (fMRI) brain
activity measurements when there are strong correlations in the noise. Our
shuffle estimator is nonparametric, unbiased, and built upon the random effect
model reflecting the randomization in the fMRI data collection process.
Leveraging symmetries in the measurements, our estimator is obtained by
appropriately permuting the measurement vector in such a way that the noise
covariance structure is intact but the explainable variance is changed after
the permutation. This difference is then used to estimate the explainable
variance. We validate the properties of the proposed method in simulation
experiments. For the image-fMRI data, we show that the shuffle estimates can
explain the variation in prediction accuracy for voxels within the primary
visual cortex (V1) better than alternative parametric methods.

equilibrium configurations are constructed in a systematic manner, in which
both toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields are determined self-consistently
with the inclusion of general relativistic effects. To solve the 2D heat
transfer inside the NS interior out to the crust, we have developed an implicit
code based on a finite-difference scheme that deals with anisotropic thermal
conductivity and relevant cooling processes in the context of a standard
cooling scenario. In agreement with previous studies, the surface temperatures
near the pole become higher than those in the vicinity of the equator as a
result of anisotropic heat transfer. Our results show that the ratio of the
highest to the lowest surface temperatures changes maximally by one order of
magnitude, depending on the equilibrium configurations. Despite such
difference, we find that the area of such hot and cold spots is so small that
the simulated X-ray spectrum could be well reproduced by a single temperature

libration, i.e. by a small periodic modulation of the rotation rate. Thanks to
its simplicity, this model is relevant to various contexts, from industrial
containers (with small oscillations of the rotation rate) to fluid layers of
terrestial planets (with length-of-day variations). Assuming a multipolar
$n$-fold boundary deformation, we first obtain the two-dimensional basic flow.
We then perform a short-wavelength local stability analysis of the basic flow,
showing that an instability may occur in three dimensions. We christen it the
Libration Driven Multipolar Instability (LDMI). The growth rates of the LDMI
are computed by a Floquet analysis in a systematic way, and compared to
analytical expressions obtained by perturbation methods. We then focus on the
simplest geometry allowing the LDMI, a librating deformed cylinder. To take
into account viscous and confinement effects, we perform a global stability
analysis, which shows that the LDMI results from a parametric resonance of
inertial modes. Performing numerical simulations of this librating cylinder, we
confirm that the basic flow is indeed established and report the first
numerical evidence of the LDMI. Numerical results, in excellent agreement with
the stability results, are used to explore the non-linear regime of the
instability (amplitude and viscous dissipation of the driven flow). We finally
provide an example of LDMI in a deformed spherical container to show that the
instability mechanism is generic. Our results show that the previously studied
libration driven elliptical instability simply corresponds to the particular
case $n=2$ of a wider class of instabilities. Summarizing, this work shows that
any oscillating non-axisymmetric container in rotation may excite intermittent,
space-filling LDMI flows, and this instability should thus be easy to observe
experimentally.

disc thickness, radial extension and radial density profile. At order zero, the
field is even algebraic for thin discs and writes $- 4 \pi G \Sigma(R) f_{edge}

factor $f_{edge} \gtrsim 1/2$, which depends on the relative distance to the

this local contribution can be surpassed by action of mass stored in the inner

the details of vertical stratification are not critical. We briefly discuss how

reverse in the self-gravitating region, which contradicts what is usually

mathematical analysis, we show the emergence of bistable and persistent
epigenetic states from the cooperative recruitment of modifying enzymes. We
also find that the dynamical system exhibits a critical point and displays, in

These results have deep implications for our understanding of epigenetic

tackle this problem by providing a framework for graph transformations with

uniform sampling can guarantee that the sampled stochastic quantity is an
unbiased estimate of the corresponding true quantity, the resulting estimator
may have a rather high variance, which negatively affects the convergence of
the underlying optimization procedure. In this paper we study stochastic
optimization with importance sampling, which improves the convergence rate by
reducing the stochastic variance. Specifically, we study prox-SGD (actually,
stochastic mirror descent) with importance sampling and prox-SDCA with
importance sampling. For prox-SGD, instead of adopting uniform sampling
throughout the training process, the proposed algorithm employs importance
sampling to minimize the variance of the stochastic gradient. For prox-SDCA,
the proposed importance sampling scheme aims to achieve higher expected dual
value at each dual coordinate ascent step. We provide extensive theoretical
analysis to show that the convergence rates with the proposed importance
sampling methods can be significantly improved under suitable conditions both

the extreme load on a wind turbine. The extreme load is the highest stress
level imposed on a turbine structure that the turbine would experience during
its service lifetime. A wind turbine should be designed to resist such a high
load to avoid catastrophic structural failures. To assess the extreme load,
turbine structural responses are evaluated by conducting field measurement
campaigns or performing aeroelastic simulation studies. In general, data
obtained in either case are not sufficient to represent various loading
responses under all possible weather conditions. An appropriate extrapolation
is necessary to characterize the structural loads in a turbine's service life.
This study devises a Bayesian spline method for this extrapolation purpose,
using load data collected in a period much shorter than a turbine's service
life. The spline method is applied to three sets of turbine's load response
data to estimate the corresponding extreme loads at the roots of the turbine
blades. Compared to the current industry practice, the spline method appears to
provide better extreme load assessment.

bands intersect at arbitrary points -- the Weyl nodes -- in the Brillouin zone.
These points carry a topological quantum number known as the \emph{chirality}
and always appear in pairs of opposite chiralities. The notion of chirality
leads to anomalous non-conservation of chiral charge, known as the \emph{chiral
anomaly}, according to which charge can be pumped between Weyl nodes of
opposite chiralities by an electromagnetic field with non-zero
$\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}$. Here, we propose probing the chiral
anomaly by measuring the optical activity of Weyl semimetals via circular
dichroism. In particular, we observe that applying such an electromagnetic
field on this state gives it a non-zero gyrotropic coefficient or a Hall-like
conductivity, which may be detectable by routine circular dichroism
experiments. This method also serves as a diagnostic tool to discriminate
between Weyl and Dirac semimetals; the latter will give a null result. More
generally, any experiment that probes a bulk correlation function that has the
same symmetries as the gyrotropic coefficient can detect the chiral anomaly as
well as differentiate between Dirac and Weyl semimetals.

their rocky cores had formed before the nebula dissipated. We model the
gravitational accumulation of nebula gas around a core as a function of
protoplanetary luminosity during accretion and calculate the resulting surface
temperature by solving the hydrostatic structure equations for the
protoplanetary nebula. Depending on nebular properties and resulting
luminosities, for planetary bodies of 0.1--1$M_{\oplus}$ we obtain hydrogen

For `super-Earths' with masses between 2--5$M_{\oplus}$ hydrogen envelopes
within the mass range of $\sim 7.5\times 10^{23}$--$1.5\times 10^{28}$ g can be
captured. To study the escape of these hydrogen-dominated protoatmospheres, we
apply a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere model and calculate the loss rates due to
the heating by the high XUV flux of the young star. Our results indicate that
under most nebula conditions `sub-Earth' and Earth-mass planets can lose their
envelopes by thermal escape during the first $100$ Myr after the disk
dissipated. However, if a nebula has a low dust depletion factor or low
accretion rates resulting in low protoplanetary luminosities, it is possible
that even protoplanets with Earth-mass cores may keep their hydrogen envelopes
during their whole lifetime. In contrast to lower mass protoplanets,
`super-Earths' accumulate a huge amount of nebula gas and lose only tiny
fractions of their primordial envelopes. Our results agree with the fact that
Venus, Earth, and Mars are not surrounded by dense hydrogen envelopes, as well
as with the recent discoveries of low density `super-Earths' that most likely
could not get rid of their protoatmospheres.

deterministic algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of
\emph{sparse} adaptive signal estimation and system identification. From a
Bayesian perspective, this task is equivalent to maximum a posteriori
probability estimation under a sparsity promoting heavy-tailed prior for the
parameters of interest. Following a different approach, this paper develops a
unifying framework of sparse \emph{variational Bayes} algorithms that employ
heavy-tailed priors in conjugate hierarchical form to facilitate posterior
inference. The resulting fully automated variational schemes are first
presented in a batch iterative form. Then it is shown that by properly
exploiting the structure of the batch estimation task, new sparse adaptive
variational Bayes algorithms can be derived, which have the ability to impose
and track sparsity during real-time processing in a time-varying environment.
The most important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they completely
eliminate the need for computationally costly parameter fine-tuning, a
necessary ingredient of sparse adaptive deterministic algorithms. Extensive
simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
sparse variational Bayes algorithms against state-of-the-art deterministic
techniques for adaptive channel estimation. The results show that the proposed
algorithms are numerically robust and exhibit in general superior estimation
performance compared to their deterministic counterparts.

distributions, and postulate that energetic and nearby MSPs are mainly
undetected in $\gamma$-rays simply because they are seen under unfavourable

structure, and taking into account that there might not exist direct links from
all the surviving nodes to the new node. In the repair problem of these
systems, surviving nodes may cooperate to transmit the repair traffic to the
new node. In this setting, we define the total number of packets transmitted

by cut-set bound analysis. In this paper, we show that the lower bound of the

that at lower energies, the thickness dependence of energy resolution is

Theoretically, such extreme high-dimensionality will cause biased or

when and why the classical principal component scores can be used to visualize

that eigenvectors related to pervasive signals will have eigenvalues scaling
linearly with the number of variables. Second, we prove that for linearly
increasing eigenvalues, the sample component scores will be scaled and rotated
versions of the population scores, asymptotically. Thus the visual information
of the sample scores will be unchanged, even though the sample eigenvectors are
biased. In the case of pervasive signals, the principal component scores can be
used to visualize the population structures, even in extreme high-dimensional

that medical resources are efficiently spared with this model, and the social

calculated analytically in most case. In practice, approximations of this
density are used, particularly Gaussian densities based on linearisation or the
unscented transform. For many highly nonlinear or non-Gaussian models, these
approximations can be poor, leading to degeneracy of the particle approximation
or even the filter ""losing track"" completely. In this paper, we develop a new
mechanism for approximating the optimal importance density, which we call the
progressive proposal method. This works by introducing the observation
progressively and performing a series of state updates, each using a local
Gaussian approximation to the optimal importance density. A number of
refinements and extensions to the basic algorithm are also introduced.
Simulations are used to demonstrate an improvement in performance over simpler
particle filters on a number of applications.

probability exponent $\alpha$ strongly depends on $r$, the range of
interaction, the symmetry of the model and the induced fluctuation. Even in a
nearest neighbour model, nonlinear form of EP can be obtained by controlling
the fluctuations and for the same range, different models give different

perturbations has significantly contributed to theoretical investigations of
rhythmic phenomena. We here propose a generalized phase reduction method that
is also applicable to strongly perturbed limit cycle oscillators. The
fundamental assumption of our method is that the perturbations can be
decomposed into a slowly varying component as compared to the amplitude
relaxation time and remaining weak fluctuations. Under this assumption, we
introduce a generalized phase parameterized by the slowly varying component and
derive a closed equation for the generalized phase describing the oscillator
dynamics. The proposed method enables us to explore a broader class of rhythmic
phenomena, in which the shape and frequency of the oscillation may vary largely
because of the perturbations. We illustrate our method by analyzing the
synchronization dynamics of limit cycle oscillators driven by strong periodic
signals. It is shown that the proposed method accurately predicts the
synchronization properties of the oscillators, while the conventional method
does not.

weakly-magnetised ultra-relativistic shocks is investigated. We demonstrate
that for such shocks, in which the scattering of energetic particles is
mediated exclusively by ion skin-depth scale structures, as might be expected
for a Weibel-mediated shock, there is an intrinsic limit on the maximum energy
to which particles can be accelerated. This maximum energy is determined from
the requirement that particles must be isotropised in the downstream plasma
frame before the mean field transports them far downstream, and falls
considerably short of what is required to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic
rays. To circumvent this limit, a highly disorganised field is required on
larger scales. The growth of cosmic-ray induced instabilities on wavelengths
much longer than the ion-plasma skin depth, both upstream and downstream of the
shock, is considered. While these instabilities may play an important role in
magnetic field amplification at relativistic shocks, on scales comparable to
the gyroradius of the most energetic particles, the calculated growth-rates
have insufficient time to modify the scattering. Since strong modification is a
necessary condition for particles in the downstream region to re-cross the
shock, in the absence of an alternative scattering mechanism, these results
imply that acceleration to higher energies is ruled out. If weakly-magnetised
ultra-relativistic shocks are disfavoured as high energy particle accelerators
in general, the search for potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
can be narrowed.

a technique called bi-level optimization to learn the analysis operators.
Compared to existing analysis operator learning approaches, our training
procedure has the advantage that it is unconstrained with respect to the

co-sparse analysis model and show that the sparsity promoting function (also
called penalty function) is the most important factor in the model. In order to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our training approach, we apply our trained
models to various classical image restoration problems. Numerical experiments

ratio can be systematically varied from 0.92 at 0.11 mbar to 1.09 at 0.30 mbar

that become most pronounced once the samples are fully oxygenated and thus
strongly hole doped. All as-grown and thus slightly oxygen deficient LMO films
are ferromagnetic insulators with saturation moments in excess of 2.5 \mu
$_{B}$ per Mn ion, their transport and optical properties that can be
understood in terms of trapped ferromagnetic polarons. Upon oxygen annealing,
the most La-deficient films develop a metallic response with an even larger
ferromagnetic saturation moment of 3.8 \mu $_{B}$ per Mn ion. In contrast, in
the oxygenated Mn-deficient films the ferromagnetic order is almost completely
suppressed to less than 0.5 \mu $_{B}$ per Mn ion and the transport remains

von K\'arm\'an flow thanks to the monitoring of the spatio-temporal spectrum of
the velocity fluctuations, combined with projection onto suitable Beltrami
modes. It is shown that the large scale coherent fluctuations of the flow obeys
a sequence of Eckhaus instabilities when the Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}$ is
varied from $10^2$ to $10^6$. This sequence results in modulations of
increasing azimuthal wavenumber. The basic state is the laminar or
time-averaged flow at an arbitrary $\mathrm{Re}$, which is axi-symmetric, i.e.
with a $0$ azimuthal wavenumber. Increasing $\mathrm{Re}$ leads to
non-axisymmetric modulations with increasing azimuthal wavenumber from $1$ to
$3$. These modulations are found to rotate in the azimuthal direction. However
no clear rotation frequency can be established until $\mathrm{Re}\approx
4\times 10^3$. Above, they become periodic with an increasing frequency. We
finally show that these modulations are connected with the coherent structures
of the mixing shear layer. The implication of these findings for the turbulence
parametrization is discussed. Especially, they may explain why simple eddy
viscosity models are able to capture complex turbulent flow dynamics.

demonstrate the usefulness of PTA by applying it to longitudinal gene

details. The NIR variation features of WPVS48 are consistent with the
corresponding optical variations, but the features appear sharper in the NIR
than in the optical, suggesting that the optical photons undergo multiple
scatterings. The J and Ks emission, tracing the hot (1600 K) dust echo, lags
the B and R variations by on average 64 +/- 4 days and 71 +/- 5 days,
respectively (restframe). WPVS48 lies on the known tau-M_V relationship.
However, the observed lag is about three times shorter than expected from the
dust sublimation radius r_sub inferred from the optical-UV luminosity, and
explanations for this common discrepancy are searched for. The sharp NIR echos
argue for a face-on torus geometry and allow us to put forward two potential
scenarios: 1) as previously proposed, in the equatorial plane of the accretion
disk the inner region of the torus is flattened and may come closer to the
accretion disk. 2) The dust torus with inner radius r_sub is geometrically and
optically thick, so that the observer only sees the facing rim of the torus
wall, which lies closer to the observer than the torus equatorial plane and
therefore leads to an observed foreshortened lag. Both scenarios are able to
explain the factor three discrepancy between tau and r_sub. Longer-wavelength
dust reverberation data might enable one to distinguish between the scenarios.

the standard statistical tool to handle these likelihood free problems, but
they require a very large number of simulations. In this work we develop two
new ABC sampling algorithms that significantly reduce the number of simulations

color. A comparison with isochrones shows reasonably good agreement with BaSTI
models, a small offset to Dartmouth models, and a larger offset to Padua
models. Even for the best globular cluster data available, the metallicity of a
simple stellar population can be determined from the RGB alone only with an
accuracy of 0.3dex for [M/H]< -1, and 0.15dex for [M/H]> -1. For mixed
populations, as they are observed in external galaxies, the uncertainties will
be even larger due to uncertainties in extinction, age, etc. Therefore caution

given by lattice QCD. Moreover, we show that the Richardson's interquark
potential suppresses the quark scalar density in the Higashjima-Miransky

observable that is sensitive to quark confinement. For the quark axial charge,
we find that it is suppressed due to the gluon dynamics. The result of the
quenched analysis agrees qualitatively with the experimental data of the
isovector axial coupling constant $g_A$. We show that the suppression of the
quenched axial charge is due to a mechanism similar to that of the quark tensor
charge. In the Schwinger-Dyson equation with the leading unquenching quark-loop
contribution the quark axial charge is more suppressed, due to the anomaly
effect. The quark pseudoscalar density is found to be large, and is divergent

nodes are predicted with the help of an active sensor node. Virtual Sensing
Framework (VSF) provides the mechanism to predict the sensing values by
exploiting the data correlation among the sensor nodes. If the number of active
sensor nodes can be minimized, a lot of energy can be saved. The active nodes'
selection must fulfill the following constraints - (i) the set of active nodes
are sufficient to predict the sensing values of the dormant nodes, (ii) each
active sensor nodes can report their data to the sink node (directly or through
some other active node(s)). The goal is to select a minimal number of active
sensor nodes so that energy savings can be maximized.

velocity distribution shows a significant deviation from the Maxwell

structured, this non-equilibrium distribution can be exploited for momentum
transfer in tangential direction between the two surfaces. This opens up the
possibility to extract work from the system which operates as a heat engine.
Since both surfaces are held at constant temperatures, the mode of momentum
transfer is different from thermal creep flow that has gained more attention so
far. This situation is studied in the limit of free-molecular flow for the case
that an unstructured surface is allowed to move tangentially with respect to a
structured surface. Parameter studies are conducted, and configurations with
maximum thermodynamic efficiency are identified. Overall, it is shown that
significant efficiencies can be obtained by tangential momentum transfer

moving ultrarelativistically through magnetic bending systems, we have shown
that the transverse dynamics equation for a particle in the bunch has a driving
term which behaves as the centrifugal force caused by the particle's initial
potential energy due to collective particle interactions within the bunch. As a
result, the initial potential energy at the entrance of a bending system, which
we call pseudo (kinetic) energy, is indistinguishable from the usual kinetic
energy offset from the design energy in its perturbation to particle optics
through dispersion and momentum compaction. In this paper, in identifying this
centrifugal force on particles as the remnant of the CSR cancellation effect in
transverse particle dynamics, we show how the dynamics equation in terms of the
canonical momentum for beam motion on a curved orbit is related to the
Panofsky-Wenzel theorem for wakefields for beam motion on a straight path. It
is shown that the effect of pseudo energy spread can be measurable only for a
high-peak-current bunch when the pseudo slice energy spread is appreciable
compared to the slice kinetic energy spread. The implication of the pseudo
slice energy spread for bunch dynamics in magnetic bends is discussed.

edge-weighted graph $G = (V,E)$ one is to find a subset of $k$ vertices $S$,
such that each vertex in $V$ is ""close"" to some vertex in $S$. The
approximation status of this basic problem is well understood, as a simple
2-approximation algorithm is known to be tight. Consequently different
extensions were studied.
  In the capacitated version of the problem each vertex is assigned a capacity,
which is a strict upper bound on the number of clients a facility can serve,
when located at this vertex. A constant factor approximation for the
capacitated $k$-center was obtained last year by Cygan, Hajiaghayi and Khuller
[FOCS'12], which was recently improved to a 9-approximation by An, Bhaskara and
Svensson [arXiv'13].
  In a different generalization of the problem some clients (denoted as
outliers) may be disregarded. Here we are additionally given an integer $p$ and
the goal is to serve exactly $p$ clients, which the algorithm is free to
choose. In 2001 Charikar et al. [SODA'01] presented a 3-approximation for the
$k$-center problem with outliers.
  In this paper we consider a common generalization of the two extensions
previously studied separately, i.e. we work with the capacitated $k$-center
with outliers. We present the first constant factor approximation algorithm
with approximation ratio of 25 even for the case of non-uniform hard
capacities.

which lie close to a $1:2:3$ resonance chain. Our analysis shows that their
TTVs are consistently explained by the three-planet model, and constrains their
masses as $M_{\rm b} = 2.1_{-0.8}^{+1.5} M_{\oplus}$ (Kepler-51b), $M_{\rm c} =
4.0 \pm 0.4 M_{\oplus}$ (Kepler-51c), and $M_{02} = 7.6 \pm 1.1 M_{\oplus}$
(KOI-620.02), thus confirming KOI-620.02 as a planet in this system. The masses
inferred from the TTVs are rather small compared to the planetary radii based
on the stellar density and planet-to-star radius ratios determined from the
transit light curves. Combining these estimates, we find that all three planets
in this system have densities among the lowest determined, $\rho_p \lesssim
0.05\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$. With this feature, the Kepler-51 system serves as
another example of low-density compact multi-transiting planetary systems. We
also identify a curious feature in the archived Kepler light curve during the
double transit of Kepler-51b and KOI-620.02, which could be explained by their
overlapping on the stellar disk (a planet-planet eclipse). If this is really
the case, the sky-plane inclination of KOI-620.02's orbit relative to that of
Kepler-51b is given by $\Delta \Omega = -25.3_{-6.8}^{+6.2}\mathrm{deg}$,
implying significant misalignment of their orbital planes. This interpretation,
however, seems unlikely because such an event that is consistent with all of
the observations is found to be exceedingly rare.

  Characterization",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of the Liscic/Petrofer probe is to determine the cooling
intensity during liquid quenching in laboratory and workshop environments. The
surface heat transfer coefficient is calculated by the one-dimensional finite
volume method from the smoothed temperature curve, measured at a near-surface
point in the probe. Smoothed reference temperature curves for oil and water,
based on measurements made by the probe, are used in a series of numerical
experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the calculation with respect to
various input parameters of the problem, such as: thermal properties of the
material, the near-surface thermocouple position, and the diameter of the
probe. These results are relevant for other liquid quenchants, at least
qualitatively, if not quantitatively. A similar type of analysis is conducted
with respect to the variation of numerical simulation parameters in the finite
volume method---the choice of space and time steps for problem discretization.
When the input curves are sufficiently smooth, the method itself is very
reliable.

contingent and could have been otherwise, being solely the result of historical
accidents. Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological
entities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors
remains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive
reasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the
logical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present
article describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations
of biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the
language and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach
assumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends
discipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised
through the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and
asymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these
four concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.
Four fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's
theory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes
Mendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism
and deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts
of natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their
reproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to
clarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major
theories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin
of life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.

microdisk was investigated by micro magnetic simulation based on the Landau
Lifshitz Gilbert equation. Our results show that the DM interaction modifies
the size of the vortex core, and also induces an out of plane magnetization
component at the edge and inside the disk. The DM interaction can destabilizes
one vortex handedness, generate a bias field to the vortex core and couple the
vortex polarity and chirality. This DM-interaction-induced coupling can
therefore provide a new way to control vortex polarity and chirality.

framework of classical and quantum electrodynamics. Since there has been no
distinct experimental validation of radiation reaction and its underlying
equations so far and its impact is expected to be substantial for the
construction of new experimental devices, e.g., quantum x-free electron lasers,
a profound understanding of radiation reaction effects is of special interest.
Here, we describe how the inclusion of quantum radiation reaction effects
changes the dynamics of ultra-relativistic electron beams colliding with
intense laser pulses significantly. Thereafter, the angular distribution of
emitted radiation is demonstrated to be strongly altered in the quantum
framework, if in addition to single photon emission also higher order photon
emissions are considered. Furthermore, stimulated Raman scattering of an
ultra-intense laser pulse in plasmas is examined and forward Raman scattering
is found to be significantly increased by the inclusion of radiation reaction
effects in the classical regime. The numerical simulations in this work show
the feasibility of an experimental verification of the predicted effects with
presently available lasers and electron accelerators.
