The problem of constructing indecomposable $A$-modules inductively from simple
ones by means of exact sequences - called accessibility - is the starting point
of the present diploma-thesis. It has lead us to the consideration of
exceptional and indecomposable tree-representations of finite quivers.
Following Ringel, we prove his result that exceptional representations are
tree-representations. We give a detailed description of the various aspects of
the Schofield-Induction which plays an important role in the proof. Moreover we
introduce a functor (strong hypotheses being given) which enables us to
construct indecomposable modules of an algebra from indecomposable
representations of a certain bipartite quiver. We also give a proof of Ringel's
result that each exceptional representation of dimension $d>1$ of a generalized
Kronecker quiver has an indecomposable factor- or subrepresentation of
dimension $d-1$. The thesis is concluded by some calculations showing the
accessibility of representations of the 3-Kronecker-quiver in small dimensions.

studied. Utilizing the recent numerical result of proto-first-star formation

field strength generated by the radiative force and the Biermann battery
effect. We find that magnetic field of \sim 10^{-9} G is generated on the
surface of the accretion disk around the proto-first-star. The field strength
on the accretion disk is smaller by two orders of magnitude than the critical
value, above which the gravitational fragmentation of the disk is suppressed.
Thus, the generated seed magnetic field hardly affect the dynamics of on-site
first star formation directly, unless efficient amplification process is taken
into consideration. We also find that the generated magnetic field is
continuously blown out from the disk on the outflows to the poles, that are
driven by the thermal pressure of photoheated gas. The strength of the diffused
magnetic field in low density regions is \sim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}G at n_H=10^3

monopolar and a dipolar term. We present a model in which the dipolar term of
the magnetostatic energy resulting from the transverse magnetization in the

homogeneously magnetized ellipsoids [Phys. Rev. 67, 351 (1945)]. The analytic
results agree almost perfectly with simulation data as long as the wire
diameter is sufficiently small to prevent inhomogeneities of the magnetization
along the cross-section. Owing to the recently demonstrated negligible D\""oring
mass of these walls, our results should also apply to the dynamic case, where
domain walls are driven by spin-transfer toque effects and/or an axial magnetic

magnetic energy which can be released impulsively and account for the flare
plasma heating. We compute the temporal evolution of the thermal X-ray emission
in kink-unstable coronal loops using MHD simulations and discuss the results of
with respect to solar flare observations. The model consists of a highly
twisted loop embedded in a region of uniform and untwisted coronal magnetic
field. We let the kink instability develop, compute the evolution of the plasma
properties in the loop (density, temperature) without accounting for mass
exchange with the chromosphere. We then deduce the X-ray emission properties of
the plasma during the whole flaring episode. During the initial phase of the
instability plasma heating is mostly adiabatic. Ohmic diffusion takes over as
the instability saturates, leading to strong and impulsive heating (> 20 MK),
to a quick enhancement of X-ray emission and to the hardening of the thermal
X-ray spectrum. The temperature distribution of the plasma becomes broad, with
the emission measure depending strongly on temperature. Significant emission
measures arise for plasma at temperatures T > 9 MK. The magnetic flux-rope then
relaxes progressively towards a lower energy state as it reconnects with the
background flux. The loop plasma suffers smaller sporadic heating events but
cools down conductively. The total thermal X-ray emission slowly fades away
during this phase, and the high temperature component of emission measure
distribution converges to the power-law distribution $EM\propto T^{-4.2}$. The
amount of twist deduced directly from the X-ray emission patterns is
considerably lower than the maximum magnetic twist in the simulated flux-ropes.

IVGDR shapes by the sum of three Lorentzians adding up to the TRK sum rule and
theory-based predictions for the A-dependence of pole energies and spreading
widths. For the small spins reached by capture level densities are well
described by only one free global parameter; a significant collective
enhancement due to the deviation from axial symmetry is observed. Reliable
predictions for compound nuclear reactions also outside the valley of stability
as expected from the derived global parameterization are important for nuclear
astrophysics and for the transmutation of nuclear waste.

that a network of LTI observers assesses its output vector. The dissemination
of information within the network is dictated by a pre-specified directed graph
in which each vertex represents an observer. Each observer computes its own
state estimate using only the portion of the output vector accessible to it and
the state estimates of other observers that are transmitted to it by its
neighbors, according to the graph. This paper proposes an update rule that is a
natural generalization of consensus, and for which we determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of parameters for the update rule that
lead to asymptotic omniscience of the state of the plant at all observers. The
conditions reduce to certain detectability requirements that imply that if
omniscience is not possible under the proposed scheme then it is not viable
under any other scheme that is subject to the same communication graph,
including nonlinear and time-varying ones.

components of Kerr optical frequency combs in the dynamical regime of Turing
patterns. We show that these Turing patterns display a particularly strong and
robust phase-locking, originating from a cascade of phase-locked triplets which
asymptotically lead to a global phase-locking between the modes. The local and
global phase-locking relationship defining the shape of the optical pulses are
analytically determined. Our analysis also shows that solitons display a much
weaker phase-locking which can be destroyed more easily than in the Turing

via magnetic braking, during their Main-Sequence lifetimes. However, magnetic
braking only operates on the surface layers; it is not yet completely
understood how angular momentum is transported within the star, and how rapidly
the spin-down information is communicated to the deep interior. In this work,
we use insight from recent progress in understanding internal solar dynamics to
model the interior of other solar-type stars. We assume, following Gough and
McIntyre (1998), that the bulk of the radiation zone of these stars is held in
uniform rotation by the presence of an embedded large-scale primordial field,
confined below a stably-stratified, magnetic-free tachocline by large-scale
meridional flows downwelling from the convection zone. We derive simple
equations to describe the response of this model interior to spin-down of the
surface layers, that are identical to the two-zone model of MacGregor and
Brenner (1991), with a coupling timescale proportional to the local
Eddington-Sweet timescale across the tachocline. This timescale depends both on
the rotation rate of the star and on the thickness of the tachocline, and can
vary from a few hundred thousand years to a few Gyr, depending on stellar
properties. Qualitative predictions of the model appear to be consistent with
observations, although depend sensitively on the assumed functional dependence
of the tachocline thickness on the stellar rotation rate.

between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave astrophysics
communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect
gravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover their
parameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report
here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60
complete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion
modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian
portion modelling the early inspiral. In a ""blind injection challenge"" similar
to that conducted in recent LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid
waveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The
resulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 of
the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a
thousand years. Parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of these
waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular
momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We also perform a large-scale
monte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid
waveforms with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves. Our
results predict that early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will have a
volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300Mpc (1Gpc) for
$10M_{\odot}+10M_{\odot}$ ($50M_{\odot}+50M_{\odot}$) binary black hole
coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in
the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in
sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. [Abstract

central role closely related to adjunctions. Monads have been studied mostly in
algebraic situations. In this dissertation, we study this concept in some
categories of smooth manifolds. Namely, the tangent functor in the category of
smooth manifolds is the functor part of a unique monad, which is the main
character of this dissertation.
  After its construction and the study of uniqueness properties in related
categories, we study its algebras, which are to this monad what representations
are to a group. We give some examples of algebras, and general conditions that
they should satisfy. We characterize them in the category of affine manifolds.
We also study an analog of the tangent functor monad and its algebras in
algebraic geometry.
  We then prove our main theorem: algebras over the tangent functor monad
induce foliations on the manifold on which they are defined. This result links
the study of these algebras to the study of foliations. A natural question is
then to characterize foliations which arise this way. We give some restrictions
in terms of the holonomy of such foliations. Finally, we study in greater
detail algebras on surfaces, where they take a very simple form, and we nearly
characterize them.

spectra reveal weak, gravity sensitive alkali lines and strong lithium 6708
Angstrom absorption that indicate the system is younger than field age.
VLT-SINFONI near-IR spectra also show weak, gravity sensitive features and
spectral morphology that is consistent with other young, very low-mass dwarfs.
We combine the constraints from all age diagnostics to estimate a system age of
~30-200 Myr. The 1.2-4.7 micron spectral energy distribution of the components
point toward T_eff=3200 +/- 500 K and T_eff=3100 +/- 500 K for NLTT 33370 A and
B, respectively. The observed spectra, derived temperatures, and estimated age
combine to constrain the component spectral types to the range M6-M8.
Evolutionary models predict masses of 113 +/- 8 M_Jup and 106 +/- 7 M_Jup from
the estimated luminosities of the components. KPNO-Phoenix spectra allow us to
estimate the systemic radial velocity of the binary. The Galactic kinematics of
NLTT 33370AB are broadly consistent with other young stars in the Solar
neighborhood. However, definitive membership in a young, kinematic group cannot
be assigned at this time and further follow-up observations are necessary to
fully constrain the system's kinematics. The proximity, age, and late-spectral
type of this binary make it very novel and an ideal target for rapid, complete

for wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into
hydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, and
hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has to be in the form of CO2
rather than CH4 or CO in a H2-depleted water-dominated thick atmosphere, and
that the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich
atmosphere leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We
apply our self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic
features for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD 97658 b, and 55

micron in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 micron in thermal
emission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection of
water-vapor features and a confirmation of nonexistence of methane features
would provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere. In general,
our simulations show that chemical stability has to be taken into account when
interpreting the spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune. Water-dominated
atmospheres only exist for carbon to oxygen ratios much lower than the solar
ratio, suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could be rare.

when one of the hyperfine states involved interacts with the BEC, while the
other state is non-interacting, by performing a non-perturbative resummation of
the probabilities of exciting different numbers of phonon modes. In the
presence of interactions the impurity gets dressed by Bogoliubov excitations of
the BEC, and forms a polaron. The RF signal contains a delta-function peak
centered at the energy of the polaron measured relative to the bare impurity
transition frequency with a weight equal to the amount of bare impurity
character in the polaron state. The RF spectrum also has a broad incoherent
part arising from the background excitations of the BEC, with a characteristic
power-law tail that appears as a consequence of the universal physics of
contact interactions. We discuss both the direct RF measurement, in which the
impurity is initially in an interacting state, and the inverse RF measurement,
in which the impurity is initially in a non-interacting state. In the latter
case, in order to calculate the RF spectrum, we solve the problem of polaron
formation: a mobile impurity dynamically gets dressed by Bogoliubov phonons.
Our solution based on a time-dependent variational ansatz of coherent states of
Bogoliubov phonons, becomes exact when the impurity is localized. Moreover we
show that such an ansatz compares well with a semiclassical estimate of the
propagation amplitude of a mobile impurity in the BEC. Our technique can be
extended to cases when both initial and final impurity states interact with the
BEC.

sub-populations within a sample of high-confidence SDSS DR8 star-forming

Metal-rich dwarfs classified as tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidates in the
literature are typically of metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 8.70 $\pm$ 0.05, while
SDSS dwarfs fainter than M$_R$ = -16 have a mean metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) =
8.28 $\pm$ 0.10, regardless of their luminosity, indicating that there is an
approximate floor to the metallicity of low luminosity galaxies. Our
hydrodynamical simulations predict that TDGs should have metallicities elevated
above the normal luminosity-metallicity relation. Metallicity can therefore be
a useful diagnostic for identifying TDG candidate populations in the absence of
tidal tails. At magnitudes brighter than M$_R$ ~ -16 our sample of 53
star-forming galaxies in 9 HI gas-rich groups is consistent with the normal
relation defined by the SDSS sample. At fainter magnitudes there is an increase
in dispersion in metallicity of our sample, suggestive of a wide range of HI
content and environment. In our sample we identify three (16% of dwarfs) strong
TDG candidates (12 + log(O/H) > 8.6), and four (21%) very metal poor dwarfs (12

do not allow the rods to turn at the intersections, and thus there is a single,
continuous route through the system. This Q1D model displays caging behavior,
collective particle rearrangements, and rapid growth of the structural
relaxation time, which are also found in supercooled liquids and glasses. The
mean-square displacement $\Sigma(t)$ for this Q1D model displays several
dynamical regimes: 1) short-time diffusion $\Sigma(t) \sim t$, 2) a plateau in
the mean-square displacement caused by caging behavior, 3) single-file
diffusion characterized by anomalous scaling $\Sigma(t) \sim t^{0.5}$ at
intermediate times, and 4) a crossover to long-time diffusion $\Sigma(t) \sim
t$ for times $t$ that grow with the complexity of the circuit. We develop a
general procedure for determining the structural relaxation time $t_D$, beyond
which the system undergoes long-time diffusion, as a function of the packing
fraction $\phi$ and system topology. This procedure involves several steps: 1)
define a set of distinct microstates in configuration space of the system, 2)
construct a directed network of microstates and transitions between them, 3)
identify minimal, closed loops in the network that give rise to structural
relaxation, 4) determine the frequencies of `bottleneck' microstates that
control the slow dynamics and time required to transition out of them, and 5)
use the microstate frequencies and lifetimes to deduce $t_D(\phi)$. We find
that $t_D$ obeys power-law scaling, $t_D\sim (\phi^* - \phi)^{-\alpha}$, where
both $\phi^*$ (signaling complete kinetic arrest) and $\alpha>0$ depend on the

for an elliptic two-dimensional problem with discontinuous coefficients is

union of $N$ disjoint polygonal subdomains $\Omega_i$ of diameter $O(H_i)$. The
discontinuities of the coefficients, possibly very large, are assumed to occur
only across the subdomain interfaces $\partial \Omega_i$. In each $\Omega_i$ a
conforming quasiuniform triangulation with parameters $h_i$ is constructed. We
assume that the resulting triangulation in $\Omega$ is also conforming, i.e.,
the meshes are assumed to match across the subdomain interfaces. On the fine
triangulation the problem is discretized by a DG method. For solving the
resulting discrete system, a FETI-DP type method is proposed and analyzed. It
is established that the condition number of the preconditioned linear system is
estimated by $C(1 + \max_i \log H_i/h_i)^2$ with a constant $C$ independent of
$h_i$, $H_i$ and the jumps of coefficients. The method is well suited for
parallel computations and it can be extended to three-dimensional problems.
This result is an extension, to the case of full fine-grid DG discretization,
of the previous result [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp.~400--422] where it
was considered a conforming finite element method inside the subdomains and a
discontinuous Galerkin method only across the subdomain interfaces. Numerical
results are presented to validate the theory.

important source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and these are vital for
the formation of clouds in view of the high supersaturations required for
homogeneous water droplet nucleation. The methods of quantum chemistry have
increasingly been employed to model nucleation due to their high accuracy and
efficiency in calculating configurational energies; and nucleation rates can be
obtained from the associated free energies of particle formation. However, even
in such advanced approaches, it is typically assumed that the nuclei have a
classical nature, which is questionable for some systems. The importance of
zero-point motion (also known as quantum nuclear dynamics) in modelling small
clusters of sulphuric acid and water is tested here using the path integral
molecular dynamics (PIMD) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level
of theory. The general effect of zero-point motion is to distort the mean
structure slightly, and to promote the extent of proton transfer with respect
to classical behaviour. In a particular configuration of one sulphuric acid
molecule with three waters, the range of positions explored by a proton between
a sulphuric acid and a water molecule at 300 K (a broad range in contrast to
the confinement suggested by geometry optimisation at 0 K) is clearly affected
by the inclusion of zero point motion, and similar effects are observed for
other configurations.

formulated. The mathematical and physical relevance of the radix economy, also
called digit capacity, is established, showing how physical laws can be derived
from this concept in a unified way. The principle reinterprets and generalizes
the principle of least action yielding two classes of physical solutions: least
action paths and quantum wavefunctions. A new physical foundation of the
Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is then accomplished and it is used to
derive the Schr\""odinger and Dirac equations and the breaking of the
commutativity of spacetime geometry. The formulation provides an explanation of
how determinism and random statistical behavior coexist in spacetime and a
framework is developed that allows dynamical processes to be formulated in
terms of chains of digits. These methods lead to a new (pre-geometrical)
foundation for Lorentz transformations and special relativity. The
Parker-Rhodes combinatorial hierarchy is encompassed within our approach and
this leads to an estimate of the interaction strength of the electromagnetic

of less than one thousandth. Finally, it is shown how the principle of
least-radix economy naturally gives rise to Boltzmann's principle of classical
statistical thermodynamics. A new expression for a general (path-dependent)

ecological and medical studies where the exact measurement of the variable of
interest is costly but a small number of sampling units can be ordered with
respect to the variable of interest by any means other than actual measurements

statistics which are not identically distributed and most of the commonly used
nonparametric techniques are not directly applicable to them. We first develop
kernel density estimates of $f$ based on an imperfect PROS sampling procedure
and study its theoretical properties. Then, we consider the problem when the
underlying distribution is assumed to be symmetric and introduce some plug-in
kernel density estimators of $f$. We use an EM type algorithm to estimate
misplacement probabilities associated with an imperfect PROS design. Finally,
we expand on various numerical illustrations of our results via several

(MTI-FP) method for solving the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation with a dimensionless
parameter $0<\varepsilon\leq1$ which is inversely proportional to the speed of
light. In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. $0<\varepsilon\ll1$, the
solution to the KG equation propagates waves with amplitude at $O(1)$ and
wavelength at $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in time and $O(1)$ in space, which causes
significantly numerical burdens due to the high oscillation in time. The MTI-FP
method is designed by adapting a multiscale decomposition by frequency (MDF) to
the solution at each time step and applying an exponential wave integrator to
the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with wave operator under well-prepared
initial data for $\varepsilon^2$-frequency and $O(1)$-amplitude waves and a
KG-type equation with small initial data for the reminder waves in the MDF. We
rigorously establish two independent error bounds in $H^2$-norm to the MTI-FP
method at $O(h^{m_0}+\tau^2+\varepsilon^2)$ and
$O(h^{m_0}+\tau^2/\varepsilon^2)$ with $h$ mesh size, $\tau$ time step and
$m_0\ge2$ an integer depending on the regularity of the solution, which
immediately imply that the MTI-FP converges uniformly and optimally in space
with exponential convergence rate if the solution is smooth, and uniformly in
time with linear convergence rate at $O(\tau)$ for all $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$
and optimally with quadratic convergence rate at $O(\tau^2)$ in the regimes
when either $\varepsilon=O(1)$ or $0<\varepsilon\le \tau$. Numerical results
are reported to confirm the error bounds and demonstrate the efficiency and
accuracy of the MTI-FP method for the KG equation, especially in the
nonrelativistic limit regime.

programme Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution, the Two Micron All Sky
Survey and the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey, plots have been constructed
to expose the relative contributions from molecular hydrogen, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, forbidden emission lines, warm dust continuum and
stellar emission at various bands. Besides identifying trends, these plots have
helped to reveal PN mimics including six previously known PNe in the outer LMC
which are re-classied as other object types. Together with continuing follow-up
optical observations, the data have enabled a substantial reduction in the
number of PNe previously tagged as `likely' and `possible'. The total number of
LMC PNe is adjusted to 715 but with a greater degree of confidence in regard to
classification.
  In each colour-colour plot, the more highly evolved LMC PNe are highlighted
for comparison with younger, brighter PNe. The faintest and most evolved PNe
typically cluster in areas of colour-colour space occupied by ordinary stars.
Possible reasons for the wide disparity in infrared colour-colour ratios, such
as evolution and dust composition, are presented for evaluation. A correlation
is found between the optical luminosity of PNe, emission-line ratios and the
MIR dust luminosity at various bands. Luminosity functions using the four
Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer of Spitzer (MIPS) [24]
bands are directly compared, revealing an increasing accumulation of PNe within
the brightest two magnitudes at longer wavelengths. A correlation is also found
between the MIPS [24] band and the [O III] 5007 and H-beta fluxes.

matching method matches H-ATLAS sources to GAMA/SDSS galaxies, then links the
optical counterparts to GAMA groups. The stacking method counts the number of
far-IR sources within the projected radii of GAMA groups, subtracting the local
background. We investigated the dependence of the far-IR (250 um) luminosity
function on group mass in the range 10d12 < M_h < 10d14Msun/h and on redshift
in the range 0 < z < 0.4, using a sample of 3000 groups containing H-ATLAS
sources with GAMA redshifts over an area of 126 sq. deg. We find that the
characteristic 250 um luminosity, L^*(250), increases with group mass up to M_h
~ 10d13Msun/h, but is roughly constant above this, while it increases with
redshift at high group masses, but less so at low masses. We also find that the
group far-IR luminosity-to-mass ratio L(250)/M_h increases with redshift and is
higher in low-mass groups. We estimate that around 70% of the 250 um luminosity
density in the local universe is contributed by groups with M_h > 10d12Msun/h.
We also find that the far-IR-to-optical colours of H-ATLAS galaxies are
independent of group mass over the range 10d12 < M_h <10d14Msun/h in the local
universe. We also compare our observational results with recent semi-analytical

states: not only is it in principle computable, but one can obtain lower bounds
for it. In this way, it has been possible to identify families of states whose
complexity scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. With the goal of
progressing in the systematic study of the mathematical property of $\rm{TS}$,
in this work we characterize the tree size of pure states for the case where
the number of qubits is small, namely, 3 or 4. The study of three qubits does
not hold great surprises, insofar as the structure of entanglement is rather
simple; the maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 8, reached for instance by the
$|\rm{W}\rangle$ state. The study of four qubits yields several insights: in
particular, the most economic description of a state is found not to be
recursive. The maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 16, reached for instance by a
state called $|\Psi^{(4)}\rangle$ which was already discussed in the context of
four-photon down-conversion experiments. We also find that the states with
maximal tree size form a set of zero measure: a smoothed version of tree size
over a neighborhood of a state ($\epsilon-\rm{TS}$) reduces the maximal values
to 6 and 14, respectively. Finally, we introduce a notion of tree size for
mixed states and discuss it for a one-parameter family of states.

  analysis of acoustics and structures",,,,,"physics.comp-ph math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  The trapezoidal rule, which is a special case of the Newmark family of
algorithms, is one of the most widely used methods for transient hyperbolic
problems. In this work, we show that this rule conserves linear and angular
momenta and energy in the case of undamped linear elastodynamics problems, and
an `energy-like measure' in the case of undamped acoustic problems. These
conservation properties, thus, provide a rational basis for using this
algorithm. In linear elastodynamics problems, variants of the trapezoidal rule
that incorporate `high-frequency' dissipation are often used, since the higher
frequencies, which are not approximated properly by the standard
displacement-based approach, often result in unphysical behavior. Instead of
modifying the trapezoidal algorithm, we propose using a hybrid finite element
framework for constructing the stiffness matrix. Hybrid finite elements, which
are based on a two-field variational formulation involving displacement and
stresses, are known to approximate the eigenvalues much more accurately than
the standard displacement-based approach, thereby either bypassing or reducing

vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks due to the additional transmission of the

transmission for secure communication is an interesting and important problem.
In this paper, we consider the transmission of a confidential message from a
source to a destination in a decentralized wireless network in the presence of
randomly distributed eavesdroppers. The source-destination pair can be
potentially assisted by randomly distributed relays. For an arbitrary relay, we
derive exact expressions of secure connection probability for both colluding
and non-colluding eavesdroppers. We further obtain lower bound expressions on
the secure connection probability, which are accurate when the eavesdropper
density is small. By utilizing these lower bound expressions, we propose a
relay selection strategy to improve the secure connection probability. By
analytically comparing the secure connection probability for direct
transmission and relay transmission, we address the important problem of
whether or not to relay and discuss the condition for relay transmission in
terms of the relay density and source-destination distance. These analytical
results are accurate in the small eavesdropper density regime.

Coulomb force does not destroy the Q-ball configuration. These properties are
analogous to those in the V-shaped model, which was studied by Arod\'z and Lis.

technologies. At the architectural level, soft errors are commonly modeled by a
probabilistic bit-flip model. In developing such abstract fault models, an
important issue to consider is the likelihood of multiple bit errors caused by
particle strikes. This likelihood has been studied to a great extent in
memories, but has not been understood to the same extent in logic circuits. In
this paper, we attempt to quantify the likelihood that a single transient event
can cause multiple bit errors in logic circuits consisting of combinational
gates and flip-flops. In particular, we calculate the conditional probability
of multiple bit-flips given that a single bit flips as a result of the
transient. To calculate this conditional probability, we use a Monte Carlo
technique in which samples are generated using detailed post-layout circuit
simulations. Our experiments on the ISCAS'85 benchmarks and a few other
circuits indicate that, this conditional probability is quite significant and
can be as high as 0.31. Thus we conclude that multiple bit-flips must
necessarily be considered in order to obtain a realistic architectural fault
model for soft errors.

calorimeter in the ZDC installation slot at one of the RHIC interaction points.
By installing a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter at this location we
measure the spectra of photons, neutrons and pi0 at pseudo rapidity eta above
6.
  The new measurements at 500 GeV p-p collisions contribute to improve the
hadronic interaction models used in the cosmic-ray air shower simulations.
Using a similar kinematic coverage at RHIC to that of the measurements at LHC,
we can test the Feynman scaling with a wide energy range and make the
extrapolation of models into cosmic-ray energy more reliable. Combination of a
high position resolution of the LHCf detector and a high energy resolution of
the ZDC makes it possible to determine pT of forward neutrons with the ever
best resolution. This enables us to study the forward neutron spin asymmetry
discovered at RHIC in more detail.
  Another new experiment expected at RHIC is world-first light-ion collisions.
Cosmic-ray interaction models have been so far tested with accelerator data,
but colliders have provided only p-p and heavy-ion collisions. To simulate the
interaction between cosmic-ray particles and atmosphere, collision of light
ions like nitrogen is a ultimate goal for the cosmic-ray physics. We propose
200 GeV p-N collisions together with 200 GeV p-p collisions to study the
nuclear effects in the forward particle production.
  The experiment can be performed by using the existing LHCf detector.
Considering the geometry and response of one of the LHCf detectors, we propose
some short dedicated operations. Ideal beam conditions are summarized in this
paper. Our basic idea is to bring one of the LHCf detectors to RHIC and then
operate from 2016 season at RHIC.

presented. A HZ in this context must satisfy two separate conditions: a
radiative one and one of dynamical stability. For the case of single stars, the
usual concept of circumstellar habitable zone is based on the radiative
condition only, as the dynamical stability condition is taken for granted. For
the radiative condition, we extend the simple formulation of the circumstellar
habitable zone for single stars, to the case of eccentric stellar binary
systems, where two sources of luminosity at different orbital phases contribute
to the irradiance of their planetary circumstellar and circumbinary regions.
Our approach considers binaries with eccentric orbits and guarantees that
orbits in the computed habitable zone remain within it at all orbital phases.
For the dynamical stability condition, we use the approach of invariant loops
developed by Pichardo et al. 2005 to find regions of stable, non-intersecting
orbits, which is a robust method to find stable regions in binary stars, as it
is based in the existence of integrals of motion. We apply the combined
criteria to calculate HZ for 64 binary stars in the solar neighborhood with
known orbital parameters, including some with discovered planets. Formulae and
interpolating tables are provided, so the reader can compute the boundaries of
the HZ for an arbitrary binary system, using the stellar flux limits they
prefer. Together with the formulae provided for stable zones, these allow the
computation of both regions of stability and habitability around any binary
stellar system. We found 56% of the cases we consider can satisfy both
restrictions, this is a very important constriction to binary systems.
Nevertheless, we conclude that these systems where a dynamical and radiative
safe zone exists, must be considered strong candidates in the search for
habitable planets

ZF/MRT scheme achieves a diversity order of N-M, where N is the number of relay
antennas and M is the number of interferers. In addition, we show that the
MMSE/MRT scheme always achieves the best outage performance, and the ZF/MRT
scheme outperforms the MRC/MRT scheme in the low SNR regime, while becomes
inferior to the MRC/MRT scheme in the high SNR regime. Finally, in the large N
regime, we show that both the ZF/MRT and MMSE/MRT schemes are capable of
completely eliminating the CCI, while perfect interference cancelation is not
possible with the MRC/MRT scheme.

that a correlation leading to the non-local box is possible to be derived
consistently if we release the one of major axioms in quantum mechanics, {\it
Born's rule}. This allows us to obtain a theory which in one end of the

from the Euclidean metric only in a smooth and strictly convex bounded domain
$M$. The lens rigidity problem is concerned with recovering the metric $g$
inside $M$ from the corresponding lens relation on the boundary $\partial M$.
In this paper, the stability of the lens rigidity problem is investigated for
metrics which are a priori close to a given non-trapping metric satisfying
""strong fold-regular"" condition. A metric $g$ is called strong fold-regular if
for each point $x\in M$, there exists a set of geodesics passing through $x$
whose conormal bundle covers $T^*_{x}M$. Moreover, these geodesics contain
either no conjugate points or only fold conjugate points with a non-degeneracy
condition. Examples of strong fold-regular metrics are constructed and are
expected to be generic. Our main result gives the first stability result for
the lens rigidity problem in the case of anisotropic metrics which allow
conjugate points. The approach is based on the study of the linearized inverse
problem of recovering a metric from its induced geodesic flow, which is a
weighted geodesic X-ray transform problem for symmetric 2-tensor fields. A key
ingredient is to show that the kernel of the X-ray transform on symmetric
solenoidal 2-tensor fields is of finite dimension. It remains open whether the
kernel space is trivial or not.

of the masses of both components. Using up to date evolutionary models, I
obtain a mass range of between 25 to 35 Msun for the mass of the supergiant and
between 13 to 23 Msun for the mass of the black hole. Accepting more liberal
estimates of uncertainties in both the distance and the effective temperature,
one may extend these ranges to 21 to 35 Msun and 10 to 23 Msun for both masses,
respectively. The most likely values within these ranges are, respectively, 27
Msun and 16 Msun. The obtained mass of black hole agrees with the value 15 +- 1
Msun suggested by Orosz et al. (2011). However, the value suggested by them for
the mass of the supergiant of 19 +- 2 Msun should not be used as such a star
violates the mass-luminosity relation for the the massive core hydrogen burning
stars. This consideration was not incorporated into the iterative process of
Orosz et al. To resolve this violation I consider the possibility that the
hydrogen content of HDE 222268 might be lowered as a result of the mass
transfer and the induced fast rotation of the mass gainer. I analyzed the
evolutionary effects of such situation and found that, while important, they do
not invalidate the conclusions listed above. If, as a result of the rotation
induced mixing, the present hydrogen content of HDE 226868 is equal about 0.6
(as suggested by some observational data), then its present mass may be
somewhat lower: about 24 Msun rather than about 27 Msun.

find that it scales with the ionising continuum luminosity roughly as expected

Predictions from regression analysis are compared to existing experimental data

The spin-orbit admixture coefficients data were based on atomic spin-orbit

momentum-relaxation involves the Debye temperature and the electron-phonon
coupling whose variation among the elemental metals was neglected, ii) the
Elliott-Yafet theory involves matrix elements of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC),

deal with situations in which training data is not available. Then we cannot
model the unknown functional relationship between data and the unknown model
function (or parameter vector) with a Gaussian Process of appropriate
dimensionality. A Bayesian method based on state space modelling is advanced
instead. Within this framework, the likelihood is expressed in terms of the
probability density function ($pdf$) of the state space variable and the sought
model parameter vector is embedded within the domain of this $pdf$. As the
measurable vector lives only inside an identified sub-volume of the system
state space, the $pdf$ of the state space variable is projected onto the space
of the measurables, and it is in terms of the projected state space density
that the likelihood is written; the final form of the likelihood is achieved
after convolution with the distribution of measurement errors. Application
motivated vague priors are invoked and the posterior probability density of the
model parameter vectors, given the data is computed. Inference is performed by
taking posterior samples with adaptive MCMC. The method is illustrated on
synthetic as well as real galactic data.

extending the work of Chandrasekhar & M\""unch (1950). This method is applied a)
to theoretical synthetic data recovering the original velocity distribution
with very small error; b) to a sample of about 12.000 field main--sequence
stars, corroborating that the velocity distribution function is
non--Maxwellian, but is better described by distributions based on the concept
of maximum entropy, such as Tsallis or Kaniadakis distribution functions. This
is a very robust and novel method that deconvolve the rotational velocity
cumulative distribution function from a sample of $v \sin i$ data in just one
single step without needing any convergence criteria.

maintained to the channel capacity (as the target error-probability is lowered

challenging to determine the ordering of the items to sell in order to maximize
the revenue due to the fact that the autonomy and private information of the
agents heavily influence the outcome of the auction.
  The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we demonstrate how to
apply machine learning techniques to solve the optimal ordering problem in
sequential auctions. We learn regression models from historical auctions, which
are subsequently used to predict the expected value of orderings for new
auctions. Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization
methods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach
that maps learned models to integer linear programs (ILP) which can then be
solved by any ILP-solver. Although the studied auction design problem is hard,
our proposed optimization methods obtain good orderings with high revenues.
  Our second main contribution is the insight that the internal structure of
regression models can be efficiently evaluated inside an ILP solver for
optimization purposes. To this end, we provide efficient encodings of
regression trees and linear regression models as ILP constraints. This new way
of using learned models for optimization is promising. As the experimental
results show, it significantly outperforms the black-box best-first search in
nearly all settings.

More recently models taking into accounts shocks have been developed by

time-varying stochastic systems driven or modulated by a Levy process with

GCR dedicated detectors, we estimate the energy range responsible for this UVS
signal, around 300 MeV, and the response of UVS to the GCR anisotropy. After
the abrupt jumps of May and August 2012 the count rate has been fluctuating
only slightly around a constant value, but comparing with data from the LECP
and the CRS instruments shows that those small variations are only responses to
a varying anisotropy and not to a flux change. Taking advantage of the
similarity in energy range to one of the products of the CRS instrument suite,
we use the ratio between the two independent signals as a proxy for the
temporal evolution of the GCR spectral slope around the 300 MeV range. We show
that this slope has remained unchanged since Aug 2012 and find strong evidence
that it will no longer vary, implying the end of the modulation at those
energies and that V1 at this date is near or past the heliopause. The origin of
this narrow and stagnating inner heliosheath is still unclear, and we discuss
the potential effects of low solar wind speed episodes and subsequent
self-amplified charge-exchange with interstellar neutrals, as a source of
deceleration and collapse. We suggest that the quasi-static region encountered
by V1 may be related to such effects, triggered by the strong post
solar-maximum variability. This did not happen for V2 due to its trajectory at
an angle further from the heliosphere axis and a later termination shock
crossing. The existence on the upwind side of a mixing layer formed by charge
transfer instead of a pure plasma contact discontinuity could explain various

count and weight, both in theory and practice) known to be computable in
polynomial time. Unfortunately, all known algorithms for computing it take
Omega(n^2) time, limiting its applicability on large data sets.
  We observe that for many point sets, the greedy spanner has many `short'
edges that can be determined locally and usually quickly, and few or no `long'
edges that can usually be determined quickly using local information and the
well-separated pair decomposition. We give experimental results showing large
to massive performance increases over the state-of-the-art on nearly all tests
and real-life data sets. On the theoretical side we prove a near-linear
expected time bound on uniform point sets and a near-quadratic worst-case
bound.
  Our bound for point sets drawn uniformly and independently at random in a
square follows from a local characterization of t-spanners we give on such
point sets: we give a geometric property that holds with high probability on
such point sets. This property implies that if an edge set on these points has
t-paths between pairs of points `close' to each other, then it has t-paths
between all pairs of points.
  This characterization gives a O(n log^2 n log^2 log n) expected time bound on
our greedy spanner algorithm, making it the first subquadratic time algorithm
for this problem on any interesting class of points. We also use this
characterization to give a O((n + |E|) log^2 n log log n) expected time
algorithm on uniformly distributed points that determines if E is a t-spanner,
making it the first subquadratic time algorithm for this problem that does not
make assumptions on E.

substations and sources of power generation to initiate a cascading failure
that maximizes the number of customers without electricity. This is
particularly an important concern when the enemy has the capability to launch
cyber-attacks as practical concerns (i.e. avoiding disruption of service,
presence of legacy systems, etc.) may hinder security. Hence, a defender can
harden the security posture at certain power stations but may lack the time and
resources to do this for the entire power grid. We model a power grid as a
graph and introduce the cascading failure game in which both the defender and
attacker choose a subset of power stations such as to minimize (maximize) the
number of consumers having access to producers of power. We formalize problems
for identifying both mixed and deterministic strategies for both players, prove
complexity results under a variety of different scenarios, identify tractable
cases, and develop algorithms for these problems. We also perform an
experimental evaluation of the model and game on a real-world power grid
network. Empirically, we noted that the game favors the attacker as he benefits
more from increased resources than the defender. Further, the minimax defense
produces roughly the same expected payoff as an easy-to-compute deterministic
load based (DLB) defense when played against a minimax attack strategy.
However, DLB performs more poorly than minimax defense when faced with the
attacker's best response to DLB. This is likely due to the presence of low-load
yet high-payoff nodes, which we also found in our empirical analysis.

produce a curve comparable to the Gibbs adsorption isotherm. However, the
actual isotherm takes into account the solubility of the surfactant in the
aqueous bulk phase. Hence, assuming that the total surfactant population is
only distributed among the available oil/water interfaces, one can calculate
what surface concentration is necessary to reproduce the experimental values of
the interfacial tension. A similar procedure can be followed using the zeta
potential of the drops as a standard for a given set of salt and surfactant
concentrations. We applied these procedures to the case of hexadecane/water
nanoemulsions at different salt concentrations. This information was used to
compute typical interaction potentials between non-deformable nanoemulsion

plate with a periodic pattern of holes, in a compressible, ideal, inviscid
fluid in the absence of mean flow. Leppington and Levine (J. Fluid Mech., 1973)
obtained an approximation of the reflection and transmission coefficients of a
plane wave incident on an infinitely thin plate with a rectangular array of
perforations, assuming that a characteristic size of the perforations is
negligible relative to that of the unit cell of the grating, itself assumed to
be negligible relative to the wavelength. One part of the present study is of
methodological interest. It establishes that it is possible to extend their
approach to thick plates with a skew grating of perforations, thus confirming
recent results in Bendali et al. (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 2013), but in a much
simpler way without using complex matched asymptotic expansions of the full
wave or to a grating of multipoles. As is well-known, effective compliances for
the plate can then be derived from the corresponding approximations of the
reflection and transmission coefficients. These compliances are expressed in
terms of the Rayleigh conductivity of an isolated perforation. Consequently, in
one other part of the present study, the methodology recently introduced in
Laurens et al. (ESAIM:M2AN, 2013) to obtain sharp bounds for the Rayleigh
conductivity has been extended to include the case for which the openings of
the perforations on the upper and lower sides of the plate are elliptical in
shape. This not only enables the determination of these bounds and of the
associated reflection and transmission coefficients for actual plates with
tilted perforations but also yields single expressions covering all usual cases
of perforations: straight or tilted with a circular or an elliptical
cross-section.

defined analytically in terms of the specific entropy for moist air. The
expression for ${\theta}_{s}$ is valid for a general mixing of dry air, water
vapour and possible condensed water species. It verifies the same conservative
properties as the moist entropy, even for varying dry air or total water
content. The moist formulation for ${\theta}_{s}$ is equal to the dry
formulation $\theta$ if dry air is considered and it verifies new properties
valid for the moist air cases, both saturated or under-saturated ones. Exact
and approximate versions of ${\theta}_{s}$ are evaluated for several
Stratocumulus cases, in particular by using the aircraft observations FIRE-I
experiment data sets. It appears that there is no (or small) jump in
${\theta}_{s}$ at the top of the PBL. The mixing in moist entropy is almost
complete in the PBL, with the same values observed in the clear air and the
cloudy regions, including the very top of the entrainment region. The
Randall-Deardorff CTEI analysis may be interpreted as a mixing in moist entropy
criterion. The iso-${\theta}_{s}$ lines are plotted on skew $T$-$\ln(p)$ and
conserved variable diagrams. All these properties could suggest some hints on
the use of moist entropy (or ${\theta}_{s}$) in cloud modelling or in mixing
processes, with the marine Stratocumulus considered as a paradigm of moist
turbulence.

physical basis of judo throws it is possible to obtain such results from the
analysis of high competition application:Lever Techniques are enhanced in their
effectiveness in three ways: The rotational movements, strictly connected to
the Lever techniques mechanics achieving victory in competition, can be
extended to the unbalance phase. The rotational movements can be applied in a
totally new way putting away even the unbalance that is basic in the Lever
techniques. The Lever tool can be hybridized with the Couple tool to lower the
energy consumption. Couple Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness also
in three ways: The Couple tool that doesnt need unbalance allowing uke body
rotate around his center of mass, is enhanced utilizing the Uke body smaller
resistance directions,normally summarized in Diagonal attacks. The vertical
rotational movements in the transverse plan with the axis in the sagittal plane
can be added to the Couple application with transverse rotation and axis in the
frontal plane to overcome some defensive resistance, mainly in the trunk and
leg group of Couple techniques,like Uchi Mata or O Soto Gari. The rotational
movements enhance the throwing action changing the mechanics of Couple into
Lever applying a Torque,both with the direction change of one force or the time
delay of his application. This analysis, expanded with a short physical
framework, clarifies hidden deep concepts and helps teacher and coaches in

wherever hydrogen is predominantly molecular. They are found to be strongly
depleted in dense molecular clouds, suggesting freeze-out onto grains in such
cold environments. We can then expect that HCl and HF were also the major
carriers of Cl and F in the gas and icy phases of the outer solar nebula, and
were incorporated into comets. We aimed to measure the HCl and HF abundances in
cometary ices as they can provide insights on the halogen chemistry in the
early solar nebula. We searched for the J(1-0) lines of HCl and HF at 626 and
1232 GHz, respectively, using the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space
Observatory. HCl was searched for in comets 103P/Hartley 2 and C/2009 P1
(Garradd), whereas observations of HF were conducted in comet C/2009 P1. In
addition, observations of H$_2$O and H$_2^{18}$O lines were performed in C/2009
P1 to measure the H$_2$O production rate. Three lines of CH$_3$OH were
serendipitously observed in the HCl receiver setting. HCl is not detected,
whereas a marginal (3.6-$\sigma$) detection of HF is obtained. The upper limits
for the HCl abundance relative to water are 0.011% and 0.022%, for 103P and
C/2009 P1, respectively, showing that HCl is depleted with respect to the solar
Cl/O abundance by a factor more than 6$^{+6}_{-3}$ in 103P, where the error is
related to the uncertainty in the chlorine solar abundance. The marginal HF
detection obtained in C/2009 P1 corresponds to an HF abundance relative to
water of (1.8$\pm$0.5) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$, which is approximately consistent
with a solar photospheric F/O abundance. The observed depletion of HCl suggests
that HCl was not the main reservoir of chlorine in the regions of the solar
nebula where these comets formed. HF was possibly the main fluorine compound in
the gas phase of the outer solar nebula.

expanding universe is demonstrated to be explainable as an excess of the
kinetic energy with respect to its potential energy. According to traditional
Friedman cosmology, any non-zero value of the total energy integral is ascribed
to the space curvature. However, as we show, in the flat universe the total
energy also can be different from zero. Initially, a very small excess of
kinetic energy originates from the early universe. The present observational
data show that our universe has probably a flat space with an excess of kinetic
energy. The evolutionary scenario shows that the universe presently is in the
transitional stage where its radial coordinate expansion approaches the
velocity of light. A possibility of the closed Bubble universe with the local
Big Bang and everlasting expansion is demonstrated. Dark matter can be
essentially contributed by the non-relativistic massive neutrinos, which have
cooled to very low temperatures and velocities thus favoring the formation of
the observed broad equipotential wells in galaxies.

electronic dispersions have large renormalization kinks near the same energy.
These observations suggest that phonon broadening originates from quasiparticle

originate from coupling to anomalous phonons. We measured the phonon anomaly in
underdoped (x=0.05) and overdoped (x=0.20,0.25) La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ by
inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering with high resolution. Combining these

of the giant phonon anomaly is very different from that of the ARPES kink, i.e.
the two phenomena are not connected. We show that these results provide
indirect evidence that the phonon anomaly originates from novel collective
charge excitations as opposed to interactions with electron-hole pairs. Their
amplitude follows the superconducting dome so these charge modes may be
important for superconductivity.

energies and their potential value to constrain physical processes and
astrophysical parameters in the most energetic sources of the universe. Current
detectors have failed to detect significant anisotropies which had been
expected to allow source identification. Some indications about the UHECR
composition, which may become heavier at the highest energies, has even put
into question the possibility that such a goal could be achieved soon.
  We investigate the potential value of a new-generation detector, with 10
times larger exposure, to overcome the current situation and make significant
progress in the detection of anisotropies and thus in the study of UHECRs. We
take as an example the expected performances of the JEM-EUSO, assuming a
uniform full-sky coverage with a total exposure of 300,000 km2 sr yr.
  We simulate realistic UHECR sky maps for a wide range of possible
astrophysical scenarios allowed by the current constraints, taking into account
the energy losses and photo-dissociation of the UHECRs, as well as their
deflections by magnetic fields. These sky maps, built for the expected
statistics of JEM-EUSO as well as for the current Auger statistics, as a
reference, are analyzed from the point of view of their intrinsic anisotropies,
using the two-point correlation function. A statistical study of the resulting
anisotropies is performed for each astrophysical scenario, varying the UHECR
source composition and spectrum as well as the source density.
  We find that significant anisotropies are expected to be detected by a
next-generation UHECR detector, for essentially all the astrophysical scenarios
studied, and give precise, quantitative meaning to this statement. Our results
show that a gain of one order of magnitude in exposure would make a significant

a 3.58 day orbit around a 4.2 Gyr-old G2 star. The planet candidate was
identified from the CoRoT photometry, and was confirmed as a planet with
ground-based spectroscopy.
  The confirmation of the planet candidate is based on radial velocity
observations combined with imaging to rule out blends. The characterisation of
the planet and its host star is carried out using a Bayesian approach where all
the data (CoRoT photometry, radial velocities, and spectroscopic
characterisation of the star) are used jointly. The Bayesian analysis includes
a study whether the assumption of white normally distributed noise holds for
the CoRoT photometry, and whether the use of a non-normal noise distribution
offers advantages in parameter estimation and model selection.
  CoRoT-27b has a mass of $10.39 \pm 0.55$ $\mathrm{M}_{\rm Jup}$, a radius of
$1.01 \pm 0.04$ $\mathrm{R}_{\rm Jup}$, a mean density of
$12.6_{-1.67}^{+1.92}$ $\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$, and an effective temperature of
$1500 \pm 130$ K. The planet orbits around its host star, a 4.2 Gyr-old G2-star
with a mass $M_{\star}=1.06$ $M_{\odot}$, and a radius $R_{\star}=1.05$
$R_{\odot}$, on a $0.048 \pm 0.007$ AU orbit every 3.58 days. The radial
velocity observations allow us to exclude highly eccentric orbits, namely,
$e<0.065$ with a 99% confidence. Given its high mass and density, theoretical
modelling of CoRoT-27b is demanding. We identify two solutions with heavy
element mass fractions of $0.11\pm0.08$ $\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ and $0.07\pm0.06$
$\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$, but even solutions void of heavy elements cannot be
excluded.
  We carry out a secondary eclipse search from the CoRoT photometry using a
method based on Bayesian model selection, but conclude that the noise level is
too high to detect eclipses shallower than 9% of the transit depth.

proposed. It is extended from the classical definition to the quantum realm by
showing that a `transition' from the Markov to the non-Markov regime occurs
when the correlations between the system and the environment, generated by
their joint evolution, can no longer be neglected. The suggested definition is
based on the comparison between measured correlation functions and those built
by assuming that the system is in a Markov regime thus giving a figure of merit
of the error coming from this assumption. It is shown that the knowledge of the
dynamical map and initial condition of the system is not enough to fully
characterise the non-Markovian dynamics of the reduced system. The example of
three exactly solvable models, i.e. decoherence and spontaneous emission of the
qubit in a bosonic bath and decoherence of the photon's polarization induced by
interaction with its spacial degrees of freedom, reveals that previously
proposed Markovianity criteria and measures which are based on dynamical map

turbulent compressible flow whom dynamics is modeled with the Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The discrete equations are linearized using
finite differences and the Jacobian is computed using repeated evaluation of
the residuals. Stability of the flow is assessed solving an eigenvalue problem.
The sensitivity gradients which indicate regions of the flow where a passive
control device could stabilize the unstable eigenvalues are defined within this
fully discrete framework. Second order finite differences are applied to the
discrete residual to compute the gradients. In particular, the sensitivity
gradients are shown to be linked to the Hessian of the RANS equations. The
introduced formalism and linearization method are generic: the code used to
evaluate the residual of the RANS equations can be used in a black box manner,
and the complex linearization of the Hessian is avoided. The method is tested
on a two dimensional deep cavity case, the flow is turbulent with a Reynolds
number equal to 860 000 and compressible with a Mach number of 0.8. Several
turbulence models and numerical schemes are used to validate the method.
Physical features of the flow are recovered, such as the fundamental frequency
of the natural flow as well as acoustic mechanisms, suggesting the validity of
the method. The sensitivity gradients are then computed and validated, the
error in predicting the eigenvalue variation being found less than 3\%. Control
maps using a small steady control device are finally obtained, indicating that
the control area should be chosen in the vicinity of the leading edge of the
cavity.

  Strategy",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many computer programs have graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which need good
layout to make efficient use of the available screen real estate. Most GUIs do
not have a fixed layout, but are resizable and able to adapt themselves.
Constraints are a powerful tool for specifying adaptable GUI layouts: they are
used to specify a layout in a general form, and a constraint solver is used to
find a satisfying concrete layout, e.g.\ for a specific GUI size. The
constraint solver has to calculate a new layout every time a GUI is resized or
changed, so it needs to be efficient to ensure a good user experience. One
approach for constraint solvers is based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and
successive over-relaxation (SOR).
  Our observation is that a solution after resizing or changing is similar in
structure to a previous solution. Thus, our hypothesis is that we can increase
the computational performance of an SOR-based constraint solver if we reuse the
solution of a previous layout to warm-start the solving of a new layout. In
this paper we report on experiments to test this hypothesis experimentally for
three common use cases: big-step resizing, small-step resizing and constraint
change. In our experiments, we measured the solving time for randomly generated
GUI layout specifications of various sizes. For all three cases we found that
the performance is improved if an existing solution is used as a starting
solution for a new layout.
