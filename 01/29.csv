detect spins in a semiconductor nanowire where a SINGLE quantized subband is
occupied at room temperature. Here, we report achieving this goal in 50-nm
diameter InSb nanowires by demonstrating both the spin-valve and the Hanle
effect. The spin relaxation time in the nanowires was found to have increased
by an order of magnitude over what has been reported in bulk and quantum wells
due to the suppression of D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation as a result of
single subband occupancy. These experiments raise hopes for the realization of
a room-temperature Datta-Das spin transistor.

based on a multi-resolution transformation of probability distributions. The
model allows a varying amount of shrinkage to be applied to data features of
different scales and/or at different locations in the sample space, and the
varying shrinkage level is locally adaptive to the empirical behavior of the
data. Moreover, the model's hierarchical design---through a latent Markov tree
structure---allows borrowing of information across locations and scales in
setting the adaptive shrinkage level. Inference under the model proceeds
efficiently using general recipes for conjugate hierarchical models. We
illustrate the work of the model in density estimation and evaluate its
performance through simulation under several schematic scenarios carefully
designed to be representative of a variety of applications. We compare its
performance to those of several state-of-the-art nonparametric models---the
P\'olya tree, the optional P\'olya tree, and the Dirichlet process mixture of
normals. In addition, we establish several important theoretical properties for
the model including absolute continuity, full nonparametricity, and posterior
consistency.

discussing its dependence on the parameters -- $\theta_{13}$, mass hierarchy

We follow a staged approach and analyze the $\delta_{CP}$ sensitivity that can
be achieved at different points of time over the next 15 years from these LBL
experiments alone and/or in conjunction with ICAL@INO. We find that the CP
sensitivity of NO$\nu$A/T2K is enhanced due to the synergies between the
different channels and between the two experiments. On the other hand the lack
of knowledge of hierarchy and octant makes the CP sensitivity poorer for some
parameter ranges. Addition of ICAL data to T2K and NO$\nu$A can exclude these
spurious wrong-hierarchy and/or wrong-octant solutions and cause a significant
increase in the range of $\delta_{CP}$ values for which a hint of CP violation
can be achieved. In fact in parameter regions unfavourable for NO$\nu$A/T2K, we
may get the first evidence of CP violation by adding the ICAL data to these.
Similarly the precision with which $\delta_{CP}$ can be measured also improves

increase of the cross--linker concentration, that drives the gel transition, as
well as by an increase of the polymer density, that induces a glass transition.
These dynamical continuous (gel) and discontinuous (glass) transitions might
interfere, since the glass transition might occur within the gel phase, and the
gel transition might be induced in a polymer suspension with glassy features.
Here we study the interplay of these transitions by investigating via
event--driven molecular dynamics simulation the relaxation dynamics of a
polymeric suspension as a function of the cross--linker concentration and the
monomer volume fraction. We show that the slow dynamics within the gel phase is
characterized by a long sub-diffusive regime, which is due both to the crowding
as well as to the presence of a percolating cluster. In this regime, the
transition of structural arrest is found to occur either along the gel or along
the glass line, depending on the length scale at which the dynamics is probed.
Where the two line meet there is no apparent sign of higher order dynamical
singularity. Logarithmic behavior typical of $A_{3}$ singularity appear inside
the gel phase along the glass transition line. These findings seem to be
related to the results of the mode coupling theory for the $F_{13}$ schematic
model.

interlocking pieces. There is no doubt that this is invaluable work,
particularly for our understanding of the intricate connections between so many
quantum information protocols. But to me, it seems to miss the mark for an
ultimate understanding of quantum theory; I am left hungry. I still want to
know what strange property of matter forces this formalism upon our information
accounting. To play on something Einstein once wrote to Max Born, ""The quantum
reconstructions are certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that they
are not yet the real thing. The reconstructions say a lot, but do not really

organizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are
two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the
features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes
that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only
focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms
traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms
mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities
from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable
algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node
attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network
structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community
detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the
network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able
to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches.
Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by
finding relevant node attributes for each community.

substrates, the localized spin is coupled to the nearby itinerant conduction
electrons via Kondo exchange. In the strong coupling limit this can result in
the Kondo effect - the formation of a correlated, many body singlet state - and
a resulting renormalization of the density of states near the Fermi energy.
However, even when Kondo screening does not occur, Kondo exchange can give rise
to a wide variety of other phenomena. In addition to the well known
renormalization of the g factor and the finite spin decoherence and relaxation
times, Kondo exchange has recently been found to give rise to a newly
discovered effect: the renormalization of the single ion magnetic anisotropy.
Here we put these apparently different phenomena on equal footing by treating
the effect of Kondo exchange perturbatively. In this formalism, the central
quantity is $\rho J$, the product of the density of states at the Fermi energy
$\rho$ and the Kondo exchange constant J. We show that perturbation theory
correctly describes the experimentally observed exchange induced shifts of the
single spin excitation energies, demonstrating that Kondo exchange can be used
to tune the effective magnetic anisotropy of a single spin.

orbital plane of the EB is slightly inclined to the line of sight (iEB =
87.33+/-0.06 degrees) while that of the planet is inclined by ~2.5 degrees to
the binary plane at the reference epoch. Orbital precession with a period of
~11 years causes the inclination of the latter to the sky plane to continuously
change. As a result, the planet often fails to transit the primary star at
inferior conjunction, causing stretches of hundreds of days with no transits
(corresponding to multiple planetary orbital periods). We predict that the next
transit will not occur until 2020. The orbital configuration of the system
places the planet slightly closer to its host stars than the inner edge of the
extended habitable zone. Additionally, the orbital configuration of the system
is such that the CBP may experience Cassini-States dynamics under the influence
of the EB, in which the planet's obliquity precesses with a rate comparable to
its orbital precession. Depending on the angular precession frequency of the
CBP, it could potentially undergo obliquity fluctuations of dozens of degrees
(and complex seasonal cycles) on precession timescales.

correlations, long range Van der Waals type interactions and near degeneracy
static correlations. In this work we analyze for a one-dimensional model of a
two-electron system how these three types of correlations can be incorporated
in a simple wave function of restricted functional form consisting of an
orbital product multiplied by a single correlation function $f(r_{12})$
depending on the interelectronic distance $r_{12}$. Since the three types of
correlations mentioned lead to different signatures in terms of the natural
orbital (NO) amplitudes in two-electron systems we make an analysis of the wave
function in terms of the NO amplitudes for a model system of a diatomic
molecule. In our numerical implementation we fully optimize the orbitals and
the correlation function on a spatial grid without restrictions on their
functional form. Due to this particular form of the wave function, we can prove
that none of the amplitudes vanishes and moreover that it displays a distinct
sign pattern and a series of avoided crossings as a function of the bond
distance in agreement with the exact solution. This shows that the wave
function Ansatz correctly incorporates the long range Van der Waals
interactions. We further show that the approximate wave function gives an
excellent binding curve and is able to describe static correlations. We show
that in order to do this the correlation function $f(r_{12})$ needs to diverge
for large $r_{12}$ at large internuclear distances while for shorter bond
distances it increases as a function of $r_{12}$ to a maximum value after which
it decays exponentially. We further give a physical interpretation of this
behavior.

the early Universe, inflation occurs close to a maximum of both the scalar
potential and the scalar coupling to the Ricci scalar in the Jordan frame. At
late times, the dilaton, which decouples from the dynamics during inflation,
receives a potential term from unimodular gravity and leads to the acceleration
of the Universe. We address two central issues in this scenario. First we show
that the Damour-Polyalov mechanism, when non-relativistic matter is present
prior to the start of inflation, sets the initial conditions for inflation at
the maximum of the scalar potential. We then show that conformal invariance
implies that matter particles are not coupled to the dilaton in the late
Universe at the classical level. When fermions acquire masses at low energy,
scale invariance is broken and quantum corrections induce a coupling between
the dilaton and matter which is still small enough to evade the gravitational
constraints in the solar system.

GALEX FUV detector failure. The 5$\sigma$ depth of the NUV imaging varies
between 20.8 and 22.7 (ABmag). Such imaging provides the first sensitive view
of the entire content of hot stars in the Magellanic System, revealing the
presence of young populations even in sites with extremely low star-formation
rate surface density like the MB, owing to high sensitivity of the UV data to
hot stars and the dark sky at these wavelengths.
  The density of UV sources is quite high in many areas of the LMC and SMC.
Crowding limits the quality of source detection and photometry from the
standard mission pipeline processing. We performed custom-photometry of the
GALEX data in the MC survey region ($<15^{\circ}$ from the LMC, $<10^{\circ}$
from the SMC). After merging multiple detections of sources in overlapping
images, the resulting catalog we have produced for the LMC contains nearly 6
million unique NUV point sources within 15$^{\circ}$ and is briefly presented
herein. This paper provides a first look at the GALEX MC survey and highlights
some of the science investigations that the entire catalog and imaging dataset
will make possible.

evolutionary origin remains a key unsolved puzzle. Whereas reciprocity or
conditional cooperation is one of the most prominent mechanisms proposed to
explain the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas, recent experimental
findings on networked Prisoner's Dilemma games suggest that conditional
cooperation also depends on the previous action of the player---namely on the
`mood' in which the player currently is. Roughly, a majority of people behaves
as conditional cooperators if they cooperated in the past, while they ignore
the context and free-ride with high probability if they did not. However, the
ultimate origin of this behavior represents a conundrum itself. Here we aim
specifically at providing an evolutionary explanation of moody conditional
cooperation. To this end, we perform an extensive analysis of different
evolutionary dynamics for players' behavioral traits---ranging from standard
processes used in game theory based on payoff comparison to others that include
non-economic or social factors. Our results show that only a dynamic built upon
reinforcement learning is able to give rise to evolutionarily stable moody
conditional cooperation, and at the end to reproduce the human behaviors
observed in the experiments.

proposed the following approach to study of rigidity problems for the boundary
of a $C^0$-submanifold in a smooth Riemannian manifold: Let $Y_1$ be a
2-dimensional compact connected $C^0$-submanifold with nonempty boundary in a
2-dimensional smooth connected Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$ without boundary
satisfying the condition $$\rho_{Y_1}(x,y) = \liminf_{x' \to x, y' \to y, x',y'
\in \mathop{\rm Int} Y_1} \{[l(\gamma_{x',y',\mathop{\rm Int} Y_1})]\} <
\infty,$$ if $x,y \in Y_1$. Here $\inf[l(\gamma_{x',y',\mathop{\rm Int} Y_1})]$
is the infimum of the length of smooth paths joining $x'$ and $y'$ in the
interior $\mathop{\rm Int} Y_1$ of $Y_1$. In the present paper, we first
establish that $\rho_{Y_1}$ is a metric on $Y_1$. Suppose further that $Y_1$ is
strictly convex in the metric $\rho_{Y_1}$. Consider another 2-dimensional
compact connected $C^0$-submanifold $Y_2$ of $X$ with boundary satisfying the
condition $\rho_{Y_2}(x,y) < \infty$, $x,y \in Y_2$, and assume that $\partial
Y_1$ and $\partial Y_2$ are isometric in the metrics $\rho_{Y_j}$, $j = 1,2$.
There appears the following natural question: Under which additional conditions
are the boundaries $\partial Y_1$ and $\partial Y_2$ of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$
isometric in the metric $\rho_X$ of the ambient manifold $X$? The paper is
devoted to the detailed discussions of this question. In it, we in particular
obtain a number of new results concerning the rigidity problems for the
boundaries of $C^0$-submanifolds in a Riemannian manifold. The case of $\dim
Y_j = \dim X = n$, $n > 2$, is also considered.

field is a key process describing the stage of preheating after inflation. For
sufficiently strong couplings between the inflaton and matter fields, this
process is known to proceed non-perturbatively. Parametric resonance plays
crucial role for bosonic fields in this case, and the evolution of the
occupation numbers for fermions is non-perturbative as well. In the Minkowski
space, parametric resonance for bosons and non-perturbative effects for
fermions would still persist even in the case of weak coupling. In particular,
the energy density of created bosons would grow exponentially with time.
However, the situation is quite different in the expanding universe. We give a
simple demonstration how the conditions of the expanding universe,
specifically, redshift of the field modes, lead to the usual perturbative
expressions for particle production by an oscillating inflaton in the case of
weak couplings. The results that we obtain are relevant and fully applicable to
the Starobinsky model of inflation.

aspects of many real-world allocation problems, such as shipping explosive
munitions, scheduling processes in a cluster with fragile nodes, re-using
passwords across multiple websites, and quarantining patients during a disease
outbreak. In these problems, objects must be assigned to handlers, but each
object has a probability of destroying itself and all the other objects
allocated to the same handler. The goal is to maximize the expected value of
the objects handled successfully.
  We show that finding the optimal allocation is
$\mathsf{NP}$-$\mathsf{complete}$, even if all the handlers are identical. We
present an FPTAS when the number of handlers is constant. We note in passing
that the same technique also yields a first FPTAS for the weapons-target
allocation problem \cite{manne_wta} with a constant number of targets. We study
the structure of DOH problems and find that they have a sort of phase
transition -- in some instances it is better to spread risk evenly among the
handlers, in others, one handler should be used as a ``sacrificial lamb''. We
show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time if the destruction
probabilities depend only on the handler to which an object is assigned; if all
the handlers are identical and the objects all have the same value; or if each
handler can be assigned at most one object.
  Finally, we empirically evaluate several heuristics based on a combination of
greedy and genetic algorithms. The proposed heuristics return fairly high
quality solutions to very large problem instances (upto 250 objects and 100
handlers) in tens of seconds.

increases the entropy and heat energy. Jacobson has showed that the Einstein

This, however, works only if the acceleration $a$ is much larger than the scale
set by the curvature of the spacetime. It is explored here whether an extension
is possible to the case with no lower bound on $a$. We show that this is
possible if one assumes that in a locally accelerating frame, the matter-energy
passing through null hypersurfaces could result in an increase in the heat
energy and the entropy. Such a generalisation extends the thermodynamic
derivation of gravity to include any non-freely falling observer. A new method
of determining the temperature detected by such locally accelerating observers

The
problem involves a collection of agents (radios) that wish to discover each
other in the blind setting where there is no shared infrastructure and they
initially have no knowledge of each other. Time is divided into discrete slots;
spectrum is divided into discrete channels, $\{1,2,..., n\}$. Each agent may
access a single channel in a single time slot and we say that two agents
rendezvous when they access the same channel in the same time slot. The model
is asymmetric: each agent $A_i$ may only use a particular subset $S_i$ of the
channels and different agents may have access to different subsets of channels.
The goal is to design deterministic channel hopping schedules for each agent so
as to guarantee rendezvous between any pair of agents with overlapping channel
sets.
  Two independent sets of authors, Shin et al. and Lin et al., gave the first
constructions guaranteeing asynchronous blind rendezvous in $O(n^2)$ and
$O(n^3)$ time, respectively. We present a substantially improved construction
guaranteeing that any two agents, $A_i$, $A_j$, will rendezvous in $O(|S_i|
|S_j| \log\log n)$ time. Our results are the first that achieve nontrivial
dependence on $|S_i|$, the size of the set of available channels. This allows
us, for example, to save roughly a quadratic factor over the best previous
results in the important case when channel subsets have constant size. We also
achieve the best possible bound of $O(1)$ time for the symmetric situation;
previous works could do no better than $O(n)$. Using the probabilistic method
and Ramsey theory we provide evidence in support of our suspicion that our
construction is asymptotically optimal for small size channel subsets: we show
both a $c |S_i||S_j|$ lower bound and a $c \log\log n$ lower bound when $|S_i|,
|S_j| \leq n/2$.

Here we analyze the evolution of a non-rotating 60 Msun star and its spectrum
throughout its lifetime. Interestingly, the star has a supergiant appearance
(luminosity class I) even at the ZAMS. We find the following evolutionary
sequence of spectral types: O3 I (at the ZAMS), O4 I (middle of the H-core
burning phase), B supergiant (BSG), B hypergiant (BHG), hot luminous blue
variable (LBV; end of H-core burning), cool LBV (H-shell burning through the
beginning of the He-core burning phase), rapid evolution through late WN and
early WN, early WC (middle of He-core burning), and WO (end of He-core burning
until core collapse). We find the following spectroscopic phase lifetimes:
3.22e6 yr for the O-type, 0.34e5 yr (BSG), 0.79e5 yr (BHG), 2.35e5 yr (LBV),
1.05e5 yr (WN), 2.57e4 yr (WC), and 3.80e4 yr (WO). Compared to previous
studies, we find a much longer (shorter) duration for the early WN (late WN)
phase, as well as a long-lived LBV phase. We show that LBVs arise naturally in
single-star evolution models at the end of the MS when the mass-loss rate
increases as a consequence of crossing the bistability limit. We discuss the
evolution of the spectra, magnitudes, colors, and ionizing flux across the
star's lifetime, and the way they are related to the evolution of the interior.

observed with UVES, where the first error is from statistics and the second one
refers to the systematic effects. The iron abundance in NGC 4833 is homogeneous
at better than 6%. On the other hand, the light elements involved in
proton-capture reactions at high temperature show the large star-to-star
variations observed in almost all GCs studied so far. The Na-O anticorrelation
in NGC 4833 is quite extended, as expected from the high temperatures reached
by stars on the HB, and NGC 4833 contains a conspicuous fraction of stars with
extreme [O/Na] ratios. More striking is the finding that large star-to-star
variations are seen also for Mg, which spans a range of more than 0.5 dex in
this GC. Depletions in Mg are correlated to the abundances of O and
anti-correlated with Na, Al, and Si abundances. This pattern suggests the
action of nuclear processing at unusually high temperatures, producing the
extreme chemistry observed in the stellar generations of NGC 4833. This extreme
changes are also seen in giants of the much more massive GCs M 54 and omega

why they have never been detected so far. Expected rates at redshift $z\simeq

Tessellation, to measure the density field, and the Minimal Spanning Tree, to
define continuous structures, and so we measure SF activity as a function of
local density and the type of environment (cluster, group, filament, and void),
and quantify the degree to which environment contributes to quenching of SF
activity. Our sample covers over two orders of magnitude in stellar mass
(10^8.5 to 10^11 Msun), and consequently we trace the effects of environment on
SF activity for dwarf and massive galaxies, distinguishing so-called ""mass
quenching"" from ""environment quenching"". Environmentally-driven quenching of SF
activity, measured relative to the void galaxies, occurs to progressively
greater degrees in filaments, groups, and clusters, and this trend holds for
dwarf and massive galaxies alike. A similar trend is found using g-r colours,
but with a more significant disparity between galaxy mass bins driven by
increased internal dust extinction in massive galaxies. The SFR distributions
of massive SF galaxies have no significant environmental dependence, but the
distributions for dwarf SF galaxies are found to be statistically distinct in
most environments. Pre-processing plays a significant role at low redshift, as
environmentally-driven galaxy evolution affects nearly half of the galaxies in
the group environment, and a significant fraction of the galaxies in the more
diffuse filaments. Our study underscores the need for sensitivity to dwarf
galaxies to separate mass-driven from environmentally-driven effects, and the
use of unbiased tracers of SF activity.

M500^a_BCG with the best fit slope of a_BCG~0.35+-0.1 and scatter of M*BCG at a
fixed M500 of ~0.2 dex. We show that M*-M relations from abundance matching or
halo modelling reported in recent studies underestimate stellar masses of BCGs
by a factor of ~2-4, because these studies used stellar mass functions (SMF)
based on photometry that severely underestimates the outer surface brightness
profiles of massive galaxies. We show that M*-M relation derived using
abundance matching with the recent SMF calibration by Bernardi et al. (2013)
based on improved photometry is in a much better agreement with the relation we
derive. The total stellar mass of galaxies correlates with total mass M500 with
the slope of \approx 0.6+-0.1 and scatter of 0.1 dex. This indicates that
efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars decreases with
increasing cluster mass. We show that for a fixed choice of the initial mass
function (IMF) total stellar fraction in clusters is only a factor of ~3-5
lower than the peak stellar fraction reached in M\approx 10^12 Msun halos, and
only a factor of ~1.5-3 if the IMF becomes progressively more bottom heavy with
increasing mass in early type galaxies, as indicated by recent observations.
The larger normalization and slope of the M*-M relation derived in this study
shows that the overall efficiency of star formation in massive halos is
suppressed much less than was thought before and that feedback and associated
suppression of star formation in massive halos should be weaker than assumed in

indirect detection of dark matter with gamma rays. We investigate the
sensitivity of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to dark matter
annihilation and decay in the Galactic Center. As the inner density profile of
the Milky Way's dark matter halo is uncertain, we study the impact of the slope
of the Galactic density profile, inwards of the Sun, on the prospects for
detecting a dark matter signal with CTA. We find that the sensitivity achieved
by CTA to annihilation signals is strongly dependent on the inner profile
slope, whereas the dependence is more mild in the case of dark matter decay.
Surprisingly, we find that the optimal choice of signal and background regions
is virtually independent of the assumed density profile. For the fiducial case
of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we find that CTA will be able to probe
annihilation cross sections well below the canonical thermal relic value for
dark matter masses from a few tens of GeV up to $\sim 5$ TeV for annihilation
to $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, and will achieve only a slightly weaker sensitivity for
annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ or $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. CTA will improve significantly
on current sensitivity to annihilation signals for dark matter masses above
$\sim 100$ GeV, covering parameter space that is complementary to that probed
by searches with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The interpretation of apparent
excesses in the measured cosmic-ray electron and positron spectra as signals of
dark matter decay will also be testable with CTA observations of the Galactic
Center. We demonstrate that both for annihilation and for decay, including
spectral information for hard channels (such as $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and
$\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$) leads to enhanced sensitivity for dark matter masses above
$m_{\rm DM}\sim 200$ GeV.

coherent, thin chains of galaxies that are rooted in filaments and terminate in
neighbouring filaments or voids. On average, tendrils contain 6 galaxies and

that tendrils represent real structures rather than accidental alignments. We
show that voids found in the SDSS-DR7 survey that overlap with GAMA regions
contain a large number of galaxies, primarily belonging to tendrils. This
implies that void sizes are strongly dependent on the number density and
sensitivity limits of a survey. We caution that galaxies in low density
regions, that may be defined as `void galaxies,' will have local galaxy number

supernovae is provided by their immediate circumstellar medium, which according
to several models should be shaped by the progenitor binary system. So far,
X-ray and radio observations indicate that the surroundings are very tenuous,
producing severe upper-limits on the mass loss from winds of the progenitors.
In this study, we perform numerical hydro-dynamical simulations of the
interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar structures formed by possible
mass outflows from the progenitor systems and we estimate numerically the
expected numerical X-ray luminosity. We consider two kinds of circumstellar
structures: a) A circumstellar medium formed by the donor star's stellar wind,
in case of a symbiotic binary progenitor system; b) A circumstellar medium
shaped by the interaction of the slow wind of the donor star with consecutive
nova outbursts for the case of a symbiotic recurrent nova progenitor system.
For the hydro-simulations we used well-known Type Ia supernova explosion
models, as well as an approximation based on a power law model for the density
structure of the outer ejecta. We confirm the strict upper limits on stellar
wind mass loss, provided by simplified interpretations of X-ray upper limits of
Type Ia supernovae. However, we show that supernova explosions going off in the
cavities created by repeated nova explosions, provide a possible explanation
for the lack of X-ray emission from supernovae originating from symbiotic
binaries. Moreover, the velocity structure of circumstellar medium, shaped by a
series of nova explosion matches well with the Na absorption features seen in
absorption toward several Type Ia supernovae.

of the column density around the ionized gas. We aim to quantify this effect
and discuss its potential link to the Core and Initial Mass Function (CMF/IMF).
We used in a systematic way Herschel column density maps of several regions
observed within the HOBYS key program: M16, the Rosette and Vela C molecular
cloud, and the RCW 120 H ii region. We fitted the column density PDFs of all
clouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak or
enlarged shape in the PDF. Our interpretation is that the lowest part of the
column density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while the
second peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of the
ionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. The condensations at the edge
of the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimes
recognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. This could lead to an
unambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing star
formation. In the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of the
CMF/IMF, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the PDF may impact the formation
of objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the CMF/IMF. In
particular a broader PDF is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fit
properly the IMF with a reasonable initial Mach number for the molecular cloud.
Since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variations
among the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the PDF, the
relative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

halo mass function, we investigate the role of the mass definition in the
properties of the multiplicity function of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. We
show that the density profile for haloes formed from triaxial peaks that
undergo ellipsoidal collapse and virialisation is such that the ratio between
the mean inner density and the outer local density is essentially independent
of mass. This causes that, for suited values of the spherical overdensity
$\Delta$ and the linking length $b$, SO and FoF masses are essentially
equivalent to each other and the respective multiplicity functions are
essentially the same. The overdensity for haloes having undergone ellipsoidal
collapse is the same as if they had formed according to the spherical top-hat
model, which leads to a value of $b$ corresponding to the usual virial
overdensity, $\Delta_{vir}$, equal to $\sim$ 0.2. The multiplicity function
resulting from such mass definitions, expressed as a function of the top-hat
height for spherical collapse, is very approximately universal in all CDM
cosmologies. The reason for this is that, for such mass definitions, the
top-hat density contrast for ellipsoidal collapse and virialisation is close to
a universal value, equal to $\sim$ 0.9 times the usual top-hat density contrast
for spherical collapse.

early-type (dE) galaxies in the Virgo cluster, VCC 1183 and VCC 1453, studied
as part of the SMAKCED stellar absorption-line spectroscopy and imaging survey.
These KDCs have radii of 1.8'' (0.14 kpc) and 4.2'' (0.33 kpc), respectively.
Each of these KDCs is distinct from the main body of its host galaxy in two
ways: (1) inverted sense of rotation; and (2) younger (and possibly more
metal-rich) stellar population. The observed stellar population differences are
probably associated with the KDC, although we cannot rule out the possibility
of intrinsic radial gradients in the host galaxy. We describe a statistical
analysis method to detect, quantify the significance of, and characterize KDCs
in long-slit rotation curve data. We apply this method to the two dE galaxies
presented in this paper and to five other dEs for which KDCs have been reported
in the literature. Among these seven dEs, there are four significant KDC
detections, two marginal KDC detections, and one dE with an unusual central
kinematic anomaly that may be an asymmetric KDC.The frequency of occurence of
KDCs and their properties provide important constraints on the formation
history of their host galaxies. We discuss different formation scenarios for
these KDCs in cluster environments and find that dwarf-dwarf wet mergers or gas
accretion can explain the properties of these KDCs. Both of these mechanisms
require that the progenitor had a close companion with a low relative velocity.
This suggests that KDCs were formed in galaxy pairs residing in a poor group
environment or in isolation whose subsequent infall into the cluster quenched
star formation.

eclipses allow us to estimate the extent of a spherically symmetric corona on
the primary G star of about 1.3Rsun, or 0.86Rstar, and indicate the G star is

experiments and simulations showing the scattering of polaritons against a
localised obstacle in a semiconductor microcavity. The authors observe in the
linear excitation regime the formation of density and phase patterns
reminiscent of those expected in the non-linear regime from the nucleation of
dark solitons. Based on this observation, they conclude that previous
theoretical and experimental reports on dark solitons in a polariton system
should be revised. Here we comment why the results from Cilibrizzi et al. take
place in a very different regime than previous investigations on dark soliton
nucleation and do not reproduce all the signatures of its rich nonlinear
phenomenology. First of all, Cilibrizzi et al. consider a particular type of
radial excitation that strongly determines the observed patterns, while in
previous reports the excitation has a plane-wave profile. Most importantly, the
nonlinear relation between phase jump, soliton width and fluid velocity, and
the existence of a critical velocity with the time-dependent formation of
vortex-antivortex pairs are absent in the linear regime. In previous reports
about dark soliton and half-dark soliton nucleation in a polariton fluid, the
distinctive dark soliton physics is supported both by theory (analytical and
numerical) and experiments (both continuous wave and pulsed excitation).

magnitude lower than measured from a 2006 {\it XMM-Newton} observation. This is
the first time that large accretion rate variations have been seen in a
detached pre-CV. A third body in a 14 yr eccentric orbit suggested in a recent
eclipse timing study is too distant to perturb the central binary sufficiently
to influence accretion. A hypothetical coronal mass ejection just prior to the
{\it XMM-Newton} observation might explain the higher accretion rate, but the
implied size and frequency of such events appear too great. We suggest
accretion is most likely modulated by a magnetic cycle on the secondary acting
as a wind ""accretion switch"", a mechanism that can be tested by X-ray and
ultraviolet monitoring. If so, QS Vir and similar pre-CVs could provide
powerful insights into hitherto inscrutable cataclysmic variable and M dwarf

transformation to the rotating frame does not commute with the stochastic

the Hamiltonian. Modification of the decay terms is also required in a master
equation approach (i.e., the Liouville--von Neumann density matrix equation)
for describing the dynamics. For isotropic Gaussian white noise, the RWA
dynamics remains Markovian, although the Lindblad terms in the master equation
for the density matrix become time-dependent when the non-commutation of the
RWA transformation and the noise Hamiltonian is properly accounted for. We also
treat Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise, and find, in contra-distinction to the white

when the non-commutation of the RWA transformation and the noise Hamiltonian is
taken into account. These findings are applicable to the modeling of any open

precision of the accelerations in the plane of the sky, which have a factor of

ordered systems, where the presence of topological order is reflected in an
additional contribution to the entanglement of the system. Obtaining this
topological entropy from analytical calculations or numerical simulations is
generally difficult due to the fact that it is an order one correction to
leading terms that scale with the size of the system. In order to distil the
topological entropy, one resorts to extrapolation as a function of system size,
or to clever subtraction schemes that allow to cancel out the leading terms.
Both approaches have the disadvantage of requiring multiple (accurate)
calculations of the entanglement of the system. Here we propose a modification
of conventional entanglement calculations that allows to obtain the topological
entropy of a system from a single measurement of entanglement. In our approach,
we replace the conventional trace over the degrees of freedom of a partition of
the system with a projection onto a given state (which needs not be known). We
show that a proper choice of partition and projective measurement allows to rid
the entanglement measures of the typical boundary terms, thus exposing the
topological contribution alone. We consider specifically the measures known as
von Neumann entropy and entanglement negativity, and we discuss their
application to both models that exhibit quantum as well as classical
topological order.

on C_n is doubly transitive, meaning that G acts transitively on the
configuration space of (ordered) pairs of points in C_n; second, we prove that
the diagonal action of G on the product of (any number of) copies of C_n is
transitive provided the corresponding n's are pairwise distinct. In the second
part of the paper, we study the isotropy subgroups G_n of G in C_n. We equip
each G_n with the structure of an ind-algebraic group and classify the Borel
subgroups of these ind-algebraic groups for all n. Our classification shows
that every Borel subgroup of G (= G_0) is conjugate to the subgroup B of
triangular (elementary) automorphisms; on the other hand, for n > 0, the
conjugacy classes of Borel subgroups of G_n are parametrized by certain orbits
of B in C_n. Our main result is that the conjugacy classes of non-abelian Borel
subgroups of G_n correspond precisely to the B-orbits of the C^*-fixed points
in C_n and thus, are in bijection with the partitions of n. We also prove an
infinite-dimensional analogue of the classical theorem of R.Steinberg,
characterizing the (non-abelian) Borel subgroups of G_n in purely
group-theoretic terms. Together with our classification this last theorem
implies that the G_n are pairwise non-isomorphic as abstract groups. Our study
of the groups G_n is motivated by the fact that these are the automorphism
groups of non-isomorphic simple algebras Morita equivalent to the Weyl algebra

information using electronic tunneling transverse to the single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) backbone while the latter is translocated through a narrow channel. The
original idea considered a single pair of electrodes to read out the current
and distinguish the bases [1, 2]. Here, we propose an improvement to the
original sequencing by tunneling method, in which $N$ pairs of electrodes are
built in series along a synthetic nanochannel. While the ssDNA is forced
through the channel using a longitudinal field it passes by each pair of
electrodes for long enough time to gather a minimum of $m$ tunneling current
measurements, where $m$ is determined by the level of sequencing error desired.
Each current time series for each nucleobase is then cross-correlated together,
from which the DNA bases can be distinguished. We show using random sampling of
data from classical molecular dynamics, that indeed the sequencing error is
significantly reduced as the number of pairs of electrodes, $N$, increases.
Compared to the sequencing ability of a single pair of electrodes,
cross-correlating $N$ pairs of electrodes is exponentially better due to the
approximate log-normal nature of the tunneling current probability
distributions. We have also used the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation to
analytically describe the mean and variance of the cross-correlations that are
used to distinguish the DNA bases. The method we suggest is particularly useful
when the measurement bandwidth is limited, allowing a smaller electrode gap
residence time while still promising to consistently identify the DNA bases

commonly used functionals using Quantum Monte Carlo. By considering several
measures of functional accuracy, we conclude that the van der Waals and hybrid
functionals significantly out perform LDA and PBE. We support these conclusions
by analyzing the impact of functional choice on structural optimization in the
molecular solid, and on the location of the liquid-liquid phase transition.

discover sets of nodes with common connectivity patterns. Such sets are
commonly referred to as network communities. Research on network community
detection has predominantly focused on identifying communities of densely
connected nodes in undirected networks.
  In this paper we develop a novel overlapping community detection method that
scales to networks of millions of nodes and edges and advances research along
two dimensions: the connectivity structure of communities, and the use of edge
directedness for community detection. First, we extend traditional definitions
of network communities by building on the observation that nodes can be densely
interlinked in two different ways: In cohesive communities nodes link to each
other, while in 2-mode communities nodes link in a bipartite fashion, where
links predominate between the two partitions rather than inside them. Our
method successfully detects both 2-mode as well as cohesive communities, that
may also overlap or be hierarchically nested. Second, while most existing
community detection methods treat directed edges as though they were
undirected, our method accounts for edge directions and is able to identify
novel and meaningful community structures in both directed and undirected
networks, using data from social, biological, and ecological domains.

the H$\alpha$ and [NII] $\lambda$6584 line luminosities can be predicted with a

equivalent widths and colours is also presented. The effectiveness of the ANN
calibration is demonstrated with an independent dataset (the Galaxy Mass and

particles is a challenging problem. In this paper, we develop and implement a
theoretical model that captures the interplay between advection, segregation,
and diffusion in size bidisperse granular materials. The fluxes associated with
these three driving factors depend on the underlying kinematics, whose
characteristics play key roles in determining particle segregation
configurations. Unlike previous models for segregation, our model uses
parameters based on kinematic measures from discrete element method simulations
instead of arbitrarily adjustable fitting parameters, and it achieves excellent
quantitative agreement with both experimental and simulation results when
applied to quasi-two-dimensional bounded heaps. The model yields two
dimensionless control parameters, both of which are only functions of
physically control parameters (feed rate, particle sizes, and system size) and
kinematic parameters (diffusion coefficient, flowing layer depth, and
percolation velocity). The P\'eclet number, $Pe$, captures the interplay of
advection and diffusion, and the second dimensionless parameter, $\Lambda$,
describes the interplay between segregation and advection. A parametric study
of $\Lambda$ and $Pe$ demonstrates how the particle segregation configuration
depends on the interplay of advection, segregation, and diffusion. The model
can be readily adapted to other flow geometries.

Compression conjecture-asserts that concept classes (equivalently set systems)
admit compression schemes of size linear in their VC dimension. To-date this
statement is known to be true for maximum classes---those that possess maximum
cardinality for their VC dimension. The most promising approach to positively
resolving the conjecture is by embedding general VC classes into maximum
classes without super-linear increase to their VC dimensions, as such
embeddings would extend the known compression schemes to all VC classes. We
show that maximum classes can be characterised by a local-connectivity property
of the graph obtained by viewing the class as a cubical complex. This geometric
characterisation of maximum VC classes is applied to prove a negative embedding
result which demonstrates VC-d classes that cannot be embedded in any maximum
class of VC dimension lower than 2d. On the other hand, we show that every VC-d
class C embeds in a VC-(d+D) maximum class where D is the deficiency of C,
i.e., the difference between the cardinalities of a maximum VC-d class and of
C. For VC-2 classes in binary n-cubes for 4 <= n <= 6, we give best possible
results on embedding into maximum classes. For some special classes of Boolean
functions, relationships with maximum classes are investigated. Finally we give
a general recursive procedure for embedding VC-d classes into VC-(d+k) maximum
classes for smallest k.

perspective, giving particular relevance to Dengue. Dengue is a subtropical and
tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that affects about 100 million
people per year and is considered by the World Health Organization a major
concern for public health. The mathematical models developed and tested in this
work, are based on ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics
underlying the disease, including the interaction between humans and
mosquitoes. An analytical study is made related to equilibrium points, their
stability and basic reproduction number. The spreading of Dengue can be
attenuated through measures to control the transmission vector, such as the use
of specific insecticides and educational campaigns. Since the development of a
potential vaccine has been a recent global bet, models based on the simulation
of a hypothetical vaccination process in a population are proposed. Based on
Optimal Control theory, we have analyzed the optimal strategies for using these
controls, and respective impact on the reduction/eradication of the disease
during an outbreak in the population, considering a bioeconomic approach. The
formulated problems are numerically solved using direct and indirect methods.
The first discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization
problem. Indirect methods use the Pontryagin Maximum Principle as a necessary
condition to find the optimal curve for the respective control. In these two
strategies several numerical software packages are used.

spinors and connecting objects that arise here are formally the same as the
ones borne by the traditional formalisms. Any spin-affine connexion appears to
possess a torsional part which is conveniently chosen as a suitable asymmetric
contribution. Such a torsional affine contribution thus supplies a
gauge-invariant potential that can eventually be taken to carry an observable
character, and thereby effectively takes over the role of any trivially
realizable symmetric contribution. The overall curvature spinors for any
spin-affine connexion accordingly emerge from the irreducible decomposition of
a mixed world-spin object which in turn comes out of the action on elementary
spinors of a typical torsionful second-order covariant derivative operator.
Explicit curvature expansions are likewise exhibited which fill in the gap
related to their absence from the literature. It is then pointed out that the
utilization of the torsionful spinor framework may afford locally some new

to -45 deg. The CO emission, dust opacity at 353 GHz (tau353), and dust
temperature (Td) show generally good spatial correspondence. On the other hand,
the correspondence between the HI emission and the dust properties is less
clear than in CO. The integrated HI intensity WHI and tau353 show a large
scatter with a correlation coefficient of ~0.6 for a Td range from 16 K to 22
K. We find, however, that WHI and tau353 show better correlation for smaller
ranges of Td every 0.5 K, generally with a correlation coefficient of 0.7-0.9.
We set up a hypothesis that the HI gas associated with the highest Td >= 21.5 K
is optically thin, whereas the HI emission is generally optically thick for Td
lower than 21.5 K. We have determined a relationship for the optically thin HI
gas between atomic hydrogen column density and tau353, NHI (cm-2) = (1.5 x
10^26) x tau353, under the assumption that the dust properties are uniform and
we have applied this to estimate NHI from tau353 for the whole cloud. NHI was
then used to solve for Ts and tauHI over the region. The result shows that the
HI is dominated by optically thick gas having a low spin temperature of 20-40 K
and a density of 40-160 cm-3. The HI envelope has a total mass of ~1.2 x 10^4
Msol, an order of magnitude larger than that of the CO clouds. The HI envelope
properties derived by this method do not rule out a mixture of HI and H2 in the
dark gas, but we present indirect evidence that most of the gas mass is in the
atomic state.

and in the future will considerably increase the number of known exoplanets and
the precision of the measured times of transit minima. Variations in the
transit times can not only be used to infer the presence of additional planets,
but might also provide opportunities for testing new physics in the places
beyond the Solar system. In this work, we take deviation from the
inverse-square law of gravity as an example, focus on the fifth-force-like
Yukawa-type correction to the Newtonian gravitational force which parameterizes
this deviation, investigate its effects on the secular transit timing
variations and analyze their observability in exoplanetary systems. It is found
that the most optimistic values of Yukawa-type secular transit timing
variations are at the level of $\sim 0.1$ seconds per year. Those values
unfortunately appear only in rarely unique cases and, most importantly, they
are still at least two orders of magnitude below the current capabilities of
observations. Such a deviation from the inverse-square law of gravity is likely
too small to detect for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, systematic
uncertainties, such as the presence of additional and unknown planets, will
likely be exceptionally difficult to remove from a signal that should be seen.

Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method is a fast solver, which
smooths the objective function and minimizes it by alternately updating the

sparse only or low rank only minimization problem with squared loss or an

As a concrete example, we solve the Schatten-$p$ norm and $\ell_{2,q}$-norm
regularized Low-Rank Representation (LRR) problem by IRLS, and theoretically
prove that the derived solution is a stationary point (globally optimal if
$p,q\geq1$). Our convergence proof of IRLS is more general than previous one

X-rays spectral properties at a high angular resolution up to 2 arcmin, and to
compare them with the interstellar gas. The X-ray spectrum is non-thermal and
used to calculate absorbing column density, photon index, and
absorption-corrected X-ray flux. The photon index varies significantly from 2.1

index, especially in the west region, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81.
The X-ray intensity tends to increase with the averaged interstellar gas

the photon index less than 2.4 are found outside of the central 10 arcmin of

$f(u,v)=h(\varphi(u)\cdot\psi(v))$, for some univariate polynomials
$\varphi,\psi,h$ over ${\mathbb R}$. This significantly improves a result of
Elekes and R\'onyai (2000).
  Our results are cast in a more general form, in which we give an upper bound
for the number of zeros of $z=f(x,y)$ on a triple Cartesian product $A\times

that the number of distinct distances between $n$ points lying on a
constant-degree parametric algebraic curve which does not contain a line, in

derive improved lower bounds for several variants of the sum-product problem in
additive combinatorics.

main aims to detect cyclotron resonant scattering features and study their
variation patterns with accreting luminosities and orbital phases. The
cyclotron scattering lines of Vela X-1 at $\sim 22 - 27$ keV and $49 - 57$ keV
are confirmed in the average spectra of Vela X-1. But in the flare states with
hard X-ray luminosity higher than $\sim 5\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (3 -- 100
keV), the fundamental line cannot be detected. This feature suggests that a
fan-like beam radiation pattern is expected in high luminosity ranges of Vela
X-1. Variations of the cyclotron line energies and depths are discovered, which
may change with continuum spectral properties. Both cyclotron line energies
show no correlations with X-ray luminosity. The fundamental line energy shows
no significant correlations with photon index and cutoff energy. While, the
first harmonic energy shows a positive correlation with photon index and
exponential cutoff energy. The energy ratio of two cyclotron lines always
higher than 2 has the weak correlation with photon index and cutoff energy.
These relations support that the X-ray spectral properties of accreting X-ray
pulsars are affected by cyclotron resonance scattering. In the case of Vela
X-1, the broader and deeper first harmonic would play the main role to cause
the spectral variations. The positive correlations between the ratio of line
width to energy and the corresponding depth for both two lines support a
cylindrical column accretion geometry in Vela X-1.

rates thanks to the large bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies. To realize
sufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with
large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost
and power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will
likely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of
antennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of
mmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper
develops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that
exploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient
operation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is
designed to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths.
For single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability
using the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient
allocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are
obtained. The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the
multi-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the
estimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/digital precoding
algorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only

to the Pleiades cluster from the DANCe multidimensional astro-photometric data

the membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and must
incorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure.
  We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of
the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer
posterior membership probabilities. The distribution of the cluster members
proper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the full
multidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with a
mixture-of-Gaussians likelihood. We analyse several representation spaces
composed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes and
colour indices. We select two prominent representation spaces composed of
variables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based in
Random Forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probability
candidates. We consistently find lists of high probability (p > 0.9975)
candidates with $\approx$ 1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in the
most recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster.

$H_{RFT}$ derived in [1]. We show that this theory is valid as long as at any
intermediate value of rapidity $\eta$ throughout the evolution at least one of
the colliding objects is dilute. Importantly, at some values of $\eta$ the
dilute object could be the projectile, while at others it could be the target,
so that $H_{RFT}$ does not reduce to either $H_{JIMWLK}$ or $H_{KLWMIJ}$. When
both objects are dense, corrections to the evolution not accounted for in [1]
become important. The same limitation applies to other approaches to high
energy evolution available today, such as for example [3] and [4]. We also show
that, in its regime of applicability $H_{RFT}$ can be simplified. We derive the
simpler version of $H_{RFT}$ and in the large $N_c$ limit rewrite it in terms
of the Reggeon creation and annihilation operators. The resulting $H_{RFT}$ is
explicitly self dual and provides the generalization of the Pomeron calculus
developed in [4] by including higher Reggeons in the evolution. It is
applicable for description of `large' Pomeron loops, namely Reggeon graphs
where all the splittings occur close in rapidity to one dilute object
(projectile), while all the merging close to the other one (target).
Additionally we derive, in the same regime expressions for single and double
inclusive gluon production (where the gluons are not separated by a large

about two strategic approaches, 'reconstructing dark energy' and 'falsifying

approaches, considering the data limitations and its uncertainties we have to
deal with cosmographic degeneracies that makes it difficult to distinguish
between different dark energy models. On the other hand one can use the power
of the data to falsify an assumed model using advanced statistical techniques.
Within all these issues, focusing on falsification of cosmological constant has
a particular importance since finding any significant deviation from $\Lambda$

for colloid-polymer mixtures. The high-density regime featuring reentrant
melting of the glass upon increasing the attraction strength, and the crossover
from repulsive glasses formed at weak attraction to attractive glasses formed
at strong attraction, are discussed. Flow curves are found in qualitative
agreement with experimental data, featuring a strong increase in the yield
stress, and, for suitable interaction parameters, the crossover between two
yield stresses. The yield strain, defined as the position of the stress
overshoot under startup flow, is found to be proportional to the attraction
range for strong attraction. At weak and intermediate attraction strength, the
combined effects of hard-core caging and attraction-driven bonding result in a
richer dependence on the parameters. The first normal-stress difference
exhibits a weaker dependence on short-ranged attractions as the shear stress,

algorithms and tools for processing very large collections of short strings

problems. Many state-of-the-art aligners, at their core, have used the
Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) as a main-memory index of a reference genome
(typical example, NCBI human genome). Recently, BWT has also found its use in
string-graph assembly, for indexing the reads (i.e., raw data from DNA
sequencers). In a typical data set, the volume of reads is tens of times of the
sequenced genome and can be up to 100 Gigabases. Note that a reference genome
is relatively stable and computing the index is not a frequent task. For reads,
the index has to computed from scratch for each given input. The ability of
efficient BWT construction becomes a much bigger concern than before. In this
paper, we present a practical method called CX1 for constructing the BWT of
very large string collections. CX1 is the first tool that can take advantage of
the parallelism given by a graphics processing unit (GPU, a relative cheap
device providing a thousand or more primitive cores), as well as simultaneously
the parallelism from a multi-core CPU and more interestingly, from a cluster of
GPU-enabled nodes. Using CX1, the BWT of a short-read collection of up to 100
Gigabases can be constructed in less than 2 hours using a machine equipped with
a quad-core CPU and a GPU, or in about 43 minutes using a cluster with 4 such
machines (the speedup is almost linear after excluding the first 16 minutes for
loading the reads from the hard disk). The previously fastest tool BRC is
measured to take 12 hours to process 100 Gigabases on one machine; it is
non-trivial how BRC can be parallelized to take advantage a cluster of

shown that one of the elements from the boundary can be always chosen to be an

states, channels and observables. We show that boundariness is intimately
related to (semi)norms that provide an operational interpretation of this
quantity. In particular, the minimum error probability for discrimination of a
pair of quantum devices is lower bounded by the boundariness of each of them.
We proved that for states and observables this bound is saturated and
conjectured this feature for channels. The boundariness is zero for
infinite-dimensional quantum objects as in this case all the elements are
boundary elements.

malicious shareholders trying to reconstruct the secret by obtaining legal
shares from the other shareholders while providing them with fake shares.
Verifiable Secret Sharing schemes solve this problem by allowing shareholders
verifying the others' shares. We present new verification algorithms providing
arbitrary secret sharing schemes with cheater detection capabilities, and prove
their space efficiency with regard to other schemes appeared in the literature.
We also introduce, in one of our schemes, the Exponentiating Polynomial Root
Problem (EPRP), which is believed to be NP-Intermediate and therefore
difficult.

disagreement among experts. As arguments favoring and opposing such methodology
were discussed, other publications empirically showed that the past development
of performances followed a non linear trend. Other works, while deeply
exploring the conditions leading to world records, highlighted that performance
is tied to the economical and geopolitical context. Here we investigated the
following human boundaries: development of performances with time in Olympic
and non-Olympic events, development of sport performances with aging among
humans and others species (greyhounds, thoroughbreds, mice). Development of
performances from a broader point of view (demography & lifespan) in a specific
sub-system centered on primary energy was also investigated. We show that the
physiological developments are limited with time. Three major and direct
determinants of sport performance are age, technology and climatic conditions
(temperature). However, all observed developments are related to the
international context including the efficient use of primary energies. This
last parameter is a major indirect propeller of performance development. We
show that when physiological and societal performance indicators such as
lifespan and population density depend on primary energies, the energy source,
competition and mobility are key parameters for achieving long term sustainable
trajectories. Otherwise, the vast majority (98.7%) of the studied trajectories
reaches 0 before 15 generations, due to the consumption of fossil energy and a
low mobility rate. This led us to consider that in the present turbulent
economical context and given the upcoming energy crisis, societal and physical
performances are not expected to grow continuously.

stellar yields are presented for each model. The models with enriched helium
have shorter main sequence and AGB lifetimes, and enter the AGB with a more
massive hydrogen exhausted core than the primordial helium model. The main
consequences are 1) low-mass AGB models with enhanced helium will evolve more
than twice as fast, giving them the chance to contribute sooner to the chemical
evolution of the forming globular clusters, and 2) the stellar yields will be
strongly reduced relative to their primordial helium counterparts. An increase
of Delta Y = 0.10 at a given mass decreases the yields of carbon by up to ~60%,
of fluorine by up to 80%, and decreases the yields of the s-process elements

continuous way, over the last 4 Ga, while the study of the eucritic meteorites
revealed a few samples that crystallized in presence of water and volatile
elements. The formation of Jupiter and probably its migration occurred in the
period when eucrites crystallized, and triggered a phase of bombardment that
caused icy planetesimals to cross the asteroid belt. In this work, we study the
flux of icy planetesimals on Vesta during the Jovian Early Bombardment and,
using hydrodynamic simulations, the outcome of their collisions with the
asteroid. We explore how the migration of the giant planet would affect the
delivery of water and volatile materials to the asteroid and we discuss our
results in the context of the geophysical and collisional evolution of Vesta.
In particular, we argue that the observational data are best reproduced if the
bulk of the impactors was represented by 1-2 km wide planetesimals and if
Jupiter underwent a limited (a fraction of au) displacement.

deducing rigorously the macroeconomic dynamics as emerging from the
interactions of many individual agents. This includes deduction of the fractal
/ intermittent fluctuations of macroeconomic quantities from the granularity of
the mezo-economic collective objects (large individual wealth, highly
productive geographical locations, emergent technologies, emergent economic
sectors) in which the micro-economic agents self-organize.
  In particular, we present some theoretical predictions, which also met
extensive validation from empirical data in a wide range of systems: - The
fractal Levy exponent of the stock market index fluctuations equals the Pareto
exponent of the investors wealth distribution. The origin of the macroeconomic
dynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital
of the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter
'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the
minima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2
'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.
  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market
fluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine
conceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics. Joining another giant
of contemporary science - Phil Anderson - Aoki emphasized the role of rare,
large fluctuations in the emergence of macroeconomic phenomena out of
microscopic interactions and in particular their non self-averaging, in the
language of statistical physics. In this light, we present a simple stochastic
multi-sector growth model.

that of a strictly pseudoconformal structure: in this case, the two complex

to the ${\rm CR}$ structure. A non trivial example of a manifold endowed with a

field associated with the intra-cluster-medium (ICM) through the presence of
extended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and peripheral relics.
This observational evidence has fundamental implications on the physics of the
ICM. Non-thermal components in galaxy clusters are indeed unique probes of very
energetic processes operating within clusters that drain gravitational and
electromagnetic energy into cosmic rays and magnetic fields. These components
strongly affect the (micro-)physical properties of the ICM, including viscosity
and electrical conductivities, and have also potential consequences on the
evolution of clusters themselves. The nature and properties of cosmic rays in
galaxy clusters, including the origin of the observed radio emission on
cluster-scales, have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last decade.
Only recently we can start addressing some of the most important questions in
this field, thanks to recent observational advances, both in the radio and at
high energies. The properties of cosmic rays and of cluster non-thermal
emissions depend on the dynamical state of the ICM, the efficiency of particle
acceleration mechanisms in the ICM and on the dynamics of these cosmic rays. In
this review we discuss in some detail the acceleration and transport of cosmic
rays in galaxy clusters and the most relevant observational milestones that
have provided important steps on our understanding of this physics. Finally,
looking forward to the possibilities from new generations of observational
tools, we focus on what appear to be the most important prospects for the near
future from radio and high-energy observations.

trajectory of each MBP is then calculated and described by a diffusion index
({\gamma}) and a diffusion coefficient (D). We further explore the distribution
of the diffusion indices with the help of a Monte Carlo simulation. We find
{\gamma} = 1.69 +- 0.08 and D = 257 +- 32 km^2/s averaged over all MBPs.
Trajectories of most MBPs are classified as super-diffusive, i.e., {\gamma} >
1, with the determined {\gamma} being to our knowledge the largest obtained so
far. A direct correlation between D and time-scale ({\tau}) determined from
trajectories of all MBPs is also obtained. We discuss a simple scenario to
explain the diffusivity of the observed, relatively short-lived MBPs while they
migrate within a small area in a supergranule (i.e., an internetwork area). We
show that the scatter in the {\gamma} values obtained for individual MBPs is
due to their limited lifetimes. The super-diffusive MBPs can be well-described
as random walkers (due to granular evolution and intergranular turbu- lence)

brought evidence of a strong correlation between radio and X-ray emission
during the hard spectral state; however, now more and more sources, the
so-called `outliers', are found with a radio emission noticeably below the
established `standard' relation. Several explanations have already been
considered, but the existence of dual tracks is not yet fully understood.
  We suggest that in the hard spectral state re-condensation of gas from the
corona into a cool, weak inner disk can provide additional soft photons for
Comptonization, leading to a higher X-ray luminosity in combination with rather
unchanged radio emission, which presumably traces the mass accretion rate. As
an example, we determined how much additional luminosity due to photons from an
underlying disk would be needed to explain the data from the representative
outlier source H1743-322. From the comparison with calculations of Compton
spectra with and without the photons from an underlying disk, we find that the
required additional X-ray luminosity lies well in the range obtained from
theoretical models of the accretion flow. The radio/X-ray luminosity relation
resulting from Comptonization of additional photons from a weak, cool inner
disk during the hard spectral state can explain the observations of the outlier
sources, especially the data for H1743-322, the source with the most detailed
observations. The existence or non-existence of weak inner disks on the two
tracks might point to a difference in the magnetic fields of the companion
stars. These could affect the effective viscosity and the thermal conductivity,
hence also the re-condensation process.

to improve resiliency of data centers, can play a key role in deploying ICT
infrastructure in remote and inhospitable environments in order to take
advantage of low temperatures and hydro- and wind-electric capabilities. This
is because of capability of the modular data centers to survive even in lack of
continuous on-site maintenance and support. The most critical part of a data
center is its network fabric that could impede the whole system even if all
other components are fully functional, assuming that other analyses has been
already performed to ensure the reliability of the underlying infrastructure

effectively calculate the performance of a design along its lifespan even up to

parts of 10 MK flare loops exhibit an apparent motion with velocities of
several tens of km/s along the developing flare ribbons. In the early stages of
the flare, flare ribbons consist of compact, localized bright transition-region
emission from the footpoints of the flare loops. A DEM analysis shows that the
flare loops have temperatures up to the formation of Fe XXIV. A series of very
long, S-shaped loops erupt, leading to a CME observed by STEREO. The observed
dynamics are compared with the evolution of magnetic structures in the
""standard solar flare model in 3D"". This model matches the observations well,
reproducing both the apparently slipping flare loops, S-shaped erupting loops,
and the evolution of flare ribbons. All of these processes are explained via 3D
reconnection mechanisms resulting from the expansion of a torus-unstable flux
rope. The AIA observations and the numerical model are complemented by radio
observations showing a noise storm in the metric range. Dm-drifting pulsation
structures occurring during the eruption indicate plasmoid ejection and
enhancement of reconnection rate. The bursty nature of radio emission shows
that the slipping reconnection is still intermittent, although it is observed
to persist for more than an hour.

was evaporated at 1210 {\deg}C in the first zone of the furnace and particle
growth and shaping took place in the subsequent zones, heated to 730 {\deg}C
and 390 {\deg}C respectively. The generated aerosol was monitored by a scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS), while parameters, such as furnace temperature,
seed particle size and concentration and nitrogen carrier gas flow, were
investigated. Off-line atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the morphology of the silver
nanoparticles in addition to the SMPS scans. Spherical silver nanoparticles
with a mobility diameter of more than 115 nm and a geometric standard deviation
of typically 1.09 or lower at concentrations as large as 5e5cm^{-3} could be
produced. The mobility diameter of the monodisperse aerosol could be varied in
the range of 50 nm to 115 nm by changing the furnace temperature or the gold
seed particle size. Elemental analysis revealed that the gold from the seed
particles formed a homogeneous alloy with the silver (< 3.5 atomic percent of
gold). The growth mechanism could not be identified unambiguously since the
obtained silver particles could both originate from heterogeneous nucleation of
silver vapour on the seed particles or from coagulation and coalescence of the
seed particles with smaller, homogeneously nucleated silver particles.
Moreover, the narrow size distribution opens the opportunity to obtain an
exclusively singly charged, monodisperse calibration aerosol at sufficient
concentrations after and additional mobility selection process.

and remains the subject of heated debates. It is the aim of this review to
summarize the latest developments in this field and to address the issue of
origin by confronting different brown dwarf and giant planet formation
scenarios to presently available observational constraints. As examined in the
review, if objects are classified as ""Brown Dwarfs"" or ""Giant Planets"" on the
basis of their formation mechanism, it has now become clear that their mass
domains overlap and that there is no mass limit between these two distinct
populations.
  Furthermore, while there is increasing observational evidence for the
existence of non-deuterium burning brown dwarfs, some giant planets,
characterized by a significantly metal enriched composition, might be massive
enough to ignite deuterium burning in their core. Deuterium burning (or lack
of) thus plays no role in either brown dwarf or giant planet formation.
Consequently, we argue that the IAU definition to distinguish these two
populations has no physical justification and brings scientific confusion. In
contrast, brown dwarfs and giant planets might bear some imprints of their
formation mechanism, notably in their mean density and in the physical
properties of their atmosphere. Future direct imaging surveys will undoubtedly
provide crucial information and perhaps provide some clear observational
diagnostics to unambiguously distinguish these different astrophysical objects.

Poincar\'e duality for de Rham cohomology is shown to hold for the case with
non-standard supports as well. We apply these results to find optimal spaces of
linear observables for analogs of arbitrary degree $k$ of both the vector
potential and the Faraday tensor. The term optimal has to be intended in the
following sense: The spaces of linear observables we consider distinguish
between different configurations; in addition to that, there are no redundant
observables. This last point in particular heavily relies on the analog of
Poincar\'e duality for the new cohomology groups.

fourth-order partial differential equations representing flexural waves in thin
elastic plates. It is shown that, in contrast with the Helmholtz equation, the
general form of the partial differential equation is not invariant with respect
to the cloaking transformation. The significant result of this paper is the
analysis of the transformed equation and its interpretation in the framework of
the linear theory of pre-stressed plates. The paper provides a formal framework
for transformation elastodynamics as applied to elastic plates. Furthermore, an
algorithm is proposed for designing a square cloak for flexural waves, which
employs a regularised push-out transformation. Illustrative numerical examples
show high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed cloaking algorithm. In
particular, a physical configuration involving a perturbation of an
interference pattern generated by two coherent sources is presented. It is
demonstrated that the perturbation produced by a cloaked defect is negligibly
small even for such a delicate interference pattern.

analysis is an accepted and well-established technique in software engineering

of tool vendors started offering tools that allow casual end-users to run
various static analyses on spreadsheets as well. We supervised a study where
three undergraduate software engineering students examined a selection of 14
spreadsheet auditing tools, trying to give a concrete recommendation for an
industry partner. Reflecting on the study's results, we found that most of
these tools do provide useful aids in finding problems in spreadsheets, but we
have also spotted several areas where tools had significant issues. Some of
these issues could be remedied if spreadsheet auditing tool vendors would pick
up some ideas of static analysis tools for traditional software development and
adopt some of their solution approaches.

includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications. Hence it
is unsurprising that it continues to be one of the most active research areas
of computer vision. Even after over three decades of intense research, the
state-of-the-art in face recognition continues to improve, benefitting from
advances in a range of different research fields such as image processing,
pattern recognition, computer graphics, and physiology. Systems based on
visible spectrum images, the most researched face recognition modality, have
reached a significant level of maturity with some practical success. However,
they continue to face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and
expression changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly
decrease recognition accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have been
proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of infrared (IR)
imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research direction. This paper
presents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject.
Our key contributions are: (i) a summary of the inherent properties of infrared
imaging which makes this modality promising in the context of face recognition,
(ii) a systematic review of the most influential approaches, with a focus on
emerging common trends as well as key differences between alternative
methodologies, (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial
images available to the researcher, and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most
promising avenues for future research.

tools are built upon the outputs of TPT that allow to generate these reactive
trajectories directly, or even transition paths that travel from one group of
nodes to the other without making any detour and carry the same probability
current as the reactive trajectories. These objects permit to characterize the
mechanism of the transitions, for example by quantifying the width of the tubes
by which these transitions occur, the location and distribution of their
dynamical bottlenecks, etc. These tools are applied to a network modeling the
dynamics of the Lennard-Jones cluster with 38 atoms (LJ38) and used to
understand the mechanism by which this cluster rearranges itself between its
two most likely states at various temperatures.
