formation of resonances. As an example of this general mechanism, we focus on
an experimentally relevant material and predict bound excitons in twisted
bilayer graphene, which is a two-dimensional gapless structure exhibiting
metallic screening. The binding energies calculated by first-principles
simulations are surprisingly large. The low-energy effective model reveals that
these bound states are produced by a unique destructive coherence between two
alike subband resonant excitons. In particular, this destructive coherent
effect is not sensitive to the screening and dimensionality, and hence may
persist as a general mechanism for creating bound excitons in various metallic
structures, opening the door for excitonic applications based on metallic
structures.

advection and molecular diffusion is often described as a diffusive process,
with an effective diffusivity that is enhanced compared to the molecular value.
However, this description fails to capture the tails of the scalar
concentration distribution in initial-value problems. To remedy this, we
develop a large-deviation theory of scalar dispersion that provides an
approximation to the scalar concentration valid at much larger distances away
from the centre of mass, specifically distances that are $O(t)$ rather than
$O(t^{1/2})$, where $t \gg 1$ is the time from the scalar release. The theory
centres on the calculation of a rate function obtained by solving a
one-parameter family of eigenvalue problems which we derive using two
alternative approaches, one asymptotic, the other probabilistic. We emphasise
the connection between large deviations and homogenisation: a perturbative
solution of the eigenvalue problems reduces at leading order to the cell
problem of homogenisation theory. We consider two classes of flows in some
detail: shear flows and cellular flows. In both cases, large deviation
generalises classical results on effective diffusivity and captures new
phenomena relevant to the tails of the scalar distribution. These include
approximately finite dispersion speeds arising at large P\'eclet number
$\mathrm{Pe}$ (corresponding to small molecular diffusivity) and, for
two-dimensional cellular flows, anisotropic dispersion. Explicit asymptotic
results are obtained for shear flows in the limit of large $\mathrm{Pe}$. (A
companion paper, Part II, is devoted to the large-$\mathrm{Pe}$ asymptotic
treatment of cellular flows.) The predictions of large-deviation theory are
compared with Monte Carlo simulations that estimate the tails of concentration
accurately using importance sampling.

molecular diffusion is a two-dimensional periodic flow with closed streamlines
inside periodic cells. Over long time scales, the dispersion of a scalar in
this flow can be characterised by an effective diffusivity that is a factor
$\mathrm{Pe}^{1/2}$ larger than molecular diffusivity when the P\'eclet number
$\mathrm{Pe}$ is large. Here we provide a more complete description of
dispersion in this regime by applying the large-deviation theory developed in
Part I of this paper. We derive approximations to the rate function governing
the scalar concentration at large time $t$ by carrying out an asymptotic
analysis of the relevant family of eigenvalue problems. We identify two
asymptotic regimes and make predictions for the rate function and spatial
structure of the scalar. Regime I applies to distances from the release point
that satisfy $|\boldsymbol{x}| = O(\mathrm{Pe}^{1/4} t)$ . The concentration in
this regime is isotropic at large scales, is uniform along streamlines within
each cell, and varies rapidly in boundary layers surrounding the separatrices
between adjacent cells. The results of homogenisation theory are recovered from
our analysis. Regime II applies when $|\boldsymbol{x}|=O(\mathrm{Pe} \, t/\log
\mathrm{Pe})$ and is characterised by an anisotropic concentration distribution
that is localised around the separatrices. A novel feature of this regime is
the crucial role played by the dynamics near the hyperbolic stagnation points.
A consequence is that in part of the regime the dispersion can be interpreted
as resulting from a random walk on the lattice of stagnation points. The two
regimes overlap so that our asymptotic results describe the scalar
concentration over a large range of distances. They are verified against
numerical solutions of the family of eigenvalue problems yielding the rate
function.

results show that two relaxation processes are enough to fit attenuation data

investigate the origin of protostellar jets using typical molecular tracers of
shocked regions, such as SiO and SO. Methods: We mapped the inner 22"" of the
NGC1333-IRAS2A protostar in SiO(5-4), SO(65-54), and the continuum emission at
1.4 mm using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in the framework of the
CALYPSO IRAM large program. Results: For the first time, we disentangle the
NGC1333-IRAS2A Class 0 object into a proto-binary system revealing two
protostars (MM1, MM2) separated by ~ 560 AU, each of them driving their own
jet, while past work considered a single protostar with a quadrupolar outflow.
We reveal (i) a clumpy, fast (up to |V-VLSR| > 50 km/s), and blueshifted jet
emerging from the brightest MM1 source, and (ii) a slower redshifted jet,
driven by MM2. Silicon monoxide emission is a powerful tracer of
high-excitation (Tkin > 100 K; n(H2) > 10^5 cm-3) jets close to the launching
region. At the highest velocities, SO appears to mimic SiO tracing the jets,
whereas at velocities close to the systemic one, SO is dominated by extended
emission, tracing the cavity opened by the jet. Conclusions: Both jets are
intrinsically monopolar, and intermittent in time. The dynamical time of the
SiO clumps is < 30-90 yr, indicating that one-sided ejections from protostars
can take place on these timescales.

depends on the distribution of emission measure over temperature (DEM). Due to
the well-known ill conditioning problem, no precisely resolved DEM can be
inverted directly from the spectrum, so often only a gross parametrization of
the DEM is used to approximate the data, in hopes that the parametrization can
provide useful model-independent constraints on the heating process. However,
ill conditioning also introduces ambiguity into the various different
parametrizations that could approximate the data, which may spoil the perceived
advantages of model independence. Thus, this paper instead suggests a single
parametrization for both the heating mechanism and the X-ray sources, based on
a model of impulsive heating followed by complete cooling. This approach is
similar to a ``cooling flow'' approach, but allows injection at multiple
initial temperatures, and applies even when the steady state is distribution of
different shock strengths, as for a standing shock with a range of obliquities,
or for embedded stochastic shocks that are only steady in a statistical sense.
This produces an alternative parametrization for X-ray spectra that is
especially streamlined for higher density plasmas with efficient radiative
cooling, and provides internal consistency checks on the assumption of
impulsive heating followed by complete cooling. The result is no longer model
independent, but the results are more directly interpretable in terms of useful
physical constraints on the impulsive heating distribution.

transmission between two cellular devices with local communication needs. Due
to the increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices in future mobile
networks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is required to maximize
network throughput and achieve higher spectral efficiency. In this paper,
performance of network-integrated D2D communication under channel uncertainties
is investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a
multi-user and multi-relay network, we propose a robust distributed solution
for resource allocation with a view to maximizing network sum-rate when the
interference from other relay nodes and the link gains are uncertain. An
optimization problem is formulated for allocating radio resources at the relays
to maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements for cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint.
Each of the uncertain parameters is modeled by a bounded distance between its
estimated and bounded values. We show that the robust problem is convex and a
gradient-aided dual decomposition algorithm is applied to allocate radio
resources in a distributed manner. Finally, to reduce the cost of robustness
defined as the reduction of achievable sum-rate, we utilize the \textit{chance
constraint approach} to achieve a trade-off between robustness and optimality.
The numerical results show that there is a distance threshold beyond which
relay-aided D2D communication significantly improves network performance when
compared to direct communication between D2D peers.

Perturbed BP is often more successful and at the same time tens to hundreds of

compares favorably with state-of-the-art SP-guided decimation, which has a
computational complexity that generally scales exponentially worse than our

that Perturbed SP can outperform SP-guided decimation, making it the best

spatially direct the transmissions. The accuracy of the estimated CSI plays an
important role in designing accurate beamformers that can control the amount of
interference created from simultaneous spatial transmissions to mobile users.
Therefore, a new technique based on the structure of the spatial covariance
matrix and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is proposed to enhance channel
estimation in the presence of interference. Bayesian estimation and Least
Squares estimation frameworks are introduced by utilizing the DCT to separate
the overlapping spatial paths that create the interference. The spatial domain
is thus exploited to mitigate the contamination which is able to discriminate
across interfering users. Gains over conventional channel estimation techniques
are presented in our simulations which are also valid for a small number of
antennas.

allow the campaigner to adjust the effective spreading rate by incentivizing
the infected in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, in addition to
the direct recruitment. We consider time varying information spreading rate in

observations of the incidence frequency of LLSs and the HI column density
distribution function over the redshift range $z=2-5$ and find good agreement.
I explore the connection between LLSs and their host halos and find that LLSs
reside in halos with a wide range of halo masses with a nearly constant
covering fraction within a virial radius. Over the range $z=2-5$, I find that
more than half of the LLSs reside in halos with $M < 10^{10}h^{-1}M_\odot$,
indicating that absorption line studies of LLSs can probe these low-mass
galaxies which H$_2$-based star formation models predict to have very little
star formation. I study the physical state of individual LLSs and test a simple
model (Schaye 2001) which encapsulates many of their properties. I confirm that
LLSs have a characteristic absorption length given by the Jeans length and that
they are in photoionization equilibrium at low column densities. Finally, I
investigate the self-shielding of LLSs to the UVB and explore how the
non-sphericity of LLSs affects the photoionization rate at a given $N_{\rm
HI}$. I find that at $z\approx 3$, LLSs have an optical depth of unity at a
column density of $\sim 10^{18} {\rm cm}^{-2}$ and that this is the column
density which characterizes the onset of self-shielding.

Polyelectrolytes are used to electrostatically assemble Eu(III) chelate

the growth of a high quality diamond crystal. Photoluminescence,
cathodoluminescence and time resolved fluorescence measurements show that the
Eu atoms retain the characteristic optical signature of Eu(III) upon

experimental findings, corroborating that Eu3+ in diamond is a stable

consequence of their derivation from a discrete variational principle, these
algorithms have very good long-time energy conservation, as well as exactly
preserving discrete momenta. We present stability results for these algorithms,
focusing on understanding how explicit variational integrators can be designed
for this type of system. It is found that for explicit algorithms an
instability arises because the discrete symplectic structure does not become
the continuous structure in the $t \rightarrow 0$ limit. We examine how a
generalized gauge transformation can be used to put the Lagrangian in the
""antisymmetric discretization gauge,"" in which the discrete symplectic
structure has the correct form, thus eliminating the numerical instability.
Finally, it is noted that the variational guiding center algorithms are not
electromagnetically gauge invariant. By designing a model discrete Lagrangian,
we show that the algorithms are approximately gauge invariant as long as
$\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\phi$ are relatively smooth. A gauge invariant discrete
Lagrangian is very important in a variational particle-in-cell algorithm where

lenge for several reasons: (1) graphics performance is important due to
popularity of games and (2) applications with the same UID can share state.
This paper presents Anception, the first flexible application virtualization
framework for Android. It is imple- mented as a modification to the Android
kernel and supports application virtualization that addresses the above
requirements. Anception is able to confine many types of malware while
supporting unmodified Android applications. Our Anception- based system
exhibits up to 3.9% overhead on various 2D/3D benchmarks, and 1.8% overhead on
the SunSpider benchmark.

important matters in option pricing theory today. The most common practice to
deal with these issues is to use another similar or ""closely related"" asset or
index which is traded, for hedging purposes. Implicitly, traders assume here
that the higher the correlation between the traded and nontraded assets, the
better the hedge is expected to perform. This raises the question as to how
\textquoteleft{}closely related\textquoteright{} the assets really are. In this
paper, the concept of twin assets is introduced, focusing the discussion
precisely in what does it mean for two assets to be similar. Our findings point
to the fact that, in order to have very similar assets, for example identical
twins, high correlation measures are not enough. Specifically, two basic
criteria of similarity are pointed out: i) the coefficient of variation of the
assets and ii) the correlation between assets. From here, a method to measure
the level of similarity between assets is proposed, and secondly, an option
pricing model of twin assets is developed. The proposed model allows us to
price an option of one nontraded asset using its twin asset, but this time
knowing explicitly what levels of errors we are facing. Finally, some numerical
illustrations show how twin assets behave depending upon their levels of
similarities, and how their potential differences will traduce in MAPE (mean
absolute percentage error) for the proposed option pricing model.

test-phases because the classifier is characterized only by a subset of the
samples called support vectors (SVs), and the rest of the samples (non SVs)
have no influence on the classification result. However, the advantage of the
sparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is
generally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this
paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us
to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training
phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the
sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal
solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach
through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can
substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM
solvers such as LIBSVM. In the current big data era, we believe that safe
sample screening would be of great practical importance since the data size can
be reduced without sacrificing the optimality of the final solution.

the quantum field theoretical description of the neutrino production and
detection processes. Emphasis is placed on the locality of the interactions of
these processes, where on top of the usual application of the four fermion
local Hamiltonian, we assume that weak interactions switched on only when the
wave functions of the particles involved are overlapping and switched off upon
their separation. A key assumption in our treatment is that the wave packet
sizes of the particles, in particular, the neutrino producing source particles
and the neutrino absorbing detector particles, are taken to be negligible
compared with their mean free path in their respective medium. With this
assumption, and taking into considerations of the finite time of neutrino
production, neutrino wave packets with well-defined edges are generated. This
fact, together with the locality of weak interactions, enable us to relate the

time averaging procedure normally employing in derivations of neutrino
oscillation formula. No assumptions on the particular forms of particle wave
functions; for example, Gaussians, need to be made. A good feature of our
approach is that the neutrino oscillation formula is automatically normalised
if the in-going states of the production and detection processes are
normalised. We also show that causality and unitarity cannot both be satisfied
in virtual neutrino models.

its three-year life span, based on the concept of natural cities. The term
'natural cities' refers to spatially clustered geographic events, such as the
agglomerated patches aggregated from individual social media users' locations.
We applied the head/tail division rule to derive natural cities, based on the
fact that there are far more low-density locations than high-density locations
on the earth surface. More specifically, we generated a triangulated irregular
network, made up of individual unique user locations, and then categorized
small triangles (smaller than an average) as natural cities for the United
States (mainland) on a monthly basis. The concept of natural cities provides a
powerful means to develop new insights into the evolution of real cities,
because there are virtually no data available to track the history of cities
across their entire life spans and at very fine spatial and temporal scales.
Therefore, natural cities can act as a good proxy of real cities, in the sense
of understanding underlying interactions, at a global level, rather than of
predicting cities, at an individual level. Apart from the data produced and the
contributed methods, we established new insights into the structure and
dynamics of natural cities, e.g., the idea that natural cities evolve in
nonlinear manners at both spatial and temporal dimensions.

internalizing Darwinian fitness as a self-estimated fitness. The self-estimated
fitness participates in a feedback loop that effectively produces intrinsic
meaning in the organism. Second, animals with advanced nervous systems evolved
a special form of communication that modifies the way each partner estimates
fitness. The resulting change in intrinsic meaning is experienced subjectively
as a primary form of consciousness. This primary form is subsequently used to
generate, partly through internalized dialogue, more complex forms of
consciousness, such as consciousness of the natural and social worlds,
consciousness of the self, and language-dependent forms of consciousness.

continues to be a driving force in the theory of Random Matrices. For Matrix
Models [53] the method of orthogonal polynomials can be used and the
asymptotics of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel [59] become the key for studying
universality. In this paper the existing results on the CD-kernel will be
extended in two directions. Firstly, in order to analyze the transition from
the universal to the non-universal regime, we provide leading order asymptotics
that are global rather than local. This allows e.g. to describe the moderate
deviations for the largest eigenvalues of unitary ensembles ($\beta$ = 2),
where such a transition occurs. Secondly, our asymptotics will be uniform under
perturbations of the probability measure that defines the matrix ensemble. Such
information is useful for the analysis of a different type of ensembles [25],
which is not known to be determinantal and for which the method of orthogonal
polynomials cannot be used directly. The just described applications of our
results are formulated in this paper but will be proved elsewhere. As a
byproduct of our analysis we derive first order corrections for the 1-point
correlation functions of unitary ensembles in the bulk. Our proofs are based on
the nonlinear steepest descent method [20]. They follow closely [17] and
incorporate improvements introduced in [36, 64]. The presentation is
self-contained except for a number of general facts from Random Matrix theory
and from the theory of singular integral operators.

modeling, three levels are generally considered: the micro, meso and macro
levels, representing respectively the interactions between vehicles, groups of
vehicles sharing common properties (such as a common destination or a common

context: micro and meso models allow to simulate road networks with complex
topologies such as urban area, while macro models allow to develop control
strategies to prevent congestion in highways. However, to simulate large-scale
road networks, it can be interesting to integrate different representations,
e.g., micro and macro, in a single model. Existing models share the same
limitation: connections between levels are fixed a priori and cannot be changed
at runtime. Therefore, to be able to observe some emerging phenomena such as
congestion formation or to find the exact location of a jam in a large macro
section, a dynamic hybrid modeling approach is needed. In 2013 we started the
development of a multi-level agent-based simulator called JAM-FREE within the

supermassive black holes to molecular clouds, protoplanetary discs, and
cometary outflows. In many such fluids, shearing flows are present, leading to
the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) and changing the
properties and structures of the fluid through processes such as mixing and
clumping of dust. We investigate how dust changes the growth rates of the KHI
in 2D and 3D and how the it redistributes and clumps dust. We investigate if
similarities can be found between the structures in 3D KHI and those seen in
observations of molecular clouds. We do this by performing numerical
hydrodynamical dust+gas simulations with in addition to gas a number of dust
fluids. Each dust fluid represents a portion of the particle size-distribution.
We study how dust-to-gas mass density ratios between 0.01 and 1 alter the
growth rate in the linear phase of the KHI. We do this for a wide range of
perturbation wavelengths, and compare these values to the analytical gas-only
growth rates. As the formation of high-density dust structures is of interest
in many astrophysical environments, we scale our simulations with physical
quantities similar to values in molecular clouds. Large differences in dynamics
are seen for different grain sizes. We demonstrate that high dust-to-gas ratios
significantly reduce the growth rate of the KHI, especially for short
wavelengths. We compare the dynamics in 2D and 3D simulations, where the latter
demonstrates additional full 3D instabilities during the non-linear phase,
leading to increased dust densities. We compare the structures formed by the
KHI in 3D simulations with those in molecular clouds and see how the column
density distribution of the simulation shares similarities with log-normal
distributions with power-law tails sometimes seen in observations of molecular
clouds.

robotics, which has attracted intensive research in recent decades. This report
is mainly concerned with provable collision avoidance of multiple autonomous
vehicles operating in unknown cluttered environments, using reactive
decentralized navigation laws, where obstacle information is supplied by some
sensor system.
  Recently, robust and decentralized variants of model predictive control based
navigation systems have been applied to vehicle navigation problems. Properties
such as provable collision avoidance under disturbance and provable convergence
to a target have been shown; however these often require significant
computational and communicative capabilities, and don't consider sensor
constraints, making real time use somewhat difficult. There also seems to be
opportunity to develop a better trade-off between tractability, optimality, and
robustness.
  The main contributions of this work are as follows; firstly, the integration
of the robust model predictive control concept with reactive navigation
strategies based on local path planning, which is applied to both holonomic and
unicycle vehicle models subjected to acceleration bounds and disturbance;
secondly, the extension of model predictive control type methods to situations
where the information about the obstacle is limited to a discrete ray-based
sensor model, for which provably safe, convergent boundary following can be
shown; and thirdly the development of novel constraints allowing decentralized
coordination of multiple vehicles using a robust model predictive control type
approach, where a single communication exchange is used per control update,
vehicles are allowed to perform planning simultaneously, and coherency
objectives are avoided.

measurements the real part of the frequency-dependent conductivity is

hopping electron amplitudes $t$ (and $t'$) between nearest (and next-nearest)

comparison of the method results with other approaches. Namely: (i) the
truncated DE-GWF method reproduces the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results;
(ii) in the lowest (zeroth) order of the expansion the method can reproduce the
analytical results of the standard Gutzwiller approximation (GA), as well as of
the recently proposed ""grand-canonical Gutzwiller approximation"" (GCGA). We
obtain important features of the SC state. First, the SC gap at the Fermi
surface resembles a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave only for optimally- and overdoped
system, being diminished in the antinodal regions for the underdoped case in a
qualitative agreement with experiment. Corrections to the gap structure are
shown to arise from the longer range of the real-space pairing. Second, the
nodal Fermi velocity is almost constant as a function of doping and agrees
semi-quantitatively with experimental results. Third, we compare the doping
dependence of the gap magnitude with experimental data. Fourth, we analyze the
$\mathbf{k}$-space properties of the model: Fermi surface topology and
effective dispersion. The DE-GWF method opens up new perspectives for studying
strongly-correlated systems, as: (i) it works in the thermodynamic limit, (ii)
is comparable in accuracy to VMC, and (iii) has numerical complexity comparable
to GA (i.e., it provides the results much faster than the VMC approach).

consistent with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the optical spectra
exhibit blueshifted absorption, and eventually narrow Fe II and [Ca II]

a luminous blue variable star (LBV) erupting for decades since 1950, followed
by a Type IIn SN in 2001. Interpreted as an LBV followed by a SN analogous to
SN 2009ip, the multi-decade LBV eruptions would be the longest ever observed,

1988Z, suggesting one of the most extreme episodes of pre-SN mass loss ever
discovered.

introduced by multiple base stations. Specifically, the peak throughput
increases linearly with the number of base stations $m$ and is roughly $m/4$

overlap. At each base station, the messages received from the nearby stations
help resolve collisions by the interference cancellation mechanism. Building
from our exact formulas for the non-cooperative case, we provide a heuristic

KOI-202 in the Kepler catalog, thanks to our radial velocity follow-up program
of Kepler-released planet candidates, which is on going with the SOPHIE
spectrograph. We performed a complete analysis of the system by combining the
Kepler observations from Q1 to Q15, to ground-based spectroscopic observations
that allowed us to derive radial velocity measurements, together with the host
star parameters and properties. We also analyzed the light curve to derive the
star's rotation period and the phase function of the planet, including the
secondary eclipse. We found the planet has a mass of 0.939 $\pm$ 0.085
M$_{Jup}$ and a radius of 1.325 $\pm$ 0.043 R$_{Jup}$ which makes it a member
of the bloated giant subgroup. It orbits its G3 V host star in 1.72 days. The
system has an isochronal age of 5.1 Gyr, consistent with its moderate stellar
activity as observed in the Kepler light curve and the rotation of the star of
17.2 $\pm$ 1.6 days. From the detected secondary, we derived the day side
temperature as a function of the geometric albedo and estimated the geometrical
albedo, Ag, is in the range 0.094 to 0.013. The measured night side flux
corresponds to a night side brightness temperature of 2154 $\pm$ 83 K, much
greater than what is expected for a planet with homogeneous heat
redistribution. From the comparison to star and planet evolution models, we
found that dissipation should operate in the deep interior of the planet. This
modeling also shows that despite its inflated radius, the planet presents a
noticeable amount of heavy elements, which accounts for a mass fraction of 0.11
$\pm$ 0.04.

measurements in the solar wind. However, different properties of detected flux
ropes suggest different types of flux-rope population. As such, are there
different populations of flux ropes? The answer is positive, and is the result
of the analysis of four lists of flux ropes, including magnetic clouds (MCs),
observed at 1 AU. The in situ data for the four lists have been fitted with the
same cylindrical force-free field model, which provides an estimation of the
local flux-rope parameters such as its radius and orientation. Since the
flux-rope distributions have a large dynamic range, we go beyond a simple
histogram analysis by developing a partition technique that uniformly
distributes the statistical fluctuations over the radius range. By doing so, we
find that small flux ropes with radius R<0.1 AU have a steep power-law
distribution in contrast to the larger flux ropes (identified as MCs), which
have a Gaussian-like distribution. Next, from four CME catalogs, we estimate
the expected flux-rope frequency per year at 1 AU. We find that the predicted
numbers are similar to the frequencies of MCs observed in situ. However, we
also find that small flux ropes are at least ten times too abundant to
correspond to CMEs, even to narrow ones. Investigating the different possible
scenarios for the origin of those small flux ropes, we conclude that these
twisted structures can be formed by blowout jets in the low corona or in
coronal streamers.

X-1, NGC 1313 X-1, NGC 1313 X-2 and NGC 253 X-1. We found that, although a
common reference model can be used to describe the X-ray spectra, the sources
show different spectral evolutions, phenomenologically described in terms of
variations in the properties of a soft component and a high energy tail.
Variations at low energies are accounted for (mostly) by changes in the
normalization of the soft component and/or in the column density to the source,
while variations in the high energy tail by changes in the parameters of an
optically thick corona. This spectral variability is rather well characterized
on a colour-colour and hardness-intensity diagram in terms of suitably defined
hardness ratios. We suggest the existence of a variability pattern on the
hardness-intensity diagram and we interpret it in terms of the switch between a
near-Eddington and a super-Eddington accretion regime. The transition between
the two regimes seems to be driven mostly by changes in the contribution of the
soft component, which can be explained in terms of the increasing importance of
wind emission. The analysis is complemented by an investigation of the
short-term time variability of all the sources. In general, no clear
correlation between the spectral and temporal properties is found.

of the model is in analyzing the migration of host (remaining in the same

the simplest case $M=2$, this modification is justified because it gives a more
realistic description of migration processes. This becomes evident in a purely

for a certain number of guest susceptible present in non-host cenrta because
these susceptible may be infected and return to the host node as infectives.
The flux of such infectives is not negligible and is comparable with the flux
of host infectives migrated to other centra, because the return rate of a guest

single polynomial inequality raises an intriguing question related to the
finite determinateness of the full moment sequence. The more general case of a
measure with density equal to the exponential of a polynomial is treated in
parallel. Our approach relies on Stokes theorem and simple Hankel-type matrix
identities.

  University",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the study of the quantum Hall effect there are still many unresolved
problems. One of these is how to generate representative wave functions for
ground states on other geometries than the planar and spherical. We study one
such geometry, the toroidal one, where the periodic boundary conditions must be
properly taken into account.
  As a tool to study the torus we investigate the properties of various types
of localized states, similar to the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator,
which are maximally localized in phase space. We consider two alternative
definitions of localized states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) on a torus.
One is the projection of the coordinate delta function onto the LLL. Another
definition, proposed by Haldane & Rezayi, is to consider the set of functions
which have all their zeros at a single point. Since all LLL wave functions on a
torus, are uniquely defined by the position of their zeros, this defines a set
of functions that are expected to be localized around the point maximally far
away from the zeros.
  These two families of localized states have many properties in common with
the coherent states on the plane and on the sphere, e.g. a simple resolution of
unity and a simple self-reproducing kernel. However, we show that only the
projected delta function is maximally localized.
  We find that because of modular covariance, there are severe restrictions on
which wave functions that are acceptable on the torus. As a result, we can
write down a trial wave function for the $\nu=\frac{2}{5}$ state, that respects
the modular covariance, and has good numerical overlap with the exact coulomb
ground state.
  Finally we present preliminary calculations of the antisymmetric component of
the viscosity tensor for the proposed, modular covariant, $\nu=\frac{2}{5}$
state, and find that it is in agreement with theoretical predictions.

weak lensing survey. 3D cosmic shear is a technique that analyses weak lensing
in three dimensions using a spherical harmonic approach, and does not bin data
in the redshift direction. This is applied to CFHTLenS, a 154 square degree
imaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of
11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. To account for survey
masks we apply a 3D pseudo-Cl approach on weak lensing data, and to avoid
uncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radial
wave numbers k<=1.5h/Mpc and k<=5.0h/Mpc, and angular wavenumbers l~400-5000.
We show how one can recover 2D and tomographic power spectra from the full 3D
cosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2D cosmic shear
power spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic shear
tomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3D power in the
calculation of such 2D and tomographic power spectra from data naturally
accounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum. We use 3D cosmic
shear to constrain cosmologies with parameters OmegaM, OmegaB, sigma8, h, ns,
w0, wa. For a non-evolving dark energy equation of state, and assuming a flat
cosmology, lensing combined with WMAP7 results in h=0.78+/-0.12,
OmegaM=0.252+/-0.079, sigma8=0.88+/-0.23 and w=-1.16+/-0.38 using only scales
k<=1.5h/Mpc. We also present results of lensing combined with first year Planck
results, where we find no tension with the results from this analysis, but we
also find no significant improvement over the Planck results alone. We find
evidence of a suppression of power compared to LCDM on small scales 1.5 < k <
5.0 h/Mpc in the lensing data, which is consistent with predictions of the
effect of baryonic feedback on the matter power spectrum.

Ratio (SINR) that is applicable to a certain transmission, referred to as
Channel State Information (CSI), can only be learned after the transmission has
taken place and is thereby outdated (delayed). For example, this occurs under
intermittent interference. We devise the backward retransmission (BRQ) scheme,
which uses the delayed CSIT to send the optimal amount of incremental
redundancy (IR). BRQ uses fixed-length packets, fixed-rate R transmission
codebook, and operates as Markov block coding, where the correlation between
the adjacent packets depends on the amount of IR parity bits. When the delayed
CSIT is full and R grows asymptotically, the average throughput of BRQ becomes
equal to the value achieved with prior CSIT and a fixed-power transmitter;
however, at the expense of increased delay. The second contribution is a method
for employing BRQ when a limited number of feedback bits is available to report
the delayed CSIT. The main novelty is the idea to assemble multiple feedback
opportunities and report multiple SINRs through vector quantization. This
challenges the conventional wisdom in ARQ protocols where feedback bits are
used to only quantize the CSIT of the immediate previous transmission.

Arthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-known

challenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in
detail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity
class QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right.
  We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for
3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of only
n^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP
with a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithms
nearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never
been previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT
protocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of
certain entangled games.
  In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation
algorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT
protocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins
never provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for
all k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games,
which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on
subsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be
closely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.

We prove the existence of a broad class of sparse processes by using the
Minlos-Bochner theorem. This requires a careful study of the regularity
properties, especially the boundedness in Lp-spaces, of the characteristic
functional of the innovations. We are especially interested in the functionals

sparser kind of processes. Finally, we apply our main theorem of existence to

$\overline{\Sigma}\simeq0.1-0.4\:\rm{g~cm^{-2}}$ --- relatively low values

fragmentation of these cores. (3) Determine the $\Sigma$ (equivalently column

near complete for $A_V>3\:$mag. The PDF is well fit by a single log-normal with
mean $\overline{A}_V\simeq9\:$mag, high compared to other known clouds. It does
not exhibit a separate high-end power law tail, which has been claimed to

image based analysis, sampled over a ~ks time frame to investigate the

over a 100s time frame to seize the fast variability of each source during its

duty cycle ($<$1% activity over nine years of data), when studied at the 100s
level, they are the ones with the highest detection percentage, meaning that,
when active, they tend to have many bright short-term flares with respect to
the other SFXTs. To investigate in a coherent and self consistent way all the
available results within a physical scenario, we have extracted cumulative
luminosity distributions for all the sources of the sample. The
characterization of such distributions in hard X-rays, presented for the first

the modes affect fast ions in a region of real space governed by the eigenmode

forming a polymer brush, structure and dynamics of the polymers is
investigated, varying chain stiffness and grafting density. The anchoring
condition for the grafted chains is chosen such that their first bonds are
oriented along the normal to the substrate plane.
  Compression of such a semi-flexible brush by a planar piston is observed to
be a two-stage process: for small compressions the chains contract by
""buckling"" deformation whereas for larger compression the chains exhibit a
collective (almost uniform) bending deformation. Thus, the stiff polymer brush
undergoes a 2-nd order phase transition of collective bond reorientation. The
pressure, required to keep the stiff brush at a given degree of compression, is
thereby significantly smaller than for an otherwise identical brush made of
entirely flexible polymer chains! While both the brush height and the chain
linear dimension in the z-direction perpendicular to the substrate increase
monotonically with increasing chain stiffness, lateral (xy) chain linear
dimensions exhibit a maximum at intermediate chain stiffness. Increasing the
grafting density leads to a strong decrease of these lateral dimensions,
compatible with an exponential decay. Also the recovery kinetics after removal
of the compressing piston is studied, and found to follow a power-law /
exponential decay with time.
  A simple mean-field theoretical consideration, accounting for the
buckling/bending behavior of semi-flexible polymer brushes under compression,

demonstration of graphene antennas is finding suitable terahertz sources to
feed the antenna. This paper estimates the performance of a graphene RF
plasmonic micro-antenna fed with a photoconductive source. The terahertz source
is modeled and, by means of a full-wave EM solver, the radiated power of the
device is estimated with respect to material, laser illumination and antenna
geometry parameters. The results show that the proposed device radiates
terahertz pulses with an average power up to 1$\mu$W, proving the feasibility
of feeding miniaturized graphene antennas with photoconductive materials.

are uniform in $[0,1]$, we show that, in the large $L$ limit, there is almost
surely no path to the fittest site if $x>x^*_{1/2}$ and we conjecture that

larger rocky bodies. The components of the nearby binary aCentauri have higher
than solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.
We aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the aCen system.
Having already detected the temperature minimum, Tmin, of aCenA, we here
attempt to do so also for the companion aCenB. Using the aCen stars as
templates, we study possible effects Tmin may have on the detectability of
unresolved dust discs around other stars. We use Herschel and APEX photometry
to determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. In addition, we use
APEX for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around aCen seen
in the photometric images. Models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used to
estimate the amount of debris around these stars. For solar-type stars, a
fractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for SEDs that do not exhibit
the Tmin-effect. Slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mu
for both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd
(1-3)e-5. Dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of the
putative Zodi belts around the aCen stars, viz. <~4e-6 MMoon of 4 to 1000 mu
size grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. Similarly, for filled-in Tmin
emission, corresponding EKBs could account for ~1e-3 MMoon of dust. Light
scattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-Zodi discs will have profound
implications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search for
biomarkers in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets. The F-IR SED of aCenB is
marginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in the
upper atmosphere. We also show that an aCenA-like temperature minimum may
result in an erroneous apprehension about the presence of dust around other

bubbles between the clouds that are blown by stellar winds and supernovae. We
compare our 3D maps of the IS dust to the ROSAT diffuse X-ray background maps.
In the Plane, there is a good correspondence between the locations and extents
of the mapped nearby cavities and the 0.25 keV background emission
distribution, showing that most of these nearby cavities contribute to this
soft X-ray emission. Assuming a constant dust to gas ratio and homogeneous 1MK
hot gas filling the cavities, we modeled in a simple way the 0.25 keV surface
brightness along the Galactic plane as seen from the Sun, taking into account
the absorption by the mapped clouds. The data-model comparison favors the
existence of hot gas in the Local Bubble (LB). The average mean pressure in the
local cavities is found to be on the order of about 10,000 cm-3K, in agreement
with previous studies. The model overestimates the emission from the huge
cavities in the 3rd quadrant. Using CaII absorption data, we show that the dust
to CaII ratio is very small in this region, implying the presence of a large
quantity of lower temperature (non-X-ray emitting) ionized gas, explaining at
least part of the discrepancy. In the meridian plane, the two main brightness
enhancements coincide well with the chimneys connecting the LB to the halo. No
nearby cavity is found towards the bright North Polar Spur (NPS) at high
latitude. We searched in the maps for the source regions of the 0.75 keV
enhancements in the 4th and 1st quadrants. Tunnels and cavities are found to
coincide with the main bright areas, however no tunnel nor cavity is found to
match the low-latitude, brightest part of the NPS. In addition, the comparison
between the maps and published spectra do not favor the nearby cavities located
within about 200pc as potential source regions for the NPS.

initial gluon spectrum modelling the shattering of the color glass condensate,
causing the initial distribution to be out of equilibrium. We find that the
saturation reduces the efficiency in building-up the elliptic flow, even if the
thermalization process is quite fast $\tau_{therm} \approx 0.8 \,\rm fm/c$. and
the pressure isotropization even faster $\tau_{isotr} \approx 0.3 \,\rm fm/c$.
The impact of the initial non-equilibrium manifests for non-central collisions
and can modify the estimate of the viscosity respect to the assumption of full

an adaptive controller without using the image-space velocity signal where the
adaptations of the depth-rate-independent kinematic parameter and depth
parameter are driven by both the image-space tracking errors and observation
errors. The major superiority of the proposed observer-based adaptive
controller lies in its simplicity and the separation of the handling of
multiple uncertainties in visually servoed robotic systems, thus avoiding the
overparametrization problem of the existing work. Using Lyapunov analysis, we
demonstrate that the image-space tracking errors converge to zero
asymptotically. The performance of the proposed adaptive control scheme is
illustrated by a numerical simulation.

in the optimal timing of a firm/project sale or in the valuation of natural

reward and a discounted final reward. The running and final rewards as well as
the instantaneous interest rate (used for calculating discount factors) depend
on a Feller-Markov process modelling the underlying randomness in the world,
such as prices of stocks, prices of natural resources (gas, oil, etc.), or
factors influencing the interest rate. For years, it had seemed sensible to
assume that interest rates were uniformly separated from 0, which is needed for
the existing theory to work. However, recent developments in Japan and in
Europe showed that interest rates can get arbitrarily close to 0. In this paper
we establish the feasibility of the stopping problem, prove the existence of
optimal stopping times and a variational characterisation (in the viscosity
sense) of the value function when interest rates are NOT uniformly separated
from 0. Our results rely on certain ergodic properties of the underlying
(non-uniformly) ergodic Markov process. We provide several criteria for
diffusions and jump-diffusions.

the application of such maximally entangled states from the viewpoint of the

to the GHZ states. The algebraic structure of the GHZ transform is made clear
and representative examples for it are verified as multi-qubit Clifford gates.

GHZ transform and apply it to the reformulation of quantum circuit model of
teleportation and the reformulation of the fault-tolerant construction of
single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates in teleportation-based quantum
computation. We clearly show that there exists a natural algebraic structure
called the teleportation operator in terms of the Bell transform to catch
essential points of quantum teleportation, and hence we expect that there would
also exist interesting algebraic structures in terms of the GHZ transform to
play important roles in quantum information and computation.
