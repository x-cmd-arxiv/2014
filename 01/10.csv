Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS) solar system object (SSO) calibration
targets, which were observed regularly throughout the Herschel mission. We
construct ratios of the spectra for all observations of a given source with
respect to a reference. The reference observation is selected iteratively to be
the one with the highest observed continuum. Assuming that any pointing offset
leads to an overall shift of the continuum level, then these ratios represent
the relative flux loss due to mispointing. The mispointing effects are more
pronounced for a smaller beam, so we consider only the FTS short wavelength
array (SSW, 958-1546 GHz) to derive a pointing correction. We obtain the
relative pointing offset by comparing the ratio to a grid of expected losses
for a model source at different distances from the centre of the beam, under
the assumption that the SSW FTS beam can be well approximated by a Gaussian. In
order to avoid dependency on the point source flux conversion, which uses a
particular observation of Uranus, we use extended source flux calibrated
spectra to construct the ratios for the SSOs. In order to account for continuum
variability, due to the changing distance from the Herschel telescope, the SSO
ratios are normalised by the expected model ratios for the corresponding
observing epoch. We confirm the accuracy of the derived pointing offset by
comparing the results with a number of control observations, where the actual
pointing of Herschel is known with good precision. Using the method we derived
pointing offsets for repeated observations of Uranus (including observations
centred on off-axis detectors), Neptune, Ceres and NGC7027. The results are
used to validate and improve the point-source flux calibration of the FTS.

Accurate modelling and removal of the telescope contribution is, therefore, an

pipeline. A dust-contaminated telescope model with time invariant mirror
emissivity was adopted before the Herschel launch. However, measured FTS
spectra show a clear evolution of the telescope contribution over the mission

archive {\it XMM}-Newton and Swift/XRT observations of 4U 1700+24 in order to
have a uniform high-energy ($0.3-10$ keV) view of the source. We confirmed the
existence of a red-shifted O VIII Ly-$\alpha$ transition (already observed in
the 2002 {\it XMM}-Newton data) in the high-resolution spectra collected via
the RGS instruments. The red-shift of the line is found in all the analysed
observations and, on average, it was estimated to be $\simeq 0.009$. We also
observed a modulation of the centroid energy of the line on short time scales
(a few days) and discuss the observations in the framework of different
scenarios. If the modulation is due to the gravitational red-shift of the
neutron star, it might arise from a sudden re-organization of the emitting
$X$-ray matter on the scale of a few hundreds of km. Alternatively, we are
witnessing a uni-polar jet of matter (with typical velocity of $1000-4000$ km
s$^{-1}$) possibly emitted by the neutron star in an almost face-on system. The
second possibility seems to be required by the apparent lack of any modulation
in the observed $X$-ray light curve. We also note also that the low-resolution
spectra (both {\it XMM}-Newton and Swift/XRT in the $0.3-10$ keV band) show the
existence of a black body radiation emitted by a region (possibly associated
with the neutron star polar cap) with typical size from a few tens to hundreds
of meters. The size of this spot-like region reduces as the overall luminosity
of 4U 1700+24 decreases.

thin-shell instability reduces X-ray emission. For 2D simulations of collision
between equal expanding winds, we carry out a parameter study of such
instability as a function of the ratio of radiative vs. adiabatic-expansion
cooling lengths. In the adiabatic regime, the extended cooling layer suppresses
instability, leading to planar shock compression with X-ray luminosity that
follows closely the expected (Lx ~ M^2) quadratic scaling with mass-loss rate M
. In the strongly radiative limit, the X-ray emission now follows an expected
linear scaling with mass loss (Lx ~ M), but the instability deforms the shock
compression into extended shear layers with oblique shocks along fingers of
cooled, dense material. The spatial dispersion of shock thermalization limits
strong X-ray emission to the tips and troughs of the fingers, and so reduces
the X-ray emission (here by about a factor 1/50) below what is expected from
analytic radiative-shock models without unstable structure. Between these two
limits, X-ray emission can switch between a high-state associated with extended
shock compression, and a low-state characterized by extensive shear. Further
study is needed to clarify the origin of this ""shear mixing reduction factor""

simple-to-measure structural function provides direct estimates of virial
coefficients. Comparing the virial coefficients of an atomistically detailed

permits the role of many-body effects to be quantified. The approach is applied
to two models: (i) a size-asymmetrical colloid-polymer mixture, and (ii) a

spatial distribution of matter as created by a yet not completely understood

possible in terms of the event by event probability distribution of the

accuracy independent on the details of the subsequent fluid dynamical evolution

Structure survey, the precursor to the XXL survey. It has a photometrically
determined redshift $z=1.91^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$, making it among the most distant

measured. The spherically integrated Comptonization is
$Y_{500}=(3.0\pm0.4)\times 10^{-12}$, a measurement which is relatively

obtained, analysed and discuss HARPS high-resolution spectra of rho Pup and DX
Cet. We derived the same physical quantities as used in previous studies, which
are the first-moment radial velocities and the bi-Gaussian spectral line
asymmetries. The identification of f=7.098 (1/d) as a fundamental radial mode
and the very accurate Hipparcos parallax promote rho Pup as the best standard
candle to test the period-luminosity relations of delta Sct stars. The action
of small-amplitude nonradial modes can be seen as well-defined cycle-to-cycle
variations in the radial velocity measurements of rho Pup. Using the
spectral-line asymmetry method, we also found the centre-of-mass velocities of
rho Pup and DX Cet, V_gamma = 47.49 +/- 0.07 km/s and V_gamma = 25.75 +/- 0.06
km/s, respectively. By comparing our results with previous HARPS observations
of classical Cepheids and beta Cep stars, we confirm the linear relation
between the atmospheric velocity gradient and the amplitude of the radial
velocity curve, but only for amplitudes larger than 22.5 km/s. For lower values
of the velocity amplitude (i.e., < 22.5 km/s), our data on rho Pup seem to
indicate that the velocity gradient is null, but this result needs to be
confirmed with additional data. We derived the Baade-Wesselink projection
factor p = 1.36 +/- 0.02 for rho Pup and p = 1.39 +/- 0.02 for DX Cet. We
successfully extended the period-projection factor relation from classical

ground-state energy in quantum many-particle systems. In the absence of
interaction, the influence of particle statistics on the ground-state energy is
trivial: the ground-state energy of noninteracting bosons is lower than that of
free fermions because of Bose-Einstein condensation and Pauli exclusion
principle. In the presence of hard-core or other interaction, however, the
comparison is not trivial. Nevertheless, the ground-state energy of hard-core
bosons is proved to be lower than that of spinless fermions, if all the hopping
amplitudes are nonnegative. The condition can be understood as the absence of
frustration among hoppings. By mapping the many-body Hamiltonian to a
tight-binding model on a fictitious lattice, we show that the Fermi statistics
of the original particles introduces an effective magnetic flux in the
fictitious lattice. The latter can be regarded as a frustration, since it leads
to a destructive interference among different paths along which a single
particle is propagating. If we introduce hopping frustration, the hopping
frustration is expected to compete with ""effective frustration"", leading to the
possibility that the ground-state energy of hard-core bosons can be higher than
that of fermions. We present several examples, in which the ground-state energy
of hard-core bosons is proved to be higher than that of fermions due to the
hopping frustration. The basic ideas were reported in a recent Letter [W.-X.

cross-polarisation. We use the geometry of the measured set of visibilities to
project down to pure temperature modes on the sky, serving as a significant
compression, and an effective first filter of polarised contaminants. We use
the m-mode formalism with the Karhunen-Loeve transform to give a highly

cleaning realistic polarised skies observed with an instrument suffering from
substantial off axis polarisation leakage. We develop an optimal quadratic
estimator in the m-mode formalism, which can be efficiently calculated using a
Monte-Carlo technique. This is used to assess the implications of foreground
removal for power spectrum constraints where we find that our method can clean
foregrounds well below the foreground wedge, rendering only scales $k_\parallel
< 0.02 h \,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ inaccessible. As this approach assumes perfect
knowledge of the telescope, we perform a conservative test of how essential
this is by simulating and analysing datasets with deviations about our assumed
telescope. Assuming no other techniques to mitigate bias are applied, we
recover unbiased power spectra when the per-feed beam width to be measured to
0.1%, and amplifier gains to be known to 1% within each minute. Finally, as an
example application, we extend our forecasts to a wideband 400-800 MHz

astrophysical flows) are subjected to strong rotation and stratification. These
effects break the symmetries of classical, homogenous isotropic turbulence. In
doing so, they introduce a natural decomposition of phase space in terms of
wave modes and potential vorticity modes. The appearance of a new time scale
associated to the propagation of waves, in addition to the eddy turnover time,
increases the complexity of the energy transfers between the various scales;
nonlinearly interacting waves may dominate at some scales while balanced motion
may prevail at others. In the end, it is difficult to predict \emph{a priori}
if the energy cascades downscale as in homogeneous isotropic turbulence,
upscale as expected from balanced dynamics, or follows yet another
phenomenology.
  In this paper, we suggest a theoretical approach based on equilibrium
statistical mechanics for the ideal system, inspired from the restricted
partition function formalism introduced in metastability studies. In this
framework, we show analytically that in the presence of rotation, when the
dynamics is restricted to the slow modes, the equilibrium energy spectrum
features an infrared divergence characteristic of an inverse cascade regime,
whereas this is not the case for purely stratified flows.

soft and molecular glasses, but its microscopic origin remains unclear. Here,
we elucidate the yielding of a colloidal glass by using x-ray scattering to
monitor the structure factor during the yielding process. We apply a recently
introduced combination of small-angle x-ray scattering and rheology to the
oscillatory shear, and follow the structure factor during the increasing strain
amplitude. Surprisingly, we observe a sharp transition in the orientational
ordering of the nearest-neighbor structure upon yielding, in contrast to the
smooth variation of the viscoelastic moduli. This transition is accompanied by
a sudden change of intensity fluctuations towards Gaussian distributions. We
thus identify yielding as a new, dynamically induced transition of the glass in
response to the applied shear.

invariants of multi-qubit systems. The Hilbert space of such systems can be
stratified in terms of states with different types of symmetry. We review the
connection between this stratification and the ring of entanglement invariants
and the corresponding geometric description in terms of algebraic varieties. On
a stratum of a non-trivial symmetry group the invariants of the symmetry
preserving operations gives a sufficient description of entanglement. Finding
these invariants is often a simpler problem than finding the invariants of the
local unitary group. The conditions, as given by the Luna-Richardson theorem,
for when the ring of such invariants is isomorphic to the ring of local unitary
invariants on the stratum are discussed. As an example we consider symmetry
groups that can be diagonalized by local unitary operations and for which the
group action on each qubit is non-trivial. On the stratum of such a symmetry
the entanglement can be described in terms of a canonical form and the
invariants of the symmetry preserving operations. This canonical form and the
invariants are directly determined by the symmetry group. Further, we briefly
discuss how some recently proposed entanglement classification schemes capture
symmetry properties.

curvature invariants vanish (the VSI property) are well-studied, less is known

Recently it was shown that the neutral signature metrics belong to two distinct
subclasses: the Walker and Kundt metrics. In this paper we have chosen an
example from each of the two subcases of the Ricci-flat VSI Walker metrics
respectively.
  To investigate the difference between the metrics we determine the existence
of a null, geodesic, expansion-free, shear-free and vorticity-free vector, and
classify these spaces using their infinitesimal holonomy algebras. The
geometric implications of the holonomy algebras are further studied by
identifying the recurrent or covariantly constant null vectors, whose existence
is required by the holonomy structure in each example. We conclude the paper
with a simple example of the equivalence algorithm for these pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds, which is the only approach to classification that provides all
necessary information to determine equivalence.

equations subject to suitable conditions can be written in a similar way to the
Einstein-Maxwell field equations; (ii) these equations have solutions that
describe accelerated expansion for the three possible cosmological models of
the universe, namely, spherical expansion, flat expansion and hyperbolic
expansion when $\alpha $, a parameter of theory, is greater than zero. This
result allow us to conjeture that this solutions are compatible with the era of
Dark Energy and that the energy-momentum tensor for the field $h^{a}$, a
bosonic gauge field from the Chern-Simons gravity action, corresponds to a form
of positive cosmological constant.
  It is also shown that the EChS field equations have solutions compatible with
the era of matter: (i) In the case of an open universe, the solutions
correspond to an accelerated expansion ($\alpha >0$) with a minimum scale
factor at initial time that, when the time goes to infinity, the scale factor
behaves as a hyperbolic sine function. (ii) In the case of a flat universe, the
solutions describing an accelerated expansion whose scale factor behaves as a
exponencial function when time grows. \item In the case of a closed universe it
is found only one solution for a universe in expansion, which behaves as a
hyperbolic cosine function when time grows.

velocity, although there are also claimed detections by means of periodic
variations in half-width or line intensity. However, scarce observational
evidence exists about simultaneous detection of oscillations in several
spectral indicators. Aims. Our main aim here is to explore the relationship
between spectral indicators, such as Doppler shift, line intensity, and line
half-width, and the linear perturbations excited in a simple prominence model.
Methods. Our equilibrium background model consists of a bounded, homogeneous
slab, which is permeated by a transverse magnetic field, having prominence-like
physical properties. Assuming linear perturbations, the dispersion relation for
fast and slow modes has been derived, as well as the perturbations for the
different physical quantities. These perturbations have been used as the input
variables in a one-dimensional radiative transfer code, which calculates the
full spectral profile of the hydrogen H-alpha and H-beta lines. Results. We
have found that different oscillatory modes produce spectral indicator
variations in different magnitudes. Detectable variations in the Doppler
velocity were found for the fundamental slow mode only. Substantial variations
in the H-beta line intensity were found for specific modes. Other modes lead to
lower and even undetectable parameter variations. Conclusions. To perform
prominence seismology, analysis of the H-alpha and H-beta spectral line
parameters could be a good tool to detect and identify oscillatory modes.

study the distinction between deterministic and stochastic components in time
series [L. Lacasa and R. Toral, Phys. Rev. E., 82, 036120 (2010)].
Specifically, the authors propose that the node degree distribution of these
processes follows an exponential functional of the form $P(\kappa)\sim
\exp(-\lambda~\kappa)$, in which $\kappa$ is the node degree and $\lambda$ is a
positive parameter able to distinguish between deterministic (chaotic) and
stochastic (uncorrelated and correlated) dynamics. In this work, we investigate
the characteristics of the node degree distributions constructed by using HVG,
for time series corresponding to $28$ chaotic maps and $3$ different stochastic
processes. We thoroughly study the methodology proposed by Lacasa and Toral
finding several cases for which their hypothesis is not valid. We propose a
methodology that uses the HVG together with Information Theory quantifiers. An
extensive and careful analysis of the node degree distributions obtained by
applying HVG allow us to conclude that the Fisher-Shannon information plane is
a remarkable tool able to graphically represent the different nature,
deterministic or stochastic, of the systems under study.

steady-state or stationary MHD models in Throumoulopoulos & Tasso (2001),
finding that their separable semi-analytic nonlinear solutions are actually not
unique given their specific selection of several free functionals and chosen
boundary conditions. The multiplicity of nonlinear steady MHD solutions gives
rise to differences in the total energies contained in the magnetic fields and
flow velocity fields as well as in the asymptotic behaviours approaching
infinity, which may in turn explain why numerical solvers tend to converge to a
nonlinear solution with a lower energy than the corresponding separable
semi-analytic one. By properly adjusting model parameters, we invoke
semi-analytic and numerical solutions to describe different kind of scenarios,
including nearly parallel case and the situation in which the misalignment
between the fluid flow and magnetic field is considerable. We propose that
these MHD models are capable of describing the magnetospheres of MWDs as
examples of applications with moderate conditions (including magnetic field)

gamma-ray flare on 2009 November 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6
photons/cm^2/s at energies E>100 MeV and becoming one of the brightest GeV
sources for about two weeks. Its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,
instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. We investigate
changes of the object's radio-to-GeV spectral energy distribution (SED) during
and after the prominent GeV flare with the aim to determine the nature of the
object and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. The data
collected by the Fermi and AGILE satellites at gamma-ray energies, Swift at
X-ray and ultraviolet, Kanata, NOT, and Keck telescopes at optical, OAGH and
WISE at infrared, and IRAM 30m, OVRO 40m, Effelsberg 100m, RATAN-600, and VLBA
at radio, are analysed together to trace the SED evolution on timescales of
months. The gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) is
located at redshift z=0.638. It is shining through an unrelated foreground
galaxy at z=0.500. The AGN light is likely amplified by a factor of a few
because of gravitational lensing. The AGN SED shows a two-humped structure
typical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud NLSy1 galaxies, with the high-energy
(inverse-Compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude over
the low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. The difference
between the two SED humps is smaller during the low-activity state. Fermi
observations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux and
spectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightest
gamma-ray state. If the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) and external Compton (EC) emission, the observed GeV spectral variability
may result from varying relative contributions of these two emission
components.

$\alpha_\textrm{1}=1.0\pm0.2$, $\alpha_\textrm{2}=0.36\pm0.01$, and
$H_{\textrm{B}}=8.3$. The KS test reveals that the probability that the Trojans
and cold KBOs share the same parent H-distribution is less than 1 in 1000. When
the bimodal albedo distribution of the hot objects is accounted for, there is
no evidence that the H-distributions of the Trojans and hot KBOs differ. Our
findings are in agreement with the predictions of the Nice model in terms of
both mass and H-distribution of the hot and Trojan populations. Wide field
survey data suggest that the brightest few hot objects, with
$H_{\textrm{r'}}\lesssim3$, do not fall on the steep power-law slope of fainter
hot objects. Under the standard hierarchical model of planetesimal formation,
it is difficult to account for the similar break diameters of the hot and cold

structure of jets. Traditionally, broadening has been measured with respect to
the thrust axis, which is aligned along the (hemisphere) jet momentum to
minimize the vector sum of transverse momentum within a jet. In this paper, we
advocate measuring broadening with respect to the ""broadening axis"", which is
the direction that minimizes the scalar sum of transverse momentum within a
jet. This approach eliminates many of the calculational complexities arising
from recoil of the leading parton, and observables like the jet angularities
become recoil-free when measured using the broadening axis. We derive a simple
factorization theorem for broadening-axis observables which smoothly
interpolates between the thrust-like and broadening-like regimes. We argue that
the same factorization theorem holds for two-point energy correlation functions
as well as for jet shapes based on a ""winner-take-all axis"". Using kinked
broadening axes, we calculate event-wide angularities in e+e- collisions with
next-to-leading logarithmic resummation. Defining jet regions using the
broadening axis, we also calculate the global logarithms for angularities
within a single jet. We find good agreement comparing our calculations both to
showering Monte Carlo programs and to automated resummation tools. We give a
brief historical perspective on the broadening axis and suggest ways that
broadening-axis observables could be used in future jet substructure studies at

short, evolutionary phase of massive stars. While our understanding of
Wolf-Rayet stars has increased dramatically over the past decades, it remains
unclear whether rapid rotators are among them. There are various indications
that rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet stars should exist. Unfortunately, due to
their expanding atmospheres, rotational velocities of Wolf-Rayet stars are very
difficult to measure. However, recently observed spectra of several Wolf-Rayet
stars reveal peculiarly broad and round emission lines. Could these spectra
imply rapid rotation?
  In this work, we model the effects of rotation on the atmospheres of
Wolf-Rayet stars. We further investigate whether the peculiar spectra of five
Wolf-Rayet stars may be explained with the help of stellar rotation, infer
appropriate rotation parameters, and discuss the implications of our results.
We make use of the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) non-LTE model atmosphere code.
Since the observed spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars are mainly formed in their
expanding atmospheres, rotation must be accounted for with a 3D integration
scheme of the formal integral. For this purpose, we assume a rotational
velocity field consisting of an inner co-rotating domain and an outer domain,
where the angular momentum is conserved. We find that rotation can reproduce
the unique spectra analyzed here. However, the inferred rotational velocities
at the stellar surface are large (~200 km/s), and the inferred co-rotation
radii (~10 stellar radii) suggest the existence of very strong photospheric
magnetic fields (~20 kG).

orphan TeV flare have been observed from the blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421).
The TeV emission from Mrk 421 is believed to be produced by leptonic
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. In this scenario, correlations between
the X-ray and the TeV fluxes are expected, TeV orphan flares are hardly
explained and the activity (measured as duty cycle) of the source at TeV
energies is expected to be equal or less than that observed in X-rays if only
SSC is considered. To estimate the TeV duty cycle of Mrk 421 and to establish
limits on its variability at different time scales, we continuously observed
Mrk 421 with the Milagro observatory. Mrk 421 was detected by Milagro with a
statistical significance of 7.1 standard deviations between 2005 September 21

Motivated by the partial consistency phenomena, we propose to model $g(Z)$ via
incidental parameters. Based on partitioning the support of $Z$, a simple local
average is used to estimate the response surface. The proposed method seeks to
strike a balance between computation burden and efficiency of the estimators
while minimizing model bias. Computationally this approach only involves least
squares. We show that given the inconsistent estimator of $g(Z)$, a root $n$
consistent estimator of parametric component $\beta$ of the partially linear
model can be obtained with little cost in efficiency. Moreover, conditional on
the $\beta$ estimates, an optimal estimator of $g(Z)$ can then be obtained
using classic nonparametric methods. The statistical inference problem
regarding $\beta$ and a two-population nonparametric testing problem regarding
$g(Z)$ are considered. Our results show that the behavior of test statistics
are satisfactory. To assess the performance of our method in comparison with
other methods, three simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset about

restricted to a subgraph of the social network of their users. While
centralized, highly successful social networking services entail a complete
privacy loss of their users, Social Overlays at higher performance represent an
ideal private and censorship-resistant communication substrate for the same
purpose.
  Routing in such restricted topologies is facilitated by embedding the social
graph into a metric space. Decentralized routing algorithms have up to date
mainly been analyzed under the assumption of a perfect lattice structure.
However, currently deployed embedding algorithms for privacy-preserving Social
Overlays cannot achieve a sufficiently accurate embedding and hence
conventional routing algorithms fail. Developing Social Overlays with
acceptable performance hence requires better models and enhanced algorithms,
which guarantee convergence in the presence of local optima with regard to the
distance to the target.
  We suggest a model for Social Overlays that includes inaccurate embeddings

algorithm that can achieve polylog routing length despite local optima. We
provide analytical bounds on the performance of NextBestOnce assuming a

GRB 130603B indicated that a few hundredths of a solar mass of neutron star
matter were ejected and that this ejected mass has radioactively decayed into
heavy r-process elements. If correct, this confirms long standing predictions
(Eichler, Livio, Piran and Schramm 1989) that on the one hand, sGRBs are
produced in compact binary mergers (CBMs) and on the other hand that these
events are significant and possibly dominant sources of the heavy (A>130)
r-process nuclei. Assuming that this interpretation is correct we obtain a
lower limit of 0.02 m_sun on the ejected mass. Using the current estimates of
the rate of sGRBs and with a beaming factor of 50, mergers associated with
sGRBs can produce all the observed heavy r-process material in the Universe. We
confront this conclusion with cosmochemistry and show that even though such
events are rare, mixing is sufficient to account for the current homogeneous
distribution of r-process material in the Galaxy. However, the appearance of
significant amounts of Eu in some very low metallicity stars requires that some
mergers took place very early on, namely with a very short time delay after the
earliest star formation episodes. Alternatively, an additional early
r-processsource may have contributed at that early stage. Finally, we note that
evidence for short lived {244}^Pu in the very early solar system suggests that
a merger of this kind took place within the vicinity of the solar system
shortly (a few hundred million years) before its formation.

distributed aggregators who have energy storage and purchase energy from the

each aggregator seeks to minimize its own long-term payments for energy
purchase and operational costs of energy storage by deciding how much energy to
buy from the ISO, and the ISO seeks to minimize the long-term total cost of the
system (e.g. energy generation costs and the aggregators' costs) by dispatching
the energy production among the generators. The decision making of the entities
is complicated for two reasons. First, the information is decentralized: the
ISO does not know the aggregators' states (i.e. their energy consumption
requests from customers and the amount of energy in their storage), and each
aggregator does not know the other aggregators' states or the ISO's state (i.e.
the energy generation costs and the status of the transmission lines). Second,
the coupling among the aggregators is unknown to them. Specifically, each
aggregator's energy purchase affects the price, and hence the payments of the
other aggregators. However, none of them knows how its decision influences the
price because the price is determined by the ISO based on its state. We propose
a design framework in which the ISO provides each aggregator with a conjectured
future price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-term
cost based on its conjectured price as well as its local information. The
proposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralized
and involving complex coupling among the various entities.

modulated robustness. While for uncertain convex programs there exist
randomized approaches with efficient sampling, this is not the case for
non-convex problems. Approaches based on statistical learning theory are
applicable to non-convex problems, but they usually are conservative in terms
of performance and require high sample complexity to achieve the desired
probabilistic guarantees. In this paper, we derive a novel scenario approach
for a wide class of random non-convex programs, with a sample complexity
similar to that of uncertain convex programs and with probabilistic guarantees
that hold not only for the optimal solution of the scenario program, but for
all feasible solutions inside a set of a-priori chosen complexity. We also
address measure-theoretic issues for uncertain convex and non-convex programs.
Among the family of non-convex control- design problems that can be addressed
via randomization, we apply our scenario approach to randomized Model
Predictive Control for chance-constrained nonlinear control-affine systems.

although common around more evolved young stellar objects, are rarely detected
during the earliest, ""Class 0"" phase; however, a few excellent candidates have
been discovered recently around both low and high mass protostars. In this
early phase, prominent outflows are ubiquitously observed; they are expected to
be associated with at least small magnetized disks. Disk formation - once
thought to be a simple consequence of the conservation of angular momentum
during hydrodynamic core collapse - is far more subtle in magnetized gas. In
this case, the rotation can be strongly magnetically braked. Indeed, both
analytic arguments and numerical simulations have shown that disk formation is
suppressed in the strict ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit for the observed
level of core magnetization. We review what is known about this ""magnetic
braking catastrophe"", possible ways to resolve it, and the current status of
early disk observations. Outflows are also intimately linked to disk formation;
they are a natural product of magnetic fields and rotation and are important
signposts of star formation. We review new developments on early outflow
generation since PPV. The properties of early disks and outflows are a key

coding and cooperation between a relay and users to boost the throughput and to

shares the same spreading code. The relay has two roles, it synchronizes
network transmissions and it broadcasts the combined signals received from
users. From user $\mathcal{B}$'s point of view, the signal is decoded, and

consistent with theoretical expectations of the WHIM. We discuss the

this detection shows again that using signposts is a very effective strategy to
search for the WHIM, follow-up observations are crucial both to strengthen the
statistical significance of the detection and to rule out other

expected to suppress the long-range charged impurity scattering and
consequently to enhance the mobility. However, the absence of such enhancement
has caused some controversies regarding the scattering mechanism. In graphene
devices transferred from SiO2 to STO using a newly developed technique, we
observe a moderate mobility enhancement near the Dirac point, which is the
point of charge neutrality achieved by adjusting the Fermi level. While bulk
STO is not known as a ferroelectric material, its surface was previously
reported to exhibit an outward displacement of oxygen atoms and
ferroelectric-like dipole moment. When placed on STO, graphene shows strong and
asymmetric hysteresis in resistivity, which is consistent with the dipole
picture associated with the oxygen displacement. The hysteretic response of the
surface dipole moment diminishes the polarizability, therefore weakens the
ability of STO to screen the Coulomb potential of the impurities.

recurrent neural networks. In RC, an input signal perturbs the intrinsic
dynamics of a medium called a reservoir. A readout layer is then trained to
reconstruct a target output from the reservoir's state. The multitude of RC
architectures and evaluation metrics poses a challenge to both practitioners
and theorists who study the task-solving performance and computational power of
RC. In addition, in contrast to traditional computation models, the reservoir
is a dynamical system in which computation and memory are inseparable, and
therefore hard to analyze. Here, we compare echo state networks (ESN), a
popular RC architecture, with tapped-delay lines (DL) and nonlinear
autoregressive exogenous (NARX) networks, which we use to model systems with
limited computation and limited memory respectively. We compare the performance
of the three systems while computing three common benchmark time series:
H{\'e}non Map, NARMA10, and NARMA20. We find that the role of the reservoir in
the reservoir computing paradigm goes beyond providing a memory of the past
inputs. The DL and the NARX network have higher memorization capability, but
fall short of the generalization power of the ESN.

  Computational Biology",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003495",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Absence epilepsy is believed to be associated with the abnormal interactions
between the cerebral cortex and thalamus. Besides the direct coupling,
anatomical evidence indicates that the cerebral cortex and thalamus also
communicate indirectly through an important intermediate bridge--basal ganglia.
It has been thus postulated that the basal ganglia might play key roles in the
modulation of absence seizures, but the relevant biophysical mechanisms are
still not completely established. Using a biophysically based model, we
demonstrate here that the typical absence seizure activities can be controlled
and modulated by the direct GABAergic projections from the substantia nigra
pars reticulata (SNr) to either the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) or the
specific relay nuclei (SRN) of thalamus, through different biophysical
mechanisms. Under certain conditions, these two types of seizure control are
observed to coexist in the same network. More importantly, due to the
competition between the inhibitory SNr-TRN and SNr-SRN pathways, we find that
both decreasing and increasing the activation of SNr neurons from the normal
level may considerably suppress the generation of SWDs in the coexistence
region. Overall, these results highlight the bidirectional functional roles of
basal ganglia in controlling and modulating absence seizures, and might provide
novel insights into the therapeutic treatments of this brain disorder.

of all these interactions are detected at discrete genomic regions on selected

designated Centromeric Regions of Interphase Chromatin Homing (CENTRICH).
CENTRICH manifest 199-716-fold higher density of inter-chromosomal binding
sites compared to genome-wide or chromosomal averages (p =
2.10E-101-1.08E-292). Sequence alignment analysis shows that CENTRICH represent

nucleolus; 2) exhibit highly diverse set of DNA-bound chromatin state
regulators, including marked enrichment of CTCF and STAT1 binding sites; 3)
bind multiple intergenic disease-associated genomic loci (IDAGL) with
documented long-range enhancer activities and established links to increased
risk of developing epithelial malignancies and other common human disorders.
Using distances of SNP loci homing sites within genomic coordinates of CENTRICH
as a proxy of likelihood of disease-linked SNP loci binding to CENTRICH, we
demonstrate statistically significant correlations between the probability of
SNP loci binding to CENTRICH and GWAS-defined odds ratios of increased risk of
a disease for cancer, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes. Our

equations admit simple analytic solutions for $\phi(t)$ and $H(t)$, which are

thus provide a simple way of setting the initial conditions from which to start

spatially-flat models with polynomial and exponential potentials, and determine
the background evolution in each case; generically $H(t)$ and $|\phi(t)|$ as
well as their time derivatives decrease during kinetic dominance until
$\dot{\phi}^2\sim V(\phi)$, marking the onset of a brief period of fast-roll
inflation prior to a slow roll phase. We also calculate the approximate

citation records for their research. Drawing samples that are too small may
make it difficult or impossible for studies to achieve their goals, while
drawing samples that are too large may drain resources that could be better
used for other purposes. This paper considers three common situations and
offers advice for dealing with each. First, an entire population of records is
available for an institution. We argue that, even though all records have been
collected, the use of inferential statistics, significance testing, and
confidence intervals is both common and desirable. Second, because of limited
resources or other factors, a sample of records needs to be drawn. We
demonstrate how power analyses can be used to determine in advance how large
the sample needs to be to achieve the study's goals. Third, the sample size may
already be determined, either because the data have already been collected or
because resources are limited. We show how power analyses can again be used to
determine how large effects need to be in order to find effects that are
statistically significant. Such information can then help bibliometricians to
develop reasonable expectations as to what their analysis can accomplish. While
we focus on issues of interest to bibliometricians, our recommendations and
procedures can easily be adapted for other fields of study.

Considering that both monolingual and multilingual Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) behave alike when applied for such documents, we use a training corpus
built on Wikipedia where all documents are length-normalized and obtain
improvements over previously reported scores for LDA. Another focus of our work
is on model combination. For this end we include Explicit Semantic Analysis
(ESA) in the experiments. We observe that ESA is not competitive with LDA in a
query based retrieval task on CLEF 2000 data. The combination of machine
translation with concept models increased performance by 21.1% map in
comparison to machine translation alone. Machine translation relies on parallel
corpora, which may not be available for many language pairs. We further explore
how much cross-lingual information can be carried over by a specific
information source in Wikipedia, namely linked text. The best results are
obtained using a language modeling approach, entirely without information from
parallel corpora. The need for smoothing raises interesting questions on
soundness and efficiency. Link models capture only a certain kind of
information and suggest weighting schemes to emphasize particular words. For a
combined model, another interesting question is therefore how to integrate
different weighting schemes. Using a very simple combination scheme, we obtain
results that compare favorably to previously reported results on the CLEF 2000

\sqrt{s_{NN}}\le$ 39 GeV. The simulations are performed within a three-fluid
model employing three different equations of state (EoS's): a purely hadronic
EoS and two versions of the EoS involving the deconfinement transition---a
first-order phase transition and a smooth crossover one. The present
simulations demonstrate low sensitivity of $v_2$(charged) to the EoS. All
considered scenarios equally well reproduce recent STAR data on $v_2$(charged)
for mid-central Au+Au collisions and properly describe its change of sign at
the incident energy decrease below $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3.5 GeV. The
predicted integrated elliptic flow of various species exhibits a stronger
dependence on the EoS. A noticeable sensitivity to the EoS is found for
anti-baryons and, to a lesser extent, for $K^-$ mesons. In particular, the
$v_2$ excitation functions of anti-baryons exhibit a non-monotonicity within
the deconfinement scenarios that was predicted by Kolb, Sollfrank and Heinz.
However, low multiplicities of anti-baryons at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 10 GeV
result in large fluctuations of their $v_2$ which may wash out this
non-monotonicity.

recent years to be a powerful tool by researchers far beyond the optimization
community to model many important applications involving structured low rank

developments in the emerging field of compressed sensing. The L\""owner

single-variable function to each of the singular values of a matrix, has played
an important role for a long time in solving matrix optimization problems.
However, the classical theory developed for L\""owner operators has become

provide some necessary theoretical foundations for designing numerical methods
for solving the MOP. This goal is achieved by introducing and conducting a
thorough study on a new class of matrix valued functions, coined as spectral
operators of matrices. Several fundamental properties of spectral operators,
including the well-definedness, continuity, directional differentiability,
Fr\'{e}chet-differentiability, locally Lipschitzian continuity, $\rho$-order

characteristics of reactive DC-magnetron sputtered NbN. The basic principle is
to ignite a plasma using argon, and then to introduce a small additional
nitrogen flow to achieve the nitridation of a Nb target. Subsequent sputtering
leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate. The characteristics of
a sputtered film depend on a number of parameters: argon pressure, nitrogen
flow rate and time-evolution profile, substrate material, etc. Crucially, the
hysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used
to provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the
reactive process. By studying these dependencies we have been able to achieve
highly reproducible film characteristics on sapphire, silicon dioxide on
silicon, and silicon nitride on silicon. Intrinsic film stress was minimised by
optimising the argon pressure, giving NbN films having Tc = 14.65 K. In the

of NESS in which the system is not finite, but rather a many-body system.

common. We generated a draft genome sequence for the strongyloidean nematode
parasite Dictyocaulus viviparus, the cattle lungworm. In the assembly, we
identified nearly 1 Mb of sequence with similarity to Wolbachia. The fragments
were unlikely to derive from a live Wolbachia infection: most were short, and
the genes were disabled through inactivating mutations. Many fragments were
co-assembled with definitively nematode-derived sequence. We found limited
evidence of expression of the Wolbachia-derived genes. The D. viviparus
Wolbachia genes were most similar to filarial strains, and strains from the
host-promiscuous clade F. We conclude that D. viviparus was infected by
Wolbachia in the past. Genome sequence based surveys are a powerful tool for
revealing the genome archaeology of infection and symbiosis.

combinatorial expansion properties. This is expressed, e.g., by the discrete
Cheeger inequality, the lower bound of which states that $\lambda(G) \leq
h(G)$, where $\lambda(G)$ is the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of
a graph $G$ and $h(G)$ is the Cheeger constant measuring the edge expansion of
$G$. We are interested in generalizations of expansion properties to finite
simplicial complexes of higher dimension (or uniform hypergraphs).
  Whereas higher dimensional Laplacians were introduced already in 1945 by
Eckmann, the generalization of edge expansion to simplicial complexes is not
straightforward. Recently, a topologically motivated notion analogous to edge
expansion that is based on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-cohomology was introduced by Gromov
and independently by Linial, Meshulam and Wallach. It is known that for this
generalization there is no higher dimensional analogue of the lower bound of
the Cheeger inequality. A different, combinatorially motivated generalization
of the Cheeger constant, denoted by $h(X)$, was studied by Parzanchevski,
Rosenthal and Tessler. They showed that indeed $\lambda(X) \leq h(X)$, where
$\lambda(X)$ is the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of the ($(k-1)$-dimensional
upper) Laplacian, for the case of $k$-dimensional simplicial complexes $X$ with
complete $(k-1)$-skeleton.
  Whether this inequality also holds for $k$-dimensional complexes with
non-complete $(k-1)$-skeleton has been an open question. We give two proofs of
the inequality for arbitrary complexes. The proofs differ strongly in the
methods and structures employed, and each allows for a different kind of
additional strengthening of the original result.

leads to the deposition of NbN onto the host substrate. The characteristics of
a sputtered film depend on a number of parameters: argon pressure, nitrogen
flow rate and time-evolution profile, substrate material, etc. Crucially, the
hysteresis in the target voltage as a function of the nitrogen flow can be used
to provide a highly effective monitor of nitrogen consumption during the
reactive process. By studying these dependencies we have been able to achieve
highly reproducible film characteristics on sapphire, silicon dioxide on
silicon, and silicon nitride on silicon. Intrinsic film stress was minimised by
optimising the argon pressure, giving NbN films having Tc = 14.65 K. In the

from photodissociation regions on the surface of molecular clouds. The
L[CII]/LIR ratio in our intermediate redshift (U)LIRGs is on average ~10 times

polynomial inequalities that can be implemented with linear matrix
inequalities. Convexity is preserved, but the problem has now a finite number
of constraints. We show how to take advantage of the properties of the
exponential function in order to build quickly accurate approximations. The
problem used for illustration is the least-squares fitting of a positive sum of
exponentials to an empirical density. When the exponents are given, the problem
is convex, but we also give a procedure for optimizing the exponents. Several
examples show that the method is flexible, accurate and gives better results
than other methods for the investigated problems.

presented for the non-Abelian Chern-Simons actions in the cases N=1, 2, 3, and
the corresponding component actions are explicitly worked out. Such a
Chern-Simons action does not exist for N=4. In the latter case, a superform

multiplet action principles in the cases N=2, 3, 4. The N=3 and N=4 actions are
demonstrated to be universal in the sense that all known off-shell
supergravity-matter systems (with the exception of pure conformal supergravity)
may be described using such an action. Starting from the N=3 and N=4 Abelian
vector multiplets, we also construct composite O(2) multiplets which are
analogues of the four-dimensional construction of an N=2 reduced chiral scalar
engineered from the improved tensor multiplet. Using these composites, we
present the superfield equations of motion for N=3 and N=4 anti-de Sitter and
topologically massive supergravity theories. We also sketch the construction of
a large family of higher derivative couplings for N=3 and N=4 vector

dominated. We estimate the surface temperature of a radiation pressure
dominated accretion disk, \Theta=(c_s/r\Omega_K)^2<<(H/r)^2, which is
significantly lower than that of a gas pressure dominated disk, \Theta (H/r)^2.
This means that the outflow can be launched magnetically from the photosphere
of the radiation pressure dominate disk only if the effective potential barrier
along the magnetic field line is extremely shallow or no potential barrier is
present. For the latter case, the slow sonic point in the outflow may probably
be in the disk, which leads to a slow circular dense flow above the disk. This
implies that hot gas (probably in the corona) is necessary for launching a jet
from the radiation pressure dominated disk, which provides a natural
explanation on the observational evidence that the relativistic jets are
related to hot plasma in some X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. We
investigate the outflows accelerated from the hot corona above the disk by the
magnetic field and radiation force of the accretion disk. We find that, with
the help of the radiation force, the mass loss rate in the outflow is high,
which leads to a slow outflow. This may be the reason why the jets in
radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert galaxies are in general mild relativistic
compared with those in blazars.

the verbal thoughts of the patient to be perceived as external voices. The
account is based on a predictive control model, in which verbal self-monitoring
is implemented. The aim of this study was to examine lip muscle activity during
AVHs in schizophrenia patients, in order to check whether inner speech
occurred. Methods: Lip muscle activity was recorded during covert AVHs (without
articulation) and rest. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used on eleven
schizophrenia patients. Results: Our results show an increase in EMG activity
in the orbicularis oris inferior muscle, during covert AVHs relative to rest.
This increase is not due to general muscular tension since there was no
increase of muscular activity in the forearm muscle. Conclusion: This evidence
that AVHs might be self-generated inner speech is discussed in the framework of
a predictive control model. Further work is needed to better describe how the
inner speech monitoring dysfunction occurs and how inner speech is controlled
and monitored. This will help better understanding how AVHs occur.

trainees' depression is evaluated. Principal stratification is used to deal
with noncompliance to the assigned treatment. Due to the latent nature of the
principal strata, strong structural assumptions are often invoked to identify
principal causal effects. Alternatively, distributional assumptions may be
invoked using a model-based approach. These often lead to weakly identified
models with substantial regions of flatness in the posterior distribution of
the causal effects. Information on multiple outcomes is routinely collected in
practice, but is rarely used to improve inference. This article develops a
Bayesian approach to exploit multivariate outcomes to sharpen inferences in
weakly identified principal stratification models. We show that inference for
the causal effect on depression is significantly improved by using the
re-employment status as a secondary outcome in the JOBS II study. Simulation
studies are also performed to illustrate the potential gains in the estimation
of principal causal effects from jointly modeling more than one outcome. This
approach can also be used to assess plausibility of structural assumptions and
sensitivity to deviations from these structural assumptions. Two model checking

example to time-independent loading by a steadily flowing fluid (air or water),
a dangerous bifurcation, such as a sub-critical bifurcation, or a cyclic fold,
will trigger a dynamic jump to one or more remote stable attractors. When there
is more than one candidate attractor, the one onto which the structure settles
can then be indeterminate, being sensitive to infinitesimally small variations
in starting conditions or parameters. In this paper we develop and study an
archetypal model to explore the nonlinear dynamic interactions between
galloping at an incipient sub-critical Hopf bifurcation of a structure with
shell-like buckling behaviour that is gravity-loaded to approach a sub-critical
pitch-fork bifurcation. For the fluid forces, we draw on the aerodynamic
coefficients determined experimentally by Novak for the flow around a bluff
body of rectangular cross-section. Meanwhile, for the structural component, we
consider a variant of the propped-cantilever model that is widely used to
illustrate the sub-critical pitchfork: within this model a symmetry-breaking
imperfection makes the behaviour generic. The compound bifurcation
corresponding to simultaneous galloping and buckling is the so-called
Takens-Bodganov Cusp. We make a full unfolding of this codimension-3
bifurcation for our archetypal model to explore the adjacent phase-space
topologies and their indeterminacies.

are incoupled to one side and extracted from the other, can in the mean-field

$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric external potential. If the strength of the in- and
outcoupling is increased two $\mathcal{PT}$ broken states bifurcate from the
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric ground state. At this bifurcation point a stability
change of the ground state is expected. However, it is observed that this
stability change does not occur exactly at the bifurcation but at a slightly
different strength of the in-/outcoupling effect. We investigate a
Bose-Einstein condensate in a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric double-$\delta$

analysed by means of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and it is shown that
the difference in the strength of the in-/outcoupling between the bifurcation

the nonlinear term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

eigenstates of angular momentum represented by the spinor spherical harmonics.
Afterwards we study the properties of many-fermion states resulting from a
multiple angular momentum composition of the one-fermion states, giving the
total angular momentum $J=\left\langle L\right\rangle+ \left\langle

We demonstrate how the composition rules affect the relativistic interplay
between the sums of the spins $\left\langle S\right\rangle $ and orbital
angular moments $\left\langle L\right\rangle $ of the constituents, which
collectively generate the spin of composite particle. It is suggested that in a
relativistic case, when the masses of the constituent fermions are much less

of the composite particle is dominated by the orbital angular moments
$\left\langle L\right\rangle $ of the constituents, while $\left\vert

attention is paid to the case $J=1/2$ that is related to the spin of proton

High expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption H I and He I
lines. From the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolution
of the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that SN
2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 Msun He-core progenitor star,
corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 Msun, that ejected a mass of
56Ni of about 0.04 Msun, with an energy of E= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. Such a low-mass
progenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebular
spectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. From the modelling of the
adiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 Rsun,
clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. The radio light curve of SN
2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of SN 1993J, but with a higher
mass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of SN 2001ig.

requires an accurate spectral characterization of the objects in order to avoid
polluting the results with undetected binary or peculiar stars. This piece of
information is a key issue in the understanding of the link between rotation
and the presence of chemical peculiarities. Aims. A sample of 47 low v sin i
A0-A1 stars (v sin i < 65km/s), initially selected as main-sequence normal
stars, are investigated with high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
spectroscopic data. The aim is to detect spectroscopic binaries and chemically
peculiar stars, and eventually establish a list of confirmed normal stars.
Methods. A detailed abundance analysis and spectral synthesis is performed to
derive abundances for 14 chemical species. A hierarchical classification,
taking measurement errors into account, is applied to the abundance space and
splits the sample into two different groups, identified as the chemically
peculiar stars and the normal stars. Results. We show that about one third of
the sample is actually composed of spectroscopic binaries (12 double-lined and
five single-lined spectroscopic binaries). The hierarchical classification
breaks down the remaining sample into 13 chemically peculiar stars (or
uncertain) and 17 normal stars.

bounded. The problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem with ${\cal

the computational complexity of a generic convex solver is exponential in the
number of constraints. This paper gives an efficient energy scheduling
algorithm, called the iterative dynamic water-filling algorithm, that has a
computational complexity of ${\cal O}(NK^2)$ per iteration. For the single-user
case, a dynamic water-filling method is shown to be optimal. Unlike the
traditional water-filling algorithm, in dynamic water-filling, the water level
is not constant but changes when the battery overflows or depletes. An
iterative version of the dynamic water-filling algorithm is shown to be optimal
for the case of multiple users. Even though in principle the optimality is
achieved under large number of iterations, in practice convergence is reached
in only a few iterations. Moreover, a single iteration of the dynamic
water-filling algorithm achieves a sum-rate that is within $(N-1)K/2$ nats of
the optimal sum-rate.

the moist entropy potential temperature recently defined in Marquet (2011).
Both homogeneously saturated and non-saturated versions of $N^2$ (the squared
BVF) are derived. The method employed for computing these special homogeneous
cases relies on the expression of density written as a function of pressure,
total water content and specific moist entropy only. The associated
conservative variable diagrams are discussed and compared with existing ones.
Despite being obtained without any simplification, the formulations for $N^2$
remain nicely compact and are clearly linked with the squared BVF expressed in
terms of the adiabatic non-saturated and saturated lapse rates. As in previous
similar expressions, the extreme homogeneous solutions for $N^2$ are of course
different, but they are not analytically discontinuous. This allows us to
define a simple bridging expression for a single general shape of $N^2$,
depending only on the basic mean atmospheric quantities and on a transition
parameter, to be defined (or parameterized) in connection with the type of
application sought. This integrated result remains a linear combination (with
complex but purely local weights) of two terms only, namely the environmental
gradient of the moist entropy potential temperature and the environmental
gradient of the total water content. Simplified versions of the various
equations are also proposed for the case in which the moist entropy potential
temperature is approximated by a function of both so-called moist-conservative
variables of Betts (1973).

probabilistic inequality in which one combines data collected in experiments

pairs of instances of time, $(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), (t_3, t_4),$ where $t_1 <
t_2 < t_3.$ We generalize LG conditions of macroscopic realism and noninvasive
measurability in the general contextual framework. Our formulation is done in
the purely probabilistic terms: existence of the context independent joint
probability distribution $P$ and the possibility to reconstruct the
experimentally found marginal (two dimensional) probability distributions from
the $P.$ We derive an analog of the LG inequality, ""contextual LG inequality"",
and use it as a test of ""quantum-likeness"" of statistical data collected in a
series of experiments on recognition of ambiguous figures. In our experimental
study the figure under recognition is the Schroeder stair which is shown with
rotations for different angles. Contexts are encoded by dynamics of rotations:
clockwise, anticlockwise, and random. Our data demonstrated violation of the
contextual LG inequality for some combinations of aforementioned contexts.
Since in quantum theory and experiments with quantum physical systems this
inequality is violated, e.g., in the form of the original LG-inequality, our
result can be interpreted as a sign that the quantum(-like) models can provide
a more adequate description of the data generated in the process of recognition
of ambiguous figures.

car-following, which runs against the traditional traffic flow theory.
