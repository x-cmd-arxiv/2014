approximately included by applying a correction factor to the solution of the
corresponding equation for the local equivalent interaction. This is usually
referred to as the Perey correction factor. Purpose: In this work we
investigate the validity of the Perey correction factor for single-channel
bound and scattering states, as well as in transfer (p,d) cross sections.
Method: We solve the scattering and bound state equations for non-local
interactions of the Perey-Buck type, through an iterative method. Using the
distorted wave Born approximation, we construct the T-matrix for (p,d) on 17O,
41Ca, 49Ca, 127Sn, 133Sn, and 209Pb at 20 and 50 MeV. Results: We found that
for bound states, the Perey corrected wave function resulting from the local
equation agreed well with that from the non-local equation in the interior
region, but discrepancies were found in the surface and peripheral regions.
Overall, the Perey correction factor was adequate for scattering states, with
the exception of a few partial waves corresponding to the grazing impact
parameters. These differences proved to be important for transfer reactions.
Conclusions: The Perey correction factor does offer an improvement over taking
a direct local equivalent solution. However, if the desired accuracy is to be
better than 10%, the exact solution of the non-local equation should be
pursued.

by the dynamics generated by the noncommutativity. This is an oscillation in
the spectrum of the volume operator of the universe, within the bouncing region

Dynamo bistability has been proposed as an explanation. However it is not
straightforward to obtain such a bistability in dynamo models. On the other
hand, the solar magnetic dipole at times of magnetic field inversion becomes
transverse to the rotation axis, while the magnetic field becomes weaker at
times far from that of inversion. Thus the
  Sun resembles a star with the second type of activity. We suggest that
M-dwarfs can have magnetic cycles, and that M-dwarfs with the second type of
activity can just be stars observed at times of magnetic field inversion. Then
the relative number of M-dwarfs with the second type of activity can be used in
the framework of this model to determine parameters of stellar convection near
the surface.

systems, a layering of primary, secondary, and tertiary control has become the
standard operation paradigm for islanded microgrids. Despite this superficial
similarity, the control objectives in microgrids across these three layers are
varied and ambitious, and they must be achieved while allowing for robust
plug-and-play operation and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision
making and time-scale separations. In this work, we explore control strategies
for these three layers and illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and
dependencies among them. Building from a first-principle analysis of
decentralized primary droop control, we study centralized, decentralized, and
distributed architectures for secondary frequency regulation. We find that
averaging-based distributed controllers using communication among the
generation units offer the best combination of flexibility and performance. We
further leverage these results to study constrained AC economic dispatch in a
tertiary control layer. Surprisingly, we show that the minimizers of the
economic dispatch problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of
steady-states reachable by droop control. In other words, the adoption of droop
control is necessary and sufficient to achieve economic optimization. This
equivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop coefficients,
which include the known criteria for power sharing. We illustrate the
performance and robustness of our designs through simulations.

atmospheric effects of microwave power beams before issuing launch licenses for
SSP satellite systems. This paper proposes to collect representative and
comprehensive data of the interaction of power beams with the atmosphere by
extending the infrastructure of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research
Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska, USA. Estimates of the transmission
infrastructure performance as well as measurement devices and scientific
capabilities of possible upgrade scenarios will be discussed. The proposed
upgrade of the HAARP facility is expected to deliver a wealth of data and
information which could serve as a decision base for governmental launch
licensing of SSP satellites, and which can be used in addition to deepen public
acceptance of SSP as a large-scale renewable energy source.

massless photon and a universe that does not turn into a plasma of massless
charged particles. If we choose M=3 and N=2, the only option is shown to be the
Standard Model with an undetermined number of families. We do not assume the
U(1) embedding, charge quantization, family repetition, nor the fermion
representations; all of these features are derived, assuming a doublet Higgs.
With a slightly stronger assumption even the Higgs representation is
determined. We also consider a more general class, requiring an asymptotically
free strong SU(M) (with M geq 3) interaction from the first factor and an
electromagnetic U(1) embedded in both factors. We allow Higgs symmetry breaking
of the U(N)x U(1) flavor group by at most one Higgs boson in any
representation, combined with any allowed chiral symmetry breaking by SU(M).
For M=3 there is a large number of solutions with an unbroken U(1). In all of
these, quarks have third-integral charges and color singlets have integer
charges in comparison to leptons. Hence Standard Model charge quantization
holds for any N. Only for N=2 these models allow an SU(5) GUT extension, but
this extension offers no advantages whatsoever for understanding the Standard
Model; it only causes complications, such as the doublet-triplet splitting
problem. Although all these models have a massless photon, all except the
Standard Model are ruled out by the second anthropic requirement. In this class
of brane models the Standard Model is realized as a GUT with its intestines
removed, to keep only the good parts: a GUT without guts.

communication network are highly interdependent. Recognizing the need for a
deeper understanding of the interdependency in a multi-layered network,
significant efforts have been made by the research community in the last few
years to achieve this goal. Accordingly a number of models have been proposed
and analyzed. Unfortunately, most of the models are over simplified and, as
such, they fail to capture the complex interdependency that exists between
entities of the power grid and the communication networks involving a
combination of conjunctive and disjunctive relations. To overcome the
limitations of existing models, we propose a new model that is able to capture
such complex interdependency relations. Utilizing this model, we provide
techniques to identify the $\cal K$ most vulnerable nodes of an interdependent
network. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time in some
special cases, whereas for some others, the problem is NP-complete. We
establish that this problem is equivalent to computation of a {\em fixed point}
of a multilayered network system and we provide a technique for its computation
utilizing Integer Linear Programming. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our
technique using real data collected from the power grid and the communication
network that span the Maricopa County of Arizona.

polycrystalline UO2 at 295 and 1200 K using time-of-flight inelastic neutron
scattering to investigate the impact of anharmonicity on the vibrational
spectra and to benchmark ab initio PDOS simulations performed on this strongly
correlated Mott-insulator. Time-of-flight PDOS measurements include anharmonic
linewidth broadening inherently and the factor of ~ 7 enhancement of the oxygen
spectrum relative to the uranium component by the neutron weighting increases
sensitivity to the oxygen-dominated optical phonon modes. The first-principles
simulations of quasi-harmonic PDOS spectra were neutron-weighted and
anharmonicity was introduced in an approximate way by convolution with
wavevector-weighted averages over our previously measured phonon linewidths for
UO2 that are provided in numerical form. Comparisons between the PDOS
measurements and the simulations show reasonable agreement overall, but they
also reveal important areas of disagreement for both high and low temperatures.
The discrepancies stem largely from an ~ 10 meV compression in the overall
bandwidth (energy range) of the oxygen-dominated optical phonons in the
simulations. A similar linewidth-convoluted comparison performed with the PDOS
spectrum of Dolling et al. obtained by shell-model fitting to their historical
phonon dispersion measurements shows excellent agreement with the
time-of-flight PDOS measurements reported here. In contrast, we show by
comparisons of spectra in linewidth-convoluted form that recent
first-principles simulations for UO2 fail to account for the PDOS spectrum
determined from the measurements of Dolling et al. These results demonstrate
PDOS measurements to be stringent tests for ab initio simulations of phonon
physics in UO2 and they indicate further the need for advances in theory to
address lattice dynamics of UO2.

This phenomenon has been observed in biological processes such as endocytosis,

protein adsorption. In this paper, we show that the classical elastic model of

tension due to protein adsorption in a local region, and a viscous-elastic

viscous-elastic model for inhomogeneous membranes of the Helfrich type. Using
the new viscous-elastic model, we find that the lipids flow to accommodate
changes in membrane curvature during protein adsorption. We show that, at the
end of protein adsorption process, the system sustains a residual local tension
to balance the difference between the actual mean curvature and the imposed
spontaneous curvatures. This change in membrane tension can have a functional
impact in many biological phenomena where proteins interact with membranes.

extra-galactic. FRB 110220 has a scattering tail of $\sim 5.6\pm 0.1 \ms$. If
the electron density fluctuations arise from a turbulent cascade, the

yield linear or non-linear combinations of all measured miRs. Global human miR
expression was measured in AML, B-ALL, and T-ALL cell lines and patient RNA

miR-27a), known to function as tumor suppressors of acute leukemias, appeared
in the AML, B-ALL and T-ALL centric networks. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis
showed that the most connected miR in the B-ALL-centric network, miR-708, is
highly and specifically expressed in B-ALLs, suggesting that miR-708 might
serve as a biomarker for B-ALL. This approach is systematic, quantitative,
scalable, and unbiased. Rather than a single signature, our approach yields a
network of signatures reflecting the redundant nature of biological signaling
pathways. The network representation allows for visual analysis of all
signatures by an expert and for future integration of additional information.
Furthermore, each signature involves only small sets of miRs, such as dyads and

indeterminism do not require meta-theoretic considerations in their

relative to the meta-theory if there is freedom for deviation, due to
higher-order causes. Absolute free will, which corresponds to our intuitive

infinite. We argue that this hierarchy corresponds to higher levels of
uncomputability. In other words, at any finitely high order in the hierarchy,
there are uncomputable deviations from the law at that order. Applied to the

the use of word-level alignements (e.g. infered with the help of GIZA++)
between translated sentences, in order to align the word embeddings in
different languages. In this workshop paper, we investigate an autoencoder
model for learning multilingual word representations that does without such
word-level alignements. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the
bag-of-word representation of given sentence from an encoded representation
extracted from its translation. We evaluate our approach on a multilingual
document classification task, where labeled data is available only for one
language (e.g. English) while classification must be performed in a different
language (e.g. French). In our experiments, we observe that our method compares
favorably with a previously proposed method that exploits word-level alignments
to learn word representations.

anisotropy generated by the time evolution along the light cone of the 21cm
signal from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations include the physics
necessary to model the signal during both the late emission regime and the
early absorption regime, namely X-ray and Lyman-band 3D radiative transfer in
addition to the usual dynamics and ionizing UV transfer. The signal is analysed
using correlation functions perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight
(LOS). We reproduce general findings from previous theoretical studies: the
overall amplitude of the correlations and the fact that the light cone
anisotropy is visible only on large scales (100 cMpc). However, the detailed
behaviour is different. At 3 different epochs, the amplitude of the
correlations along and perpendicular to the LOS differ from each other,
indicating anisotropy. These 3 epochs are associated with 3 events of the
global reionization history: the overlap of ionized bubbles, the onset of mild
heating by X-rays in regions around the sources, and the onset of efficient
Lyman-alpha coupling in regions around the sources. A 20x20 deg^2 survey area
may be necessary to mitigate sample variance when we use the directional
correlation functions. On a 100 cMpc scale the light cone anisotropy dominates
over the anisotropy generated by peculiar velocity gradients computed in the
linear regime. By modelling instrumental noise and limited resolution, we find
that the anisotropy should be easily detectable by the SKA, assuming perfect
foreground removal, the limiting factor being a large enough survey size. In
the case of the LOFAR, it is likely that only first anisotropy episode will
fall in the observing frequency range and will be detectable only if sample
variance is much reduced (i.e. a larger than 20x20 deg^2 survey, which is not
presently planned).

Ionized Absorbers toward Quasars (KODIAQ) survey which aims to characterize the

circumgalactic medium (CGM) at 2<z<4. We select absorbers optically thick at
the Lyman limit ({\tau}LL > 1, log N(HI) > 17.3) as probes of these galaxies
and their CGM where both transitions of the O VI doublet have little
contamination from the Ly {\alpha}, {\beta} forests. We found 20 absorbers that
satisfy these rules: 7 Lyman limit systems (LLSs), 8 super-LLSs (SLLSs) and 5
damped Ly{\alpha} (DLAs). The O VI detection rate is 100% for the DLAs, 71% for
the LLSs, and 63% for the SLLSs. When O VI is detected, log N(OVI)=14.9+/-0.3,
an average O VI column density substantially larger and with a smaller
dispersion than found in blind O VI surveys at similar redshifts. Strong O VI
absorption is therefore nearly ubiquitous in the CGM of z~2-3 galaxies. The
total velocity widths of the O VI profiles are also large (200<Dv(OVI)<400
km/s). These properties are quite similar to those seen for O VI in low z
star-forming galaxies, and therefore we hypothesize that these strong CGM O VI
absorbers (with {\tau}LL > 1) at 2<z<3.5 also probe outflows of star-forming
galaxies. The LLSs and SLLSs with no O VI absorption have properties consistent
with those seen in cosmological simulations tracing cold streams feeding
galaxies. When the highly ionized (Si IV and O VI) gas is taken into account,
we determine that the {\tau}LL > 1 absorbers could contain as much as 3-14% of
the cosmic baryon budget at z~2-3, only second to the Ly{\alpha} forest. We
conservatively show that 5-20% of the metals ever produced at z~2-3 are in form
of highly ionized metals ejected in the CGM of galaxies.

alternative scenarios for the cosmic ray escape from the GRBs, i.e., that
cosmic rays can leak from the sources. We find that the dip model, which
describes the ankle in UHECR observations by the pair production dip, is
strongly disfavored in combination with the internal shock model because a)
unrealistically high baryonic loadings (energy in protons versus energy in
electrons/gamma-rays) are needed for the individual GRBs and b) the prompt
neutrino flux easily overshoots the corresponding neutrino bound. On the other
hand, GRBs may account for the UHECRs in the ankle transition model if cosmic

reaching maximum velocities at 1"" (410 pc) from the center. Interestingly, HI
observations done with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array show that the
absorption against the central continuum has the exact same velocity range as
the CO in emission. This strongly suggests that the absorbing HI also lies
within 1"" from the center, is mixed in and corotates with the molecular gas. A
comparison of HI absorption profiles taken at different resolutions (5""-45"")
shows that the spectra at lower resolutions are less deep at the systemic
velocity. This provides evidence for HI emission in the larger beams, covering
the region from 1 kpc to 9 kpc from the center. The central rapidly rotating
disk was likely formed either during the merger or from fall-back material.
Lastly, the radio continuum flux of the central source at mm wavelengths

Ophiuchus) recently obtained on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT).
Our sample consists of central cluster galaxies (CCGs) with previously-observed
H\alpha-filaments, and have existing data from the X-ray to radio wavelength
regimes available. Here, we present the detailed optical data over a broad
wavelength range to probe the spatially-resolved kinematics and stellar
populations of the stars. We use the Pegase.HR model with the ELODIE v3.1
stellar library to determine the star formation histories of the galaxies using
full spectrum fitting. We perform single stellar population (SSP) as well as
composite stellar population (CSP) fits to account for more complex star
formation histories. Monte-Carlo simulations and \chi 2-maps are used to check
the reliability of the solutions. This, combined with the other multiwavelength
data, will form a complete view of the different phases (hot and cold gas and
stars) and how they interact in the processes of star formation and feedback
detected in central galaxies in cooling flow clusters, as well as the influence
of the host cluster. We find small, young stellar components in at least three
of the four galaxies, even though two of the three host clusters have zero
spectrally-derived mass deposition rates from X-ray observations.

observational signatures in the form of age segregation: the distribution of
the stellar properties (e.g. stellar age and/or metallicity) in the NSCs
reflect the infall history of the different clusters. The stellar populations
of clusters infalling at different times (dynamical ages), are differentially
segregated in the NSC, and are not fully mixed even after few Gyrs of
evolution. Moreover, the radial properties of stellar populations in the
progenitor cluster are mapped to their radial distribution in the final NSC,
potentially leading to efficient mass segregation in NSCs, even those where
relaxation times are longer than a Hubble time. Finally, the overall structures
of the stellar populations present non-spherical configurations and show
significant cluster to cluster population differences.

Global-scale dynamo action is believed to generate large-scale magnetic
structures in the deep solar interior through the interplay of convection,
rotation, and shear. Portions of these large-scale magnetic structures are then
believed to rise through the convective layer, forming magnetic loops which
then pierce the photosphere as sunspot pairs. Previous global simulations of 3D
MHD convection in rotating spherical shells have demonstrated mechanisms
whereby large-scale magnetic wreaths can be generated in the bulk of the
convection zone. Our recent simulations have achieved sufficiently high levels
of turbulence to permit portions of these wreaths to become magnetically
buoyant and rise through the simulated convective layer through a combination
of magnetic buoyancy and advection by convective giant cells. These buoyant
magnetic loops are created in the bulk of the convective layer as strong
Lorentz force feedback in the cores of the magnetic wreaths dampen small-scale
convective motions, permitting the amplification of local magnetic energies to
over 100 times the local kinetic energy. While the magnetic wreaths are largely
generated the shearing of axisymmetric poloidal magnetic fields by axisymmetric
rotational shear (the $\Omega$-effect), the loops are amplified to their peak
field strengths before beginning to rise by non-axisymmetric processes. This
further extends and enhances a new paradigm for the generation of emergent
magnetic flux bundles, which we term turbulence-enabled magnetic buoyancy.

first-order electroweak phase transition generically predict significant
deviations of the Higgs couplings to gluons, photons, and Z bosons from their
SM values. Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC
and at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of
the phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus
on the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the
first-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with
various SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current
LHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the
possibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet,
or larger, representation of the SU(3)_c. Future LHC experiments (including
HL-LHC) will be able to definitively probe the case when the new scalar is a
color triplet. If the new scalar is not colored, an electron-positron Higgs
factory, such as the proposed ILC or TLEP, would be required to test the nature
of the phase transition. The extremely precise measurement of the
Higgsstrahlung cross section possible at such machines will allow for a
comprehensive and definitive probe of the possibility of a first-order
electroweak phase transition in all models we considered, including the case
when the new scalar is a pure gauge singlet.

associated with the ejection of powerful, relativistically-moving jets. The
mechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the
angular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the
disc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between
these possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due
to the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been
suggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to
whether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform
continuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the
extragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find
that, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at
3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5
GHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source
sits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate
that spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable
exceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very
fast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting
prograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially
retrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although
theoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that
retrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for
certain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of
studying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the
physics of jet launching.

Fe/Ni ratio, so the 60Fe-60Ni decay system (t1/2=2.62 Myr) is well suited to
establish the timescale of core formation in this object. We report new
measurements of 60Ni/58Ni ratios in bulk SNC/martian

{\epsilon}60Ni values between SNC meteorites and the building blocks of Mars
assumed to be chondritic (55 % ordinary chondrites +45% enstatite chondrites)
is +0.028+/-0.023 (95% confidence interval). Using a model of growth of
planetary embryo, this translates into a time for Mars to have reached ~44 % of
its present size of 1.9(-0.8)(+1.7) Myr with a strict lower limit of 1.2 Myr
after solar system formation, which agrees with a previous estimate based on
182Hf-182W systematics. The presence of Mars when planetesimals were still
being formed may have influenced the formation of chondrules through bow shocks

assessing the suitability of materials for use in production processes. A
recently published round-robin study that circulated the same samples to
several alpha counting centers showed wide center-to-center variations in
measured alpha emissivity. A separate analysis of these results hypothesized
that much of the variation might arise from differences in sample-to-entrance
window separations. XIA recently introduced an ultra low background counter,
the UltraLo-1800 (UltraLo), that operates in a fundamentally different manner
from the proportional counters used at most of the centers in the original
study. In particular, by placing the sample within the counting volume, it
eliminates the sample-to-entrance window separation issue noted above, and so
offers an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In this work we briefly review
how the UltraLo operates and describe a new round-robin study conducted
entirely on UltraLo instruments using a set of standard samples that included
two samples used in the original study. This study shows that, for LA (Low
Alpha between 2 and 50 alpha/khr-cm$^2$) sample measurements, the only
remaining site-to-site variations were due to counting statistics. Variations
in ULA (Ultra-Low Alpha < 2 alpha/khr-cm$^2$) sample measurements were reduced
three-fold, compared to the earlier study, with the measurements suggesting
that residual activity variations now primarily arise from site-to-site
differences in the cosmogenic background.

and the far-UV domain. A fraction of their radiation can be reprocessed into
the thermal nebular emission, seen in the spectrum from the near-UV to longer
wavelengths. In the case of symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) a strong
contribution from their cool giants is indicated in the optical/near-IR. In
this paper I introduce a method of multiwavelength modelling the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of SSSs from the supersoft X-rays to the near-IR with
the aim to determine the physical parameters of their composite spectra. The
method is demonstrated on two extragalactic SSSs, the SyXB RX J0059.1-7505 (LIN
358) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), RX J0439.8-6809 in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and two Galactic SSSs, the classical nova RX
J2030.5+5237 (V1974 Cyg) during its supersoft phase and the classical symbiotic
star RX J1601.6+6648 (AG Dra) during its quiescent phase. The multiwavelength
approach overcomes the problem of the mutual dependence between the
temperature, luminosity and amount of absorption, which appears when only the
X-ray data are fitted.Thus, the method provides an unambiguous solution. It was
found that selection of the model (a blackbody or an atmospheric model) is not
of crucial importance in fitting the global X-ray/IR SED. The multiwavelength
modelling of the SED of SSSs is essential in determining their physical
parameters.

calculus. The advent of cirquent calculus arose from the need for a deductive
system with a more explicit ability to reason about resources. Unlike the more
traditional proof-theoretic approaches that manipulate tree-like objects
(formulas, sequents, etc.), cirquent calculus is based on circuit-style
structures called cirquents, in which different ""peer"" (sibling, cousin, etc.)
substructures may share components. It is this resource sharing mechanism to
which cirquent calculus owes its novelty (and its virtues). From its inception,
cirquent calculus has been paired with an abstract resource semantics. This
semantics allows for reasoning about the interaction between a resource
provider and a resource user, where resources are understood in the their most
general and intuitive sense. Interpreting resources in a more restricted
computational sense has made cirquent calculus instrumental in axiomatizing
various fundamental fragments of Computability Logic, a formal theory of
(interactive) computability. The so-called ""classical"" rules of cirquent
calculus, in the absence of the particularly troublesome contraction rule,
produce a sound and complete system CL5 for Computability Logic. In this paper,
we investigate the computational complexity of CL5, showing it is
$\Sigma_2^p$-complete. We also show that CL5 without the duplication rule has
polynomial size proofs and is NP-complete.

report here a comparative study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for
the Rydberg CPHASE gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate
fidelity with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse
sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations. In
contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of numerical
pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance window. The
resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation patterns and their
spectra contain only one additional frequency beyond the basic resonant Rydberg
gate frequencies. Pulses of such low complexity should be experimentally

are highly desirable for development of millimeter and sub-millimeter radio
astronomy. Multimoded bolometers provide a unique solution to achieve such
sensitivity, for which hundreds of single-mode sensors would otherwise be
required. The primary concern in employing such multimoded sensors for
polarimetery is the control of the polarization systematics. In this paper, we
examine the angular- and polarization- dependent absorption pattern of a thin
resistive grid or membrane, which models an absorber used for a multimoded
bolometer. The result shows that a freestanding thin resistive absorber with a
surface resistivity of \eta/2, where \eta\ is the impedance of free space,
attains a beam pattern with equal E- and H-plane responses, leading to zero
cross polarization. For a resistive-grid absorber, the condition is met when a
pair of grids is positioned orthogonal to each other and both have a
resistivity of \eta/2. When a reflective backshort termination is employed to
improve absorption efficiency, the cross-polar level can be suppressed below
-30 dB if acceptance angle of the sensor is limited to <60degrees. The small
cross-polar systematics have even-parity patterns and do not contaminate the
measurements of odd-parity polarization patterns, for which many of recent
instruments for cosmic microwave background are designed. Underlying symmetry
that suppresses these cross-polar systematics is discussed in detail. The
estimates and formalism provided in this paper offer key tools in the design
consideration of the instruments using the multimoded polarimeters.

which it does not; (3) they assume the disk is a single structure with chemical
properties that are a smooth function of the distance to the galactic center,

formation of these structures. I discuss these various issues, and, commenting
on Snaith et al. (2014), how a closed box model offers an interesting
approximation to the galactic chemical evolution, by providing the conditions

Large-scale structure surveys, such as the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS), have collected quasar (QSO) spectra that enable the
reconstruction of HI density fluctuations. The data fall on a collection of
lines defined by the lines-of-sight (LOS) of the QSO, and a major issue with
producing a 3D reconstruction is determining how to model the regions between
the LOS. We present a method that produces a 3D map of this relatively
uncharted portion of the Universe by employing local polynomial smoothing, a
nonparametric methodology. The performance of the method is analyzed on
simulated data that mimics the varying number of LOS expected in real data, and
then is applied to a sample region selected from BOSS. Evaluation of the
reconstruction is assessed by considering various features of the predicted 3D
maps including visual comparison of slices, PDFs, counts of local minima and
maxima, and standardized correlation functions. This 3D reconstruction allows
for an initial investigation of the topology of this portion of the Universe

radio-continuum and has a size of $\sim$74 pc $\times$ 57 pc at the LMC
distance. The X-ray emission exhibits a faint soft shell morphology with
Fe-rich gas in its interior $-$ indicative of a Type Ia origin. The remnant
appears to be mostly dissipated at higher radio-continuum frequencies leaving
only the south-eastern limb fully detectable while in the optical it is the
western side of the SNR shell that is clearly detected. The best-fit
temperature to the shell X-ray emission ($kT = 0.41^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ keV) is

an Fe mass of 0.5-1.8$~M_{\odot}$ in the interior of the remnant, both of which
are consistent with the Type Ia scenario. We find an equipartition magnetic

avoid returning back to previously visited sites. We parameterise the strength

find that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce

that computes the smallest partial matrix. We prove a bijection between the

establishing the equivalence of these two models and their second-order cone

are equivalent and one should always solve the second-order cone relaxation.
For mesh networks, the semidefinite relaxation is tighter than the second-order
cone relaxation but requires a heavier computational effort, and the chordal
relaxation strikes a good balance. Simulations are used to illustrate these
results.

fuzzy sets to represent the fuzzy terms in the technical trading rules; second,
we translate each technical trading heuristic into a group of fuzzy IF-THEN

system; and finally, the linear combination of these fuzzy systems is used as
the excess demand function in the price dynamic equation. We transform a wide
variety of technical trading rules into fuzzy systems, including moving average
rules, support and resistance rules, trend line rules, big buyer, big seller

rules. Simulation results show that the price dynamics driven by these
technical trading rules are complex and chaotic, and some common phenomena in
real stock prices such as jumps, trending and self-fulfilling appear naturally.

converges to some constant very quickly at the rate of the Lyapunov exponent.

Here we explore the planet's circulation as a function of atmospheric
metallicity and atmospheric composition, modeling atmospheres with a low
mean-molecular weight (i.e., H2-dominated) and a high mean-molecular weight
(i.e. water- and CO2-dominated). We find that atmospheres with a low
mean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressures
above the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. For these
atmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasing
metallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperature
variations and hence stronger superrotation. In comparison, atmospheres with a
high mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-pole
temperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, but
differences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jet
structure. The circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated by
equatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a CO2-dominated atmosphere
is instead dominated by high-latitude jets. By comparing emergent flux spectra
and lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show that
observations in emission can break the degeneracy in determining the
atmospheric composition of GJ 1214b. The variation in opacity with wavelength
for the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations within water
bands and small phase variations outside of water bands. The 50x solar
atmosphere, however, yields small variations within water bands and large phase
variations at other characteristic wavelengths. These observations would be
much less sensitive to clouds, condensates, and hazes than transit
observations.

separated as the simulation proceeds. The He-He unit undergoes translation,
rotation and vibration inside the cavity of B12N12 and B16N16 cages. Electron
density analysis (Atoms-in-Molecule (AIM)) shows that there is some degree of
covalent character in He-He bond (Wc type) of He2@B12N12. In case of
He2@B16N16, the He-He interaction is mostly of noncovalent type (Wn). In many
cases, especially for the heavier Ng atoms the Ng-N/B bonds are found to be of
covalent type or at least having some degree of covalent character. But Wiberg
bond indices show zero bond order in He-He bond and very low bond order in
cases of Ng-N/B bonds. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) provides further
insights into the bonding among the Ng atoms and the cage. The change in charge
distribution, radius, hardness, electrophilicity and polarizability implies
that they possess different properties and reactivity from their parent
moieties. The HOMO energies of He2 units in He2@B12N12 and He2@B16N16 are
significantly higher than that in free He atoms. Their kinetic stability and
different calculated properties imply that the He-He interaction and Ng-N/B

comparable to a control room, which is a well known term in the mechanical
production domain. One crucial task of an SPCC is the systematic visualization
of measurement data in order to provide context-, purpose-, and role-oriented
information for all stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance
managers, developers) during the execution of a software development project.
The article will present an overview of SPCC concepts, a concrete instantiation
that supports goal-oriented data visualization, as well as examples and
experiences from practical applications.

of a hypergraph $H$, is an assignment of colours to its vertices such that no
edge of $H$ contains less than $\alpha$ or more than $\beta$ vertices with
different colours. This notion, introduced by B{\'u}jtas and Tuza, generalises
both classical hypergraph colourings and the more general Voloshin colourings
of hypergraphs. In fact, for $r$-uniform hypergraphs, classical colourings
correspond to $(2,r)$-colourings while an important instance of Voloshin
colourings of $r$-uniform hypergraphs gives $(2, r-1)$-colourings. One
intriguing aspect of all these colourings, not present in classical colourings,
is that $H$ can have gaps in its $(\alpha,\beta)$-spectrum, that is, for $k_1 <
k_2 < k_3$, $H$ would be $(\alpha,\beta)$-colourable using $k_1$ and using
$k_3$ colours, but not using $k_2$ colours.
  In an earlier paper, the first two authors introduced, for $\sigma$ a
partition of $r$, a very versatile type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which they
called $\sigma$-hypergraphs. They showed that, by simple manipulation of the
parameters of a $\sigma$-hypergraph $H$, one can obtain families of hypergraphs
which have $(2,r-1)$-colourings exhibiting various interesting chromatic
properties. They also showed that, if the smallest part of $\sigma$ is at least
2, then $H$ will never have a gap in its $(2,r-1)$-spectrum but, quite
surprisingly, they found examples where gaps re-appear when $\alpha=\beta=2$.
  In this paper we extend many of the results of the first two authors to more
general $(\alpha,\beta)$-colourings, and we study the phenomenon of the
disappearanace and re-appearance of gaps and show that it is not just the
behaviour of a particular example but we place it within the context of a more
general study of constrained colourings of $\sigma$-hypergraphs.

{\AA} steps. We did not observe usual optic and acoustic modes; instead we had
two broad overlapped peaks for the films ranged from 6 {\AA} to 40 {\AA}. One
interesting result was the high anisotropic resonance field values for these
films. Exchange coupling between ferromagnetic layers causes shift on resonance
field values but these shifts in our samples were much larger than expected.
This large anisotropic behavior is not clear at the moment. Our theoretical
model was not able to determine a value for the exchange coupling parameter.
One reason can be the close thickness values for Co sublayers. The other reason
can be the Ti non-magnetic layer. If titanium did not grow layer by layer on
cobalt, the cobalt ferromagnetic layers may behave as a single layer. As a
result one cannot observe exchange interaction between ferromagnetic layers

stellar kinematics and metallicities mainly come from relatively high-latitude
fields (|b|>4) where a complex mix of stellar population is seen. We aim here
to constrain the formation history of the Galactic bar by studying the radial
velocity and metallicity distributions of stars in-situ (|b|<1). We observed
red clump stars in four fields along the bar's major axis (l=10,6,-6 and b=0
plus a field at l=0,b=1) with low-resolution spectroscopy from VLT/FLAMES,
observing around the CaII triplet. We developed robust methods for extracting
radial velocity and metallicity estimates from these low signal-to-noise
spectra. We derived distance probability distributions using Bayesian methods
rigorously handling the extinction law. We present radial velocities and
metallicity distributions, as well as radial velocity trends with distance. We
observe an increase in the radial velocity dispersion near the Galactic plane.
We detect the streaming motion of the stars induced by the bar in fields at
l=+/-6, the highest velocity components of this bar stream being metal-rich
([Fe/H]~0.2 dex). Our data is consistent with a bar inclined at 26+/-3 from the

stars, in particular in the field at l=0,b=1. We confirm the flattening of the
metallicity gradient along the minor axis when getting closer to the plane,
with a hint that it could actually be inverted. Our stellar kinematics
corresponds to the expected behaviour of a bar issued from the secular
evolution of the Galactic disc. The mix of several populations, seen further
away from the plane, is also seen in the bar in-situ since our metallicity
distributions highlight a different spatial distribution between metal-poor and
metal-rich stars, the more metal-poor stars being more centrally concentrated.

efficient memetic algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm
(PSO) and Pattern Search (PS). In the proposed memetic algorithm, PSO is
responsible for exploration of the search space and the detection of the
potential regions with optimum solutions, while pattern search (PS) is used to
produce an effective exploitation on the potential regions obtained by PSO.
Moreover, a novel probabilistic selection strategy is proposed to select the
appropriate individuals among the current population to undergo local
refinement, keeping a well balance between exploration and exploitation.
Experimental results confirm that the local refinement with PS and our proposed
selection strategy are effective, and finally demonstrate effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed PSO-PS based MA for SVMs parameters optimization.

rare class of asteroids exhibiting anomalous polarimetric properties. Their
very distinctive feature is that they show negative polarization at relatively
large phase-angles, where all 'normal' asteroids show positive polarization.
The origin of the Barbarian phenomenon is unclear, but it seems to be
correlated with the presence of anomalous abundances of spinel, a mineral
usually associated with the so-called Calcium Aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs)
on meteorites. Since CAIs are samples of the oldest solid matter identified in
our solar system, Barbarians are very interesting targets for investigations.
Inspired by the fact that some of the few known Barbarians are members of, or
very close to the dynamical family of Watsonia, we have checked whether this
family is a major repository of Barbarians, in order to obtain some hints about
their possible collisional origin. We have measured the linear polarization of
a sample of nine asteroids which are members of the Watsonia family within the
phase-angle range 17-21 DEG. We found that seven of them exhibit the peculiar
Barbarian polarization signature, and we conclude that the Watsonia family is a
repository of Barbarian asteroids. The new Barbarians identified in our
analysis will be important to confirm the possible link between the Barbarian

imaging detection of planetary companions. For such studies, it is crucial to
evaluate the distance to group members in order to access their physical
properties. Membership of several stars is strongly debated and age estimates
vary from one author to another with doubts about coevality. We revisit the
kinematic properties of the TWA in light of new trigonometric parallaxes and
proper motions to derive the dynamical age of the association and physical
parameters of kinematic members. Using observations performed with the NTT/ESO
telescope we measured trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for 13 stars
in TWA. With the convergent point method we identify a co-moving group with 31
TWA stars. We deduce kinematic distances for 7 members of the moving group that
lack trigonometric parallaxes. A traceback strategy is applied to the stellar
space motions of a selection of 16 of the co-moving objects with accurate and
reliable data yielding a dynamical age for the association of t = 7.5 +/- 0.7
Myr. Using our new parallaxes and photometry available in the literature we
derive stellar ages and masses from theoretical evolutionary models. With new
parallax and proper motion measurements from this work and current astrometric
catalogs we provide an improved and accurate database for TWA stars to be used
in kinematical analysis. We conclude that the dynamical age obtained via
traceback strategy is consistent with previous age estimates for the TWA, and
is also compatible with the average ages derived in the present paper from
evolutionary models for pre-main sequence stars.

sensitivity is the efficiency with which the quanta of interest couple to the
detected quasiparticles. As low temperature superconducting resonators,
thin-films are attractive candidates for producing quantum-sensitive arrayable
sensors and the readout uses an additional microwave probe. We have calculated
the quasiparticle generation efficiency eta_s for low energy photons in a
representative, clean thin-film superconductor (Al) operating well-below its
superconductingtransition temperature as a function of film thickness, within
the framework of the coupled kineticequations described by Chang and
Scalapino.[J. J. Chang and D. J. Scalapino, J. Low Temp. Phys. 31, 1 (1978)].
We have also included the effect of a lower frequency probe. We show that
phonon loss from the thin-film reduces eta_s by as much as 40% compared to
earlier models that considered relatively thick films or infinite volumes. We
also show that the presence of the probe and signal enhances the generation
efficiency slightly. We conclude that the ultimate limiting noise equivalent
power of this class of detector is determined by the thin-film geometry.

particular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive
information, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient
radio frequency energy. We devise novel online scheduling schemes in which the
tradeoff between the users' ergodic rates and their average amount of harvested
energy can be controlled. In particular, we modify the well-known maximum
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum normalized-SNR (N-SNR) schedulers by
scheduling the user whose SNR/N-SNR has a certain ascending order (selection
order) rather than the maximum one. We refer to these new schemes as
order-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling and show that the lower the selection order,
the higher the average amount of harvested energy in the system at the expense
of a reduced ergodic sum rate. The order-based N-SNR scheduling scheme provides
proportional fairness among the users in terms of both the ergodic achievable
rate and the average harvested energy. Furthermore, we propose an order-based
equal throughput (ET) fair scheduler, which schedules the user having the
minimum moving average throughput out of the users whose N-SNR orders fall into
a given set of allowed orders. We show that this scheme provides the users with
proportionally fair average harvested energies. In this context, we also derive
feasibility conditions for achieving ET with the order-based ET scheduler.
Using the theory of order statistics, the average per-user harvested energy and
ergodic achievable rate of all proposed scheduling schemes are analyzed and
obtained in closed form for independent and non-identically distributed
Rayleigh, Ricean, Nakagami-m, and Weibull fading channels. Our closed-form

light-section sensor with an algorithmic pipeline. A hand-guided sensor
captures a continuous movie of 3D views while being moved around the object.
The views are automatically aligned and the acquired 3D model is displayed in
real time. In contrast to most existing sensors no bandwidth is wasted for
spatial or temporal encoding of the projected lines. Nor is an expensive color
camera necessary for 3D acquisition. The achievable measurement uncertainty and
lateral resolution of the generated 3D data is merely limited by physics. An
alternating projection of vertical and horizontal lines guarantees the
existence of corresponding points in successive 3D views. This enables a
precise registration without surface interpolation. For registration, a variant
of the iterative closest point algorithm - adapted to the specific nature of
our 3D views - is introduced. Furthermore, data reduction and smoothing without
losing lateral resolution as well as the acquisition and mapping of a color

very confident and valuable input, so it is of extreme importance to extract as
many resonance pole parameters from them as possible. In addition, the
troubling fact is that BW parameters given in PDG have been obtained from KH80
solution, while pole parameters have been obtained from KA84 version of KH
solution. To remedy this, we have used newly developed Laurent+Pietarinen
expansion method [6,7] for obtaining pole positions for all partial waves for
KH80 and KA84 solutions, compared them, and shown that the differences in pole
parameters are, with very few discussed exceptions, negligible for all partial
waves. We finally give a full set of pole parameters for both solutions for all
partial waves; results which are until now unpublished.

requires large initial values of the roll parameter is then proposed. To get

sources decreases with increasing Class and is definitely higher in Perseus and
Ophiuchus than in Chamaeleon and Lupus. According to the paradigm Class <=>
Evolution, the photometric variability can be considered to be a feature more
pronounced in less evolved protostars, and, as such, related to accretion
processes. Moreover, our statistical findings agree with the current knowledge
of the star formation activity in different regions. The 34 selected variables
were further investigated for similarities with known young eruptive variables,
namely the EXors. In particular we analyzed : (1) the shape of the spectral
energy distribution (SED); (2) the IR excess over the stellar photosphere; (3)
magnitude versus color variations; and (4) output parameters of model fitting.
This first systematic search for EXors ends up with 11 bona fide candidates
that can be considered as suitable targets for monitoring or future
investigations.

130427A under the hypothesis that the GRB central engine is an
accretion-powered magnetar. In this framework, initially proposed to explain
GRBs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion of
matter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to the
accretion rate. The emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces are
able to pause accretion. We show that the X-ray and optical afterglow is well
explained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contribution
from the spin-down of the magnetar. Our modelling does not require any
contribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglow
light curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. We
derive the magnetic field ($B\sim 10^{16}$ G) and the spin period ($P\sim 20$
ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimum
luminosity for accretion. This minimum luminosity results well below the prompt
emission luminosity of GRB 130427A, providing a strong consistency check for
the scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuous
accretion onto the magnetar. This is in agreement with the relatively long spin
period of the magnetar. GRB 130427A was a well monitored GRB showing a very
standard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that an
accretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long GRBs.

out that energy-aware strategies to minimize network energy consumption must
not undermine the normal network operation. In particular, two very important
issues that may limit the application of green networking techniques concern,
respectively, network survivability, i.e. the network capability to react to
device failures, and robustness to traffic variations. We propose novel
modelling techniques to minimize the daily energy consumption of IP networks,
while explicitly guaranteeing, in addition to typical QoS requirements, both
network survivability and robustness to traffic variations. The impact of such
limitations on final network consumption is exhaustively investigated. Daily
traffic variations are modelled by dividing a single day into multiple time
intervals (multi-period problem), and network consumption is reduced by putting
to sleep idle line cards and chassis. To preserve network resiliency we
consider two different protection schemes, i.e. dedicated and shared
protection, according to which a backup path is assigned to each demand and a
certain amount of spare capacity has to be available on each link. Robustness
to traffic variations is provided by means of a specific modelling framework
that allows to tune the conservatism degree of the solutions and to take into
account load variations of different magnitude. Furthermore, we impose some
inter-period constraints necessary to guarantee network stability and preserve
the device lifetime. Both exact and heuristic methods are proposed.
Experimentations carried out with realistic networks operated with flow-based
routing protocols (i.e. MPLS) show that significant savings, up to 30%, can be
achieved also when both survivability and robustness are fully guaranteed.

observed in a number of local tadpole galaxies by Sanchez Almeida et al. (2013)
and interpreted as showing early stages of assembling in disk galaxies, with
the star formation sustained by external metal-poor gas accretion. The
agreement with tadpoles has several implications: (1) it proves that galaxies
other than the local tadpoles present the same unusual metallicity pattern. (2)
Our metallicity inhomogeneities were inferred using the direct method, thus
discarding systematic errors usually attributed to other methods. (3) Taken
together with the tadpole data, our findings suggest a threshold around one
tenth the solar value for the metallicity drops to show up. Although galaxies
with clear metallicity drops are rare, the physical mechanism responsible for
them may sustain a significant part of the star-formation activity in the local
Universe. We argue that the star-formation dependence of the mass-metallicity

transition between two regimes of violation of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem in the nonequilibrium stationary state: a regime of weak violation
where the stationary fluctuation-dissipation ratio is finite, when the
asymmetry parameter is less than a threshold value, and a regime of strong

rates surface densities are estimated from the 12.8 $\mu m$ [Ne{\sc ii}] line
strengths leading to values close to 0.1M$_\odot\,\,{\rm yr}^{-1}\,\,{\rm

of PAH molecules by older stellar populations. T-ReCS high spatial resolution
data reveal silicate absorption at $\lambda$ 9.7 $\mu m$ in the central tens of
parsecs of the Seyfert 2 NGC 1386, and silicate emission in the Seyfert 1
galaxy NGC 7213. In the case of NGC 1386 this feature is confined to the inner
20 pc, implying that the silicate might be linked to the putative dusty torus.

torus physical properties for both galaxies, finding line of sight inclinations
consistent with the AGN unified model.

interaction dominated by vector meson exchange, and (iii) the $\omega \to K
\bar K$ mechanism in matter. The $\omega$ meson develops an important width in
matter, coming from the dominant $\omega \to \rho\pi$ decay mode, with a value
of $121 \pm 10$ MeV at normal nuclear matter density for an $\omega$ at rest.
At finite momentum, the width of the $\omega$ meson increases moderately with
values of 200 MeV at 600 MeV/c.

'Earthshine' is the dim light seen on the otherwise dark side of the
Moon, particularly when it is close to new. 'Earthlight', or reflected sunlight
from the Earth, is the source of Earthshine. Using B and V band CCD images of
both the dark and bright side of the Moon, we aim to estimate the Johnson
photometry B-V colour of the Earthshine for the first time since the late
1960s. From these measurements we are also able to quantify the colour of
Earthlight. Methods. We present images of the Moon taken with a small refractor
in Hawaii, in B and V bands and taken under favourable conditions so that
scattered light in both bands almost completely cancels, yielding a map of the
surface in B-V colour. Co-addition of 100 such images taken in rapid succession
substantially improves the signal to noise ratio, and several sources of
photometric bias are eliminated by use of relative methods. Results. The
earthlit dark side of the Moon is observed to be 0.150 +/- 0.005 mag bluer in
B-V than the sunlit bright side, in good agreement with the only known previous
measurement of this quantity from 1967. Arguing on the basis of the change in B
- V for sunlight reflected once o? the Moon, we derive a colour for earthlight
of B-V = 0.44+/-0.02 mag (without applying a small, uncertain, phase-dependent
reddening correction). The absence of a colour-gradient in the B-V image
implies that the scattering properties of the atmosphere+optical system are
almost exactly matched in the two wavelength bands, the consequences of which

signed networks. The topology is allowed to co-evolve with relational signs as
well as with agent strategies. We introduce a strategy that is conditional on
the emotional content embedded in network signs. We show that this strategy
acts as a catalyst and creates favorable conditions for the spread of
unconditional cooperation. In line with the literature, we found evidence that
the evolution of cooperation most likely occurs in networks with relatively
high chances of rewiring and with low likelihood of strategy adoption. While a
low likelihood of rewiring enhances cooperation, a very high likelihood seems
to limit its diffusion. Furthermore, unlike in non-signed networks, cooperation
becomes more prevalent in denser topologies.

  survival data grouped in clusters of variable size",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the analysis of clustered survival data, two different types of models
that take the association into account, are commonly used: frailty models and
copula models. Frailty models assume that conditional on a frailty term for
each cluster, the hazard functions of individuals within that cluster are
independent. These unknown frailty terms with their imposed distribution are
used to express the association between the different individuals in a cluster.
Copula models on the other hand assume that the joint survival function of the
individuals within a cluster is given by a copula function, evaluated in the
marginal survival function of each individual. It is the copula function which
describes the association between the lifetimes within a cluster. A major
disadvantage of the present copula models over the frailty models is that the
size of the different clusters must be small and equal in order to set up
manageable estimation procedures for the different model parameters. We
describe in this manuscript a copula model for clustered survival data where
the clusters are allowed to be moderate to large and varying in size by
considering the class of Archimedean copulas with completely monotone
generator. We develop both one- and two-stage estimators for the different
copula parameters. Furthermore we show the consistency and asymptotic normality
of these estimators. Finally, we perform a simulation study to investigate the
finite sample properties of the estimators. We illustrate the method on a data
set containing the time to first insemination in cows, with cows clustered in
herds.

STM-excited SPP-wave is incident on a pair of 1 $\mu$m diameter holes in the

excitations in MnSi is studied in detail using inelastic light scattering. The
pure symmetry components of the electronic response are derived from the
polarization dependent spectra. The $E$ and $T_2$ responses agree by and large
with longitudinal and optical transport data. However, an anomaly is observed
right above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm C}=29\,{\rm K}$ that is
associated with the fluctuations that drive the transition into the
helimagnetic phase first order. The $T_1$ spectra, reflecting mostly chiral
spin excitations, have a temperature dependence similar to that of the $E$ and
$T_2$ symmetries. The response in the fully symmetric $A$ representation has a
considerably weaker temperature dependence than that in the other symmetries.
All nine Raman active phonon lines can be resolved at low temperature. The
positions and line widths of the strongest four lines in $E$ and $T_2$ symmetry
are analyzed in the temperature range $4<T<310\,{\rm K}$. Above $50\,{\rm K}$,
the temperature dependence is found to be conventional and given by anharmonic
phonon decay and the lattice expansion. Distinct anomalies are observed in the
range of the helimagnetic transition and in the ordered phase. Applying a
magnetic field of $4\,{\rm T}$, well above the critical field, removes all
anomalies and restores a conventional behavior highlighting the relationship
between the anomalies and magnetism. The anomaly directly above $T_{\rm C}$ in
the fluctuation range goes along with an anomaly in the thermal expansion.
While the lattice constant changes continuously and has only a kink at $T_{\rm
C}$, all optical phonons soften abruptly suggesting a direct microscopic
coupling between spin order and optical phonons rather than a reaction to
magnetostriction effects.

importance for advancing ferroelectric applications. In this Letter, we show
that the topology of the multidomain structure can have an intrinsic impact on
the degree of switchable polarization. Using a combination of polarization
hysteresis measurements and piezoresponse force microscopy on a uniaxial
organic ferroelectric, alpha-6,6'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridinium chloranilate, we
found that the head-to-head (or tail-to-tail) charged domain walls are strongly
pinned and thus impede the switching process; in contrast, if the charged
domain walls are replaced with electrically neutral antiparallel domain walls,
bulk polarization switching is achieved. Our findings suggest that manipulation
of the multidomain topology can potentially control the switchable
polarization.

of the glass transition differs from the well-studied regular first order and
second order (or continuous) phase transitions. Just as is the case in the
latter two classes of phase transitions, the RFOT also exhibits universal
features. Here, we discuss these features and compare and contrast the RFOT
with other types of transitions with an emphasis on the structural glass
transition problem. An important feature of the complete RFOT theory is that it
has at least two distinct transition temperatures, one of which is a dynamical
(avoided) transition signaling loss of effective ergodicity, and the other is
an equilibrium ideal glass transition. Particular attention is paid to the
coherence, or correlation, length associated with these transitions in the
RFOT. We also derive universal scaling relations for several experimentally
measurable quantities that are valid near the ideal glass transition. In
particular, activated scaling ideas are used to obtain a scaling equation for
the non-linear structural glass susceptibility as the ideal glass transition is
approached. Important finite corrections to the ideal glass transition
temperature are also discussed. Our work provides additional criteria for
assessing the validity of RFOT theory of the liquid to glass transition, and
provides a firm theoretical foundation for analyzing experimental data on the
temperature dependence of the relaxation times.

predictions of the particle drag by direct numerical simulation. From these
predictions a closure law $F(Re, {\varphi})$ of the drag force relationship to
the bed density ${\varphi}$ and the particle Reynolds number $Re$ is derived.
The present study includes densities ${\varphi}$ ranging from $0.01$ to $0.35$
with Re ranging up to $300$, that is compiled into a single drag correlation
valid for the whole range. The corelation has a more compact expression
compared to others previously reported in literature. At low particle
densities, the new correlation is close to the widely used Wen & Yu -
correlation. Recently, there has been reported a discrepancy between results
obtained using different numerical methods, namely the comprehensive lattice
Boltzmann study of Beetstra et al. (2007) and the predictions based on an

move to the issue of ""origin of mass"" and Brown-RHo scaling: a number of

  We argue that while at $T=0$ the main contribution to the effective quark
mass is chirally odd $m_{\snchi}$, near $T_c$ it rotates to chirally-even
component $m_\chi$, because ""infinite clusters"" of topological solitons gets
split into finite ones. Recent progress in understanding of topology require
introduction of nonzero holonomy $<A_0>\neq 0$, which splits instantons into
$N_c$ (anti)selfdual ""instanton-dyons"". Qualitative progress, as well as first

instanton-dyons generates holonomy potential with a minimum at confining value,

superior field confinement. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, enhanced
detection of single-nanoparticle induced mode-splitting in a silica WGMR via
Raman-gain assisted loss-compensation and WGM Raman lasing. Notably, we
detected and counted individual dielectric nanoparticles down to a record low
radius of 10 nm by monitoring a beatnote signal generated when split Raman
lasing lines are heterodyne-mixed at a photodetector. This dopant-free scheme
retains the inherited biocompatibility of silica, and could find widespread use
for sensing in biological media. It also opens the possibility of using
intrinsic Raman or parametric gain in other systems, where dissipation hinders
the progress of the field and limits applications.

shift, as the evolution in one its paramaters crosses a threshold value.
Assimilation of such a transition with a bifurcation has allowed to identify so
called ""early warning signals"", at the level of the time series generated by
the system underscope. The literature in early warning detection methods is
currently expanding and their potential for practical applicability is being
discussed in different contexts. In this work, we elaborate on the use of the
variance of a system variable, which constitutes the simplest early warning
indicator, to gain control on the long-term dynamics of the system, while
extending an exploitation phase. In particular, we address the cases of the
cusp and Hopf normal forms, as prototypical examples of bistability and
oscillations. Our results provide insights on the interplay between the
time-scale for the system observation, the degree of sensitivity of the control
feedback and the intensity of the random perturbations, in shaping the
long-term control efficiency.

the pixel-by-pixel scatter is ~7%. The scatter increases towards the edges of

exhibit macroscopic properties that are very similar to those of inorganic

nature of charge transport, minimizing the density of trap states (trap DOS) is
crucial to elucidate the intrinsic transport mechanism.
  We explore the limits of state-of-the-art organic crystals by measuring
single crystalline rubrene field-effect transistors that show textbook like
transfer characteristics, indicating a very low trap DOS. Particularly, the
high purity of the crystals and the very clean interface to the gate dielectric
are reflected in an unprecedentedly low subthreshold swing of 65 ${\rm mV /
decade}$, remarkably close to the fundamental limit of $58.5 {\rm mV /
decade}$.
  From the measured subthreshold behavior we have consistently quantified the
trap DOS by two different methods, yielding an exceedingly low trap density of
$D_{bulk} = 1 \times 10^{13}~{\rm cm^{-3}eV^{-1}}$ at an energy of
$\sim0.62~{\rm eV}$. These numbers correspond to one trap per eV in $10^8$
rubrene molecules. The equivalent density of traps located at the interface is
$D_{it} = 3 \times 10^{9}~{\rm cm^{-2}eV^{-1}}$ which puts them on par with the

synchronize operations on shared memory. Unfortunately, lock management can add
significant processing overhead especially for multicore deployments where
tasks on different cores convoy in queues waiting to acquire a lock.
Implementing more than one lock introduces the risk of deadlock and using
spinlocks constrains which cores a task can run on. The better alternative is
to eliminate locks and validate that real-time properties are met, which is not
directly considered in many embedded applications. Removing the locks is
non-trivial and packaging lock-free algorithms for developers reduces the
possibility of concurrency defects. This paper details how a multicore
communication API implementation is enhanced to support lock-free messaging and
the impact this has on data exchange latency between tasks. Throughput and
latency are compared on Windows and Linux between lock-based and lock-free
implementations for data exchange of messages, packets, and scalars. A model of
the lock-free exchange predicts performance at the system architecture level
and provides a stop criterion for the refactoring. The results show that
migration from single to multicore hardware architectures degrades lock-based
performance, and increases lock-free performance.

will change how people work and play, how companies use information to market
and sell their products, as well as operate their businesses. The basic shift
occurring in Web 3.0 is from information-centric to knowledge-centric patterns
of computing. Web 3.0 will enable people and machines to connect, evolve, share
and use knowledge on an unprecedented scale and in new ways that make our
experience of the Internet better. Additionally, semantic technologies have the
potential to drive significant improvements in capabilities and life cycle
economics through cost reductions, improved efficiencies, enhanced
effectiveness, and new functionalities that were not possible or economically
feasible before. In this paper we look to the semantic web and Web 3.0
technologies as enablers for the creation of value and appearance of new
business models. For that, we analyze the role and impact of Web 3.0 in
business and we identify nine potential business models, based in direct and
undirected revenue sources, which have emerged with the appearance of semantic
web technologies.

network ad hoc. Some, works attacked this problem. Among these works, we find
the modelling of the network ad hoc in the form of a graph. Thus the problem of
stability of the network ad hoc which corresponds to a problem of allocation of
frequency amounts to a problem of allocation of colors in the vertex of graph.
we present use a parameter of coloring the number of Grundy. The Grundy number
of a graph G, denoted by (G), is the largest k such that G has a greedy
k-coloring, that is a coloring with colours obtained by applying the greedy
algorithm according to some ordering of the vertices of G. In this paper, we
study the Grundy number of the lexicographic, Cartesian and direct products of
two graphs in terms of the Grundy numbers of these graphs.

use a hybrid structure of cloud computing handled by apache Hadoop where
database is implemented by HiveQL. The infrastructure divides into two parts:
locally hosted cloud which is based on Eucalyptus and the remote cloud which is
implemented on well-known Amazon Web Service (AWS). Some common problems of

(RBF-PNN), an optimization training method based on GA combined with SA is
proposed in this paper. Through building generalized Fr\'echet distance to
measure similarity between time-varying function samples, the learning problem
of radial basis centre functions and connection weights is converted into the
training on corresponding discrete sequence coefficients. Network training
objective function is constructed according to the least square error
criterion, and global optimization solving of network parameters is implemented
in feasible solution space by use of global optimization feature of GA and
probabilistic jumping property of SA . The experiment results illustrate that
the training algorithm improves the network training efficiency and stability.
