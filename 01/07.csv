field with mass dimension one, the Elko field, in the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). Due to its mass dimension, an Elko can only interact either with
Standard Model (SM) spinors and gauge fields at 1-loop order or at tree level
through a quartic interaction with the Higgs field. In this Higgs portal
scenario, the Elko is a viable candidate to a dark matter constituent which has
been shown to be compatible with relic abundance measurements from WMAP and
direct dark matter--nucleon searches. We propose a search strategy for this
dark matter candidate in the channel $pp \rightarrow l^+ l^- + \not\!\! E_T$ at
the $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV LHC. We show the LHC potential to discover the Elko
considering a triple Higgs-Elko coupling as small as $\sim 0.5$ after 1
pb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. Some phenomenological consequences of this
new particle and its collider signatures are also discussed.

theorem (Aldous, 1981;Hoover, 1979} applies and informs us that the graph is

representing the graph as a measure on $\mathbb{R}_+^2$. For the associated
definition of exchangeability in this continuous space, we rely on the
Kallenberg representation theorem (Kallenberg, 2005). We show that for certain
choices of such exchangeable random measures underlying our graph construction,
our network process is sparse with power-law degree distribution. In
particular, we build on the framework of completely random measures (CRMs) and
use the theory associated with such processes to derive important network
properties, such as an urn representation for our analysis and network
simulation. Our theoretical results are explored empirically and compared to
common network models. We then present a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for
efficient exploration of the posterior distribution and demonstrate that we are

wide-sense stationarity of the wireless channel in time and frequency. While
this approximation has some physical justification, it is only valid inside
certain time-frequency regions. This paper presents an elaborate
characterization of the non-stationarity of wireless dual-polarized channels in
time. The evaluation is based on urban macrocell measurements performed at 2.53
GHz. In order to define local quasi-stationarity (LQS) regions, i.e., regions
in which the change of certain channel statistics is deemed insignificant, we
resort to the performance degradation of selected algorithms specific to
channel estimation and beamforming. Additionally, we compare our results to
commonly used measures in the literature. We find that the polarization, the
antenna spacing, and the opening angle of the antennas into the propagation
channel can strongly influence the non-stationarity of the observed channel.
The obtained LQS regions can be of significant size, i.e., several meters, and
thus the reuse of channel statistics over large distances is meaningful (in an
average sense) for certain algorithms. Furthermore, we conclude that, from a
system perspective, a proper non-stationarity analysis should be based on the
considered algorithm.

occurs between individual residues in the protein is more driven by
computational convenience rather than fundamental protein architecture. Here we
develop a novel algorithm that defines a covariance score across two groups of
columns where each group represents a stretch of contiguous columns in the
alignment. We define a test set that consists of secondary structure elements
({\alpha}-helixes and {\beta}-strands) across more than 1,100 PFAM families.
Using these alignments to predict segments that are physically close in
structure, we show that our method substantially out-performs approaches that
aggregate the results of algorithms that operate on individual column pairs.
Our approach demonstrates that considering units of proteins beyond pairs of

because of an effect known as Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI), which trails
bright objects as the image is read out. It is often possible to correct most
of the trailing during post-processing, by moving flux back to where it
belongs. We compare several popular algorithms for this: quantifying the effect
of their physical assumptions and tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. We
combine their best elements to construct a more accurate model of damaged CCDs

CTI trailing in science exposures, a substantial improvement over previous

it is incorrectly untrailed during post-processing.

in the form of multiple line integrals computed along the trajectory C
describing the spatial conformation of the knot. In this work it is addressed
the problem of evaluating invariants of this kind in the case in which the knot
is discrete, i.e. its trajectory is constructed by joining together a set of
segments of constant length. Such discrete knots appear almost everywhere in
numerical simulations of systems containing one dimensional ring-shaped
objects. Examples are polymers, the vortex lines in fluids and superfluids like
helium and other quantum liquids. Formally, the trajectory of a discrete knot
is a piecewise smooth curve characterized by sharp corners at the joints
between contiguous segments. The presence of these corners spoils the
topological invariance of the knot invariants considered here and prevents the
correct evaluation of their values. To solve this problem, a smoothing
procedure is presented, which eliminates the sharp corners and transforms the
original path C into a curve that is everywhere differentiable. The procedure
is quite general and can be applied to any discrete knot defined off or on
lattice. This smoothing algorithm is applied to the computation of the
Vassiliev knot invariant of degree 2 denoted here with the symbol r(C). This is
the simplest knot invariant that admits a definition in terms of multiple line
integrals. For a fast derivation of r(C), it is used a Monte Carlo integration
technique. It is shown that, after the smoothing, the values of r(C) may be
evaluated with an arbitrary precision. Several algorithms for the fast
computation of the Vassiliev knot invariant of degree 2 are provided.

  international conference on Data Mining",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The curse of dimensionality has remained a challenge for a wide variety of
algorithms in data mining, clustering, classification and privacy. Recently, it
was shown that an increasing dimensionality makes the data resistant to
effective privacy. The theoretical results seem to suggest that the
dimensionality curse is a fundamental barrier to privacy preservation. However,
in practice, we show that some of the common properties of real data can be
leveraged in order to greatly ameliorate the negative effects of the curse of
dimensionality. In real data sets, many dimensions contain high levels of
inter-attribute correlations. Such correlations enable the use of a process
known as vertical fragmentation in order to decompose the data into vertical
subsets of smaller dimensionality. An information-theoretic criterion of mutual
information is used in the vertical decomposition process. This allows the use
of an anonymization process, which is based on combining results from multiple
independent fragments. We present a general approach which can be applied to
the k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness models. In the presence of
inter-attribute correlations, such an approach continues to be much more robust
in higher dimensionality, without losing accuracy. We present experimental
results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach. This approach is
resilient enough to prevent identity, attribute, and membership disclosure
attack.

$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and general inhomogeneous ignition reaction $f\ge 0$
vanishing at $u=0,1$. Typical solutions $0\le u\le 1$ transition from $0$ to
$1$ as time progresses, and we study them in the region where this transition
occurs. Under fairly general qualitative hypotheses on $f$ we show that in
dimensions $d\le 3$, the Hausdorff distance of the super-level sets
$\{u\ge\epsilon\}$ and $\{u\ge 1-\epsilon\}$ remains uniformly bounded in time
for each $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Thus, $u$ remains uniformly in time close to the
characteristic function of $\{u\ge\tfrac 12\}$ in the sense of Hausdorff
distance of super-level sets. We also show that $\{u\ge\tfrac 12\}$ expands
with average speed (over any long enough time interval) between the two
spreading speeds corresponding to any $x$-independent lower and upper bounds on
$f$. On the other hand, these results turn out to be false in dimensions $d\ge
4$, at least without further quantitative hypotheses on $f$. The proof for
$d\le 3$ is based on showing that as the solution propagates, small values of
$u$ cannot escape far ahead of values close to 1. The proof for $d\ge 4$
involves construction of a counter-example for which this fails.
  Such results were before known for $d=1$ but are new for general non-periodic
media in dimensions $d\ge 2$ (some are also new for homogeneous and periodic
media). They extend in a somewhat weaker sense to monostable, bistable, and
mixed reaction types, as well as to transitions between general equilibria

mass objects. The masses of the coldest Y dwarfs may be similar to those
inferred for recently imaged planet-mass companions to nearby young stars.
Objects in this mass range, which appear to be rare in both the interstellar

fragmentation: the brown dwarfs in interstellar clouds and companion objects in
a protoplanetary disk. In both cases, however, the fact that objects in this

information on several useful properties such as orbital eccentricity and
blended light. We present an AP survey of 41 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs),
with a single transiting candidate, for which the target star's mean stellar
density has been measured using asteroseismology. The ensemble distribution of

average ellipticity of LAE's stellar component are 10-30 % and 0.4-0.6,
respectively, that are comparable with previous study results. We successfully
identify that some LAEs have a spatial offset between Lya and stellar-continuum
emission peaks, d_Lya, by ~2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical errors. To uncover
the physical origin of strong Lya emission found in LAEs, we investigate Lya
equivalent width (EW) dependences of these three structural parameters, merger

EW(Lya)=20-250A. Contrary to expectations, we find that merger fraction does
not significantly increase with Lya EW. We reveal an anti-correlation between
d_Lya and EW(Lya) by Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. There is a trend that the
LAEs with a large Lya EW have a small ellipticity. This is consistent with the
recent theoretical claims that Lya photons can more easily escape from face-on
disks having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar gas along the line
of sight, although our KS test indicates that this trend is not statistically
significant. Our results of Lya-EW dependence generally support the idea that
an HI column density is a key quantity determining Lya emissivity.

further observations to verify the signals. In both systems, we infer that the

of photo-evaporation. These results highlight both the ability of Kepler to

physical causes of this bluer-when-brighter trend. The continuum of our
composite difference spectrum is well-fit by a power-law, with a spectral index
in excellent agreement with previous results. We measure the spectral
variability relative to the underlying spectra of the quasars, which is
independent of any extinction, and compare to model predictions. We show that
our SDSS spectral variability results cannot be produced by global accretion
rate fluctuations in a thin disk alone. However, we find that a simple model of
a inhomogeneous disk with localized temperature fluctuations will produce
power-law spectral variability over optical wavelengths. We show that the
inhomogeneous disk will provide good fits to our observed spectral variability
if the disk has large temperature fluctuations in many independently varying
zones, in excellent agreement with independent constraints from quasar
microlensing disk sizes, their strong UV spectral continuum, and single-band

of clouds in the property distribution tails varies between regions, with
larger, more massive clouds with a higher velocity dispersion being found in
greatest proportions in the bar, spiral and then disc. The bar clouds also show
a bimodality that is not reflected in the spiral and disc clouds except in the
surface density, where all three regions show two distinct peaks. We identify
these features as being due to the relative proportion of three cloud types,
classified via the mass-radius scaling relation, which we label A, B and C.
Type A clouds have the typical values listed above and form the largest
fraction in each region. Type B clouds are massive giant molecular associations
while Type C clouds are unbound, transient clouds that form in dense filaments
and tidal tails. The fraction of each clouds type depends on the cloud-cloud
interactions, which cause mergers to build up the GMA Type Bs and tidal
features in which the Type C clouds are formed. The number of cloud
interactions is greatest in the bar, followed by the spiral, causing a higher
fraction of both cloud types compared to the disc. While the cloud types also
exist in lower resolution simulations, their identification becomes more
challenging as they are not well separated populations on the mass-radius

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) exhibit a Jeans length in the kpc scale and were
therefore proposed as dark matter (DM) candidates. Our treatment here is
generic, independent of the particle physics model and applies to all DM BEC,
in or out of equilibrium. Two observed quantities crucially constrain DM in an
inescapable way: the average DM density rho_{DM} and the phase-space density Q.
The observed values of rho_{DM} and Q in galaxies today constrain both the
possibility to form a BEC and the DM mass m. These two constraints robustly
exclude axion DM that decouples just after the QCD phase transition. Moreover,
the value m ~ 10^{-22} eV can only be obtained with a number of
ultrarelativistic degrees of freedom at decoupling in the trillions which is
impossible for decoupling in the radiation dominated era. In addition, we find
for the axion vacuum misalignment scenario that axions are produced strongly
out of thermal equilibrium and that the axion mass in such scenario turns to be
17 orders of magnitude too large to reproduce the observed galactic structures.
Moreover, we also consider inhomogenous gravitationally bounded BEC's supported
by the bosonic quantum pressure independently of any particular particle
physics scenario. For a typical size R ~ kpc and compact object masses M ~ 10^7
Msun they remarkably lead to the same particle mass m ~ 10^{-22} eV as the BEC
free-streaming length. However, the phase-space density for the gravitationally
bounded BEC's turns to be more than sixty orders of magnitude smaller than the
galaxy observed values. We conclude that the BEC's and the axion cannot be the
DM particle. However, an axion in the mili-eV scale may be a relevant source of
dark energy through the zero point cosmological quantum fluctuations.

on the outer regions, 0.1 < r/Rvir < 9. We show that the median and mean
profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations
from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature,
such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r > 0.5 R200m.
In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density
profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than
predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r ~ R200m, and its
absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate,
reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost
density profiles at r > R200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are
rescaled by R200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with
respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and
evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most
self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200c. We propose a new fitting formula
that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their

coalesce with companions during galaxy mergers, and both processes change the
BH mass and spin. By means of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of
galaxies, either idealised or embedded within the cosmic web, we explore the
effects of interstellar gas dynamics and external perturbations on BH spin
evolution. All these physical quantities were evolved on-the-fly in a
self-consistent manner. We use a `maximal' model to describe the turbulence
induced by stellar feedback to highlight its impact on the angular momentum of
the gas accreted by the BH. Periods of intense star formation are followed by
phases where stellar feedback drives large-scale outflows and hot bubbles. We
find that BH accretion is synchronised with star formation, as only when gas is
cold and dense do both processes take place. During such periods, gas motion is
dominated by consistent rotation. On the other hand, when stellar feedback
becomes substantial, turbulent motion randomises gas angular momentum. However
BH accretion is strongly suppressed in that case, as cold and dense gas is
lacking. In our cosmological simulation, at very early times (z>6), the
galactic disc has not yet settled and no preferred direction exists for the
angular momentum of the accreted gas, so the BH spin remains low. As the gas
settles into a disc (6>z>3), the BH spin then rapidly reaches its maximal
value. At lower redshifts (z<3), even when galaxy mergers flip the direction of
the angular momentum of the accreted gas, causing it to counter-rotate, the BH
spin magnitude only decreases modestly and temporarily. Should this be a
typical evolution scenario for BH, it potentially has dramatic consequences
regarding their origin and assembly, as accretion on maximally spinning BH
embedded in thin Shakura-Sunyaev disc is significantly reduced.

result of targeted searches of optically discovered supernovae in the local

already been identified which is an indication of the underlying richness of
radio supernovae waiting to be discovered. For example, comparison of star
formation and supernova discovery rate imply that as many as half of the
supernovae remain undetected in the traditional optical searches, either
because of intrinsic dimness or due to dust obscuration. This has far reaching
consequences to the models of stellar and galaxy evolution. A radio sky survey
would be ideal to uncover larger supernova population. Transient radio sky
would benefit significantly from such a survey. With the advent of advanced
gravitational wave detectors a new window is set to open on the local Universe.
Localization of these gravitational detectors is poor to identify
electromagnetic counterparts of the gravitational wave sources. However, the
longer lasting radio emission accompanied in these sources could be effectively
identified in a radio sky survey. We advocate a medium area ($\approx$ a few
thousand $\rm deg^{2}$) radio sky survey at C-band. Alternatively, a survey at
S-band has advantage of larger sky coverage without serious loss of the science

nuclei (AGN), our direct view of the AGN in NLRG is impeded by a parsec-scale
dusty torus structure. Our high resolution infrared observations provide new
information about the degree of extinction induced by the torus, and the
incidence of obscured AGN in NLRG.
  We find that the point-like nucleus detection rate increases from 25 per cent
at 1.025$\mu$m, to 80 per cent at 2.05$\mu$m, and to 100 per cent at 8.0$\mu$m.
This supports the idea that most NLRG host an obscured AGN in their centre. We
estimate the extinction from the obscuring structures using X-ray, near-IR and
mid-IR data. We find that the optical extinction derived from the 9.7$\mu$m
silicate absorption feature is consistently lower than the extinction derived
using other techniques. This discrepancy challenges the assumption that all the
mid-infrared emission of NLRG is extinguished by a simple screen of dust at
larger radii. This disagreement can be explained in terms of either weakening
of the silicate absorption feature by (i) thermal mid-IR emission from the
narrow-line region, (ii) non-thermal emission from the base of the radio jets,
or (iii) by direct warm dust emission that leaks through a clumpy torus without

elasto-viscoplastic deformation of solids. Our goal in this paper is to
incorporate recently developed out-of-equilibrium statistical concepts into a
thermodynamically consistent, finite-deformation, continuum framework for
deforming amorphous solids. The basic premise is that the configurational
degrees of freedom of the material --- the part of the internal energy/entropy
that corresponds to mechanically stable microscopic configurations --- are
characterized by a configurational temperature that might differ from that of
the vibrational degrees of freedom, which equilibrate rapidly with an external
heat bath. This results in an approximate internal energy decomposition into
weakly interacting configurational and vibrational subsystems, which exchange
energy following a Fourier-like law, leading to a thermomechanical framework
permitting two well-defined temperatures. In this framework, internal variables
that carry information about the state of the material equilibrate with the
configurational subsystem, are explicitly associated with energy and entropy of
their own, and couple to a viscoplastic flow rule. The coefficients that
determine the rate of flow of entropy and heat between different internal
systems are proposed to explicitly depend on the rate of irreversible
deformation. As an application of this framework, we discuss two constitutive
models for the response of glassy materials, a simple phenomenological model
and a model related to the concept of Shear-Transformation-Zones as the basis
for internal variables. The models account for several salient features of
glassy deformation phenomenology. Directions for future investigation are
briefly discussed.

the stars show a statistical tendency to have inclinations near 90$^\circ$, in

importance to reduce the problem of understanding the structure-function

networks usually leads to a small set of different similarity values, making
standard hierarchical clustering algorithms ambiguous. We propose the use of
""multidendrograms"", an algorithm that computes agglomerative hierarchical
clusterings implementing a variable-group technique that solves the
non-uniqueness problem found in the standard pair-group algorithm. This problem
arises when there are more than two clusters separated by the same maximum
similarity (or minimum distance) during the agglomerative process. Forcing
binary trees in this case means breaking ties in some way, thus giving rise to
different output clusterings depending on the criterion used. Multidendrograms
solves this problem grouping more than two clusters at the same time when ties
occur.

binaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant
number of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the
determination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as
well as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these

result of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have
not previously been identified by other methods. We estimate that ~35% of KOIs
are false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-order
correction for observational bias. Comparing single-planet candidate KOIs to
multi-planet candidate KOIs, we find an observed false positive fraction due to
contamination of 16% and 2.4% respectively, bolstering the existing evidence
that multi-planet KOIs are significantly less likely to be false positives. We
also analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive a
simple model for the most common type of contamination in the Kepler field. We
find that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify low

dynamics of the order parameter in narrow superconducting channels of different
lengths is investigated in the ac voltage-driven regime. The resistive state of
the system at low frequencies of the applied voltage is characterized by the
formation of time-periodic groups of oscillating phase-slip centers PSCs.
Increasing the frequency reduces the lifetime of these periodic groups.
Depending on the length of the channel, the ac voltage either tends to restore
the state with a single central PSC in periodic groups or minimizes the number
of forming PSCs and induces their ordering in the system. For relatively short
channels, a further increase in frequency leads to the suppression of the order
parameter without PCS formation. For the systems with the channel length
exceeding the specified limit, the formation of PSC starts after a certain time
delay which increases rapidly with frequency. The current-voltage
characteristics of a relatively short channel at different applied voltage
frequencies are calculated. It is found that the current-voltage
characteristics exhibit a step-like structure, where the height of the first
step is determined by the quadruple value of the Josephson frequency.

small fluid elements to calculate the local stresses and temperatures and are
synchronized at certain time intervals to satisfy the macroscopic heat- and

polymeric liquid composed of short chains with ten beads between parallel
plates. The rheological properties and conformation of polymer chains coupled
with the local viscous heating are investigated with a non-dimensional

the viscous heating to the thermal conduction at the characteristic temperature
required to sufficiently change the viscosity. The present simulation
demonstrates that strong shear thinning and transitional behavior of the
conformation of the polymer chains occur with a rapid temperature rise when the
Nahme-Griffith number exceeds unity. The results also clarify that the
reentrant transition of the linear stress-optical relation occurs for large
shear stresses due to the coupling of the conformation of polymer chains and
heat generation under shear flows.

experiments. In sharp contrast, the dynamic local magnetic susceptibility of
the two phases is strikingly different. In the $\gamma$ phase, the sharp low
energy peak due to local moment formation and consequently low Kondo
temperature dominates the spectra. In the $\alpha$ phase two broad peaks can be
identified, the first is due to Kondo screening, and the second is due to
Hund's coupling. This shows that hybridization plays a central role in the

As circumstellar disc lifetimes are short, we expected to primarily find

expectation to be connected in all places at all times, have introduced novel
challenges for researchers to address. Fortunately, the wide spread deployment

enabled devices have enabled researchers to develop solutions for those

  In this paper, we present OSCAR, a multi-objective, incentive-based,

OSCAR architecture that does not introduce any intermediate hardware nor
require changes to current applications or legacy servers. The OSCAR
architecture is designed to automatically estimate the system's context,
dynamically schedule various connections and/or packets to different
interfaces, be backwards compatible with the current Internet architecture, and
provide the user with incentives for collaboration. We also formulate the OSCAR
scheduler as a multi-objective, multi-modal scheduler that maximizes system
throughput while minimizing energy consumption or financial cost. We evaluate
OSCAR via implementation on Linux, as well as via simulation, and compare our
results to the current optimal achievable throughput, cost, and energy
consumption. Our evaluation shows that, in the throughput maximization mode, we
provide up to 150% enhancement in throughput compared to current operating
systems, without any changes to legacy servers. Moreover, this performance gain
further increases with the availability of connection resume-supporting, or

contribution of vacuum polarization at one-loop order to the power spectrum of
the magnetic field on inflationary (de Sitter) background. It is found that the
one-loop term exhibits the infrared secular growth that is proportional to the
number of $e$-folds. The use of the dynamical renormalization group method,
which amounts to partial resummation of higher loop diagrams, shows that the
resummed power spectrum is free from the secular growth and the loop effect
only changes the power from $(k/a)^4$ at the tree level to ${(k/a)}^{4-\nu}$,
where $\nu$ represents the contribution from vacuum polarization. The parameter
$\nu$, being proportional to the square of the gauge coupling constant as well
as the number of fermion species, is a simple function of a ratio of fermion
mass to the Hubble parameter and is positive irrespective of the fermion mass.
Thus, the loop effect always enhances the infrared magnetic field strength. We
find that $\nu \simeq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is the possible maximum contribution to
$\nu$ from a single fermion. This estimate suggests that either large number of
fermion species or large coupling constant is a necessary condition for the
loop effect to be responsible for the seed of the cosmic magnetic fields.

in field MW halo stars previously obtained using an abundance analysis

no significant enhancement of carbon. The [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] ratios are almost
constant with a modest decreasing trend with increasing [Fe/H] and are slightly
lower than the field halo stars. The [Sr/Fe] and [Sr/Ba] ratios also tend to be
lower in the Bo\""otes I stars than in the halo stars. Our results of small

sample selection. Instead of using their maximum likelihood estimates, our
paper develops new Bayesian procedures for the selection-t models with either

of the t distribution, we can use data augmentation to impute the missing data,
and use parameter expansion to sample the restricted covariance matrices. The
Bayesian procedures only involve simple steps, without calculating analytical

Simulation studies show the vulnerability of the selection models with Normal

Interestingly, we find evidence of heavy-tailedness in three real examples

studied much. These galaxies are known to be dominated by the dark matter halo
from the innermost regions. Here we do a stability analysis for the galactic
disc of UGC 7321, a low surface brightness, superthin galaxy, for which the
various observational input parameters are available. We show that the disc is
stable against local, linear axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations.
The Toomre Q parameter values are found to be large (>> 1) mainly due to the
low disc surface density and the high rotation velocity resulting due to the
dominant dark matter halo, which could explain the observed low star formation
rate. For the stars-alone case, the disc shows finite swing amplification but
the addition of dark matter halo suppresses that amplification almost
completely. Even the inclusion of the low-dispersion gas which constitutes a
high disc mass fraction does not help in causing swing amplification. This can
explain why these galaxies do not show strong spiral features. Thus the
dynamical effect of a halo that is dominant from inner regions can naturally
explain why star formation and spiral features are largely suppressed in low
surface brightness galaxies, making these different from the high surface
brightness galaxies.

around black holes. In the near future, new facilities will have the capability
to explore the metric around SgrA$^*$, the supermassive black hole candidate at
the Center of our Galaxy, and open a new window to test the Kerr black hole
hypothesis. In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with
compact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black
holes. We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by
a hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA$^*$. We find that the
sole observation of the hot spot light curve can at most constrain a
combination of the black hole spin and of possible deviations from the Kerr
solution. This happens because the same orbital frequency around a Kerr black
hole can be found for a non-Kerr object with a different spin parameter. Second
order corrections in the light curve due to the background geometry are
typically too small to be identified. While the observation of the hot spot
centroid track can potentially bound possible deviations from the Kerr
solution, that is out of reach for the near future VLTI instrument GRAVITY. The
Kerr black hole hypothesis could really be tested in the case of the discovery
of a radio pulsar in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$. Radio observations of
such a pulsar would provide precise estimates of the mass and the spin of
SgrA$^*$, and the combination of these measurements (probing the weak field)
with the hot spot light curve information (probing the strong field) may
constrain/find possible deviations from the Kerr solution with quite good
precision.

a bound state, stoponium, which then undergoes two-body decays to Standard

Coulombic interactions responsible for the formation of this bound state, we
obtain factorization theorems for the stop pair inclusive and differential

two sets of different perturbation equations when the momentum transfer
potential is vanished in the rest frame of dark matter or dark energy. There
are many kinds of interacting forms from the phenomenological considerations,
here, we choose $Q=3H\xi_x\rho_x$ which owns the stable perturbations in most
cases. Then, according to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain the
model by currently available cosmic observations which include cosmic microwave
background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernovae, and
$f\sigma_8(z)$ data points from redshift-space distortion. Jointing the
geometry tests with the large scale structure information, the results show a
tighter constraint on the interacting model than the case without

$\xi_x=0.00372_{-0.00372- 0.00372-0.00372}^{+0.000768+0.00655+0.0102}$. It
means that the recently cosmic observations favor a small interaction rate

developed a simple method that repeatedly monitors the atomic phase while

Using this new method, we measured the continuous phase over 3 measurement

  %Compared with the standard method that initialize phase during each

dramatically increase spectrum utilization while ensuring predetermined quality
of service levels for primary users. In this paper, modeling, performance
analysis, and optimization of a distributed secondary network with random
sensing order policy are studied. Specifically, the secondary users create a
random order of available channels upon primary users return, and then find
optimal transmission and handoff opportunities in a distributed manner. By a
Markov chain analysis, the average throughputs of the secondary users and
average interference level among the secondary and primary users are
investigated. A maximization of the secondary network performance in terms of
the throughput while keeping under control the average interference is
proposed. It is shown that despite of traditional view, non-zero false alarm in
the channel sensing can increase channel utilization, especially in a dense
secondary network where the contention is too high. Then, two simple and
practical adaptive algorithms are established to optimize the network. The
second algorithm follows the variations of the wireless channels in
non-stationary conditions and outperforms even static brute force optimization,
while demanding few computations. The convergence of the distributed algorithms
are theoretically investigated based on the analytical performance indicators
established by the Markov chain analysis. Finally, numerical results validate
the analytical derivations and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
schemes. It is concluded that fully distributed sensing order algorithms can
lead to substantial performance improvements in cognitive radio networks
without the need of centralized management or message passing among the users.

emission diagrams and annihilation type diagrams are important and calculable
in the perturbative QCD approach.
  The branching rations of most decays are in the range of $10^{-4}$ to
$10^{-8}$, which are bigger by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude than the predictions
given by naive factorization, but consistent with the predictions from QCD
factorization and the recent experimental measurements. We also give the
predictions for the direct $CP$ asymmetries, some of which are large enough for
the future experiments to measure. We also find that, even with a small mixing
angle, the mixing between $f_2$ and $f_2^{\prime}$ can bring remarkable changes
to both branching ratios and the direct $CP$ asymmetries for some decays

  For decays with a vector meson and a tensor meson in final states, we predict
a large percentage of transverse polarization contributions due to the

carried out to study the relative stability of various polymorphs and to use
the obtained data in the training set. The original BOP formalism was unable to
account for the correct energetic relationship between the B20

incorrectly the B2 polymorph. In order to correct this improper behavior the
BOP potential has been extended by a Columbic term (BOP+C) in order to account
for the partial ionic character of FeSi. Using this potential we are able to
account for the correct phase order between the most stable B20 and B2 (CsCl)
polymorphs when the net atomic charges are properly set. Although this brings
in a new somewhat uncertain parameter (the net charges) one can adjust properly
the BOP+C potential for specific problems. To demonstrate this we study under
high pressure the B2 phase which becomes more stable vs. B20 as it is found
experimentally and expected to be taken place in the Earth mantle. The obtained
BOP has also been tested for the metallic and semiconducting disilicides

the disk and halo of nearby spiral galaxies, their magnetic field strength and
vertical scale heights. The spiral galaxies studied so far show a similar
magnetic field pattern which is of spiral shape along the disk plane and
X-shaped in the halo, sometimes accompanied by strong vertical fields above and
below the central region of the disk. The strength of the halo field is
comparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength
is (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications
that stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.
The magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and
maintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the
turbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the
turbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the
magnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with
time. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent
magnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated
only within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a
large-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger
in the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies. The
detection of similar scale heights in several spiral galaxies of different
Hubble type star formation implies a relation between the galactic wind, the
total magnetic field strength and the star formation in the galaxy. A galactic
wind may be essential for an effective dynamo action. Strong tidal interaction,
however, seems to disturb the balance leading to deviating and locally
different scale heights as observed in M82 and NGC~4631.

Detailed numerical hydrodynamic simulations have already offered insight in the
complex dynamics of the wind collision region (WCR), while independent
analytical studies, albeit with simplified descriptions of the WCR, have shed
light on the spectra of charged particles. In this paper, we describe a
combination of these two approaches. We present a 3D-hydrodynamical model for
colliding stellar winds and compute spectral energy distributions of
relativistic particles for the resulting structure of the WCR. The hydrodynamic

gravity, orbital motion and the radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. In our

WCR and the subsequent cooling via inverse Compton losses (including
Klein-Nishina effects), bremsstrahlung, collisions and other energy loss
mechanisms.

Transients (ILOTs; Red Transients; Red Novae) which are powered by energy
release in the core of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are likely to eject
the entire envelope, and hence cannot explain ILOTs in AGB and similar stars.
There are single-star and binary models for the powering of ILOTs, which are
eruptive stars with peak luminosities between those of novae and supernovae. In
single-star models the ejection of gas at velocities of ~500-1000 km/s and a
possible bright ionizing flash, require a shock to propagate from the core
outward. Using a self similar solution to follow the propagation of the shock
through the envelope of two evolved stellar models, a 6Mo AGB star and an 11Mo
yellow supergiant (YSG) star, we find that the shock that is required to
explain the observed mass loss also ejects most of the envelope. We also show
that for the event to have a strong ionizing flash the required energy expels
most of the envelope. The removal of most of the envelope is in contradiction
with observations. We conclude that single-star models for ILOTs of evolved

discussed, based on full evolutionary models of stars with mass in the range
$1$M$_{\odot} \leq$M$\leq 8$M$_{\odot}$, and metallicities $0.001 < Z <0.008$.
Dust grains are assumed to form in an isotropically expanding wind, by growth
of pre--existing seed nuclei. Convection, for what concerns the treatment of
convective borders and the efficiency of the schematization adopted, turns out
to be the physical ingredient used to calculate the evolutionary sequences with
the highest impact on the results obtained. Low--mass stars with M$\leq
3$M$_{\odot}$ produce carbon type dust with also traces of silicon carbide. The
mass of solid carbon formed, fairly independently of metallicity, ranges from a
few $10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$, for stars of initial mass $1-1.5$M$_{\odot}$, to
$\sim 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ for M$\sim 2-2.5$M$_{\odot}$; the size of dust
particles is in the range $0.1 \mu$m$\leq a_C \leq 0.2\mu$m. On the contrary,
the production of silicon carbide (SiC) depends on metallicity. For $10^{-3}
\leq Z \leq 8\times 10^{-3}$ the size of SiC grains varies in the range $0.05
\mu {\rm m} < {\rm a_{SiC}} < 0.1 \mu$m, while the mass of SiC formed is
$10^{-5}{\rm M}_{\odot} < {\rm M_{SiC}} < 10^{-3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Models of
higher mass experience Hot Bottom Burning, which prevents the formation of
carbon stars, and favours the formation of silicates and corundum. In this case
the results scale with metallicity, owing to the larger silicon and aluminium
contained in higher--Z models. At Z=$8\times 10^{-3}$ we find that the most
massive stars produce dust masses $m_d \sim 0.01$M$_{\odot}$, whereas models of
smaller mass produce a dust mass ten times smaller. The main component of dust
are silicates, although corundum is also formed, in not negligible quantities
($\sim 10-20\%$).

on the disc's structure. It has been shown that, in discs with viscous heating
and radiative transport, the migration can be directed outwards. In this paper
we investigate the influence of a constant dM/dt-flux through the disc, as well
as the influence of the disc's metallicity on the disc's thermodynamics. We
focus on dM/dt discs, which have a net mass flux through them. Utilizing the
resulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration in the
disc. We perform numerical hydrosimulations of dM/dt discs with viscous
heating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation in 2D in the r-z-plane. We
use the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code FARGOCA that includes a full
tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation, as well as a two temperature solver
that includes radiation transport in the flux-limited diffusion approximation.
The migration of embedded planets is studied by using torque formulae. For a
disc of gas surface density and viscosity, we find that the discs thermal
structure depends on the product Sigma_G \nu and the amount of heavy elements,
while the migration of planets additionally to the mentioned quantities,
depends on the amount of viscosity itself. As a result of this, the disc
structure can not be approximated by simple power laws. During the lifetime of
the disc, the structure of the disc changes significantly in a non-linear way
in the inner parts. In the late stages of the discs evolution, outward
migration is only possible if the metallicity of the disc is high. For low
metallicity, planets would migrate inwards and could potentially be lost. The
presented disc structures and migration maps have important consequences on the
formation of planets, as they can give hints on the different formation
mechanisms for different types of planets as a function of metallicity.

the concept of local thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, transport coefficients

star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN evolving at a similar, strong rate
and declining radio-loud AGN. While the well-known flattening of the radio
number counts below 1 mJy is mostly due to star-forming galaxies, these sources
and AGN make up an approximately equal fraction of the sub-mJy sky. Our results
shed also light on a fifty-year-old issue, namely radio emission from
radio-quiet AGN, and suggest that it is closely related to star formation, at
least at z ~ 1.5 - 2. The implications of our findings for future, deeper radio
surveys, including those with the Square Kilometre Array, are also discussed.
One of the main messages, especially to non-radio astronomers, is that radio
surveys are reaching such faint limits that, while previously they were mainly
useful for radio quasars and radio galaxies, they are now detecting mostly
star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN, i.e., the bulk of the extragalactic

cone-like shells, swept-up by stellar winds. The observed velocity structure of
the well-resolved southern HII region is most consistent with a picture that
combines a stellar wind with stellar motion (as in bow shock models) along a

hydrogen-rich material accreted from a companion star, it becomes a powerful
source of ionizing UV emission. If significant populations of such sources
exist in galaxies, strong emission in the recombination lines of HeII should be
expected from the interstellar medium. To explore this conjecture, we select
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ~11 500 emission line galaxies with stellar
ages >1 Gyr showing no signs of AGN activity and co-add their spectra in bins
of stellar population age. For the first time, we detect HeII$\lambda$4686
nebular emission in retired galaxies and find it to be significantly weaker

branch stars being the sole ionizing source in all age bins. These results
limit populations of accreting WDs with photospheric temperatures ($T_{\rm

account for no more than ~5-10% of the observed SN Ia rate. Conversely, should
all WD progenitors of SN Ia go through the phase of steady nuclear burning with

extract in-phase and quadrature (I and Q) components in the received radar
signal. However, the sampling is inefficient because the received signal
contains only a small number of significant target signals. This paper
incorporates the compressive sampling (CS) theory into the design of the
quadrature sampling system, and develops a quadrature compressive sampling
(QuadCS) system to acquire the I and Q components with low sampling rate. The
QuadCS system first randomly projects the received signal into a compressive
bandpass signal and then utilizes the quadrature sampling to output compressive
I and Q components. The compressive outputs are used to reconstruct the I and Q
components. To understand the system performance, we establish the frequency
domain representation of the QuadCS system. With the waveform-matched
dictionary, we prove that the QuadCS system satisfies the restricted isometry
property with overwhelming probability. For K target signals in the observation
interval T, simulations show that the QuadCS requires just O(Klog(BT/K))
samples to stably reconstruct the signal, where B is the signal bandwidth. The
reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio decreases by 3dB for every octave increase
in the target number K and increases by 3dB for every octave increase in the
compressive bandwidth. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify that the

tries to diverge from the equilibrium to maximize its own gains and it manages
to do so. We propose the wolf-pack strategy. Unlike standard game-theory based
strategies, our strategy does not penalize the nodes that diverge from fairness
or from equilibrium, as we believe most nodes will do so in an attempt to get
an advantage over the other nodes. The wolf-pack strategy will try to always
find the most successful node or nodes and penalize them. We believe that just
like in nature, a number of small predators can take down the bigger, more
profitable ones. Furthermore during the Challenge we test two different
strategies that provide completely opposite results. These offer a clear
picture of what the best strategy is and the problems of the current system.

has been proposed to access the neutron generalized parton distributions
(GPDs). In Impulse Approximation (IA) studies, it has been shown, in
particular, that the sum of the two leading twist, quark helicity conserving
GPDs of $^3$He, $H$ and $E$, at low momentum transfer, is dominated by the
neutron contribution, so that $^3$He is very promising for the extraction of
the neutron information. Nevertheless, such an extraction could be not trivial.
A technique, able to take into account the nuclear effects included in the IA
analysis in the extraction procedure, has been therefore developed. In this
work, the IA calculation of the spin dependent GPD $\tilde H$ of $^3$He is
presented for the first time. This quantity is found to be largely dominated,
at low momentum transfer, by the neutron contribution, which could be extracted
using arguments similar to the ones previously proposed for the other GPDs. The
known forward limit of the IA calculation of $\tilde H$, yielding the polarized
parton distributions of $^3$He, is correctly recovered. The knowledge of the
GPDs $H, E$ and $\tilde H$ of $^3$He will allow now the evaluation of the cross
section asymmetries which are relevant for coherent DVCS off $^3$He at
Jefferson Lab kinematics, an important step towards the planning of possible
experiments.

self-consistent calculations of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. First, we
examine the phase diagrams of two-band systems with a passive band in which the
intraband pairing interaction is absent and superconductivity is induced by a
Cooper pair tunneling from an active band. It is demonstrated that the
temperature of the Lifshitz point at which three second-order transition lines
meet is independent of the Cooper pair tunneling strength. The BCS-FFLO
critical field becomes lower than the Lifshitz point with increasing the
interband tunneling strength, and the resultant phase diagram is qualitatively
different from that in a single-band superconductor. We also study the
thermodynamics of Pauli-limiting two-band superconductors with comparable
intraband pairing interactions. As a consequence of a competing effect between
two bands, the FFLO phase is divided into two phases: $Q_1$- and $Q_2$-FFLO
phases. The $Q_1$-FFLO is favored in a high field regime and the $Q_2$-FFLO
becomes stable in the lower field. In a particular case, the latter is further
subdivided into a family of FFLO states with rational modulation lengths,
leading to a devil's staircase structure in the field-dependence of physical
quantities. The critical field, above which the FFLO is stabilized, is lower
than that in a single band superconductor, while the temperature of tricritical
Lifshitz point is invariant under the change of two-band parameters.

computational effort is spent while solving these linear systems of equations,

the optimization problem has been formulated in either of two different ways.
One of them leading to a sparse linear system of equations involving relatively

However, during the propagation through a magnetised plasma, the CP of the CMB
could be produced via the Faraday conversion (FC). The FC converts a
pre-existing linear polarization into CP in presence of a magnetic field with
relativistic electrons. In this paper, we focus on the FC due to supernova
remnants of the first stars, also called Pop III stars. We derive an analytic
form for the angular power spectrum of the CP of the CMB generated by the
general FC. We apply this result to the case of the FC triggered by explosions
of the first stars and evaluate the angular power spectrum, CV V . We show that
the amplitude of l(l + 1)C_l^V V /(2pi) > 10^-2 micro Kelvin squared for l >

be a very promising probe of the yet unobserved first stars, primarily due to
the expected high signal along with an unique frequency dependence.

X-ray-dominated polars. Our observational campaign aims to better understand
and describe the multiwavelength data, the physical properties of the system
components, and the short- and long-term behavior of the component fluxes in RS
Cae. We employ stellar atmosphere, stratified accretion-column, and widely used
X-ray spectral models. We fit the XMM-Newton spectra, model the multiband light
curves, and opt for a mostly consistent description of the spectral energy
distribution.
  Results. Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray
emission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion
region, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a
stream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream
emission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma
component at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV. The spectral fits give
evidence of a partially absorbing and a reflection component. Multitemperature
models, covering a broader temperature range in the X-ray emitting accretion
regions, reproduce the spectra appropriately well. Including archival data, we
describe the spectral energy distribution with a combination of models based on
a consistent set of parameters and derive a lower limit estimate of the
distance d > 750pc.
  Conclusions. The high bolometric soft-to-hard flux ratios and short-term
variability of the (X-ray) light curves are characteristic of inhomogeneous
accretion. RS Cae clearly belongs in the group of polars that show a very
strong soft X-ray flux compared to their hard X-ray flux. The different
black-body fluxes and similar hard X-ray and optical fluxes during the
XMM-Newton and ROSAT observations show that soft and hard X-ray emission are
not directly correlated.

governing any physical law and therefore arise in many areas of physics and
astrophysics. For complex problems and geometries, only numerical simulations
can give insight into quantitative and accurate behavior of the seeked
solutions. The standard numerical algorithm to solve partial differential
equations is to split the space and time discretisation separately into
different uncorrelated methods. Time is usually advanced by explicit schemes,
or, for too restrictive time steps, by implicit or semi-implicit algorithms.
This separate time and space slicing is artificial and sometimes unpractical.
Indeed, treating space and time directions symmetrically and simultaneously
without splitting is highly recommended in some problems like diffusion.
  It is the purpose of this work to present a simple numerical algorithm to
solve the standard linear scalar advection-diffusion and wave equations using a
fully spectral method in a two-dimensional Cartesian $(x,t)$ bounded space-time
domain. Generalization in three-dimensions $(x,y,t)$ is shown for the pure
diffusion problem. The basic idea is to expand the unknown function in
Chebyshev polynomials for the spatial variables $(x,y)$ as well as for the time
variable $t$. We show typical examples and demonstrate the spectral accuracy of
the method. The great advantage of fully spectral methods resides in their
high-accuracy for a relatively small number of grid points (for sufficiently

on-shell on the solutions of Einstein's equations. Then, by using the
Hamiltonian null tetrads, we find the Hamiltonian expression of the Weyl

  After having introduced the Dirac observables of canonical gravity, whose
determination requires the solution of the super-Hamiltonian and super-momentum
constraints, we discuss the connection of the Dirac observables with the notion
of 4-scalar Bergmann observables. Due to the use of radar 4-coordinates these
two types of observables coincide in our formulation of canonical ADM tetrad
gravity. However, contrary to Bergmann proposal, the Weyl eigenvalues are shown
not to be Bergmann observables, so that their relevance is only in their use
(first suggested by Bergmann and Komar) for giving a physical identification as
point-events of the mathematical points of the space-time 4-manifold.

obtained by us in the 1980s within an approach based on the dual representation
of QCD as a theory of weakly interacting mesons for large N colours. In our
analytic approach the dynamics behind the enhancement of ReA_0 and suppression
of ReA_2, the so-called Delta I = 1/2 rule for K-> pi pi decays, has a simple
structure: the usual octet enhancement through quark-gluon renormalization
group evolution down to the scales O(1 GeV) is continued as a meson evolution
down to zero momentum scales at which the factorization of hadronic matrix
elements is at work. The inclusion of lowest-lying vector meson contributions
in addition to the pseudoscalar ones and of Wilson coefficients in a momentum
scheme improves significantly the matching between quark-gluon and meson
evolutions. In particular, the anomalous dimension matrix governing the meson
evolution exhibits the structure of the known anomalous dimension matrix in the
quark-gluon evolution. The recent results on ReA_2 and ReA_0 from the RBC-UKQC
collaboration give support for our approach. In particular, the signs of the
two main contractions found numerically by these authors follow uniquely from
our analytic approach. At NLO in 1/N we obtain ReA_0/ReA_2= 16.0\pm 1.5 which
amounts to an order of magnitude enhancement over the strict large N limit
value sqrt{2}. QCD penguins contribute at 15% level to this result. We also
find \hat B_K=0.73\pm 0.02, with the smallness of 1/N corrections to the large
N value \hat B_K=3/4 resulting within our approach from an approximate
cancellation between pseudoscalar and vector meson one-loop contributions. We
summarize the status of Delta M_K in this approach.

no clear signatures of variability at radio, X-ray and TeV energies at the time
of the GeV flare. Variability around periastron in the H$\alpha$ emission line,
can be interpreted as the gravitational interaction between the pulsar and the
circumstellar disk. The equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ grows from a few days
before periastron until a few days later, and decreases again between 18 and 46
days after periastron. In near infrared we observe the similar decrease of the
equivalent width of Br$\gamma$ line between the 40th and 117th day after the

the detailed relationship between contact geometry and electronic structure
requires a quantitative ab initio approach such as density functional theory
(DFT), the Kondo many-body effects ensuing from the coupling of the impurity
spin with metal electrons are most properly addressed by formulating a
generalized Anderson impurity model to be solved with, for example, the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. Since there is at present no
seamless scheme that can accurately carry out that program, we have in recent
years designed a systematic method for semiquantitatively joining DFT and NRG.
We apply this DFT-NRG scheme to the ideal conductance of single wall (4,4) and
(8,8) nanotubes with magnetic adatoms (Co and Fe), both inside and outside the
nanotube, and with a single carbon atom vacancy. A rich scenario emerges, with
Kondo temperatures generally in the Kelvin range, and conductance anomalies
ranging from a single channel maximum to destructive Fano interference with
cancellation of two channels out of the total four. The configuration yielding
the highest Kondo temperature (tens of Kelvins) and a measurable zero-bias
anomaly is that of a Co or Fe impurity inside the narrowest nanotube. The
single atom vacancy has a spin, but a very low Kondo temperature is predicted.
The geometric, electronic, and symmetry factors influencing this variability
are all accessible, which makes this approach methodologically instructive and
highlights many delicate and difficult points in the first-principles modeling
of the Kondo effect in nanocontacts.

  Motivated primarily by disclosure limitation problems where constraints can

solve a generalization of an open problem posed by Dobra et al. (2008). Our
decomposition of $\mathcal{F_T}$ has two important consequences: (1) we derive

some degree of quantum coherence to accommodate a unitary time evolution. We
parametrize the degree of coherence by the number of coherently emitted
particles $N_{coh}$ and show that it is severely constrained by the equivalence
principle. We discuss, in this context, the fate of a shell of matter that
falls into a Schwarzschild BH. Two points of view are considered, that of a
stationary external observer and that of the shell itself. From the perspective
of the shell, the near-horizon region has an energy density proportional to
$N_{coh}^2$ in Schwarzschild units. So, if $N_{coh}$ is parameterically larger
than the square root of the BH entropy $S_{BH}^ {1/2}$, a firewall or more
generally a ""wall of smoke"" forms and the equivalence principle is violated
while the BH is still semiclassical. To have a degree of coherence that is
parametrically smaller than $S_{BH}^{1/2}$, one has to introduce a new
sub-Planckian gravitational length scale, which likely also violates the
equivalence principle. And so our previously proposed model which has
$N_{coh}=S_{BH}^{1/2}$ is singled out. From the external-observer perspective,
we find that the time it takes for the information about the state of the shell
to get re-emitted from the BH is inversely proportional to $N_{coh}$. When the

occurrence of Pati-Salam gauge symmetry with unbroken D-parity and two gauge

such models. This symmetry also ensures vanishing GUT threshold uncertainy on
$\sin^2\theta_W$ or on the highest intermediate scale. Although the proton
lifetime prediction is brought closer to the ongoing search limits with GUT
threshold effects in the minimal model, no such effects are needed in a

any confining gauge theory in D space-time dimensions is described, at large
source separations, by an effective string theory. Recently two important
advances improved our understanding of this effective theory. First, it was
realized that the form of the effective action is strongly constrained by the
requirement of the Lorentz invariance of the gauge theory, which is
spontaneously broken by the formation of a long confining flux tube in the
vacuum. This constraint is strong enough to fix uniquely the first few
subleading terms of the action. Second, it has been realized that the first of
these allowed terms - a quartic polynomial in the field derivatives - is
exactly the composite field $T\bar{T}$, built with the chiral components, $T$
and $\bar{T}$, of the energy-momentum tensor of the 2d QFT describing the
infrared limit of the effective string. This irrelevant perturbation is quantum
integrable and yields, through the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA), the energy
levels of the string which exactly coincide with the Nambu-Goto spectrum. In
this talk we first review the general implications of these two results and
then, as a test of the power of these methods, use them to construct the first
few boundary corrections to the effective string action.

it is shown that the lower bound of the dispersion of the total energy of the
system, imposed by the uncertainty principle, is dominated by the bath power
spectrum and therefore, quantum mechanics inhibits the system
thermal-equilibrium-state from being described by the canonical Boltzmann's

observation is in sharp contrast to the classical case, for which the thermal
equilibrium distribution, irrespective of the interaction strength, is
\emph{exactly} characterized by the canonical Boltzmann distribution and
therefore, no dependence on the bath power spectrum is present. We define an
\emph{effective coupling} to the environment that depends on all energy scales
in the system and reservoir interaction. Sample computations in regimes
predicted by this effective coupling are demonstrated. For example, for the
case of strong effective coupling, deviations from standard thermodynamics are
present and, for the case of weak effective coupling, quantum features such as

involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example.
In the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is very
hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry,
photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial
planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO2, and
H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for
atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either
the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere and
oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and
atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that
these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of CH4, and
NH3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents
are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in the emerging spectra, and can
be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities
results in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in the
spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities
show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with
near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. The 1-4um
region will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and
better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive
cooling timescales on the order of 10^5-10^6 Myrs, based on the modeled
effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of
such planets in future surveys.

multiple access in which the queues leverage the feedback information. We
derive the stability region under random multiple access where one of the two
queues exploits the feedback information and backs off under negative
acknowledgement (NACK) and the other, higher priority, queue will access the
channel with probability one. We characterize the stability region of this
feedback-based random access protocol and prove that this derived stability
region encloses the stability region of the conventional random access (RA)
scheme that does not exploit the feedback information.

subcellular levels in healthy BALB/cJ mice and in parallel addresses the
effects of NP injection on kidney function, blood pressure and vascular
contractility. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) showed accumulation of NPs in the liver within 1h after
intravenous infusion, accommodated by intracellular uptake in endothelial and
Kupffer cells with subsequent intracellular uptake in renal cells, particularly
the cytoplasm of the proximal tubule, in podocytes and mesangial cells. The
renofunctional effects of NPs were evaluated by arterial acid-base status and
measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) after instrumentation with
chronically indwelling catheters. Arterial pH was 7.46 and 7.41 in mice 0.5 h
after injections of saline or NP, and did not change over the next 12h. In
addition, the injections of NP did not affect arterial PCO2 or [HCO3-] either.
Twenty-four and 96h after NP injections, the GFR averaged 11.0 and 13.0 ml
min-1 g-1, respectively, values which were statistically comparable with
controls (14.0 and 14.0 ml min-1 g-1). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)
decreased 12-24h after NP injections (111 vs 123 min-1) associated with a
decreased contractility of small mesenteric arteries revealed by myography to
characterise endothelial function. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
accumulation of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles does not affect
kidney function in healthy mice but temporarily decreases blood pressure.

four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime region. Due to the symmetry of
the isolated horizon, it turns out that the boundary degrees of freedom can be
described by a SO(1,1) BF theory with sources. This provides a new alternative
approach to the usual one using Chern-Simons theory to study the black hole
entropy. To count the microscopical degrees of freedom with the boundary BF
theory, the entropy of the isolated horizon can also be calculated in the
framework of loop quantum gravity. The leading-order contribution to the
entropy coincides with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law only for a particular
choice of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, which is different from its value in
the usual approach using Chern-Simons theory. Moreover, the quantum correction
to the entropy formula is a constant term rather than a logarithmic term.

This effect is
now generally accepted to be connected with BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensation).
The dispersion relation of pressure waves in superfluid He-4 has been
determined at 1.1 {\deg}K by Yarnell et al., and exhibits a non monotonic
behavior - with a maximum and a minimum - usually explained in terms of
excitations called rotons, introduced by Landau. In the present work an attempt
is made to describe the phenomenon within the bohmian interpretation of QM. To
this end, the effects of the intermolecular potential, taken to be essentially
of the Lennard-Jones type modified to account for molecule finiteness, are
included as a Vlasov-type self-consistent field. A dispersion relation is
found, that is in quite good agreement with Yarnell's curve.

community, i.e. the community is becoming increasingly harder to penetrate. To
sustain healthy growth of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation aims to
quantitatively understand the factors that determine the editing behavior, and
explain why most new editors become inactive soon after joining. As a step
towards this broader goal, the Wikimedia foundation sponsored the ICDM (IEEE
International Conference for Data Mining) contest for the year 2011.
  The objective for the participants was to develop models to predict the
number of edits that an editor will make in future five months based on the
editing history of the editor. Here we describe the approach we followed for
developing predictive models towards this goal, the results that we obtained
and the modeling insights that we gained from this exercise. In addition,
towards the broader goal of Wikimedia Foundation, we also summarize the factors
that emerged during our model building exercise as powerful predictors of
