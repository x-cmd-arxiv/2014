Version accepted by Israel J Math",,,,"math.GR math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $\C(\Gamma)$ be the set of isomorphism classes of the finite groups that
are homomorphic images of $\Gamma$. We investigate the extent to which
$\C(\Gamma)$ determines $\Gamma$ when $\Gamma$ is a group of geometric
interest. If $\Gamma_1$ is a lattice in ${\rm{PSL}}(2,\R)$ and $\Gamma_2$ is a
lattice in any connected Lie group, then $\C(\Gamma_1) = \C(\Gamma_2)$ implies
that $\Gamma_1$ is isomorphic to $\Gamma_2$. If $F$ is a free group and
$\Gamma$ is a right-angled Artin group or a residually free group (with one
extra condition), then $\C(F)=\C(\Gamma)$ implies that $F\cong\Gamma$. If
$\Gamma_1<{\rm{PSL}}(2,\Bbb C)$ and $\Gamma_2< G$ are non-uniform arithmetic
lattices, where $G$ is a semi-simple Lie group with trivial centre and no
compact factors, then $\C(\Gamma_1)= \C(\Gamma_2)$ implies that $G \cong
{\rm{PSL}}(2,\Bbb C)$ and that $\Gamma_2$ belongs to one of finitely many
commensurability classes.
  These results are proved using the theory of profinite groups; we do not
exhibit explicit finite quotients that distinguish among the groups in
question. But in the special case of two non-isomorphic triangle groups, we
give an explicit description of finite quotients that distinguish between them.

black hole and low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$472. Reflection from the inner
accretion disk is clearly detected for the first time in this source, owing to
the sensitivity of NuSTAR. With fits to the reflection spectrum, we find
evidence for a rapidly spinning black hole, $a_{*}=0.985^{+0.005}_{-0.014}$
($1\sigma$ statistical errors). However, archival data show that the source has
relatively low radio luminosity. Recently claimed relationships between jet
power and black hole spin would predict either a lower spin or a higher peak
radio luminosity. We also report the clear detection of an absorption feature
at $7.03\pm0.03$ keV, likely signaling a disk wind. If this line arises in
dense, moderately ionized gas ($\log\xi=3.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) and is dominated by
He-like Fe XXV, the wind has a velocity of $v/c=0.043^{+0.002}_{-0.007}$
(12900$^{+600}_{-2100}$ km s$^{-1}$). If the line is instead associated with a
more highly ionized gas ($\log\xi=6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$), and is dominated by Fe
XXVI, evidence of a blue-shift is only marginal, after taking systematic errors
into account. Our analysis suggests the ionized wind may be launched within
200$-$1100 Rg, and may be magnetically driven.

investigate the general properties of these parameters in particular their
distribution and mean values. We find a mean photon index for the whole sample

keV with a standard deviation of 46 keV. This is the first time that the
cut-off energy is constrained in a such large number of AGN. We have 26
measurements of the cut-off, which corresponds to 63% of the entire sample,
distributed between 50 and 200 keV. There are a further 11 lower limits mostly
below 300 keV. Using the main parameters of the primary continuum, we have been
able to obtain the actual physical parameters of the Comptonizing region i.e.
the plasma temperature kT_e from 20 to 100 keV and the optical depth tau <4.
Finally, with the high S/N spectra starting to come from NuSTAR it will soon be
possible to better constrain the cut-off values in many AGN, allowing the
determination of more physical models and so to better understand the continuum
emission and geometry of the region surrounding black holes.

is an important challenge in communication security and has attracted
attentions of cryptographers through time. We believe that resources other than
cryptographic keys can be used for communication privacy. We consider private
message transmission (PMT) in an abstract multipath communication model between
two communicants, Alice and Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. Alice
and Bob have pre-shared keys and Eve is computationally unbounded. There are a
total of $n$ paths and the three parties can have simultaneous access to at
most $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_e$ paths. The parties can switch their paths after
every $\lambda$ bits of communication. We study perfect (P)-PMT versus
asymptotically-perfect (AP)-PMT protocols. The former has zero tolerance of
transmission error and leakage, whereas the latter allows for positive error
and leakage that tend to zero as the message length increases. We derive the
necessary and sufficient conditions under which P-PMT and AP-PMT are possible.
We also introduce explicit P-PMT and AP-PMT constructions. Our results show
AP-PMT protocols attain much higher information rates than P-PMT ones.
Interestingly, AP-PMT is possible even in poorest condition where $t_a=t_b=1$
and $t_e=n-1$. It remains however an open question whether the derived rates
can be improved by more sophisticated AP-PMT protocols.
  We study applications of our results to private communication over the
real-life scenarios of multiple-frequency links and multiple-route networks. We
show practical examples of such scenarios that can be abstracted by the
multipath setting: Our results prove the possibility of keyless
information-theoretic private message transmission at rates $17\%$ and $20\%$

different observations of the packets transmitted by a user population in one

be subject to independent on-off fading, so that each of them is either
completely faded, and then does not bring any power or interference at the
receiver, or it arrives unfaded, and then may or may not, collide with other
unfaded transmissions. With this model, a novel type of diversity is introduced
to the conventional SA scheme, leading to relevant throughput gains already for
moderate number of receivers. The analytical framework that we introduce allows
to derive closed-form expression of both throughput and packet loss rate an
arbitrary number of receivers, providing interesting hints on the key
trade-offs that characterize the system. We then focus on the problem of having
receivers forward the full set of collected packets to a final gateway using
the minimum possible amount of resources, i.e., avoiding delivery of duplicate
packets, without allowing any exchange of information among them. We derive
what is the minimum amount of resources needed and propose a scheme based on
random linear network coding that achieves asymptotically this bound without
the need for the receivers to coordinate among them.

A. Antognini et al., Science vol.339, p.417 (2013)] highlights the need to
revisit any conceivable sources of electron-muon nonuniversality in
lepton-proton interactions within the Standard Model. Superficially, a number
of perturbative processes could appear to lead to such a nonunversality. One of
these is a coupling of the scattered electron into an electronic as opposed to
a muonic vacuum polarization loop in the photon exchange of two valence quarks,
which is present only for electron projectiles as opposed to muon projectiles.
However, we can show that this effect actually is part of the radiative
correction to the proton's polarizability contribution to the Lamb shift,
equivalent to a radiative correction to double scattering. We conclude that any
conceivable genuine nonuniversality must be connected with a nonperturbative
feature of the proton's structure, e.g., with the possible presence of light
sea fermions as constituent components of the proton. If we assume an average
of roughly 0.7*10^(-7) light sea positrons per valence quark, then we can show
that virtual electron-positron annihiliation processes lead to an extra term in
the electron-proton versus muon-proton interaction, which has the right sign
and magnitude to explain the proton radius discrepancy.

Correction (FEC), is studied. Instead of sending source packets and/or parity
packets through two hops using R-DSTC as proposed in our prior work, the new
scheme delivers both source packets and parity packets using only one hop.
After the source station (access point, AP) first sends all the source packets,
the AP as well as all nodes that have received all source packets together send
the parity packets using R-DSTC. As more parity packets are transmitted, more
nodes can recover all source packets and join the parity packet transmission.
The process continues until all nodes acknowledge the receipt of enough packets
for recovering the source packets. For each given node distribution, the
optimum transmission rates for source and parity packets are determined such
that the video rate that can be sustained at all nodes is maximized. This new
scheme can support significantly higher video rates, and correspondingly higher
PSNR of decoded video, than the prior approaches. Three suboptimal approaches,
which do not require full information about user distribution or the feedback,
and hence are more feasible in practice are also presented. The proposed
suboptimal scheme with only the node count information and without feedback
still outperforms our prior approach that assumes full channel information and
no feedback.

in evaluating the mutual interference and hence the performance. Although the
Poisson point process (PPP) has been widely used to model the spatial
configuration of wireless networks, it is not suitable for networks with
repulsion. The Ginibre point process (GPP) is one of the main examples of
determinantal point processes that can be used to model random phenomena where
repulsion is observed. Considering the accuracy, tractability and
practicability tradeoffs, we introduce and promote the $\beta$-GPP, an
intermediate class between the PPP and the GPP, as a model for wireless
networks when the nodes exhibit repulsion. To show that the model leads to
analytically tractable results in several cases of interest, we derive the mean
and variance of the interference using two different approaches: the Palm
measure approach and the reduced second moment approach, and then provide
approximations of the interference distribution by three known probability
density functions. Besides, to show that the model is relevant for cellular
systems, we derive the coverage probability of the typical user and also find
that the fitted $\beta$-GPP can closely model the deployment of actual base
stations in terms of the coverage probability and other statistics.

classic problem in plasma physics. It has been given renewed attention in the
last two decades in view of experiments with complex plasmas, where charged
dust particles are often levitated in a region with strong ion flow. Efforts to
describe the shielding of the dust particles in such conditions have been
focused on the homogeneous plasma approximation, which ignores the substantial
inhomogeneity of the levitation region. We address the role of the plasma
inhomogeneity by rigorously calculating the point charge potential in the
collisionless Bohm sheath. We demonstrate that the inhomogeneity can
dramatically modify the wake, making it non-oscillatory and weaker.

the orbital period. Using a linear ephemeris, we obtained a period of

formally allowed as a solution for the companion to the Be star MWC 656 (also
known as HD 215227), although that was based on a single radial velocity curve
of the Be star, a mistaken spectral classification and rough estimates of the
inclination angle. Here we report observations of an accretion disk line
mirroring the orbit of the Be star. This, together with an improved radial
velocity curve of the Be star through fitting sharp Fe II profiles from the
equatorial disk, and a refined Be classification (to that of a B1.5-B2 III
star), reveals a black hole of 3.8 to 6.9 solar masses orbiting MWC 656, the
candidate counterpart of the gamma-ray source AGL J2241+4454. The black hole is
X-ray quiescent and fed by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow giving a
luminosity less than 1.6 x 10-7 times the Eddington luminosity. This implies
that Be binaries with black-hole companions are difficult to detect by
conventional X-ray surveys.

called chondrules. The nature of the high-temperature events that produced them
in the early solar system remains enigmatic. Beside their thermal history, one
important clue is provided by their size which shows remarkably little
variation (less than a factor of 6 for the mean chondrule radius of most
chondrites) despite the extensive range of ages and heliocentric distances
sampled. It is however unclear whether chondrule size is due to the chondrule
melting process itself, or has been simply inherited from the precursor
material, or yet results from some sorting process. I examine these different
possibilities in terms of their analytical size predictions. Unless the
chondrule-forming ""window"" was very narrow, radial sorting can be excluded as
size-determining processes because of the large variations it would predict.
Molten planetesimal collision or impact melting models, which derive chondrules
from the fragmentation of larger melt bodies, would likewise predict too much
size variability by themselves; more generally any size modification during
chondrule formation is limited in extent by evidence from compound chondrules
and the considerable compositional variability of chondrules. Turbulent
concentration would predict a low size variability but lack of evidence of any
accretion bias in carbonaceous chondrites may be difficult to reconcile with
any form of local sorting upon agglomeration. Growth by sticking (especially if
bouncing-limited) of aggregates as chondrule precursors would yield limited
variations of their final radius in space and time, and would be consistent
with the relatively similar size of other chondrite components such as
refractory inclusions. This suggests that the chondrule-melting process(es)
simply melted such nebular aggregates with little modification of mass.

time reversal which is an anti-unitary symmetry. Here we discuss a route to
gauging time reversal symmetry which applies to gapped quantum ground states
that admit a tensor network representation. The tensor network representation
of quantum states provides a notion of locality for the wave function
coefficient and hence a notion of locality for the action of complex
conjugation in anti-unitary symmetries. Based on that, we show how time
reversal can be applied locally and also describe time reversal symmetry twists
which act as gauge fluxes through nontrivial loops in the system. As with
unitary symmetries, gauging time reversal provides useful access to the

show that the flow converges exponentially fast. In general, we make use of a
suitable Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality to prove that the slowest the flow will
converge is polynomially. When the limit metric satisfies an Adams-Simon type
condition we prove that there exist flows converging to it exactly at a

new responses compared to what would be inferred using the standard form
factors to model the energy dependence of the response. For heavy targets such
as xenon and germanium, the behavior of the new nuclear responses as recoil
energy increases can be substantially different than that of the standard
responses, but this has almost no impact on the constraints derived from
experiments such as LUX, XENON100 and CDMS since the maximum nuclear recoil
energy detected in these experiments is relatively low. We simulate mock data
for 80 and 250 GeV DM candidates utilizing the new nuclear responses to
highlight how they might affect a putative signal, and find the new responses
are most important for momentum-suppressed interactions such as the magnetic
dipole or pseudoscalar-mediated interaction when the target is relatively heavy

situ from high-mass disks. By fitting a disk profile to the entire population
of Kepler planet candidates, Chiang & Laughlin (2013) constructed a
""minimum-mass extrasolar nebula"" with surface density profile Sigma r^-1.6.
Here we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume a
universal disk profile. Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet
candidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density
profiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By
simulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems
designed to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that
a universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather,
the underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broad
range of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a
narrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of
terrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial
distribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must
therefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not
have predominantly formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disk
slopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to the
gas in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks. A plausible mechanism is inward
type 1 migration of Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryos, perhaps followed by
a final assembly phase.

outflow history. We present the first optical to near-infrared (NIR)
VLT/X-shooter spectra of the jet from the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We
determine physical conditions in the knots, as well as their kinematic ""launch

regular interval of ~16 yr. The velocity dispersion versus jet velocity and the
energy input are comparable in both lobes. However, the mass loss rate,
velocity, and shock conditions are asymmetric. We find Mjet/Macc ~ 0.01-0.1,
consistent with magneto-centrifugal jet launching models. No evidence for dust
is found in the high-velocity jet, suggesting it is launched within the
sublimation radius (<0.5 au). The jet inclination measured from proper motions
and radial velocities confirms it is perpendicular to the disk. A tentative
relation is found between the structure of the jet and the photometric
variability of the source. Episodes of NIR brightening were previously detected
and attributed to a dusty disk wind. We report for the first time significant
optical fadings lasting from a few days up to a year, coinciding with the NIR
brightenings. These are likely caused by dust lifted high above the disk plane;
this supports the disk wind scenario. The disk wind is launched at a larger
radius than the high-velocity atomic jet, although their outflow variability
may have a common origin. No significant relation between outflow and accretion
variability could be established. Our findings confirm that this source
undergoes periodic ejection events, which may be coupled with dust ejections
above the disk plane.

redshift surveys, but these effects can degrade galaxy counts-in-cells and
density estimates. We carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill the
gaps to correct for the systematic effects. Our study is motivated by the
analysis of the VIMOS Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), a flux-limited
survey (i<22.5) based on one-pass observations with VIMOS, with gaps covering
25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%. Our findings are
applicable to other surveys with similar observing strategies. We compare 1)
two algorithms based on photometric redshift, that assign redshifts to galaxies
based on the spectroscopic redshifts of the nearest neighbours, 2) two Bayesian
methods, the Wiener filter and the Poisson-Lognormal filter. Using galaxy mock
catalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements on
scales of R=5 and 8 Mpc/h after applying each of these methods. We also study
how they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneous
and sparse sampling rate. We find that in VIPERS the errors in counts-in-cells
measurements on R<10 Mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of the
sample. All methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. This
systematic bias is of the same order as random errors. No method outperforms
the others. Random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. We show
that it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5
Mpc/h at redshifts 0.5<z<1.1, over a large volume such as in VIPERS survey.
This is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations
(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts.

properties such as effective temperatures, radii and surface gravities. While
interferometric measurements of stellar angular diameters are the most direct
method to gauge these, they are still limited to relatively nearby and bright
stars, which are saturated in most of the modern photometric surveys. This
dichotomy prevents us from safely extending well calibrated relations to the
faint stars targeted in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we
alleviate this obstacle by presenting SAAO near-infrared JHK observations of 55
stars: 16 of them have interferometric angular diameters, and the rest are in
common with the 2MASS (unsaturated) dataset, allowing us to tie the effective
temperatures and angular diameters derived via the Infrared Flux Method to the
interferometric scale. We extend the test to recent interferometric
measurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars, including giants, and the metal-poor
benchmark target HD122563. With a critical evaluation of the systematics
involved, we conclude that a 1% accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is
usually within reach. Caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing a
temperature scale via colour relations, as well as when assessing the
reliability of interferometric measurements, especially at sub-milliarcsec
level. As a result, rather different effective temperature scales can be
compatible with a given subset of interferometric data. We highlight some
caveats to be aware of in such a quest, and suggest a simple method to check
against systematics in fundamental measurements. A new diagnostic combination
seismic radii with astrometric distances is also presented.

this galaxy an ideal target to test different theories of spiral arm dynamics.
Taking advantage of the new high resolution PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey

quantify the origin and nature of the non-circular motions. Using a tilted-ring
analysis supported by several other archival datasets we update the estimation
of M51's position angle (PA=(173 +/- 3) deg) and inclination (i=(22 +/- 5)
deg). Harmonic decomposition of the high resolution (40 pc) CO velocity field
shows the first kinematic evidence of an m=3 wave in the inner disk of M51 with
a corotation at R(CR,m=3)=1.1 +/- 0.1 kpc and a pattern speed of Omega_p(m=3) =
140 km/(s kpc). This mode seems to be excited by the nuclear bar, while the
beat frequencies generated by the coupling between the m=3 mode and the main
spiral structure confirm its density-wave nature. We observe also a signature
of an m=1 mode that is likely responsible for the lopsidedness of M51 at small
and large radii. We provide a simple method to estimate the radial variation of
the amplitude of the spiral perturbation (Vsp) attributed to the different
modes. The main spiral arm structure has <Vsp>=50-70 km/s, while the streaming
velocity associated with the m=1 and m=3 modes is, in general, 2 times lower.
Our joint analysis of HI and CO velocity fields at low and high spatial
resolution reveals that the atomic and molecular gas phases respond differently
to the spiral perturbation due to their different vertical distribution and
emission morphology.

its data and their related analytics tasks to a cloud. When data are sensitive,
it is in the interest of the entity to outsource encrypted data to the cloud;
however, this limits the types of operations that can be performed on the cloud
side. Especially, evaluating queries over the encrypted data stored on the
cloud without the entity performing any computation and without ever decrypting
the data become a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose solutions
to conduct range queries over outsourced encrypted data. The existing methods
leak valuable information to the cloud which can violate the security guarantee
of the underlying encryption schemes. In general, the main security primitive
used to evaluate range queries is secure comparison (SC) of encrypted integers.
However, we observe that the existing SC protocols are not very efficient. To
this end, we first propose a novel SC scheme that takes encrypted integers and
outputs encrypted comparison result. We empirically show its practical
advantage over the current state-of-the-art. We then utilize the proposed SC
scheme to construct two new secure range query protocols. Our protocols protect
data confidentiality, privacy of user's query, and also preserve the semantic
security of the encrypted data; therefore, they are more secure than the
existing protocols. Furthermore, our second protocol is lightweight at the user
end, and it can allow an authorized user to use any device with limited storage
and computing capability to perform the range queries over outsourced encrypted
data.

simulations include three WDM models with thermal-production masses of 0.8 keV,
1.3 keV, and 2.6 keV, as well as CDM. Assuming a relationship between dark halo
mass and galaxy luminosity that is set by the observed luminosity function at
bright magnitudes, we find that 0.8 keV WDM is disfavored by direct galaxy
counts in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field at $>\!\!10\sigma$. Similarly, 1.3 keV
WDM is statistically inconsistent at $2.2\sigma$. Future observations with JWST
(and possibly HST via the Frontier Fields) could rule out $1.3$ keV WDM at high
significance, and may be sensitive to WDM masses greater than 2.6 keV. We also
examine the ability of galaxies in these WDM models to reionize the universe,
and find that 0.8 keV and 1.3 keV WDM produce optical depths to the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) that are inconsistent at 68% C.L. with current
Planck results, even with extremely high ionizing radiation escape fractions,
and 2.6 keV WDM requires an optimistic escape fraction to yield an optical
depth consistent with Planck data. Although CMB optical depth calculations are
model dependent, we find a strong challenge for stellar processes alone to
reionize the universe in a 0.8 keV and 1.3 keV WDM cosmology.

individual transitions between pairs of states. In contrast, the probability of
survival in the ground state at long time shows a novel, non-monotonic,
functional form, with an oscillatory behavior in the sweep rate at low sweep
rate values. We contrast the behavior of this open-multistate model to other
generalized Landau-Zener models incorporating an environment: the stochastic
Landau-Zener model and the dissipative case, where energy dissipation and
thermal excitations affect the adiabatic region. Finally, we present evidence
that the continuum of states may act to shield the two-state Landau-Zener

ago. They are based on a modification of standard quantum mechanics in which
nonlinear and stochastic terms are added to the evolution equation. Their
principal merits derive from the fact that they are mathematically precise
schemes accounting, on the basis of a unique universal dynamical principle,
both for the quantum behavior of microscopic systems as well as for the
reduction associated to measurement processes and for the classical behavior of
macroscopic objects. Since such theories qualify themselves not as new
interpretations but as modifications of the standard theory they can be, in
principle, tested against quantum mechanics. Recently, various investigations
identifying possible crucial test have been discussed. In spite of the extreme
difficulty to perform such tests it seems that recent technological
developments allow at least to put precise limits on the parameters
characterizing the modifications of the evolution equation. Here we will simply
mention some of the recent investigations in this direction, while we will
mainly concentrate our attention to the way in which collapse theories account
for definite perceptual process. The differences between the case of reductions
induced by perceptions and those related to measurement procedures by means of
standard macroscopic devices will be discussed. On this basis, we suggest a
precise experimental test of collapse theories involving conscious observers.
We make plausible, by discussing in detail a toy model, that the modified
dynamics can give rise to quite small but systematic errors in the visual
perceptual process.

missed in X-ray surveys. To do so we used two samples of luminous AGN
independently selected in hard X-ray and optical surveys. We used the largest

quantitative comparisons with a vast body of condensed phase data, spanning a

their quantum effects compete with those of the stretching mode for certain

to select a subset of customers, each one being associated with a profit, and
to design service itineraries. When the sum of profits is maximized under
distance constraints, the problem is usually called team orienteering problem.
The capacitated profitable tour problem seeks to maximize profits minus travel
costs under capacity constraints. Finally, in the VRP with private fleet and
common carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subject
to a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customers
selection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route.
  We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems which explores an
exponential number of solutions in pseudo polynomial time. The search is
conducted with standard VRP neighborhoods on an ""exhaustive"" solution
representation, visiting all customers. Since visiting all customers is usually
infeasible or sub-optimal, an efficient ""Select"" algorithm, based on resource
constrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used on any new route to find the
optimal subsequence of visits to customers. The good performance of these
neighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experiments
with a local search, an iterated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm.
Intriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum of
this neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0.09% on classic team orienteering
benchmark instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics.
Promising research avenues on hybridizations with more standard routing
neighborhoods are also open.

periodic arrays. They can be designed to interact with electromagnetic
radiation in many different and interesting ways such as allowing radiation to
experience a negative refractive index (NRI). We have used this technique to
design and build a quasi-optical Half Wave Plate (HWP) that exhibits a large
birefringence by virtue of having a positive refractive index in one axis and a
NRI in the other. Previous implementations of such NRI-HWP have been narrow
band ($\sim$1-3%) due to the inherent reliance on needing a resonance to create
the NRI region. We manufacture a W-band prototype of a novel HWP that uses the
Pancharatnam method to extend the bandwidth (up to more than twice) of a usual
NRI-HWP. Our simulated and experimentally obtained results despite their
differences show that a broadening of a flat region of the phase difference is
possible even with the initially steep gradient for a single plate.

account for this behaviour using the ""pumpistor"" model which allows for

large amplification bandwidth up to 700 MHz giving near quantum-limited

in elastic frictionless non-adhesive contact. We study the evolution of the
true contact area under increasing squeezing pressure. Rough surfaces are
squeezed from zero up to full contact, which enables us to compare the
numerical results both with asperity based models at light pressures and with
Persson's contact model for the entire range of pressures. Through the contact
perimeter we estimate the error bounds inherent to contact area calculation in
discrete problems.
  A large number of roughness realizations enables us to compute reliably the
derivative of the contact area with respect to the pressure. In contrast to
Persson's model and in agreement with asperity based models, we demonstrate
that at light pressures it is a decreasing convex function. The nonlinearity of
the contact area evolution, preserved for the entire range of pressures, is
especially strong close to infinitesimal contact. This fact makes difficult an
accurate investigation of contact at light pressure and prevents the evaluation
of the proportionality coefficient, which is predicted by analytical models. A
good agreement of numerical results with Persson's model is obtained for the
shape of the area-pressure curve especially near full contact. We investigate
the effects of the cutoff wavenumbers in surface spectrum onto the contact area
evolution. Nayak's parameter is one of the central characteristics of
roughness, it also plays an important role in rough contact mechanics, but its
effect is significantly weaker than predicted by asperity based models. We give
a detailed derivation of a new phenomenological contact evolution law; also we
derive formulae that link Nayak's parameter and density of asperities with
Hurst exponent and cutoffs wavenumbers.

conjecture that there exist such $[n,k]_q$ MDS codes as long as $q \geq n + k -

MDS condition, which can be verified in polynomial time. We propose a
combinatorial approach to tackle the conjecture, and prove that the conjecture
holds for a special case when the sets of zero coordinates of rows of the

Based on our numerical result, the conjecture is also verified for all $k \leq

plausible results compared with that of traditional classifiers such as the
support vector machine (SVM). Recently, by incorporating additional structured
sparsity priors, the second generation SRCs have appeared in the literature and
are reported to further improve the performance of HSI. These priors are based
on exploiting the spatial dependencies between the neighboring pixels, the
inherent structure of the dictionary, or both. In this paper, we review and
compare several structured priors for sparse-representation-based HSI
classification. We also propose a new structured prior called the low rank

entanglement in one-dimensional topological states by showing that local
quantum circuits of linear depth are necessary to generate them from product
states. We establish this linear lower bound for both bosonic and fermionic
one-dimensional topological phases and use symmetric circuits for phases with
symmetry. We also show that the linear lower bound can be saturated by
explicitly constructing circuits generating these topological states. The same
results hold for local quantum circuits connecting topological states in
different phases.

a distribution of atomic Boolean variables to individual agents -- the choices
available to a coalition correspond to assignments to the variables the
coalition controls. The basic modal constructs of DCL-PC are of the form
coalition C can cooperate to bring about phi. DCL-PC extends CL-PC with dynamic
logic modalities in which atomic programs are of the form agent i gives control
of variable p to agent j; as usual in dynamic logic, these atomic programs may
be combined using sequence, iteration, choice, and test operators to form
complex programs. By combining such dynamic transfer programs with cooperation
modalities, it becomes possible to reason about how the power of agents and
coalitions is affected by the transfer of control. We give two alternative
semantics for the logic: a direct semantics, in which we capture the
distributions of Boolean variables to agents; and a more conventional Kripke
semantics. We prove that these semantics are equivalent, and then present an
axiomatization for the logic. We investigate the computational complexity of
model checking and satisfiability for DCL-PC, and show that both problems are
PSPACE-complete (and hence no worse than the underlying logic CL-PC). Finally,

between first-order control -- the ability of an agent or coalition to control
some state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under
the control of the agent or coalition -- and second-order control -- the
ability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by
transferring variables to other agents. We give a logical characterisation of

paper, we study an alternate formulation of DEC-POMDPs relying on a
sequence-form representation of policies. From this formulation, we show how to

Through an experimental validation on classical test problems from the

show that mathematical programming outperforms dynamic programming but is less

contributions of this work are the use of mathematical programming for

helpful for designing novel algorithms looking for approximate solutions to

adequate manner. The present work is about changing action domain descriptions
in multimodal logic. Its contribution is threefold: first we revisit the
semantics of action theory contraction proposed in previous work, giving more
robust operators that express minimal change based on a notion of distance
between Kripke-models. Second we give algorithms for syntactical action theory
contraction and establish their correctness with respect to our semantics for
those action theories that satisfy a principle of modularity investigated in
previous work. Since modularity can be ensured for every action theory and, as
we show here, needs to be computed at most once during the evolution of a
domain description, it does not represent a limitation at all to the method
here studied. Finally we state AGM-like postulates for action theory
contraction and assess the behavior of our operators with respect to them.

core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic derived from landmarks,
propositional formulas that must be true in every solution of a planning task.
LAMA builds on the Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather
than binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter is employed
to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known FF
heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality
solutions in the case where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search
is used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner continues to
search for plans of better quality until the search is terminated. LAMA showed
best performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the
International Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we present the system in
detail and investigate which features of LAMA are crucial for its performance.
We present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition,
demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in LAMA.
Overall, we find that using landmarks improves performance, whereas the
incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be
beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far
more problems, raising the question of how to deal with action costs more
effectively in the future. The iterated weighted A* search greatly improves
results, and shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.

characters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief.
Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional
agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique
for solving the narrative generation problem -- to find a sound and believable
sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a
world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement
search planning algorithm -- the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL)
planner -- that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression,
reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals
that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those
characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical
evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL
algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than
plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.

notion of (additive) implicit abstractions, in which the planning task is
abstracted by instances of tractable fragments of optimal planning. We then
introduce a concrete setting of this framework, called fork-decomposition, that

powerful adjunct to symbolic reasoning based on language-like representations.
The research reported in this paper is a contribution to building a general
purpose DR system as an extension to a SOAR-like problem solving architecture.
The work is in a framework in which DR is modeled as a process where subtasks
are solved, as appropriate, either by inference from symbolic representations
or by interaction with a diagram, i.e., perceiving specified information from a
diagram or modifying/creating objects in a diagram in specified ways according
to problem solving needs. The perceptions and actions in most DR systems built
so far are hand-coded for the specific application, even when the rest of the
system is built using the general architecture. The absence of a general
framework for executing perceptions/actions poses as a major hindrance to using
them opportunistically -- the essence of open-ended search in problem solving.
Our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified
perceptions and actions across tasks/domains without human intervention. We
observe that the domain/task-specific visual perceptions/actions can be
transformed into domain/task-independent spatial problems. We specify a spatial
problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain
using an open-ended vocabulary of properties, relations and actions involving
three kinds of diagrammatic objects -- points, curves, regions. Solving a
spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent
simplified quantifier-free expression, the complexity of which is inherently
doubly exponential. We represent objects as configuration of simple elements to
facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar
subproblems. We show that, if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be
expressed concisely, quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in
low-order polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems. This
requires determining the similarity of two problems, the existence of a mapping
between them computable in polynomial time, and designing a memory for storing
previously solved problems so as to facilitate search. The efficacy of the idea
is shown by time complexity analysis. We demonstrate the proposed approach by
executing perceptions and actions involved in DR tasks in two army
applications.

issue of stability in this setting. In particular, we introduce a notion of the
core, which generalizes the corresponding notion in the traditional

characterize the elements of the core, and show that any element of the core
maximizes the social welfare. We also introduce a concept of balancedness for

of convexity to our setting, and show that under some natural assumptions
convex games have a non-empty core. Moreover, we introduce two alternative
notions of stability in OCF that allow a wider range of deviations, and explore
the relationships among the corresponding definitions of the core, as well as

(2SAC), as well as their conservative and strong variants. Interestingly, dual
consistency is an original property that can be established by using the
outcome of the enforcement of generalized arc consistency (GAC), which makes it
rather easy to obtain since constraint solvers typically maintain GAC during
search. On binary constraint networks, DC is equivalent to PC, but its
restriction to existing constraints, called conservative dual consistency
(CDC), is strictly stronger than traditional conservative consistencies derived
from path consistency, namely partial path consistency (PPC) and conservative
path consistency (CPC). After introducing a general algorithm to enforce strong
(C)DC, we present the results of an experimentation over a wide range of

recently received a lot of interest, mostly for its applications in formal
verification. However, propositional logic is often not expressive enough for
representing many interesting verification problems, which can be more
naturally addressed in the framework of Satisfiability Modulo Theories, SMT.
Surprisingly, the problem of finding unsatisfiable cores in SMT has received
very little attention in the literature. In this paper we present a novel
approach to this problem, called the Lemma-Lifting approach. The main idea is
to combine an SMT solver with an external propositional core extractor. The SMT
solver produces the theory lemmas found during the search, dynamically lifting
the suitable amount of theory information to the Boolean level. The core
extractor is then called on the Boolean abstraction of the original SMT problem
and of the theory lemmas. This results in an unsatisfiable core for the
original SMT problem, once the remaining theory lemmas are removed. The
approach is conceptually interesting, and has several advantages in practice.
In fact, it is extremely simple to implement and to update, and it can be
interfaced with every propositional core extractor in a plug-and-play manner,
so as to benefit for free of all unsat-core reduction techniques which have
been or will be made available.
  We have evaluated our algorithm with a very extensive empirical test on
SMT-LIB benchmarks, which confirms the validity and potential of this approach.

In numerous planning problems these functions provide good guidance to the

misguiding or when planning problems are large enough, lots of node evaluations
must be computed, which severely limits the scalability of heuristic planners.
In this paper, we present a novel solution for reducing node evaluations in
heuristic planning based on machine learning. Particularly, we define the task
of learning search control for heuristic planning as a relational
classification task, and we use an off-the-shelf relational classification tool
to address this learning task. Our relational classification task captures the
preferred action to select in the different planning contexts of a specific
planning domain. These planning contexts are defined by the set of helpful
actions of the current state, the goals remaining to be achieved, and the
static predicates of the planning task. This paper shows two methods for
guiding the search of a heuristic planner with the learned classifiers. The
first one consists of using the resulting classifier as an action policy. The
second one consists of applying the classifier to generate lookahead states
within a Best First Search algorithm. Experiments over a variety of domains
reveal that our heuristic planner using the learned classifiers solves larger
problems than state-of-the-art planners.

games is that security forces (leaders), acting first, commit to a randomized
strategy; while their adversaries (followers) choose their best response after
surveillance of this randomized strategy. Yet, in many situations, a leader may
face uncertainty about the follower's surveillance capability. Previous work
fails to address how a leader should compute her strategy given such
uncertainty. We provide five contributions in the context of a general class of
security games. First, we show that the Nash equilibria in security games are
interchangeable, thus alleviating the equilibrium selection problem. Second,
under a natural restriction on security games, any Stackelberg strategy is also
a Nash equilibrium strategy; and furthermore, the solution is unique in a class
of security games of which ARMOR is a key exemplar. Third, when faced with a
follower that can attack multiple targets, many of these properties no longer
hold. Fourth, we show experimentally that in most (but not all) games where the
restriction does not hold, the Stackelberg strategy is still a Nash equilibrium
strategy, but this is no longer true when the attacker can attack multiple
targets. Finally, as a possible direction for future research, we propose an

measurements of the system until the faults causing the abnormality are

heuristic based on reducing the entropy over a computed set of diagnoses. This
approach generally has good performance in terms of diagnostic cost, but can
fail to diagnose large systems when the set of diagnoses is too large. Focusing
on a smaller set of probable diagnoses scales the approach but generally leads
to increased average diagnostic costs. In this paper, we propose a new
diagnostic framework employing four new techniques, which scales to much larger
systems with good performance in terms of diagnostic cost. First, we propose a
new heuristic for measurement point selection that can be computed efficiently,
without requiring the set of diagnoses, once the system is modeled as a
Bayesian network and compiled into a logical form known as d-DNNF. Second, we
extend hierarchical diagnosis, a technique based on system abstraction from our
previous work, to handle probabilities so that it can be applied to sequential
diagnosis to allow larger systems to be diagnosed. Third, for the largest
systems where even hierarchical diagnosis fails, we propose a novel method that
converts the system into one that has a smaller abstraction and whose diagnoses
form a superset of those of the original system; the new system can then be
diagnosed and the result mapped back to the original system. Finally, we
propose a novel cost estimation function which can be used to choose an
abstraction of the system that is more likely to provide optimal average cost.
Experiments with ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits indicate that our approach scales
to all circuits in the suite except one that has a flat structure not

a partial instantiation of the target variables that maximizes the generalized
Bayes factor (GBF) as the best explanation for the given evidence. Our study
shows that GBF has several theoretical properties that enable MRE to
automatically identify the most relevant target variables in forming its

of a new explanation conditioned on an existing explanation, provides a soft
measure on the degree of relevance of the variables in the new explanation in
explaining the evidence given the existing explanation. As a result, MRE is
able to automatically prune less relevant variables from its explanation. We
also show that CBF is able to capture well the explaining-away phenomenon that
is often represented in Bayesian networks. Moreover, we define two dominance
relations between the candidate solutions and use the relations to generalize
MRE to find a set of top explanations that is both diverse and representative.

to restart the algorithm when no progress is observed. Alternatively, one can
start multiple instances of a local search algorithm, and allocate
computational resources (in particular, processing time) to the instances
depending on their behavior. Hence, a multi-start strategy has to decide
(dynamically) when to allocate additional resources to a particular instance
and when to start new instances. In this paper we propose multi-start
strategies motivated by works on multi-armed bandit problems and Lipschitz
optimization with an unknown constant. The strategies continuously estimate the
potential performance of each algorithm instance by supposing a convergence
rate of the local search algorithm up to an unknown constant, and in every
phase allocate resources to those instances that could converge to the optimum
for a particular range of the constant. Asymptotic bounds are given on the
performance of the strategies. In particular, we prove that at most a quadratic
increase in the number of times the target function is evaluated is needed to
achieve the performance of a local search algorithm started from the attraction
region of the optimum. Experiments are provided using SPSA (Simultaneous

We define a dominance relation that allows us to compare collections of objects
in terms of preferences over attributes of the objects that make up the
collection. We establish some key properties of the dominance relation. In
particular, we show that the dominance relation is a strict partial order when
the intra-attribute preference relations are strict partial orders and the
relative importance preference relation is an interval order.
  We provide algorithms that use this dominance relation to identify the set of
most preferred collections. We show that under certain conditions, the
algorithms are guaranteed to return only (sound), all (complete), or at least
one (weakly complete) of the most preferred collections. We present results of
simulation experiments comparing the proposed algorithms with respect to (a)
the quality of solutions (number of most preferred solutions) produced by the
algorithms, and (b) their performance and efficiency. We also explore some
interesting conjectures suggested by the results of our experiments that relate
the properties of the user preferences, the dominance relation, and the
algorithms.

investigations by Delgrande on contraction for Horn logic. We show that the
standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the Horn
case. This result stands in contrast to Delgrande's conjecture that orderly
maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for Horn logic. We then
define a more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the Horn case,
influenced by the convexity property holding for full propositional logic and
which we refer to as infra contraction. The main contribution of this work is a
result which shows that the construction method for Horn contraction for belief
sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to Hansson's
classical kernel contraction for belief sets, when restricted to Horn logic.
This result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases. We
prove that kernel contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same
results as the belief base version of infra contraction. The use of belief
bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the conjecture that Horn
belief change is best viewed as a hybrid version of belief set change and
belief base change. One of the consequences of the link with base contraction
is the provision of a representation result for Horn contraction for belief
sets in which a version of the Core-retainment postulate features.

years, mainly due to its immediate relevance to various security applications.
In this problem, robots are required to repeatedly visit a target area in a way
that maximizes their chances of detecting an adversary trying to penetrate
through the patrol path. When facing a strong adversary that knows the patrol
strategy of the robots, if the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm,
then in many cases it is easy for the adversary to penetrate undetected (in
fact, in some of those cases the adversary can guarantee penetration).
Therefore this paper presents a non-deterministic patrol framework for the
robots. Assuming that the strong adversary will take advantage of its knowledge
and try to penetrate through the patrols weakest spot, hence an optimal
algorithm is one that maximizes the chances of detection in that point. We
therefore present a polynomial-time algorithm for determining an optimal patrol
under the Markovian strategy assumption for the robots, such that the
probability of detecting the adversary in the patrols weakest spot is
maximized. We build upon this framework and describe an optimal patrol strategy
for several robotic models based on their movement abilities (directed or
undirected) and sensing abilities (perfect or imperfect), and in different
environment models - either patrol around a perimeter (closed polygon) or an
open fence (open polyline).

applications. Running a centralized search such as A* in the combined state
space of all units is complete and cost-optimal, but scales poorly, as the
state space size is exponential in the number of mobile units. Traditional
decentralized approaches, such as FAR and WHCA*, are faster and more scalable,
being based on problem decomposition. However, such methods are incomplete and
provide no guarantees with respect to the running time or the solution quality.
They are not necessarily able to tell in a reasonable time whether they would
succeed in finding a solution to a given instance. We introduce MAPP, a
tractable algorithm for multi-agent path planning on undirected graphs. We
present a basic version and several extensions. They have low-polynomial
worst-case upper bounds for the running time, the memory requirements, and the
length of solutions. Even though all algorithmic versions are incomplete in the
general case, each provides formal guarantees on problems it can solve. For
each version, we discuss the algorithms completeness with respect to clearly
defined subclasses of instances. Experiments were run on realistic game grid
maps. MAPP solved 99.86% of all mobile units, which is 18--22% better than the
percentage of FAR and WHCA*. MAPP marked 98.82% of all units as provably
solvable during the first stage of plan computation. Parts of MAPPs computation
can be re-used across instances on the same map. Speed-wise, MAPP is
competitive or significantly faster than WHCA*, depending on whether MAPP
performs all computations from scratch. When data that MAPP can re-use are
preprocessed offline and readily available, MAPP is slower than the very fast
FAR algorithm by a factor of 2.18 on average. MAPPs solutions are on average
20% longer than FARs solutions and 7--31% longer than WHCA*s solutions.

Centrality (relevance) is determined by considering the whole input source (and
not only local information), and by taking into account the existence of minor
topics or lateral subjects in the information sources to be summarized. The
method consists in creating, for each passage of the input source, a support
set consisting only of the most semantically related passages. Then, the
determination of the most relevant content is achieved by selecting the
passages that occur in the largest number of support sets. This model produces
extractive summaries that are generic, and language- and domain-independent.
Thorough automatic evaluation shows that the method achieves state-of-the-art

natural applications to sports scheduling, especially for leagues such as the
National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel long distances

small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated
from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our

Japan, producing a provably-optimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of
total team travel, a 16% reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by

to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, ILAO*
and variants of RTDP are state-of-the-art ones. These methods use reachability
analysis and heuristic search to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none
of these approaches build the graphical structure of the state transitions in a
pre-processing step or use the structural information to systematically
decompose a problem, whereby generating an intelligent backup sequence of the
state space. In this paper, we present two optimal MDP algorithms. The first
algorithm, topological value iteration (TVI), detects the structure of MDPs and
backs up states based on topological sequences. It (1) divides an MDP into
strongly-connected components (SCCs), and (2) solves these components
sequentially. TVI outperforms VI and other state-of-the-art algorithms vastly
when an MDP has multiple, close-to-equal-sized SCCs. The second algorithm,
focused topological value iteration (FTVI), is an extension of TVI. FTVI
restricts its attention to connected components that are relevant for solving
the MDP. Specifically, it uses a small amount of heuristic search to eliminate
provably sub-optimal actions; this pruning allows FTVI to find smaller
connected components, thus running faster. We demonstrate that FTVI outperforms
TVI by an order of magnitude, averaged across several domains. Surprisingly,
FTVI also significantly outperforms popular heuristically-informed MDP
algorithms such as ILAO*, LRTDP, BRTDP and Bayesian-RTDP in many domains,
sometimes by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we characterize the
type of domains where FTVI excels --- suggesting a way to an informed choice of

NB921 data taken with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope of a galaxy cluster,
XMMXCS J2215.9-1738, at z=1.46 and its surrounding structures. We obtain
redshifts for 170 [OII] emission line galaxies at z~1.46, among which 41
galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed with MOIRCS and FMOS on the Subaru
mainly, showing an accuracy of $\sigma$((z-z_spec})/(1+z_spec))=0.002. This
allows us to reveal filamentary structures that penetrate towards the centre of
the galaxy cluster and intersect with other structures, consistent with the
picture of hierarchical cluster formation. We also find that the projected
celestial distribution does not precisely trace the real distribution of
galaxies, indicating the importance of the three dimensional view of structures
to properly identify and quantify galaxy environments. We investigate the
environmental dependence of galaxy properties with local density, confirming
that the median colour of galaxies becomes redder in higher density region
while the star-formation rate of star-forming galaxies does not depend strongly
on local environment in this structure. This implies that the star-forming
activity in galaxies is truncated on a relatively short time scale in the
cluster centre.

molecular adhesion bond from force fluctuations observed in force ramp
experiments is discussed. For small loading rates the system undergoes a
limited number of unbinding and rebinding transitions observable in the
so-called force versus extension (FE) curves. The statistics of these transient
fluctuations can be utilized to estimate the parameters for the rebinding rate.
This is relevant in the experimentally important situation where the direct
observation of the reversed FE-curves is hampered, e.g. due to the presence of
soft linkers. I generalize the stochastic theory of the kinetics in two-state
models to the case of time-dependent kinetic rates and compute the relevant
distributions of characteristic forces. While for irreversible systems there is
an intrinsic relation between the rupture force distribution and the population
of the free-energy well of the bound state, the situation is slightly more
complex if reversible systems are considered. For a two-state model, a
'stationary' rupture force distribution that is proportional to the population
can be defined and allows to consistently discuss quantities averaged over the
transient fluctuations. While irreversible systems are best analyzed in the
soft spring limit of small pulling device stiffness and large loading rates,
here I argue to use the stiffness of the pulling device as a control parameter
in addition to the loading rate.

discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA) and
L-natural-convex stochastic approximation (L-natural-convex SA). Through

in the interstellar medium (ISM). We present our evolution models for the
abundance of PAHs in the ISM on a galaxy-evolution timescale. We consider
shattering of carbonaceous dust grains in interstellar turbulence as the
formation mechanism of PAHs while the PAH abundance can be reduced by
coagulation onto dust grains, destruction by supernova shocks, and
incorporation into stars. We implement these processes in a one-zone chemical
evolution model to obtain the evolution of the PAH abundance in a galaxy. We
find that PAH formation becomes accelerated above certain metallicity where
shattering becomes efficient. For PAH destruction, while supernova shock is the
primary mechanism in the metal-poor environment, coagulation is dominant in the
metal-rich environment. We compare the evolution of the PAH abundances in our
models with observed abundances in galaxies with a wide metallicity range. Our
models reproduce both the paucity of PAH detection in low metallicity galaxies
and the metallicity-dependence of the PAH abundance in high-metallicity
galaxies. The strong metallicity dependence of PAH abundance appears as a
result of the strong metallicity dependence of the dust mass increase by the
accretion of metals onto dust grains, which are eventually shattered into PAHs.
We conclude that the observational trend of the PAH abundance can be a natural
consequence of shattering of carbonaceous grains being the source of PAHs. To
establish our scenario of PAH formation, observational evidence of PAH
formation by shattering would be crucial.

measurement of the sound field as side information. The node's measurement and
the estimates of the source resulting from decoding the received messages are
then jointly encoded and transmitted to a neighboring node in the network. We
show that for this distributed source coding scenario, one can encode a
so-called conditional sufficient statistic of the sources instead of jointly
encoding multiple sources. We focus on the case where node measurements are in
form of noisy linearly mixed combinations of the sources and the acoustic
channel mixing matrices are invertible. For this problem, we derive the

In
particular, we take into account Toral's version of collective Parrondo's
paradoxical games, in which the redistribution of capital between agents, who
can play different strategies, creates a positive trend of increasing capital.
In this framework, we insert two categories of players, altruistic and selfish
ones, and see how they interact and how their capital evolves. More in detail,
we analyse the positive effects of altruistic behaviour, but we also point out
how selfish players take advantage of that situation. The general result is
that altruistic behaviour is discouraged, because selfish players get richer
while altruistic ones get poorer. We also consider a smarter way of being
altruistic, based on reputation, called ""selective altruism"", which prevents
selfish players from taking advantage of altruistic ones. In this new situation
it is altruism, and not selfishness, to be encouraged and stabilized. Finally,
we introduce a mechanism of imitation between players and study how it
influences the composition of the population of both altruistic and selfish
players as a function of time for different initial conditions and network
topologies adopted.

based on the deformed Woods-Saxon potential. Ground states are found by
minimizing energy over deformations and configurations. Pairing in odd
particle-number systems is treated either by blocking or by adding the BCS
energy of the odd quasiparticle. Three new parameters are introduced which may
be interpreted as the constant mean pairing energies for even-odd, odd-even and
odd-odd nuclei. They are adjusted by a fit to masses of heavy nuclei. Other
parameters of the model, fixed previously by fitting masses of even-even heavy
nuclei, are kept unchanged. With this adjustment, the masses of SH nuclei are
predicted and then used to calculate $\alpha$-decay energies to be compared to
known measured values. It turns out that the agreement between calculated
$Q_{\alpha}$ values with data in SH nuclei is better than in the region of the
mass fit. The model overestimates $Q_{\alpha}$ for $Z=111-113$. Ground state
(g.s.) configurations in some SH nuclei hint to a possible $\alpha$-decay

precisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by
$\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\lambda$ is a fixed rational number
greater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs
on it. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially
for infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption that earlier weights are more
important than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of NDAs, which is
often essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We
provide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor
is determinizable. We complete the picture by proving that the integers
characterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: for
every nonintegral rational discount factor $\lambda$, there is a
nondeterminizable $\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with
integral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min,
max, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for
deterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization,
which is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show
that the naive approach, of unfolding the automaton computations up to a
sufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount factor. We provide an
alternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly
exponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of
states. We also prove matching lower bounds, showing that the exponential
dependency on each of these three parameters cannot be avoided. All our results

proposed a constraint on the structure of asymptotically-free field theories.
This constraint limits the number of degrees of freedom of asymptotically-free
gauge theories in the infrared ($IR$) region relative to those in the
ultra-violet ($UV$) region. In their paper ACS checked various examples, both
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric, but checked only one case of interacting
$IR$ fixed point with superpotential - the case of Seiberg-dual of $SU(N_{c})$
gauge theory. Here we will verify the conjecture for two new cases -
$SO(N_{c})$ and $Sp(2N_{c})$ gauge groups around the Banks-Zaks fixed points.
In addition, we subject the ACS inequality to a series of nontrivial tests in
theories with conjectured accidental symmetries in the $IR$ and dramatically
different dynamics caused by superpotential deformations. We start with
$ADE$-type deformations then move on to check three chiral theories by
estimating their decoupled invariants from the chiral ring using a-maximization
and unitarity considerations. Remarkably, we found no violation of the ACS
conjecture.

lead to a better understanding of electroweak physics. As pointed out before, a
consistent inclusion of higher-order electroweak effects in the analysis of
corresponding experimental data may be crucial to properly predict the relevant
phenomenological features of these important reactions. Those contributions
lead to dramatic distortions of invariant-mass and angular distributions at
high energies, but may also significantly affect the cross section near
threshold, as is the case e.g. for Z-pairs. For this reason, we present an
analysis of the next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to WW, WZ and ZZ
production at the LHC, taking into account mass effects as well as leptonic
decays. Hence, our predictions are valid in the whole kinematic reach of the
LHC and, moreover, respect the spin correlations of the leptonic decay products
at NLO accuracy. Starting from these fixed-order results, a simple and
straight-forward method is motivated to combine the electroweak corrections
with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo predictions, focusing on a meaningful
combination of higher-order electroweak and QCD effects. To illustrate our
approach, the electroweak corrections are implemented in the HERWIG++
generator, and their phenomenological effects within a QCD environment are
studied explicitly.

hidden sector. That is, a set of new particles and forces interacting with the
known particles predominantly via gravity. In general this leads to a large set
of unknown parameters, however if the hidden sector is an exact copy of the
standard model sector, then an enhanced symmetry arises. This symmetry, which
can be interpreted as space-time parity, connects each ordinary particle ($e, \
\nu, \ p, \ n, \ \gamma, ....)$ with a mirror partner ($e', \ \nu', \ p', \ n',
\ \gamma', ...)$. If this symmetry is completely unbroken, then the mirror
particles are degenerate with their ordinary particle counterparts, and would
interact amongst themselves with exactly the same dynamics that govern ordinary
particle interactions. The only new interaction postulated is photon - mirror
photon kinetic mixing, whose strength $\epsilon$, is the sole new fundamental
(Lagrangian) parameter relevant for astrophysics and cosmology. It turns out
that such a theory, with suitably chosen initial conditions effective in the
very early Universe, can provide an adequate description of dark matter
phenomena provided that $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9}$. This review focuses on three
main developments of this mirror dark matter theory during the last decade:
Early universe cosmology, galaxy structure and the application to direct
detection experiments.

observe peaks at the maxima of the original non-interacting dispersion relation

present study takes into account the expected high energy spectrum of the
simultaneous radiation by neutrons, protons, pions, electrons and photons,
calculated using the FLUKA code by F. Cerutti (CERN) as well as on literature
values. It was found that proton irradiation causes a considerably higher
damage than neutron irradiation: in spite of a 3.8% proton fraction, the
measured damage is of the order of 20%, which fits with the calculations of N.
Mokhov (Fermilab) on the contribution of protons to the dpa. The same
calculations indicate that the total effect of protons, pions and electrons is
at least as high as that of neutrons. Since recent neutron experiments of
Nakamoto et al. show that the RRR of Cu is reduced from 200 to 50-120 for a
fluence of 10^{21} n/cm^{2}, it follows that the inclusion of all high energy
sources would lead to RRR values well below 50, thus endangering stability and

metallic contact. From model calculations, these chains are expected to be spin
polarized. However, direct experimental evidence for or against magnetism is
lacking. Here, we investigate shot noise as a potential source of information
on the magnetic state of Pt atomic chains. We observe a remarkable structure in
the distribution of measured shot-noise levels, where the data appear to be
confined to the region of nonmagnetic states. While this suggests a nonmagnetic
ground state for the Pt atomic chains, from calculations we find that the
magnetism in Pt chains is due to 'actor' electron channels, which contribute
very little to ballistic conductance and noise. On the other hand, there are
weakly polarized 'spectator' channels, which carry most of the current and are
only slightly modified by the magnetic state.

prototyping assistive applications up to embedded systems for realizing
cyber-physical systems in various domains. We are using 1:10 scale miniature
vehicles as a robotic platform to conduct research in the domain of
self-driving cars and collaborative vehicle fleets. Thus, experiments with
different sensors like e.g.~ultra-sonic, infrared, and rotary encoders need to
be prepared and realized using our vehicle platform. For each setup, we need to
configure the hardware/software interface board to handle all sensors and
actors. Therefore, we need to find a specific configuration setting for each
pin of the interface board that can handle our current hardware setup but which
is also flexible enough to support further sensors or actors for future use
cases. In this paper, we show how to model the domain of the configuration
space for a hardware/software interface board to enable model checking for
solving the tasks of finding any, all, and the best possible pin configuration.
We present results from a formal experiment applying the declarative languages
Alloy and Prolog to guide the process of engineering the hardware/software
interface for robotic platforms on the example of a configuration complexity up
to ten pins resulting in a configuration space greater than 14.5 million
possibilities. Our results show that our domain model in Alloy performs better
compared to Prolog to find feasible solutions for larger configurations with an
average time of 0.58s. To find the best solution, our model for Prolog performs
better taking only 1.38s for the largest desired configuration; however, this
important use case is currently not covered by the existing tools for the
hardware used as an example in this article.

addressed both via computer simulations and in experiments. It was found that
the experimentally obtained correlations obey a power law whereas the
correlations from simulations are better fitted by an exponential decay. We
here provide direct evidence--- via simulations of a hard sphere glass in
2D---that this discrepancy is a consequence of the finite system size in the 3D
simulations. By extending the study to a 2D soft disk model at zero
temperature, the robustness of the power-law decay in sheared amorphous solids
is underlined. Deviations from a power law occur when either reducing the
packing fraction towards the supercooled regime in the case of hard spheres or
changing the dissipation mechanism from contact dissipation to a mean-field

which is encountered in many large data recovery problems involving Markov
chain Monte Carlo schemes. In this context, sampling using Hamiltonian dynamics
is one of the recent techniques that have been proposed to exploit the target
distribution geometry. Such schemes have clearly been shown to be efficient for
multi-dimensional sampling, but are rather adapted to the exponential families
of distributions with smooth energy function. In this paper, we address the
problem of using Hamiltonian dynamics to sample from probability distributions
having non-differentiable energy functions such as $\ell_1$. Such distributions
are being more and more used in sparse signal and image recovery applications.
The proposed technique uses a modified leapfrog transform involving a proximal
step. The resulting non-smooth Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (ns-HMC) method is
tested and validated on a number of experiments. Results show its ability to
accurately sample according to various multivariate target distributions. The
proposed technique is illustrated on synthetic examples and is applied to an

magnitude diagram to follow their evolution, from the blue cloud (BC) to the
red sequence (RS), through the green valley (GV). ETGs brighter than $M_r=-21$

are younger, of about 2 Gyr on average, and evolve for about 7-8 Gyr along the

result is consistent with the dynamical analysis of both groups showing that

effects which is disturbed by small compositional changes - e.g. swapping just
2\% Fe of `defects' onto the Rh sublattice makes $T_t$ drop by 290K. This
hypersensitivity explains the narrow compositional range of the transition and

examine the process formed by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) values experienced by a typical user with respect to all base stations
in the down-link channel. This SINR process is completely characterized by
deriving its factorial moment measures, which involve numerically tractable,
explicit integral expressions. This novel framework naturally leads to
expressions for the k-coverage probability, including the case of random SINR
threshold values considered in multi-tier network models. While the k-coverage
probabilities correspond to the marginal distributions of the order statistics
of the SINR process, a more general relation is presented connecting the
factorial moment measures of the SINR process to the joint densities of these
order statistics. This gives a way for calculating exact values of the coverage
probabilities arising in a general scenario of signal combination and
interference cancellation between base stations. The presented framework
consisting of mathematical representations of SINR characteristics with respect
to the factorial moment measures holds for the whole domain of SINR and is
amenable to considerable model extension.

offer a distinctive DM signal, with potentially good prospects of detection in
large portions of the DM-particle parameter space, we explore here the
production of heavier anti-nuclei, specifically anti-helium. Even more than for
anti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the
astrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3-5

process makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few
DM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He
detection in current-generation experiments, such as AMS-02. We account for the
uncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details
of the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by
anti-proton searches. We find that only for very optimistic configurations it
might be possible to achieve detection with current generation detectors. We
estimate that, in more realistic configurations, an increase in experimental

century is finding a way to untangle the physical processes that govern galaxy
formation and evolution. Given the importance and scope of this problem, the
multi-wavelength astronomical community has used the past decade to build up a
wealth of information over specific extragalactic deep fields to address key
questions in galaxy formation and evolution. These fields generally cover at
least 10square degrees to facilitate the investigation of the rarest, typically
most massive, galaxies and AGN. Furthermore, such areal coverage allows the
environments to be fully accounted for, thereby linking the single halo to the
two-halo terms in the halo occupation distribution. Surveys at radio
wavelengths have begun to lag behind those at other wavelengths, especially in
this medium-deep survey tier. However, the survey speed offered by the JVLA
means that we can now reach a point where we can begin to obtain commensurate
data at radio wavelengths to those which already exists from the X-ray through
to the far-infrared over ~10 square degrees.
  We therefore present the case for a 10 square degree survey to 1.5uJy at
L-band in A or B Array, requiring ~4000 hours to provide census of
star-formation and AGN-accretion activity in the Universe. For example, the
observations will allow galaxies forming stars at 10Msolar/yr to be detected
out to z~1 and luminous infrared galaxies (1000Msolar/yr to be found out to
z~6. Furthermore, the survey area ensures that we will have enough cosmic
volume to find these rare sources at all epochs. The bandwidth will allow us to
determine the polarisation properties galaxies in the high-redshift Universe as
a function of stellar mass, morphology and redshift.

has at most one accepting run on every tree. The class of languages
recognisable by unambiguous tree automata is still not well-understood. In
particular, decidability of the problem whether a given language is
recognisable by some unambiguous automaton is open. Moreover, there are no
known upper bounds on the descriptive complexity of unambiguous languages among
all regular tree languages.
  In this paper we show the following complexity collapse: if a
non-deterministic parity tree automaton $A$ is unambiguous and its priorities
are between $i$ and $2n$ then the language recognised by $A$ is in the class
$Comp(i+1,2n)$. A particular case of this theorem is for $i=n=1$: if $A$ is an
unambiguous Buchi tree automaton then $L(A)$ is recognisable by a weak
alternating automaton (or equivalently definable in weak MSO). The main
motivation for this result is a theorem by Finkel and Simonnet stating that
every unambiguous Buchi automaton recognises a Borel language.
  The assumptions of the presented theorem are syntactic (we require one
automaton to be both unambiguous and of particular parity index). However, to
the authors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the
parity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous.

interacting particle systems in situation where stochastic fluctuations are
significant due to the involvement of low copy particles. In molecular biology,
measurements on the single-cell level attest to this stochasticity and one is
tempted to interpret such measurements across an isogenic cell population as
different sample paths of one and the same Markov model. Over recent years
evidence built up against this interpretation due to the presence of
cell-to-cell variability stemming from factors other than intrinsic
fluctuations. To account for this extrinsic variability, Markovian models in
random environments need to be considered and a key emerging question is how to
perform inference for such models. We model extrinsic variability by a random
parametrization of all propensity functions. To detect which of those
propensities have significant variability, we lay out a sparse learning
procedure captured by a hierarchical Bayesian model whose evidence function is
iteratively maximized using a variational Bayesian expectation-maximization
algorithm.

for combined state and parameter reduction of a parametrized linear control
system which is then used as a surrogate model in a Bayesian inverse setting.
Following the basic ideas presented in [Lieberman, Willcox, Ghattas. Parameter
and state model reduction for large-scale statistical inverse settings, SIAM J.
Sci. Comput., 32(5):2523-2542, 2010], our approach is based on a generalized
data-driven optimization functional in the construction process of the
surrogate model and the usage of a trust-region-type solution strategy that
results in an additional speed-up of the overall method. In principal, the
model reduction procedure is based on the offline construction of appropriate
low-dimensional state and parameter spaces and an online inversion step based
on the resulting surrogate model that is obtained through projection of the
underlying control system onto the reduced spaces. The generalization and
enhancements presented in this work are shown to decrease overall computational
time and increase accuracy of the reduced order model and thus allow an
application to extreme-scale problems. Numerical experiments for a generic
model and a fMRI connectivity model are presented in order to compare the
computational efficiency of our improved method with the original approach.

neutrality, by carrier mobility values exceeding 10^6 cm^2/V/s, by the
observation of integer quantum Hall plateaus starting at 30 mT and of symmetry
broken states at about 200 mT, and by the occurrence of a negative

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/783/2/88",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A study of a set of well-isolated pulses in Long and Intermediate gamma ray
burst light curves indicates that simple pulse models having smooth and
monotonic pulse rise and decay regions are inadequate. Examining the residuals
of fits of pulses to such models suggests the following patterns of departure
from smooth pulses: three separate wavelike peaks found in the residuals of
each pulse (the precursor peak, the central peak, and the decay peak) combine
with the underlying Norris et al. (2005) pulse model to produce five distinct
regions in the temporal evolution of each pulse. The Precursor Shelf occurs
prior to or concurrent with the exponential Rapid Rise. The pulse reaches
maximum intensity at the Peak Plateau, then undergoes a Rapid Decay. The decay
gradually slows into an Extended Tail. Despite these distinct temporal
segments, the pulses studied are almost universally characterized by hard to
soft spectral evolution, arguing that the new pulse features reflect a single
evolution, rather than being artifacts of pulse overlap. The fluctuations can
give a single pulse the appearance of having up to three distinct localized
peaks, leading to ambiguities in pulse-fitting if an incorrect pulse model is
used. The approach demonstrates that complex GRBs may be composed of fewer
pulses than indicated by the number of peaks. The large degree of similar
spectro-temporal behavior within gamma-ray burst pulses indicates that a single
process is responsible for producing pulses spanning a tremendous range of
durations, luminosities, and spectral hardnesses, and the correlated
characteristics of the wavelike peaks are related to the pulse asymmetry,
suggesting kinematic origins that seem supportive of relativistic shocks.

spin-dependent band structure of EuO. Significantly different optical responses
from spin-up and spin-down channels are obtained in both linear and nonlinear
cases, making it possible to distinguish contributions from different
spin-channels in the optical absorption spectra if spin-flip process can be
neglected. In addition, the red-shift of the absorption edge from paramagnetic
to ferromagnetic ordering is explained by exchange interactions. Using such
method, we have also compared the optical properties of multiferroic EuO which
is induced by strong epitaxial strain. Our results show that from tensile to
compressive strain, the blue-shift of the leading absorption peaks in the
optical spectra, the red-shift of the optical band gap in spin-up state can be
observed, consistent to the energy difference between spin-splitting orbits.
The spin-dependent nonlinear optical properties reveal that in the infrared and

their quantum numbers are such that they must also contain a light

supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and SNLS collaborations.
The data set includes several low-redshift samples (z<0.1), all 3 seasons from
the SDSS-II (0.05 < z < 0.4), and 3 years from SNLS (0.2 <z < 1) and totals
\ntotc spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae with high quality light
curves. We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data
analysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of
the full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training
of the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (\nsdssc
SNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic
uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to
the cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors
associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves. We produce
recalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and
SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II sample provides an effective, independent,
low-z anchor for the Hubble diagram and reduces the systematic error from
calibration systematics in the low-z SN sample. For a flat LCDM cosmology we
find Omega_m=0.295+-0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent with the most recent
CMB measurement from the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8sigma
(stat+sys) different than the previously published result of SNLS 3-year data.
The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric
calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant
dark-energy equation of state parameter w=-1.018+-0.057 (stat+sys) for a flat

approach has emerged, the idea being to perturb eigenvalues off the real line
and, consequently, away from regions where the Galerkin method fails. We
propose a simplified perturbation method which requires no \'a priori

latter shows that, in general, our approach will significantly outperform the
quadratic methods. We also present a new spectral enclosure for operators of
the form $A+iB$ where $A$ is self-adjoint, $B$ is self-adjoint and bounded.
This enables us to control, very precisely, how eigenvalues are perturbed from
the real line. The main results are demonstrated with examples including
magnetohydrodynamics, Schr\""odinger and Dirac operators.

systems in terms of information transfer, storage and modification. Especially
the measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic
surge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two
processes requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes
to estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these
observations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow
pooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle
to the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes
are often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues
theoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by
estimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble
is often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of
experimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a
recently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy
estimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient
implementation of the approach that deals with the increased computational
demand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a
massively parallel implementation for a graphics processing unit to handle the
computationally most heavy aspects of the ensemble method. We test the
performance and robustness of our implementation on data from simulated
stochastic processes and demonstrate the method's applicability to
magnetoencephalographic data. While we mainly evaluate the proposed method for
neuroscientific data, we expect it to be applicable in a variety of fields that
are concerned with the analysis of information transfer in complex biological,

attract, repel and orbit each other. Subsequent experimental work by Couder,
Fort, Protiere, Eddi, Sultan, Moukhtar, Rossi, Molacek, Bush and Sbitnev has
established that bouncing drops exhibit single-slit and double-slit
diffraction, tunnelling, quantised energy levels, Anderson localisation and the
creation/annihilation of droplet/bubble pairs.
  In this paper we explain why. We show first that the surface waves guiding
the droplets are Lorentz covariant with the characteristic speed c of the
surface waves; second, that pairs of bouncing droplets experience an
inverse-square force of attraction or repulsion according to their relative
phase, and an analogue of the magnetic force; third, that bouncing droplets are
governed by an analogue of Schroedinger's equation where Planck's constant is
replaced by an appropriate constant of the motion; and fourth, that orbiting
droplet pairs exhibit spin-half symmetry and align antisymmetrically as in the
Pauli exclusion principle. Our analysis explains the similarities between
bouncing-droplet experiments and the behaviour of quantum-mechanical particles.

similarity measure and proceed with a range of possibilities for computing
similarity between elements of sequences. We show how distributional similarity
measures obtained from unlabeled data can be incorporated into the learning
task as semantic knowledge. Our experiments suggest that the LA kernel yields
promising results on various biomedical corpora outperforming two baselines by
a large margin. Additional series of experiments have been conducted on the
data sets of seven general relation types, where the performance of the LA
kernel is comparable to the current state-of-the-art results.

value (and Q-) function approximation has received increasing interest this
last decade. This contribution introduces a novel approximation scheme, namely
the Kalman Temporal Differences (KTD) framework, that exhibits the following
features: sample-efficiency, non-linear approximation, non-stationarity
handling and uncertainty management. A first KTD-based algorithm is provided
for deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased
estimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD
framework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed
for special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions. Related
algorithms are experimented on classical benchmarks. They compare favorably to
the state of the art while exhibiting the announced features.
