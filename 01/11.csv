from several single-dish telescopes, 17 outflows are mapped in CO (2-1) and 17

calculate and tabulate the mass, momentum, kinetic energy, mechanical
luminosity, and force assuming optically thin emission in LTE at an excitation
temperature of 50 K. We show that all of the calculated properties are
underestimated when calculated under these assumptions. Taken together, the
effects of opacity, outflow emission at low velocities confused with ambient
cloud emission, and emission below the sensitivities of the observations
increase outflow masses and dynamical properties by an order of magnitude, on
average, and factors of 50-90 in the most extreme cases. Different (and
non-uniform) excitation temperatures, inclination effects, and dissociation of
molecular gas will all work to further increase outflow properties. Molecular
outflows are thus almost certainly more massive and energetic than commonly
reported. Additionally, outflow properties are lower, on average, by almost an
order of magnitude when calculated from the CO (3-2) maps compared to the CO
(2-1) maps, even after accounting for different opacities, map sensitivities,

the literature that the CO (3-2) line is subthermally excited in outflows, and
our results support this finding.

needing to tune a high-dimensional transition kernel which has a very high

loss during the first red giant branch (RGB) phase dominates mass loss in the
later asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Nevertheless, mass loss on the RGB
is still often parameterised by a simple Reimers law in stellar evolution
models. Aims: To try to detect CO thermal emission in a small sample of nearby
RGB stars with reliable Hipparcos parallaxes that were shown to have infrared
excess in an earlier paper. Methods: A sample of five stars was observed in the
CO J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines with the IRAM and APEX telescopes. Results: One star,
the one with the largest mass-loss rate based on the previous analysis of the
spectral energy distribution, was detected. The expansion velocity is
unexpectedly large at 12 km/s. The line profile and intensity are compared to
the predictions from a molecular line emission code. The standard model
predicts a double-peaked profile, while the observations indicate a flatter
profile. A model that does fit the data has a much smaller CO envelope (by a
factor of 3), and a CO abundance that is two times larger and/or a larger
mass-loss rate than the standard model. This could indicate that the phase of
large mass loss has only recently started. Conclusions: The detection of CO in
an RGB star with a luminosity of only about 1300 solar luminosities and a
mass-loss rate as low as a few 10(-9) solarmasses/yr is important and the
results also raise new questions. However, ALMA observations are required in
order to study the mass-loss process of RGB stars in more detail, both for
reasons of sensitivity (6 hours of integration in superior weather at IRAM were
needed to get a 4sigma detection in the object with the largest detection
probability), and spatial resolution (to determine the size of the CO
envelope).

function at T>T_c. Our best estimate for the chiral transition temperature is
T_c=(147 +/- 8)MeV; and the deconfinement transition is coincident. For

additional access control for the transmitter and the maximum power constraint,
we formulate the stochastic optimization problem of maximizing the achievable
rate as a Markov decision process (MDP) with continuous state. To efficiently
solve the problem, we define an approximate value function based on a piecewise
linear fit in terms of the battery state. We show that with the approximate
value function, the update in each iteration consists of a group of convex
problems with a continuous parameter. Moreover, we derive the optimal solution
to these convex problems in closed-form. Further, we propose power allocation
algorithms for both the finite- and infinite-horizon cases, whose computational
complexity is significantly lower than that of the standard discrete MDP method
but with improved performance. Extension to the case of a general payoff
function and imperfect energy prediction is also considered. Finally,
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms closely approach
the optimal performance.

between the Polyakov loop $\langle L_P \rangle$ and the Dirac eigenvalues
$\lambda_n$ in QCD, i.e., $\langle L_P \rangle \propto \sum_n \lambda_n^{N_t
-1} \langle n|\hat U_4|n \rangle$, by considering ${\rm Tr}
(\hat{U}_4\hat{\not{D}}^{N_t-1})$ on a temporally odd-number lattice, where the
temporal lattice size $N_t$ is odd. This formula is a Dirac spectral
representation of the Polyakov loop in terms of Dirac eigenmodes $|n\rangle$.
We here use an ordinary square lattice with the normal (nontwisted) periodic
boundary condition for link-variables $U_\mu(s)$ in the temporal direction.
From this relation, one can estimate each contribution of the Dirac eigenmode
to the Polyakov loop. Because of the factor $\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$ in the Dirac
spectral sum, this analytical relation generally indicates quite small
contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop in both confined and
deconfined phases, while the low-lying Dirac modes are essential for chiral
symmetry breaking. Also in lattice QCD calculations in confined and deconfined
phases, we numerically confirm the analytical relation, non-zero finiteness of
$\langle n|\hat U_4|n \rangle$ for each Dirac mode, and negligibly small
contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop, i.e., the Polyakov
loop is almost unchanged even by removing low-lying Dirac-mode contribution
from the QCD vacuum generated by lattice QCD simulations. Thus, we conclude
that low-lying Dirac modes are not essential modes for confinement, which
indicates no direct one-to-one correspondence between confinement and chiral
symmetry breaking in QCD.

parallel; the sequential approach allows us to potentially construct codes with
improved minimum distance. These codes, which we refer to as locally

recovery from a single erasure is considered. By studying the Generalized
Hamming Weights of the dual code, we derive upper bounds on the minimum
distance of locally 2-reconstructible codes and provide constructions for a
family of codes based on Tur\'an graphs, that are optimal with respect to this
bound. The minimum distance bound derived here is universal in the sense that
no code which permits all-symbol local recovery from $2$ erasures can have
larger minimum distance regardless of approach adopted. Our approach also leads
to a new bound on the minimum distance of codes with all-symbol locality for

This growth has been driven by rapid advances in observations and models of

the solar system. Indeed, it is only in the past few years that representative
samples of molecules have been discovered in great abundance throughout
protoplanetary disks - enough to begin building a complete budget for the most

volatiles are being mapped, snow lines are directly seen and quantified, and
distinct chemical regions within protoplanetary disks are being identified,
characterized and modeled. Theoretical processes invoked to explain the solar
system record are now being observationally constrained in protoplanetary

condensibles. The balance between chemical reset - processing of inner disk
material strong enough to destroy its memory of past chemistry, and inheritance
- the chemically gentle accretion of pristine material from the interstellar

as part of the near daily iPTF monitoring of M31 to a depth of $R\approx

monitoring of the outburst. Peaking at an absolute magnitude of $M_R=-6.6$ mag,
and with a decay time of 1 mag per day, it is a faint and very fast nova. It
shows optical emission lines of He/N and expansion velocities of 1900 to 2600

X-ray evolution revealed a supersoft source (SSS) with $kT_{\rm eff}\approx
90-110\ {\rm eV}$ that appeared within 5 days after the optical peak, and
lasted only 12 days. Most remarkably, this is not the first event from this

dynamically and adaptively by web services. Thus, the automatic negotiation of
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers is key for
enabling service-based value chains.
  The process of finding appropriate providers for web services seems to be
simple. Consumers contact several providers and take the provider which offers
the best matching SLA. However, currently consumers are not able forecasting
the probability of finding a matching provider for their requested SLA. So
consumers contact several providers and check if their offers are matching. In
case of continuing faults, on the one hand consumers may adapt their Service
Level Objects (SLOs) of the required SLA or on the other hand simply accept
offered SLAs of the contacted providers.
  By forecasting the probability of finding a matching provider, consumers
could assess their chances of finding a provider offering the requested SLA. If
a low probability is predicted, consumers can immediately adapt their SLOs or
increase the numbers of providers to be contacted.
  Thus, this paper proposes an analytical forecast model, which allows
consumers to get a realistic assessment of the probability to find matching
providers. Additionally, we present an optimization algorithm based on the
forecast results, which allows adapting the SLO parameter ranges in order to
find at least one matching provider. Not only consumers, but also providers can
use this forecast model to predict the prospective demand. So providers are
able to assess the number of potential consumers based on their offers too.
  Justification of our approach is done by simulation of practical examples
checking our theoretical findings.

$\varepsilon > 0$ depends on the depth and modulus of the circuit).

Saturn's disc-like magnetosphere. A magnetosphere more confined to the equator
in the polar regions is expected as a result of the interaction between this
type of obstacle and the solar wind. In addition, at times away from equinox, a
north-south asymmetry is expected where the magnetopause will be further
confined in one hemisphere but less confined in the opposite hemisphere.
Examining the extent of this confinement has been limited by a lack of
high-latitude spacecraft observations. Here, for the first time, direct
evidence for polar confinement of Saturn's magnetopause has been observed using
in-situ data obtained by the Cassini spacecraft during a series of
high-inclination orbits between 2007 and 2009. Following techniques established
by previous authors, we assume an equilibrium between the solar wind dynamic
pressure (which Cassini is generally unable to measure directly), and the
magnetic plus plasma pressure inside the magnetosphere. This assumption thus
allows us to estimate the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure ($D_P$) for a
series of magnetopause crossings, and hence to determine the expected location
and global shape of the magnetopause as a function of $D_P$. A clear divergence
from the familiar axisymmetric models of the magnetosphere is observed which
may be characterised by an 'apparent flattening parameter' of 0.81+0.03/-0.06
(representing a simple dilation of the nominal axisymmetric boundary along the
$Z_{KSM}$ axis such that the extent is reduced by 19% in this direction). This
figure is insensitive to variations in $D_P$.

hydrocarbons are closely related processes that have received renewed interests
in recent years because of the ever tightening supply of conventional
hydrocarbons and the growing production of hydrocarbons from low permeability
tight rocks. Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and
the timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack
of consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks,
expulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained
in the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many
mechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which
they are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller
capillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of
this complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these
processes it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this
study, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can
be obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography.
Three-dimensional (3D) images of several immature ""shale"" samples were

resolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine

used in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the
Green River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in
Eocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was
heated in-situ up to 400{\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The
other samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\deg}C. During the
heating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas
expulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of
microcracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of
microcracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5
micrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray
attenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a
methodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is
based on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of
connected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an
important complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using
two-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one
application of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the
developed workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack
formation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide
paths for primary migration.

linearly independent, resulting in a final set of slave mode products. While
the expansion coefficients can be computed in a variety of ways, we demonstrate
that finite difference is effective up to fourth order. We demonstrate the
power of the method in the strongly anharmonic system PbTe. All anharmonic
terms within an octahedron are computed up to fourth order. A proper unitary
transformation demonstrates that the vast majority of the anharmonicity can be
attributed to just two terms, indicating that a minimal model of phonon
interactions is achievable. The ability to straightforwardly generate
polynomial potentials will allow precise simulations at length and time scales

fluctuations and under the right circumstances, these grain overdensities can
overcome shear, turbulent, and gas pressure support to collapse under
self-gravity (forming a ""pebble pile"" planetesimal). Using a simple analytic
model for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate the
rate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsing
planetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. The statistics of this
process depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disk
surface density, and turbulent Mach numbers. However, when it occurs, we
predict that the resulting planetesimal mass function is broad and
quasi-universal, with a slope dN/dM~1/M^(1-2), spanning a size/mass range
~10-1e4 km (~1e-9-5.0 M_Earth). Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth
masses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach
large amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most
easily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent
vorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation
in terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).
In a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.
At small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders. However,
because density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely
proportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.
In fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a
disk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au may generically
occur late, as disks are evaporating. We also predict that conditions become
progressively more favorable for pebble-pile formation around lower-mass,
cooler stars.

focusing on the physical time scales of leptogenesis instead of the model
parameters, a more comprehensive picture emerges. The different regimes
previously identified can be understood as different relative orderings of
these time scales. This approach also shows that all regimes require a
coincidence of time scales and this in turn translates to a certain tuning of
the parameters, whether in mass terms or Yukawa couplings. Indeed, we show that
the amount of tuning involved in the minimal model is never less than one part
in 10^5. Finally, we explore an extended model where the tuning can be removed
in exchange for the introduction of a new degree of freedom in the form of a
leptophilic Higgs with a vacuum expectation value of the order of GeV.

extraction strategy generalizes critical points of snapshot topology in a
Galilean-invariant manner, allows to prioritize features according to their
strength and longevity, enables to track the temporal evolution of features, is
robust against noise and has no subjective parameters. These characteristics
are realized via several constitutive elements. First, acceleration is employed
as a feature identifier following Goto and Vassilicos (2006), thus ensuring
Galilean invariance. Second, the acceleration magnitude is used as basis for a
mathematically well-developed scalar field topology. The minima of this field
are called acceleration feature points, a superset of the acceleration zeros.
These points are discriminated into vortices and saddle points depending the
spectral properties of the velocity Jacobian. Third, all operations are based
on discrete topology for the scalar field with combinatorial algorithms. This
parameter-free foundation allows (1) to use persistence as a physically
meaningful importance measure to prioritize feature points, (2) ensures
robustness since no differentiation and interpolation need to be performed with
the data, and (3) enables a natural and robust tracking algorithm for the
temporal feature evolution. In particular, we can track vortex merging events
in an unsupervised manner. Data based analyses are presented for an
incompressible periodic cylinder wake, an incompressible planar mixing layer
and a weakly compressible planar jet. They demonstrate the power of the
tracking approach, which provides a spatiotemporal hierarchy of the minima.

arbitrary local errors given sufficient qubits. This includes correlated errors
involving many local qubits. In this work, we quantify this level of tolerance,
numerically studying the effects of many-qubit errors on the performance of the
surface code. We find that if increasingly large area errors are at least
moderately exponentially suppressed, arbitrarily reliable quantum computation
can still be achieved with practical overhead. We furthermore quantify the
effect of non-local two-qubit correlated errors, which would be expected in
arrays of qubits coupled by a polynomially decaying interaction, and when using
many-qubit coupling devices. We surprisingly find that the surface code is very
robust to this class of errors, despite a provable lack of a threshold error
rate when such errors are present.

population to produce the observed trend. We argue the latter scenario is more
probable and find that the most highly excited states (E$_{\rm up}$>1000 K) are

Wavelength, photon spin angular momentum (PSAM), and photon orbital
angular momentum (POAM), completely describe the state of a photon or an
electric field (an ensemble of photons). Wavelength relates directly to energy
and linear momentum, the corresponding kinetic quantities. PSAMand POAM,
themselves kinetic quantities, are colloquially known as polarization and
optical vortices, respectively. Astrophysical sources emit photons that carry
this information. Aims. PSAM characteristics of an electric field (intensity)
are compactly described by the Jones (Stokes/Mueller) calculus. Similarly, I
created calculi to represent POAM characteristics of electric fields and
intensities in an astrophysical context. Adding wavelength dependence to all of
these calculi is trivial. The next logical steps are to 1) form photon total
angular momentum (PTAM = POAM + PSAM) calculi; 2) prove their validity using
operators and expectation values; and 3) show that instrumental PSAM can affect
measured POAM values for certain types electric fields. Methods. I derive the
PTAM calculi of electric fields and intensities by combining the POAM and PSAM
calculi. I show how these quantities propagate from celestial sphere to image
plane. I also form the PTAMoperator (the sum of the POAMand PSAMoperators),
with and without instrumental PSAM, and calculate the corresponding expectation
values. Results. Apart from the vector, matrix, dot product, and direct product
symbols, the PTAM and POAM calculi appear superficially identical. I provide
tables with all possible forms of PTAM calculi. I prove that PTAM expectation
values are correct for instruments with and without instrumental PSAM. I also
show that POAM measurements of ""unfactored"" PTAM electric fields passing
through non-zero instrumental circular PSAM can be biased. Conclusions. The
combined PTAM calculi provide insight into how to mathematically model PTAM
sources and calibrate POAMand PSAM- induced POAM measurement errors.

shown to offer significant improvements over single algorithm approaches in a

five years. For a portfolio approach to be effective there are two crucial
conditions that must be met. First, there needs to be a collection of
complementary solvers with which to make a portfolio. Second, there must be a
collection of problem features that can accurately identify structural
differences between instances. This paper focuses on the latter issue: feature
representation, because, unlike SAT, not every problem has well-studied
features. We employ the well-known SATzilla feature set, but compute
alternative sets on different SAT encodings of CSPs. We show that regardless of
what encoding is used to convert the instances, adequate structural information
is maintained to differentiate between problem instances, and that this can be

only a small number of the regression coefficients are believed to be nonzero.
Moreover, statistical properties of high-dimensional lasso estimators are often
proved under the assumption that the correlation between the predictors is
bounded. In this vein, coordinatewise methods, the most common means of
computing the lasso solution, work well in the presence of low to moderate
multicollinearity. The computational speed of coordinatewise algorithms
degrades however as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases.
Motivated by these limitations, we propose the novel ""Deterministic Bayesian
Lasso"" algorithm for computing the lasso solution. This algorithm is developed
by considering a limiting version of the Bayesian lasso. The performance of the
Deterministic Bayesian Lasso improves as sparsity decreases and
multicollinearity increases, and can offer substantial increases in
computational speed. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that (1) the
Deterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm converges to the lasso solution, and (2)
it leads to a representation of the lasso estimator which shows how it achieves
both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ types of shrinkage simultaneously. Connections to
other algorithms are also provided. The benefits of the Deterministic Bayesian
Lasso algorithm are then illustrated on simulated and real data.

derivative theory using path integrals. To quantize this system and avoid the
problems of energy not bounded from below and states of negative norm, we
observe the following steps: 1) We extend the theory to the complex plane and
in this sense we double the degrees of freedom. 2) We add a total derivative to
fix the convenient boundary conditions. 3) We check that the complex structure
is consistent. 4) To map from the complex space to the real space we introduce
reality conditions as second class constraints and we check that the
interactions do not generate more constraints. 5) We built the measure of the
complex path integral and we show that including currents the theory is
projected to a self-interacting real theory that is renormalizable.

the framework of classical general relativity. The dark energy behaves very
similar with vacuum energy in quantum mechanics. However, once the quantum
effects are seriously taken into account, it predicts a completely wrong result
and leads to a severe fine-tuning. To solve the problem, the exact meaning of
time in quantum mechanics is reexamined. We abandon the standard interpretation
of time in quantum mechanics that time is just a global parameter, replace it
by a quantum dynamical variable playing the role of physical clock. We find
that synchronization of two spatially separated clocks can not be precisely
realized at quantum level. There is an intrinsic quantum uncertainty of distant
clock time, which implies an apparent vacuum energy fluctuation and gives an
observed dark energy density $\rho_{de}=\frac{6}{\pi}L_{P}^{-2}L_{H}^{-2}$ at
tree level approximation, where $L_{P}$ and $L_{H}$ are the Planck and Hubble
scale cutoffs. The fraction of the dark energy is given by
$\Omega_{de}=\frac{2}{\pi}$, which does not evolve with the internal clock
time. The ""dark energy"" as a quantum cosmic variance is always seen comparable
with the matter energy density by an observer using the internal clock time.
The corrected distance-redshift relation of cosmic observations due to the
distant clock effect are also discussed, which again gives a redshift
independent fraction $\Omega_{de}=\frac{2}{\pi}$. The theory is consistent with
current cosmic observations.

to 175 arcsec x 175 arcsec. IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on
27 June 2013 using a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope
that feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging spectrograph. IRIS obtains
spectra in passbands from 1332-1358, 1389-1407 and 2783-2834 Angstrom including
bright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg II h 2803 Angstrom and Mg
II k 2796 Angstrom) and transition region (C II 1334/1335 Angstrom and Si IV
1394/1403 Angstrom). Slit-jaw images in four different passbands (C II 1330, Si
IV 1400, Mg II k 2796 and Mg II wing 2830 Angstrom) can be taken simultaneously
with spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec x 175 arcsec at a
variety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to
emission from plasma at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance
our understanding of the flow of mass and energy through an interface region,
formed by the chromosphere and transition region, between the photosphere and
corona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit
of all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires
an order of magnitude more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind
combined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong numerical modeling component

do not display any sign of systematic rotation around NGC 6822. The ages and

8$ Gyr) and metal poor ([Fe/H]$\lesssim -1.5$). NGC 6822 is found to have both
metal poor ([Fe/H]$\approx -2.0$) and metal rich ([Fe/H]$\approx -0.9$) star
clusters within 15 arcmin (2 kpc) from the center, while only metal poor
clusters are observed in the outer halo with $r \geq 20$ arcmin (2.6 kpc). The
kinematics, old ages, and low metallicities of ESCs suggest that ESCs may have
accreted into the halo of NGC 6822. Based on the velocity distribution of ESCs,
we have determined the total mass and the mass-to-light ratio of NGC 6822:
$M_{N6822} = 7.5^{+4.5}_{-0.1} \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and $(M/L)_{N6822} =

required to model low dopant concentrations comparable to those achieved
experimentally for high-performing thermoelectrics. Using zinc antimonide as
our base material, we find that the electrical transport properties calculated
with DFT and Boltzmann transport theory exhibit the same trends with changes in
chemical potential as those computed with hybrid DFT, and propose a fitting
algorithm that involves adjusting the computed Fermi energy so that the
resulting Seebeck coefficient trends with temperature match experimental
trends. We confirm the validity of this approach in reproducing the
experimental trends in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient versus
temperature for Bi-doped $\beta-$Zn$_4$Sb$_3$. We then screen various
transition metal cation dopants, including copper and nickel, and find that a
Cu dopant concentration of 2.56% in Zn$_{39}$Sb$_{30}$ exhibited a 14% increase

through atmospheric escape owing to intense XUV (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet)

evolution or intense atmospheric escape can also contribute to mass loss. To
study the effects of mass loss on inner planet populations, we calculate the
evolution of hot Jupiters considering mass loss of their envelopes and thermal
contraction. Mass loss is assumed to occur through XUV-driven atmospheric
escape and the following Roche-lobe overflow. The runaway effect of mass loss
results in a dichotomy of populations: hot Jupiters that retain their envelopes
and super Earths whose envelopes are completely lost. Evolution primarily
depends on the core masses of planets and only slightly on migration history.
In hot Jupiters with small cores (~10 Earth masses), runaway atmospheric escape
followed by Roche-lobe overflow may create sub-Jupiter deserts, as observed in
both mass and radius distributions of planetary populations. Comparing our
results with formation scenarios and observed exoplanets populations, we
propose that populations of closely orbiting exoplanets are formed by capturing
of planets at/inside the inner edges of protoplanetary disks and subsequent
evaporation of sub-Jupiters.

based on Multi-Resolution Histograms (MRH) to accomplish searching in

recall rate and narrowed search space. Later steps accomplish slow search in
the reduced periphery and achieve additional accuracy.
  Experimentation on large music database using recursive programming
substantiates the potential of the method. The outcome of proposed strategy
glimpses that MRH effectively locate the patterns. Distances of MRH at lower
level are the lower bounds of the distances at higher level, which guarantees
evasion of false dismissals during PF. In due course, proposed method helps to
strike a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The system is scalable
for large music retrieval systems and also data driven for performance

provide valuable support across geographic information retrieval, data mining,
and information integration. To date, a wide variety of approaches to
geo-semantic similarity have been devised. A judgment of similarity is not
intrinsically right or wrong, but obtains a certain degree of cognitive
plausibility, depending on how closely it mimics human behavior. Thus selecting
the most appropriate measure for a specific task is a significant challenge. To
address this issue, we make an analogy between computational similarity
measures and soliciting domain expert opinions, which incorporate a subjective
set of beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and epistemic biases. Following this
analogy, we define the semantic similarity ensemble (SSE) as a composition of
different similarity measures, acting as a panel of experts having to reach a
decision on the semantic similarity of a set of geographic terms. The approach
is evaluated in comparison to human judgments, and results indicate that an SSE
performs better than the average of its parts. Although the best member tends
to outperform the ensemble, all ensembles outperform the average performance of
each ensemble's member. Hence, in contexts where the best measure is unknown,
the ensemble provides a more cognitively plausible approach.

distributed data. The input (data) nodes and the sink node that receives the
function form a connected network that is described by an undirected weighted
network graph. The algorithm to compute the given function is described by a
weighted directed acyclic graph and is called the computation graph. An
embedding defines the computation communication sequence that obtains the
function at the sink. Two kinds of optimal embeddings are sought, the embedding
that---(1)~minimizes delay in obtaining function at sink, and (2)~minimizes
cost of one instance of computation of function. This abstraction is motivated
by three applications---in-network computation over sensor networks, operator
placement in distributed databases, and module placement in distributed
computing.
  We first show that obtaining minimum-delay and minimum-cost embeddings are
both NP-complete problems and that cost minimization is actually MAX SNP-hard.
Next, we consider specific forms of the computation graph for which polynomial
time solutions are possible. When the computation graph is a tree, a polynomial
time algorithm to obtain the minimum delay embedding is described. Next, for
the case when the function is described by a layered graph we describe an
algorithm that obtains the minimum cost embedding in polynomial time. This
algorithm can also be used to obtain an approximation for delay minimization.
We then consider bounded treewidth computation graphs and give an algorithm to
obtain the minimum cost embedding in polynomial time.

instance, of L\'evy flights and the celebrated $\kappa$-distribution. A
stringent derivation yields an anomalous diffusion coefficient increasing with
time, thus describing superdiffusion. Contrary to wide belief, superdiffusion,
though faster than classical, is a weak process. Absolute values of the
coefficient are small due to the largeness of the anomalous collision frequency

frequency. We provide parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients,
determine the exponents of temporal increase, determine the power and $\kappa$

threaded by poloidal magnetic fields is introduced and studied. The linear
magnetohydrodynamic problem decouples into eigenvalue problems for in-plane
slow- and fast- Alfv'een-Coriolis (AC), and vertical magnetosonic (MS)
eigenmodes. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is composed of a discrete
number of unstable slow AC eigenmodes that is determined for each radius by the
local beta. In the vicinity of the first beta threshold a parent MRI eigenmode
together with a stable AC eigenmode (either slow or fast) and a stable MS
eigenmode form a resonant triad. The three-wave MRDI relies on the nonlinear
saturation of the parent MRI mode and the exponential growth of two daughter
linearly stable waves, slow-AC and MS modes with an effective growth rate that
is comparable to that of the parent MRI. If, however, the role of the AC
daughter wave is played by a stable fast mode, all three modes remain bounded.

target image, known as registration or alignment, corresponds to the projection
of the target image onto the transformation manifold of the reference image
(the set of images generated by its geometric transformations). It, however,
often takes a nontrivial form such that the exact computation of projections on
the manifold is difficult. The tangent distance method is an effective
algorithm to solve this problem by exploiting a linear approximation of the
manifold. As theoretical studies about the tangent distance algorithm have been
largely overlooked, we present in this work a detailed performance analysis of
this useful algorithm, which can eventually help its implementation. We
consider a popular image registration setting using a multiscale pyramid of
lowpass filtered versions of the (possibly noisy) reference and target images,
which is particularly useful for recovering large transformations. We first
show that the alignment error has a nonmonotonic variation with the filter
size, due to the opposing effects of filtering on both manifold nonlinearity
and image noise. We then study the convergence of the multiscale tangent
distance method to the optimal solution. We finally examine the performance of
the tangent distance method in image classification applications. Our
theoretical findings are confirmed by experiments on image transformation
models involving translations, rotations and scalings. Our study is the first
detailed study of the tangent distance algorithm that leads to a better
understanding of its efficacy and to the proper selection of its design
parameters.

an optimization problem on graphs, one can formulate an interdiction problem as
a game consisting of two players, namely, an interdictor and an evader, who
compete on an objective with opposing interests. In edge interdiction problems,
every edge of the input graph has an interdiction cost associated with it and
the interdictor interdicts the graph by modifying the edges in the graph, and
the number of such modifications is constrained by the interdictor's budget.
The evader then solves the given optimization problem on the modified graph.
The action of the interdictor must impede the evader as much as possible. We
focus on edge interdiction problems related to minimum spanning tree, maximum
matching and shortest paths. These problems arise in different real world
scenarios. We derive several fixed-parameter tractability and W[1]-hardness
results for these interdiction problems with respect to various parameters.
Next, we show close relation between interdiction problems and partial cover
problems on bipartite graphs where the goal is not to cover all elements but to
minimize/maximize the number of covered elements with specific number of sets.
Hereby, we investigate the parameterized complexity of several partial cover
problems on bipartite graphs.

another, non-adjacent well, without macroscopic occupation of the well between
the two. This process has previously been analysed and in this work we extend
those analyses by considering the effects of quantum statistics on the dynamics
and entanglement properties of the condensate modes in the two relevant wells.
In order to do this, we go beyond the mean-field analysis of the

so well known in quantum optics. In particular, we use the exact positive-P
representation where it is suitable, and the approximate truncated WIgner

two methods, with the mean-field dynamics not depending on the initial quantum
states of the trapped condensate. We find that the entanglement properties do
depend strongly on the initial quantum states, with quantitatively different
results found for coherent and Fock states. Comparison of the two methods gives
us confidence that the truncated Wigner representation delivers accurate
results for this system and is thus a useful method as the collisional
nonlinearity increases and the positive-P results fail to converge.
