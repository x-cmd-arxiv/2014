employing n-in-p planar sensors with an active thickness of 150
$\mathrm{\mu}$m, produced at MPP/HLL, and 100-200 $\mathrm{\mu}$m thin active
edge sensor devices, produced at VTT in Finland. These thin sensors are
designed as candidates for the ATLAS pixel detector upgrade to be operated at
the HL-LHC, as they ensure radiation hardness at high fluences. They are
interconnected to the ATLAS FE-I3 and FE-I4 read-out chips. Moreover, the
n-in-p technology only requires a single side processing and thereby it is a
cost-effective alternative to the n-in-n pixel technology presently employed in
the LHC experiments. High precision beam test measurements of the hit
efficiency have been performed on these devices both at the CERN SpS and at
DESY, Hamburg. We studied the behavior of these sensors at different bias
voltages and different beam incident angles up to the maximum one expected for
the new Insertable B-Layer of ATLAS and for HL-LHC detectors. Results obtained
with 150 $\mathrm{\mu}$m thin sensors, assembled with the new ATLAS FE-I4 chip
and irradiated up to a fluence of
4$\times$10$^{15}\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{eq}}/\mathrm{cm}^2$, show that they are
excellent candidates for larger radii of the silicon pixel tracker in the
upgrade of the ATLAS detector at HL-LHC. In addition, the active edge
technology of the VTT devices maximizes the active area of the sensor and
reduces the material budget to suit the requirements for the innermost layers.
The edge pixel performance of VTT modules has been investigated at beam test
experiments and the analysis after irradiation up to a fluence of
5$\times$10$^{15}\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{eq}}/\mathrm{cm}^2$ has been performed
using radioactive sources in the laboratory.

administered weekly pre-tests and bi-weekly post-tests in the recitation
sections of our introductory classes over four semesters from Spring 2010
through Fall 2011. The post-tests were administered as graded quizzes and were
developed to assess problem solving, laboratory, calculational and conceptual
skills that had been the focus of instruction in lab, lecture and recitation
sessions. They were not comprehensive, but gave us 'snapshots' of students'
abilities throughout the semester. They were used in conjunction with other
forms of assessment, such as conceptual inventories, to give us a broader
picture of the state of our undergraduate classes, recitation sections and
laboratories. The written pre- and post-tests, which required students to show
their work and explain their reasoning, yielded different information on
students' skills than the conceptual inventories. On almost all of the
questions, the students in the inquiry-based course performed better than all
of the other students in both the calculus-based and algebra-based classes.
This study indicates that the inquiry-based students perform better at
free-response questions that require students to show their work and explain
their reasoning, even though their conceptual inventory scores are not
significantly different from students in large lecture sections taught with
Physics Education Research-informed (PER-informed) laboratories, recitations
and lectures, as reported in a previous paper. This indicates a need for
different and/or more comprehensive assessment instruments to evaluate the
effectiveness of introductory materials and instructional techniques that can
be compared across classes and universities.

carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). Two main evolutionary channels are
proposed for the WD to reach the critical density required for a thermonuclear
explosion: the single degenerate scenario (SD), in which a CO WD accretes from
a non-degenerate companion, and the double degenerate scenario (DD), in which
two CO WDs merge. However, it remains difficult to reproduce the observed SN Ia
rate with these two scenarios.
  With a binary population synthesis code we study the main evolutionary
channels that lead to SNe Ia and we calculate the SN Ia rates and the
associated delay time distributions. We find that the DD channel is the
dominant formation channel for the longest delay times. The SD channel with
helium-rich donors is the dominant channel at the shortest delay times. Our
standard model rate is a factor five lower than the observed rate in galaxy
clusters.
  We investigate the influence of ill-constrained aspects of single- and
binary-star evolution and uncertain initial binary distributions on the rate of
type Ia SNe. These distributions, as well as uncertainties in both helium star
evolution and common envelope evolution, have the greatest influence on our
calculated rates. Inefficient common envelope evolution increases the relative
number of SD explosions such that for $\alpha_{\rm ce} = 0.2$ they dominate the
SN Ia rate. Our highest rate is a factor three less than the galaxy-cluster SN
Ia rate, but compatible with the rate determined in a field-galaxy dominated
sample. If we assume unlimited accretion onto WDs, to maximize the number of SD
explosions, our rate is compatible with the observed galaxy-cluster rate.

of the old galactic populations. However, they remain elusive due to their low
luminosity. Observational and modeling efforts are required to fully understand
their physics and to investigate the effects of metallicity in their cool
atmospheres.
  Aims. We perform a detailed study of a sample of subdwarfs to determine their
stellar parameters and constrain the stat-of-the art atmospheric models.
  Methods. We present UVES/VLT high resolution spectra of three late-K
subdwarfs and 18 M subdwarfs. Our atlas covers the optical region from 6400 AA
up to the near infrared at 8900 AA. We show spectral details of cool
atmospheres at very high resolution (R= 40 000) and compare with synthetic
spectra computed from the recent BT-Settl atmosphere models.
  Results. Our comparison shows that molecular features (TiO, VO, CaH), and
atomic features (Fe I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well fitted by current models. We
produce an effective temperature versus spectral type relation all over the
subdwarf spectral sequence. Thanks to the high resolution of our spectra, we
perform a detailed comparison of line profiles of individual elements such as
Fe I, Ca II, Ti I, and are able to determine accurate metallicities of these
stars. These determinations contribute to calibrate the relation between
metallicity and molecular band strength indices from low-resolution spectra.
  Conclusions. This work shows that the new generation of models are able to
reproduce various spectral features of M subdwarfs. Working with these high
resolution spectra allowed us to disentangle the atmospheric parameters
(effective temperature, gravity, metallicity), which is not possible when using
low resolution spectroscopy or photometry.

  Results: Photometry of the 2013 eruption, combined with three previous
eruptions, enabled construction of a template light curve of a very fast nova,
t2(V)~4 days. The archival data allowed recovery of the progenitor system in
optical and near-UV data, indicating a red-giant secondary with bright

detections, indicate a unique system with a recurrence timescale of ~1 year.
This implies the presence of a very high mass white dwarf and a high accretion
rate. The recovered progenitor system is consistent with such an elevated rate
of accretion.We encourage additional observations, especially towards the end

factor of $\Omega(\log{k})$ in expectation. However, it is not clear from these
results if the algorithm achieves good approximation factor with reasonably
high probability (say $1/poly(k)$). Brunsch and R\""{o}glin gave a dataset where
the k-means++ seeding algorithm achieves an $O(\log{k})$ approximation ratio
with probability that is exponentially small in $k$. However, this and all
other known lower-bound examples are high dimensional. So, an open problem was
to understand the behavior of the algorithm on low dimensional datasets. In
this work, we give a simple two dimensional dataset on which the seeding
algorithm achieves an $O(\log{k})$ approximation ratio with probability
exponentially small in $k$. This solves open problems posed by Mahajan et al.
and by Brunsch and R\""{o}glin.

Particles are non-Brownian and interact only via hydrodynamics and short-range
repulsive forces. An analysis of the different stress mechanisms in the
suspension shows that the viscosity is governed by the shear elasticity of the
capsules, whereas the repulsive forces are subdominant. Evidence for a dynamic
yield stress above a critical volume fraction is provided and related to the
elastic properties of the capsules. The shear stress is found to follow a
critical jamming scenario and is rather insensitive to the
tumbling-to-tank-treading transition. The particle pressure and normal stress
differences display some sensitivity to the dynamical state of the cells and
exhibit a characteristic scaling, following the behavior of a single particle,
in the tank-treading regime. The behavior of the viscosity in the fluid phase
is rationalized in terms of effective medium models. Furthermore, the role of
confinement effects, which increase the overall magnitude and enhance the
shear-thinning of the viscosity, is discussed.

inevitably gives rise to electron-positron pair production through the
interaction of these {\gamma}-rays with the Extragalactic Background Light
(EBL). Depending on the magnetic fields in the proximity of the source, the
cascade initiated from pair production can result in either an isotropic halo
around an initially beamed source or a magnetically broadened cascade flux.
Aims: Both extended pair halo (PH) and magnetically broadened cascade (MBC)
emission from regions surrounding the blazars 1ES 1101-232, 1ES 0229+200 and
PKS 2155-304 were searched for, using VHE {\gamma}-ray data taken with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), and high energy (HE; 100 MeV<E<100 GeV)
{\gamma}-ray data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Methods: By
comparing the angular distributions of the reconstructed gamma-ray events to
the angular profiles calculated from detailed theoretical models, the presence
of PH and MBC was investigated. Results: Upper limits on the extended emission
around 1ES 1101-232, 1ES 0229+200 and PKS 2155-304 are found to be at a level
of few percent of the Crab nebula flux above 1 TeV, depending on the assumed
photon index of the cascade emission. Assuming strong Extra-Galactic Magnetic
Field (EGMF) values, > 10$^{-12}$G, this limits the production of pair halos
developing from electromagnetic cascades. For weaker magnetic fields, in which
electromagnetic cascades would result in magnetically broadened cascades, EGMF
strengths in the range (0.3 - 3)$\times 10^{-15}$G were excluded for PKS
2155-304 at the 99% confidence level, under the assumption of a 1 Mpc coherence

In various fields a conservation law requires that a set of fluctuating

result, any stochastic differential equation model to be realizable must not
produce events outside of the allowed sample space. We develop a set of
constraints on the drift and diffusion terms of such stochastic models to
ensure that both the non-negativity and the unit-sum conservation law
constraint are satisfied as the variables evolve in time. We investigate the
consequences of the developed constraints on the Fokker-Planck equation, the
associated system of stochastic differential equations, and the evolution
equations of the first four moments of the probability density function. We
show that random variables, satisfying a conservation law constraint,
represented by stochastic diffusion processes, must have diffusion terms that
are coupled and nonlinear. The set of constraints developed enables the
development of statistical representations of fluctuating variables satisfying
a conservation law. We exemplify the results with the bivariate beta process

evolution leading up to the eruption, and for some time after it, a
counter-clockwise rotation of the sunspot of about 30 degrees was observed. We
suggest that the rotation triggered the eruption by progressively expanding the
magnetic field above the filament. To test this scenario, we study the effect
of twisting the initially potential field overlying a pre-existing flux-rope,
using three-dimensional zero-$\beta$ MHD simulations. We first consider a
relatively simple and symmetric system, and then study a more complex and
asymmetric magnetic configuration, whose photospheric flux distribution and
coronal structure are guided by the observations and a potential field
extrapolation. In both cases, we find that the twisting leads to the expansion
of the overlying field. As a consequence of the progressively reduced magnetic
tension, the flux-rope quasi-statically adapts to the changed environmental
field, rising slowly. Once the tension is sufficiently reduced, a distinct
second phase of evolution occurs where the flux-rope enters an unstable regime
characterized by a strong acceleration. Our simulations thus suggest a new
mechanism for the triggering of eruptions in the vicinity of rotating sunspots.

FRBs not from galaxy centers or star forming regions. The inhomogeneity of the
intergalactic medium (IGM), however, causes significant deviation of the
dispersion measure from that predicted in the simplified homogeneous IGM model
for individual event. Fortunately, with sufficient FRBs along different
sightlines but within a very narrow redshift interval (e.g., $\Delta z \sim

dispersion measures does not suffer such a problem and hence may be used as a

the host galaxies and the FRB sources contribute little to the detected
dispersion measures) and with all the uncertainties (i.e. the inhomogeneity of

electric currents in solar active regions are neutralized. That is, whether or
not the main (or direct) coronal currents connecting the active region
polarities are surrounded by shielding (or return) currents of equal total
value and opposite direction. Both theory and observations are not yet fully
conclusive regarding this question, and numerical simulations have,
surprisingly, barely been used to address it. Here we quantify the evolution of
electric currents during the formation of a bipolar active region by
considering a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the emergence
of a sub-photospheric, current-neutralized magnetic flux rope into the solar
atmosphere. We find that a strong deviation from current neutralization
develops simultaneously with the onset of significant flux emergence into the
corona, accompanied by the development of substantial magnetic shear along the
active region's polarity inversion line. After the region has formed and flux
emergence has ceased, the strong magnetic fields in the region's center are
connected solely by direct currents, and the total direct current is several
times larger than the total return current. These results suggest that active
regions, the main sources of coronal mass ejections and flares, are born with
substantial net currents, in agreement with recent observations. Furthermore,
they support eruption models that employ pre-eruption magnetic fields
containing such currents.

this work we present the self-coupling problem in detail and explicitly solve
the infinite-iterations scheme associated with it for the simplest theory of a
graviton field, which corresponds to an irreducible spin-2 representation of
the Poincar\'e group. We make explicit the non-uniqueness problem by finding an
entire family of solutions to the self-coupling problem. Then we show that the
only resulting theory which implements a deformation of the original gauge
symmetry happens to have essentially the structure of unimodular gravity. This
makes plausible the possibility of a natural solution to the first cosmological
constant problem in theories of emergent gravity. Later on we change for the
sake of completeness the starting free-field theory to Fierz-Pauli theory, an
equivalent theory but with a larger gauge symmetry. We indicate how to carry
out the infinite summation procedure in a similar way. Overall, we conclude
that as long as one requires the (deformed) preservation of internal gauge
invariance, one naturally recovers the structure of unimodular gravity or
general relativity but in a version that explicitly shows the underlying
Minkowski spacetime, in the spirit of Rosen's flat-background bimetric theory.

modify the spectrum of high order harmonics. In particular, window-type Fano
resonances can reduce photo-absorption within a narrow spectral region and,
consequently, lead to an enhanced emission of high-order harmonics in
absorption-limited generation conditions. For high harmonic generation in argon
it is shown that the 3s3p6 np 1P1 window resonances (n=4,5,6) give rise to
enhanced photon yield. In particular, the 3s3p6 4p 1P1 resonance at 26.6 eV
allows a relative enhancement up to a factor of 30 compared to the
characteristic photon emission of the neighboring harmonic order. This
enhanced, spectrally isolated and coherent photon emission line has a relative
energy bandwidth of only {\Delta}E/E=3*10-3. Therefore, it might be directly
applied for precision spectroscopy or coherent diffractive imaging without the
need of additional spectral filtering. The presented mechanism can be employed

respectively working in the 0.4-1 and 1.0-2.5 micron spectral ranges. Such a
solution is imposed by the fact the light at short wavelengths has to be shared
with the EChO Fine Guiding System (FGS) devoted to the pointing of the stars
under observation. The spectrometer makes use of a HgCdTe detector of 512 by
512 pixels, 18 micron pitch and working at a temperature of 45K as the entire
VNIR optical bench. The instrument has been interfaced to the telescope optics
by two optical fibers, one per channel, to assure an easier coupling and an
easier colocation of the instrument inside the EChO optical bench.

a method based on the Bayes optimal selection and a method based on the
Bayesian model averaging. The advantage of these methods is that they are
independent of the algorithm used to learn a predictive model, and they can be
applied in a post-processing step, after the model is learned. This makes them
applicable to a wide variety of machine learning models and methods. These
calibration methods, as well as other methods, are tested on a variety of

probe the gap symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We revisit the
behavior of in-plane $H_{c2}$ in $d$-wave superconductors by considering both
the orbital effect and Pauli paramagnetic effect. After carrying out systematic
analysis, we show that the maxima of $H_{c2}$ could be along either nodal or
antinodal directions of a $d$-wave superconducting gap, depending on the
specific values of a number of tuning parameters. This behavior is in contrast
to the common belief that the maxima of in-plane $H_{c2}$ are along the
direction where the superconducting gap takes its maximal value. Therefore,
identifying the precise $d$-wave gap symmetry through fitting experiments
results of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ with model calculations at a fixed
temperature, as widely used in previous studies, is difficult and practically
unreliable. However, our extensive analysis of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ show
that there is a critical temperature $T^{*}$: in-plane $H_{c2}$ exhibits its
maxima along nodal directions at $T < T^{*}$ and along antinodal directions at
$T^{*} < T < T_c$. The concrete value of $T^{*}$ may change as other parameters
vary, but the existence of $\pi/4$ shift of $H_{c2}$ at $T^{\ast}$ appears to
be a general feature. Thus a better method to identify the precise $d$-wave gap
symmetry is to measure $H_{c2}$ at a number of different temperatures, and
examine whether there is a $\pi/4$ shift in its angular dependence at certain
$T^{*}$. We further show that Landau level mixing does not change this general
feature. However, in the presence of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state,
the angular dependence of $H_{c2}$ becomes quite complicated, which makes it
more difficult to determine the gap symmetry by measuring $H_{c2}$.

models, with a vast range of applications areas. GLMM extends the linear mixed
models allowing for different types of response variable. Three most common
data types are continuous, counts and binary and standard distributions for
these types of response variables are Gaussian, Poisson and Binomial,
respectively. Despite that flexibility, there are situations where the response
variable is continuous, but bounded, such as rates, percentages, indexes and
proportions. In such situations the usual GLMM's are not adequate because
bounds are ignored and the beta distribution can be used. Likelihood and
Bayesian inference for beta mixed models are not straightforward demanding a
computational overhead. Recently, a new algorithm for Bayesian inference called
INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) was proposed.INLA allows
computation of many Bayesian GLMMs in a reasonable amount time allowing
extensive comparison among models. We explore Bayesian inference for beta mixed
models by INLA. We discuss the choice of prior distributions, sensitivity
analysis and model selection measures through a real data set. The results
obtained from INLA are compared with those obtained by an MCMC algorithm and
likelihood analysis. We analyze data from an study on a life quality index of
industry workers collected according to a hierarchical sampling scheme. Results
show that the INLA approach is suitable and faster to fit the proposed beta
mixed models producing results similar to alternative algorithms and with
easier handling of modeling alternatives. Sensitivity analysis, measures of
goodness of fit and model choice are discussed.

In this turn based game, an evader $e$ is chased by pursuers $p_1, p_2, ...,
p_{\ell}$. The players have full information about the environment and the
location of the other players. The pursuers are allowed to coordinate their
actions. On the pursuer turn, each $p_i$ can move to any point at distance at
most 1 from his current location. On the evader turn, he moves similarly. The
pursuers win if some pursuer becomes co-located with the evader in finite time.
The evader wins if he can evade capture forever.
  It is known that one pursuer can capture the evader in any simply-connected
polygonal environment, and that three pursuers are always sufficient in any
polygonal environment (possibly with polygonal obstacles). We contribute two
new results to this field. First, we fully characterize when an environment
with a single obstacles is one-pursuer-win or two-pursuer-win. Second, we give
sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for an environment to have a winning
strategy for two pursuers. Such environments can be swept by a \emph{leapfrog
strategy} in which the two cops alternately guard/increase the currently
controlled area. The running time of this algorithm is $O(n \cdot h \cdot
{diam}(P))$ where $n$ is the number of vertices, $h$ is the number of obstacles
and ${diam}(P)$ is the diameter of $P$.
  More concretely, for an environment with $n$ vertices, we describe an
$O(n^2)$ algorithm that (1) determines whether the obstacles are
well-separated, and if so, (2) constructs the required partition for a leapfrog
strategy.

$\rho:G\to\mathrm{GL}(V)$ of a connected complex linear algebraic group $G$

the homomorphisms $\Phi:H\to (\mathbb{C},+)$. Each such $\Phi$ is related to an
'additive relative invariant', a rational function $h$ on $V$ such that $h\circ

  For those prehomogeneous vector spaces with $D$ a type of hypersurface called
a linear free divisor, we prove there are no nontrivial additive functions of
$H$, and hence $H$ is an algebraic torus. From this we gain insight into the

components of $D$ equals the dimension of the abelianization of $G$. For some
special cases ($G$ abelian, reductive, or solvable, or $D$ irreducible) we
simplify proofs of existing results. We also examine the homotopy groups of

rapidly rotating equator and slower poles. However, theoretical models and
numerical simulations can result in a slower equator and faster poles when the
rotation is slow. Aims: We study the critical rotational influence under which
differential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) to an
anti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We estimate the non-diffusive
($\Lambda$ effect) and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the
Reynolds stress. Methods: We present the results of three-dimensional numerical
simulations of mildly turbulent convection in spherical wedge geometry. Here we
apply a fully compressible setup which would suffer from a prohibitive time
step constraint if the real solar luminosity was used. We regulate the
convective velocities by varying the amount of heat transported by thermal
conduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved convection. Results: Increasing
the efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of the rotational
influence on the flow and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar
differential rotation for Coriolis numbers around 1.3. We confirm the recent
finding of a large-scale flow bistability: contrasted with running the models
from an initial condition with unprescribed differential rotation, the
initialization of the model with certain kind of rotation profile sustains the
solution over a wider parameter range. Conclusions: Our results may have
implications for real stars that start their lives as rapid rotators implying
solar-like rotation in the early main-sequence evolution. As they slow down,
they might be able to retain solar-like rotation for lower Coriolis numbers
before switching to anti-solar rotation. This could partially explain the
puzzling findings of anti-solar rotation profiles for models in the solar
parameter regime.

galaxy groups in the redshift range 0<z<2.5. We utilize a large sample of
nearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from three
photometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central and
satellite galaxies over roughly 11 Gyr. At z~0, central galaxies in our sample
range in stellar mass from Milky Way/M31 analogs (M=6.5x10^10 M\solar) to
nearby massive ellipticals (M=1.5x10^11 M\solar). Satellite galaxies in the
same groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(M=6.5x10^9 M\solar). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the
average rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving
quiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our
analysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with
a different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using
halo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts
off in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10^12 and 10^13 M\solar,
consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast,
satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by
environmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central
galaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the
processes that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites.
While mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity
of central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the
environment in which they reside.

framework consists of simple models for the initial action-angle distribution
of tidal debris, which can be straightforwardly evolved forward in time. Taking
advantage of the essentially one-dimensional nature of tidal streams, the
transformation to position-velocity coordinates can be linearized and
interpolated near a small number of points along the stream, thus allowing for
efficient computations of a stream's properties in observable quantities. I
illustrate how to calculate the stream's average location (its ""track""') in
different coordinate systems, how to quickly estimate the dispersion around its
track, and how to draw mock stream data. As a generative model, this framework
allows one to compute the full probability distribution function and
marginalize over or condition it on certain phase-space dimensions as well as
convolve it with observational uncertainties. This will be instrumental in
proper data analysis of stream data. In addition to providing a
computationally-efficient practical tool for modeling the dynamics of tidal
streams, the action-angle nature of the framework helps elucidate how the
observed width of the stream relates to the velocity dispersion or mass of the
progenitor, and how the progenitors of ""orphan""' streams could be located.
  The practical usefulness of the proposed framework crucially depends on the
ability to calculate action-angle variables for any orbit in any gravitational
potential. A novel method for calculating actions, frequencies, and angles in
any static potential using a single orbit integration is described in an
Appendix.

given by M31 stars and dark matter halo MACHOs, in the M31 and the Milky Way

self-lensing rate. Specifically, we evaluate an expected signal of about 2
self-lensing events. As for MACHO lensing, for full 0.5 (0.01) solar mass MACHO
halos, our prediction is for about 4 (7) events. The comparatively small number
of expected MACHO versus self lensing events, together with the small number
statistics at disposal, do not enable us to put strong constraints on that

prompted much speculation on its origin. In this Letter, we propose that G2
formed out of the debris stream produced by the removal of mass from the outer
envelope of a nearby giant star. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the
returning tidal debris stream with cooling, and find that the stream condenses
into clumps that fall periodically onto Sgr A*. We propose that one of these
clumps is the observed G2 cloud, with the rest of the stream being detectable
at lower Br-$\gamma$ emissivity along a trajectory that would trace from G2 to
the star that was partially disrupted. By simultaneously fitting the orbits of
S2, G2, and $\sim$ 2,000 candidate stars, and by fixing the orbital plane of
each candidate star to G2 (as is expected for a tidal disruption), we find that
several stars have orbits that are compatible with the notion that one of them
was tidally disrupted to produce G2. If one of these stars were indeed
disrupted, it last encountered Sgr A* hundreds of years ago, and has likely
encountered Sgr A* repeatedly. However, while these stars are compatible with
the giant disruption scenario given their measured positions and proper
motions, their radial velocities are currently unknown. If one of these stars'
radial velocity is measured to be compatible with a disruptive orbit, it would
strongly suggest its disruption produced G2.

optical and near-infrared spectra that are thought to be associated with
carbon-rich polyatomic molecules in interstellar gas. However, because the
central wavelengths of these bands do not correspond with electronic
transitions of any known atomic or molecular species, their nature has remained
uncertain since their discovery almost a century ago. Here we report on
unusually strong DIBs in optical spectra of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova
SN 2012ap that exhibit changes in equivalent width over short (~30 days)
timescales. The 4428 and 6283 Angstrom DIB features get weaker with time,
whereas the 5780 Angstrom feature shows a marginal increase. These nonuniform
changes suggest that the supernova is interacting with a nearby source of the
DIBs and that the DIB carriers possess high ionization potentials, such as
small cations or charged fullerenes. We conclude that moderate-resolution
spectra of supernovae with DIB absorptions obtained within weeks of outburst
could reveal unique information about the mass-loss environment of their
progenitor systems and provide new constraints on the properties of DIB
carriers.

Clusters (MUSIC) dataset. We focus on a sub-sample of 179 clusters at redshift
z~0.11, with 3.2e14M_sun/h<M_vir<2e15Msun/h, complete in mass. We employed the
X-ray photon simulator PHOX to obtain synthetic Chandra Observations and derive
observable-like global properties of the intracluster medium (ICM), as X-ray
temperature (T_X) and luminosity (L_X). T_X is found to slightly under-estimate
the true mass-weighted temperature, although tracing fairly well the cluster
total mass. We also study the effects of T_X on scaling relations with cluster
intrinsic properties: total (M_500) and gas (M_g500) mass; integrated Compton
parameter (Y_SZ) of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) thermal effect; Y_X=M_g500 T_X.
We confirm that Y_X is a very good mass proxy, with a scatter on M_500-Y_X and
Y_SZ-Y_X lower than 5%. The study of scaling relations among X-ray, intrinsic
and SZ properties indicates that MUSIC clusters reasonably resemble the
self-similar prediction, especially for correlations involving T_X. The
observational approach also allows for a more direct comparison with real
clusters, from which we find deviations mainly due to the physical description
of the ICM, affecting T_X and, particularly, L_X.

plays a key role in determining the final mass of newborn stars. In this paper,
we investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar
disks in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the
mass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding
collapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their
evolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher
metallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and
lower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~
1e-3Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~
1e-6Msun/yr and 10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero-
and solar-metallicity disks have similar stability properties: the Toomre
parameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio
of temperatures in the disk and in the envelope as Q ~ (T_disk/T_env)^3/2, is >
1, i.e., marginally stable. At intermediate metallicities of 1e-5--1e-3Zsun,
however, the disks are found to be strongly unstable with Q ~ 0.1--1 since dust
cooling, which is effective only in the disks due to their high density (> 1e10
cm^-3), makes the temperature in the disks lower than that in the envelopes.
This indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the
protostellar disk fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent
core in this metallicity range. The typical stellar mass in this case would be
a few Msun, which is consistent with the observationally suggested mass-scale
of extremely metal-poor stars.

spatial distributions of Globular Clusters (GCs) of the giant Virgo elliptical
galaxy NGC4649 (M60). Similar features are found in the 2D distribution of
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), both associated with GCs and in the stellar
field. Deviations from azimuthal symmetry suggest an arc-like excess of GCs
extending north at 4-15 kpc galactocentric radii in the eastern side of major
axis of NGC4649. This feature is more prominent for red GCs, but still persists
in the 2D distribution of blue GCs. High and low luminosity GCs also show some
segregation along this arc, with high-luminosity GCs preferentially located in
the southern end and low-luminosity GCs in the northern section of the arc.
GC-LMXBs follow the anisotropy of red-GCs, where most of them reside; however,
a significant overdensity of (high-luminosity) field LMXBs is present to the
south of the GC arc. These results suggest that NGC4649 has experienced mergers
and/or multiple accretions of less massive satellite galaxies during its
evolution, of which the GCs in the arc may be the fossil remnant. We speculate
that the observed anisotropy in the field LMXB spatial distribution indicates
that these X-ray binaries may be the remnants of a star formation event
connected with the merger, or maybe be ejected from the parent red GCs, if the
bulk motion of these clusters is significantly affected by dynamical friction.
We also detect a luminosity enhancement in the X-ray source population of the
companion spiral galaxy NGC4647. We suggest that these may be younger high mass
X-ray binaries formed as a result of the tidal interaction of this galaxy with

that a significant fraction of stars ($\sim10%$) are in a cold ($\sigma_{\rm V}

200$ km/s). These stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in the
Galactic bar. In this study, we use two $N$-body models of the Milky Way-like
disk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine this
possibility. The general trends of the Galactocentric radial velocity
distribution in observations and simulations are similar, but neither our
models nor the BRAVA data reveal a statistically significant cold high velocity
peak. A Monte Carlo test further suggests that it is possible for a spurious
high velocity peak to appear if there are only a limited number of stars
observed. Thus, the reported cold high velocity peak, even if it is real, is
unlikely due to stars on the bar-supporting orbits. Our models do predict an
excess of stars with high radial velocity, but not in a distinct peak. In the
distance--velocity diagram, the high velocity particles in different fields
exist at a similar distance $\sim8.5 \pm 1$ kpc away from the Sun. This result
may be explained with geometric intersections between the line-of-sight and the
particle orbits; high velocity stars naturally exist approximately at the
tangent point, without constituting a distinct peak. We further demonstrate
that even without the presence of a bar structure, particle motions in an
axisymmetric disk can also exhibit an excess of high velocity stars.

in order to produce the power spectra of the two main baryonic matter
components in the Universe: stars and hot gas. As a natural extension, this can
be also used to describe the clustering of all mass. According to the design of
the halo model, the large-scale power spectra of the various matter components
are physically connected with the distribution of each component within bound
structures and thus, ultimately, with the complete set of physical processes
that drive the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Besides being
practical for cosmological and parametric studies, the semi-analytic model
presented here has also other advantages. Most importantly, it allows one to
understand on physical ground what is the relative contribution of each matter
component to the total clustering of mass as a function of scale, and thus it
opens an interesting new window to infer the distribution of baryons through
high precision cosmic shear measurements. This is particularly relevant for
future wide-field photometric surveys such as Euclid. In this work the concept
of the model and its uncertainties are illustrated in detail, while in a
companion paper we use a set of numerical hydrodynamic simulations to show a
practical application and to investigate where the model itself needs to be
improved.

ladder, or spectral line energy distribution (SLED). The few available multi-J
CO observations of galaxies show a very broad range of SLEDs, even at fixed
galaxy mass and star formation rate, making the conversion to J=1-0 emission

simulations of disk galaxies and galaxy mergers with molecular line radiative
transfer calculations to develop a model for the physical parameters that drive
variations in CO SLEDs in galaxies. An essential feature of our model is a
fully self-consistent computation of the molecular gas temperature and
excitation structure. We find that, while the shape of the SLED is ultimately
determined by difficult-to-observe quantities such as the gas density,
temperature, and optical depth distributions, all of these quantities are
well-correlated with the galaxy's mean star formation rate surface density
(Sigma_SFR), which is observable. We use this result to develop a model for the
CO SLED in terms of Sigma_SFR, and show that this model quantitatively
reproduces the SLEDs of galaxies over a dynamic range of ~200 in SFR surface
density, at redshifts from z=0-6. This model should make it possible to
significantly reduce the uncertainty in deducing molecular gas masses from

individual cluster mass estimates consistent with available SHeLS dynamical

Our best-fit solution shows a period derivative of the order of $10^{-23}$, an
extremely small number compared to that of a typical MSP. However, it is likely
that the pulsar lies beyond the Galactic Centre, and an unremarkable intrinsic
period derivative is reduced to close to zero by the Galactic potential
acceleration. Furthermore, we highlight the potential to employ PSR J1801-3210
in the strong equivalence principle test due to its wide and circular orbit. In
a broader comparison with the known MSP population, we suggest a correlation
between higher mass functions and the presence of eclipses in `very low-mass

orbital inclinations. We also suggest that the distribution of the total mass

adopted to model the projected two-point correlation function measurements on
small and intermediate scales (from $0.02$ to $60\,h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$) and to
interpret the observed trends and infer the connection of galaxies to dark
matter halos. We find that luminous red galaxies reside in massive halos of
mass $M{\sim}10^{13}$--$10^{14}\,h^{-1}{\rm M_\odot}$ and more luminous
galaxies are more clustered and hosted by more massive halos. The strong
small-scale clustering requires a fraction of these galaxies to be satellites
in massive halos, with the fraction at the level of 5--8 per cent and
decreasing with luminosity. The characteristic mass of a halo hosting on
average one satellite galaxy above a luminosity threshold is about a factor
$8.7$ larger than that of a halo hosting a central galaxy above the same
threshold. At a fixed luminosity, progressively redder galaxies are more
strongly clustered on small scales, which can be explained by having a larger
fraction of these galaxies in the form of satellites in massive halos. Our
clustering measurements on scales below $0.4\,h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$ allow us to
study the small-scale spatial distribution of satellites inside halos. While
the clustering of luminosity-threshold samples can be well described by a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, that of the reddest galaxies prefers a
steeper or more concentrated profile. Finally, we also use galaxy samples of
constant number density at different redshifts to study the evolution of
luminous galaxies, and find the clustering to be consistent with passive
evolution in the redshift range of $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$.

become CAT(0) spaces and the intrinsic means are unique. In one case, a minimal
spanning tree of a graph based on the data becomes CAT(0). In another, a

analysis related to $\chi^2$ fitting of the model parameters, relevant
observables are identified for dipole excitations, which strongly correlate
with the neutron-skin thickness $(r_{np})$, symmetry energy at saturation
density $(J)$ and slope of the symmetry energy $(L)$. Using the RNEDF framework
and experimental data on pygmy dipole strength ($^{68}$Ni, $^{132}$Sn,

gravitationally captured by depositing a considerable amount of energy into
nonradial stellar modes of very high angular number $l$. If the neutron-star
equation of state is sufficiently stiff, we show that the total energy loss in
the point-particle approximation is formally divergent. Various mechanisms
-including viscosity, finite-size effects and the elasticity of the crust- can
damp high-$l$ modes and regularize the total energy loss. Within a short time,
the black hole is trapped inside the star and disrupts it by rapid accretion.
Estimating these effects, we predict that the existence of old neutron stars in
regions where the dark-matter density rho_{DM}>10^2 sigma/(km/s) GeV/cm^3
(where sigma is the dark-matter velocity dispersion) limits the abundance of
primordial black holes in the mass range 10^{17} g < m_{PBH} < 10^{24} g, which
was previously unconstrained. In combination with existing limits, our results
suggest that primordial black holes cannot be the dominant dark matter

confining energy scale $\Lambda_{CD}$. The constituent dynamics condensate
$\langle\bar{v}v+\bar{w}w\rangle\neq 0$ spontaneously breaks the electroweak
symmetry $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm EM}$ and a triplet of
Nambu-Goldstone bosons make the gauge bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ massive, while
retaining a massless photon. A global custodial $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$
symmetry guarantees that the symmetry breaking in the weak interaction sector
agrees with electroweak data. The non-Abelian $SU(2)_C$ color dynamics
satisfies asymptotic freedom, which resolves the gauge and Higgs mass hierarchy
problems and makes the model ultraviolet complete. The composite constituent

understood, it is generally accepted that the energy released in the collapse
produces a shock that disrupts the star and produces the explosion. Some of the
stellar material does not receive enough energy to escape the potential well of
the newly formed neutron star and it falls back on to the core. This fallback
plays an important role in setting compact remnant masses and has been invoked
to explain a number of observed phenomena: late-time neutrino emission,
r-process element production, peculiar supernovae, and long-duration gamma-ray
bursts. To examine the link between fallback and these observed phenomena, we
must understand the nature of fallback and currently, multiple mechanisms have
been proposed that lead to different characteristics of the fallback. In this
paper, we model a series of three-dimensional explosions by following the
fallback for two different massive progenitors to study both the nature of the
fallback and the role of asymmetric explosions on this fallback. One of the
most-cited mechanisms behind fallback argues that it is caused by the reverse
shock produced when the outward moving supernova shock decelerates in the
relatively flat density profile of the stellar envelope. We show that this
mechanism plays a minor, if any, role in driving fallback and most supernova
fallback is produced by prompt mechanisms.

Mars sized impactor. The initial structure of the disk significantly affects
the Moon forming process, including the Moons mass, its accretion time scale,
and its isotopic similarity to Earth. The dynamics of the impact event
determines the initial structure of a nearly hydrostatic Moon forming disk.
However, the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models have been studied separately
and their connection has not previously been well quantified. Here, we show the
extent to which the properties of the disk can be inferred from Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations. By using entropy, angular momentum and
mass distributions of the SPH outputs as approximately conserved quantities, we
compute the two dimensional disk structure. We investigate four different
models: (a) standard, the canonical giant impact model, (b) fast spinning
Earth, a collision between a fast spinning Earth and a small impactor, (c) sub
Earths, a collision between two objects with half Earths mass, and (d)
intermediate, a collision of two bodies whose mass ratio is 7:3. Our SPH
calculations show that the initial disk has approximately uniform entropy. The
disks of the fast spinning Earth and sub Earths cases are hotter and more
vaporized (80-90% vapor) than the standard case (20%). The intermediate case
falls between these values. In the highly vaporized cases, our procedure fails
to establish a unique surface density profile of the disk because the disk is
unstable according to the Rayleigh criterion. In these cases, we estimate
non-unique disk models by conserving global quantities. We also develop a semi
analytic model for the thermal structure of the disk, which requires only two
inputs: the average entropy and the surface density of the disk.

Primitive operators such as those for performing arithmetic and comparisons
typically operate on a wide variety of in put value types, and as such, must
internally implement some form of dynamic type dispatch and type checking.
Removing such type tests is important for an efficient implementation.
  In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of a novel approach to reducing
the number of dynamically executed type tests called context-driven basic block
versioning. This simple technique clones and specializes basic blocks in such a
way as to allow the compiler to accumulate type information while machine code
is generated, without a separate type analysis pass. The accumulated
information allows the removal of some redundant type tests, particularly in
performance-critical paths.
  We have implemented intraprocedural context-driven basic block versioning in
a JavaScript JIT compiler. For comparison, we have also implemented a classical
flow-based type analysis operating on the same concrete types. Our results show
that basic block versioning performs better on most benchmarks and removes a
large fraction of type tests at the expense of a moderate code size increase.
We believe that this technique offers a good tradeoff between implementation
complexity and performance, and is suitable for integration in production JIT
compilers.

temporal and spatial information of network connections in encoding the network
connection information into rules in NIDS. Preliminary experiments with KDD Cup

constant $\theta \approx$ 116 K. However, the $^{51}$V spectrum shows no
ordering near these temperatures, splitting instead into two peaks below 65 K,
which suggests only short-ranged magnetic order on the NMR time scale. Two
magnetic transitions are identified from peaks in the spin-lattice relaxation
rate, $1/^{51}T_1$, at temperatures $T_{N1} \approx$ 19 K and $T_{N2} \approx$
13 K, which are lower than the estimates obtained from polycrystalline samples.
In the low-temperature incommensurate spiral state, the maximum ordered moment
is estimated as 1.95${\mu}_B$/Fe, or 1/3 of the local moment. Strong low-energy
spin fluctuations are also indicated by the unconventional power-law
temperature dependence $1/^{51}T_1 \propto T^2$. The large Weiss constant,
short-range magnetic correlations far above $T_{N1}$, small ordered moment,

reference model based on observed properties of the Large Magellanic Cloud

formation can be induced by a brief tidal interaction. We thereafter perform a
detailed parameter study, and find that at the dynamical mass of LMC-type discs
($\sim$10$^{\rm 10}$ \md{}), stellar lopsidedness (as quantified by the m$=$1
Fourier mode) and bar off-centredness can vary widely in amplitude, but are
generally short-lived ($\sim$Gyr). Tidal interactions induce more persistent
lopsidedness in lower mass galaxies (several Gyr), in particular those with
large halo-to-disc mass ratios as implied by recent halo occupation models. We
suggest that the tidal interactions play a larger role in the observed ubiquity
of lopsidedness than the presently favoured gas accretion mechanism for lower
mass galaxies. Other characteristics of Magellanic-type galaxies, such as
one-sided star formation, are quantified and tend to arise more prominently in
discs with later-type spiral structure (more halo dominated inner disc, weaker
bars) following retrograde orbital encounters.

study of QWs: time-averaged limit measure, weak limit measure, and stationary
measure. The first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and
the ballistic spreading in the QW. As Konno et al. suggested, the time-averaged

infrastructures. To realize such a goal, recently a new network infrastructure
named cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is proposed by China Mobile to enhance
network coverage and save energy simultaneously. In C-RANs, to order to save
more energy the radio front ends are separated from the colocated baseband
units and distributively located in physical positions. C-RAN can be recognized
as a variant of distributed antenna systems (DASs). In this paper we analyze
the performance of C-RANS using random matrix theory. Due to the fact that the
antennas are distributed geographically instead of being installed nearby, the
variances of the entries in the considered channel matrix are different from
each other. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the work on random matrices
with elements having different variances is largely open, which is of great
importance for DASs. In our work, some fundamental results on the eigenvalue
distributions of the random matrices with different variances are derived
first. Then based on these fundamental conclusions the outage probability of
the considered DAS is derived. Finally, the accuracy of our analytical results
is assessed by some numerical results.

coding solution over GF($q$) exists when $q$ is sufficiently large. In
particular, for each prime power $q$ no smaller than the number of receivers, a
linear solution over GF($q$) can be efficiently constructed. In this work, we
reveal that a linear solution over a given finite field does \emph{not}
necessarily imply the existence of a linear solution over all larger finite
fields. Specifically, we prove by construction that: (i) For every source
dimension no smaller than 3, there is a multicast network linearly solvable
over GF(7) but not over GF(8), and another multicast network linearly solvable
over GF(16) but not over GF(17); (ii) There is a multicast network linearly
solvable over GF(5) but not over such GF($q$) that $q > 5$ is a Mersenne prime
plus 1, which can be extremely large; (iii) A multicast network linearly
solvable over GF($q^{m_1}$) and over GF($q^{m_2}$) is \emph{not} necessarily
linearly solvable over GF($q^{m_1+m_2}$); (iv) There exists a class of
multicast networks with a set $T$ of receivers such that the minimum field size

$\Theta(\sqrt{|T|})$, but not every larger field than GF($q_{min}$) suffices to
yield a linear solution. The insight brought from this work is that not only
the field size, but also the order of subgroups in the multiplicative group of
a finite field affects the linear solvability of a multicast network.

monitored with RXTE from 1996 to 2012. We focus on three properties of these
sources: the evolution of the timing, pulsed flux, and pulse profile. We report
several new timing anomalies and radiative events, including a putative
anti-glitch seen in 1E 2259+586 in 2009, and a second epoch of very large
spin-down rate fluctuations in 1E 1048.1-5937 following a large flux outburst.
We compile the properties of the 11 glitches and 4 glitch candidates observed
from these 5 AXPs between 1996 and 2012. Overall, these monitoring observations
reveal several apparent patterns in the behavior of this sample of AXPs: large
radiative changes in AXPs (including long-lived flux enhancements, short
bursts, and pulse profile changes) are rare, occurring typically only every few
years per source; large radiative changes are almost always accompanied by some
form of timing anomaly, usually a spin-up glitch; only 20-30% of timing
anomalies are accompanied by any form of radiative change. We find that AXP
radiative behavior at the times of radiatively loud glitches is sufficiently
similar to suggest common physical origins. The similarity in glitch properties
when comparing radiatively loud and radiatively silent glitches in AXPs
suggests a common physical origin in the stellar interior. Finally, the overall
similarity of AXP and radio pulsar glitches suggests a common physical origin
for both phenomena.

we propose a more general approach where multiple codewords are generated from

secrecy is ensured is characterized, with derivations for the existence of
secret codes. We show in particular that the classes are not a trivial subset

the proposed solution. The result is further confirmed by deriving the average
achievable secrecy throughput, thus taking into account both decoding and

transport of angular momentum inside stars. The recent detection of mixed modes
that contain the signature of rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and
red giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this issue.
  Aims: Our aim is to probe the radial dependance of the rotation profiles for
a sample of Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants
are particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are
more sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case for
their more evolved counterparts.
  Methods: We first extract the rotational splittings and frequencies of the
modes for six young Kepler red giants. We then perform a seismic modeling of
these stars using the evolutionary codes CESAM2k and ASTEC. By using the
observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we
perform inversions of the internal rotation profiles of the six stars.
  Results: We obtain estimates of the mean rotation rate in the core and in the
convective envelope of these stars. We show that the rotation contrast between
the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results
also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, contrary to the RGB
stars whose core has been shown to spin down. For two of the stars, we show
that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the
observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile.
Interestingly, the depths that are found most probable for the discontinuities

outskirts, a vast region up to now essentially not covered by observations. The
recent Suzaku (X-ray) and Planck (Sunayev-Zeldovich effect) observations out to
the virial radius have highlighted in these peripheral regions a rather sharp
decline of the intracluster gas temperature, an entropy flattening in contrast
with the theoretically expected power law increase, the break of the
hydrostatic equilibrium even in some relaxed clusters, a derived gas mass
fraction above the cosmic value measured from several CMB experiments, and a
total X-ray mass lower than the weak lensing mass determinations. Here we
present the analysis of four clusters (A1795, A2029, A2204 and A133) with the
SuperModel that includes a nonthermal pressure component due to turbulence to
sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium also in the cluster outskirts. In such way
we obtain a correct determination of the total X-ray mass and of the gas mass
fraction; this in turn allows to determine the level of the gas clumping that
can affect the shape of the entropy profiles reported by the Suzaku
observations. Our conclusion is that the role of the gas clumping is very
marginal and that the observed entropy flattening is due to the rapid decrement
of the temperature in the cluster outskirts caused by non gravitational
effects. Moreover, we show that the X-ray/SZ joint analysis from ROSAT and
Planck data, as performed in some recent investigations, is inadequate to
discriminate between a power law increase and a flattening of the entropy.

evaluate the gluonic non-perturbative effect to the diquark, considering the
size effect of the diquark. We investigate the mass function of the diquark in
both cases with a constant bare diquark mass and twice of the running quark
self-energy. It is found that the diquark, especially the small diquark,

a different approach where silicene is stabilized using very weakly interacting

scaffold. The confinement between the flat graphene layers results in a planar
clustering of Si atoms with small buckling, which is energetically unfavorable
in vacuum. Buckled hexagonal arrangement of Si atoms similar to free-standing
silicene is observed for large clusters, which, in contrast to Si atoms on
metallic surfaces, is only very weakly van der Waals coupled to the graphene

findings, which are supported by density functional tight-binding calculations,
show that intercalating bilayer graphene with Si is a favorable route to
realize silicene.

638 trading flow networks of different products. We claim that the allometric

hierarchicality of a flow network, i.e., whether the trading products flow on
long hierarchical chains. Then, the flow networks of products with higher added
values and complexity, such as machinery&transport equipment with larger

networks are more hierarchical. As a result, without extra data such as global

well. The contribution of the discrete states is thus present even for
perturbative strings propagating in the background of large Schwarzschild black
holes. We argue that the discrete states live at a stringy distance from the

exponential complexity, but empirically the performance of polar codes at
finite block lengths is boosted by moving along the family ${\mathcal C}_{\rm

  Systems & Computers",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, full-duplex (FD) communications with simultaneous transmission and
reception on the same channel has been proposed. The FD receiver, however,
suffers from inevitable self-interference (SI) from the much more powerful
transmit signal. Analogue radio-frequency (RF) and baseband, as well as digital
baseband, cancellation techniques have been proposed for suppressing the SI,
but so far most of the studies have failed to take into account the inherent
nonlinearities of the transmitter and receiver front-ends. To fill this gap,
this article proposes a novel digital nonlinear interference cancellation
technique to mitigate the power amplifier (PA) induced nonlinear SI in a FD
transceiver. The technique is based on modeling the nonlinear SI channel, which
is comprised of the nonlinear PA, the linear multipath SI channel, and the RF
SI canceller, with a parallel Hammerstein nonlinearity. Stemming from the
modeling, and appropriate parameter estimation, the known transmit data is then
processed with the developed nonlinear parallel Hammerstein structure and
suppressed from the receiver path at digital baseband. The results illustrate
that with a given IIP3 figure for the PA, the proposed technique enables higher
transmit power to be used compared to existing linear SI cancellation methods.
Alternatively, for a given maximum transmit power level, a lower-quality PA
(i.e., lower IIP3) can be used.

to combine two different and independent sources of information on the internal

whose light curve shows deep eclipses, complex pulsation patterns with
pulsation frequencies typical of {\delta} Sct, and a highly eccentric orbit. We
present the result of the analysis of Kepler photometry and of high resolution
phaseresolved spectroscopy. Spectroscopy yielded both the radial velocity
curves and, after spectral disentangling, the primary component effective
temperature and metallicity, and line-of-sight projected rotational velocities.
The Kepler light curve was analyzed with an iterative procedure devised to
disentangle eclipses from pulsations which takes into account the visibility of
the pulsating star during eclipses. The search for the best set of binary
parameters was performed combining the synthetic light curve models with a
genetic minimization algorithm, which yielded a robust and accurate
determination of the system parameters. The binary components have very similar
masses (1.88 and 1.86 Msun) and effective temperatures (6800 and 6600 K), but
different radii (3.45 and 3.05 Rsun). The comparison with the theoretical
models evidenced a somewhat different evolutionary status of the components and
the need of introducing overshooting in the models. The pulsation analysis
indicates a hybrid nature of the pulsating (secondary) component, the
corresponding high order g-modes might be excited by an intrinsic mechanism or
by tidal forces.

of this cavity would be around an order of magnitude larger than the energy
lost by X-ray emission. It would be the smallest and youngest known cavity in a
brightest cluster galaxy and the lack of over pressuring implies heating is
still gentle. In contrast, NGC 4874 does not show any evidence for cavities,
although it hosts a well-known wide-angle-tail radio source which is visible
outside the region occupied by the X-ray corona. These two galaxies show that

16.84 au. Analysis of the spectra revealed the presence of the CO$^+$ and
N$_2^+$ emissions in the cometary coma at a distance of 8.36 au from the Sun.
This distance is larger than ionic emissions have been detected in any previous
objects. Only continuum, with no traces of emissions, was detected in the

spectra obtained in 2008, average column densities of 2.04$\times$10$^9$ mol
cm$^{-2}$ for N$_2^+$ and 3.26$\times$10$^{10}$ mol cm$^{-2}$ for CO$^+$ were
measured in the cometary coma. The derived values correspond to
N$_2^+$/CO$^+$=0.06 within the projected slit. The parameter, which is used as
an indicator of cometary activity, was measured as 2000 cm in 2008, and 800 cm
in 2009 and 2011. The values correspond to dust production rates between 10-20
kg s$^{-1}$, 4-6 kg s$^{-1}$ and 3-5 kg s$^{-1}$ at 8.36, 9.86, and 13.40 au
respectively. There is an obvious correlation between the decrease of the dust
production rate of the nucleus and the disappearance of the emissions in the
spectrum of C/2002 VQ94 (LINEAR) at heliocentric distances greater than 9 au.
The colors and size of the nucleus of C/2002 VQ94 (LINEAR) were estimated from

M_I^w( U), is hyperreflexive for suitable infinite I, then so is M_I^w( V). We
describe situations where if L1, L are isomorphic lattices, then the

general nature in quantum field theory (such as the formal expression for the
Lagrangian perturbation of a correlation function), our formula is completely
well-defined from the start, i.e. requires no further UV-renormalization. This
feature is a result of a cancelation of UV-divergences between various terms in
our identity. Our proof, and an analysis of the features, of our identity is
given for the example of massive, Euclidean $\varphi^4$ theory in 4 dimensional
Euclidean space, and relies heavily on the framework of the renormalization
group flow equations. It is valid to arbitrary, but finite orders in
perturbation theory. The final formula, however, makes no explicit reference to
the renormalization group flow, nor to perturbation theory, and we conjecture
that it also holds non-perturbatively. The identity can be applied
constructively because it gives recursive algorithm for the computation of OPE
coefficients to arbitrary (finite) perturbation order in terms of the zeroth
order coefficients corresponding to the underlying free field theory, which in
turn are trivial to obtain. We briefly illustrate the relation of this method
to more standard methods for computing the OPE in some simple examples.

population by incorporating pre-defined baryonic prescriptions into a dark
matter hierarchical merger tree. Specifically the model is based on the simple
gas-regulator model introduced by Lilly et al. 2013 coupled with the empirical
quenching rules of Peng et al. 2010/12. The simplest model already does quite
well in reproducing, without re-adjusting the input parameters, many
observables including the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation, the faint end slope
of the galaxy mass function and the shape of the star-forming and passive mass
functions. Compared with observations and/or the recent phenomenological model
of Behroozi et al. 2013 based on epoch-dependent abundance-matching, our model
also qualitatively reproduces the evolution of the Main Sequence sSFR(z) and
SFRD(z) star formation rate density relations, the $M_s - M_h$ stellar-to-halo
mass relation and also the $SFR - M_h$ relation. Quantitatively the evolution
of sSFR(z) and SFRD(z) is not steep enough, the $M_s - M_h$ relation is not
quite peaked enough and, surprisingly, the ratio of quenched to star-forming
galaxies around M* is not quite high enough. We show that these deficiencies
can simultaneously be solved by ad hoc allowing galaxies to re-ingest some of
the gas previously expelled in winds, provided that this is done in a
mass-dependent and epoch-dependent way. These allow the model galaxies to
reduce an inherent tendency to saturate their star-formation efficiency. This
emphasizes how efficient galaxies around M* are in converting baryons into
stars and highlights the fact that quenching occurs just at the point when
galaxies are rapidly approaching the maximum possible efficiency of converting
baryons into stars.

Spatially resolved kinematics and stellar population parameters (ages,
metallicities and $\alpha$-element abundance ratios) derived using ~20 Lick
indices are presented. Despite remarkable similarities in their morphologies,
photometric properties (luminosity and colour) and kinematics, the two galaxies
exhibit significantly different stellar population parameters.
  SDSS J073422.21+265133.9 exhibits a strong metallicity gradient
(Delta[Z/H]/Delta R ~ -0.4) all the way into the centre of the galaxy. It also
exhibits an age profile that suggest a relatively recent, centrally
concentrated burst of star formation superimposed on an older, more spatially
extended population. NGC 2484, a well known X-ray AGN, exhibits a flat
core-like structure in its metallicity gradient, but no detectable age
gradient. The alpha-element abundance ratio ([E/Fe]) profiles of the two
galaxies are also significantly different. SDSS J073422.21+265133.9 exhibits a
slightly positive gradient (Delta [E/H]/Delta R ~ 0.1), perhaps again
suggesting a more recent central burst of star formation, while NGC 2484 shows
a negative gradient (Delta [E/H]/Delta R ~-0.1), indicating that star formation
may have happened ""inside out"".
  Our analysis of these two galaxies of similar mass, morphology and kinematics
therefore suggests two different mechanisms to have been in action during their
formation. Consequently, we conclude that the central galaxies of fossil groups
can not be considered a homogeneous group with regard to their formation
processes or star formation histories.

masses. Here we investigate whether this HI is related to the presence of a
stellar disc within the host making use of the classification of ETGs in fast
and slow rotators (FR/SR). We find a large diversity of HI masses and
morphologies within both families. Surprisingly, SRs are detected as often,
host as much HI and have a similar rate of HI discs/rings as FRs. Accretion of
HI is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. The
weak relation between HI and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequent
kinematical misalignment in FRs, including cases of polar and counterrotating
gas. In SRs the HI is usually polar. This complex picture highlights a
diversity of ETG formation histories which may be lost in the relative
simplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outer
regions.
  We find that LCDM hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducing
the HI properties of ETGs. The gas discs formed in simulations are either too
massive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation.
Kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. The main
point of conflict is that nearly all simulated FRs and a large fraction of all
simulated SRs host corotating HI. This establishes the HI properties of ETGs as
a novel challenge to simulations.

of the shear field acts to increase the initial overdensity (or decrease the
underdensity) that a protohalo (or protovoid) must have if it is to form by the
present time. Equivalently, it is the difference between the overdensity and
(the square root of the) shear that must be larger than a threshold value. To
estimate the effect this has on halo abundances using the excursion set
approach, we must solve for the first crossing distribution of a barrier of
constant height by the random walks associated with the difference, which is
now (even for Gaussian initial conditions) a non-Gaussian variate. The
correlation properties of such non-Gaussian walks are inherited from those of
the density and the shear, and, since they are independent processes, the
solution is in fact remarkably simple. We show that this provides an easy way
to understand why earlier heuristic arguments about the nature of the solution
worked so well. In addition to modelling halos and voids, this potentially
simplifies models of the abundance and spatial distribution of filaments and
sheets in the cosmic web.

follows an universal dome-shaped behavior as function of doping. It is believed
that the origin of superconductivity in cuprates is entangled with the physics
of the pseudogap phase. An open discussion is whether the source of
superconductivity is the same that causes the pseudogap properties. The $t$-$J$
model treated in large-N expansion shows $d$-wave superconductivity triggered
by non-retarded interactions, and an instability of the paramagnetic state to a
flux phase or $d$-wave charge density wave ($d$-CDW) state. In this paper we
show that self-energy effects near $d$-CDW instability may lead to a
dome-shaped behavior of $T_c$. In addition, it is also shown that these
self-energy contributions may describe several properties observed in the
pseudogap phase. In this picture, although fluctuations responsible for the
pseudogap properties leads to a dome-shaped behavior, they are not involved in
pairing which is mainly non-retarded.

agent performing a discrete-time random walk over a finite state space. The
agent's action at each time step is to specify the probability distribution for
the next state given the current state. Following the set-up of Todorov, the
state-action cost at each time step is a sum of a state cost and a control cost
given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the agent's next-state
distribution and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The online
aspect of the problem is due to the fact that the state cost functions are
generated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns the current state cost
only after selecting an action. An explicit construction of a computationally
efficient strategy with small regret (i.e., expected difference between its
actual total cost and the smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of
the state costs) under mild regularity conditions is presented, along with a
demonstration of the performance of the proposed strategy on a simulated target

other macroscopic quantum states like the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state,
the content of entanglement and other quantum correlations in the microscopic

of particles in their macroscopic sectors, when all the particles suffer
passage through local amplitude and phase damping channels. Decay of quantum
correlations -- entanglement as well as quantum discord -- of this class of
states in the microscopic to macroscopic partition is also much lower in the
case of all the local quantum channels, as compared to the other macroscopic
superposition states. The macroscopic sections of the states are formed, in
each case, by using a Dicke state and an orthogonal product state, which are
macroscopically distinct in terms of markedly different amounts of violation of
Bell inequality.

behaviors due to its ability to form complex multi-cellular structures.
Knowledge of M. xanthus surface gliding motility and the mechanisms that
coordinate it are critically important to our understanding of collective cell
behaviors. Although the mechanism of gliding motility is still under
investigation, recent experiments suggest that there are two possible
mechanisms underlying force production for cell motility: the focal adhesion
mechanism and the helical rotor mechanism which differ in the biophysics of the
cell-substrate interactions. Whereas the focal adhesion model predicts an
elastic coupling, the helical rotor model predicts a viscous coupling. Using a
combination of computational modeling, imaging, and force microscopy, we find
evidence for elastic coupling in support of the focal adhesion model. Using a
biophysical model of the M. xanthus cell, we investigated how the mechanical
interactions between cells are affected by interactions with the substrate.
Comparison of modeling results with experimental data for cell-cell collision
events pointed to a strong, elastic attachment between the cell and substrate.
These results are robust to variations in the mechanical and geometrical
parameters of the model. We then directly measured the motor-substrate coupling
by monitoring the motion of optically trapped beads and find that motor
velocity decreases exponentially with opposing load. At high loads, motor
velocity approaches zero velocity asymptotically and motors remain bound to
beads indicating a strong, elastic attachment.

structures have been observed. A large number of users participate in these
networks and the size of the resulting graphs poses computational challenges.
There is a particular demand in identifying the nodes responsible for
information flow between communities; for example, in temporal Twitter networks
edges between communities play a key role in propagating spikes of activity
when the connectivity between communities is sparse and few edges exist between
different clusters of nodes. The new algorithm proposed here is aimed at
revealing these key connections by measuring a node's vicinity to nodes of
another community. We look at the nodes which have edges in more than one
community and the locality of nodes around them which influence the information
received and broadcasted to them. The method relies on independent random walks
of a chosen fixed number of steps, originating from nodes with edges in more
than one community. For the large networks that we have in mind, existing
measures such as betweenness centrality are difficult to compute, even with
recent methods that approximate the large number of operations required. We
therefore design an algorithm that scales up to the demand of current big data
requirements and has the ability to harness parallel processing capabilities.
The new algorithm is illustrated on synthetic data, where results can be judged
carefully, and also on a real, large scale Twitter activity data, where new
insights can be gained.

Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) and one J-Dropout galaxy using the Combined Array
for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer (PdBI). We observed three bright $z\sim6.5-7$ LAEs discovered in
the SUBARU deep field (SDF) and the Multiple Imaged lensed $z\sim 11$ galaxy
candidate found behind the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015. For the LAEs IOK-1
($z=6.965$), SDF J132415.7+273058 ($z=6.541$) and SDF J132408.3+271543
($z=6.554$) we find upper limits for the [CII] line luminosity of $<2.05$,
$<4.52$ and $<10.56\times10^{8}{\rm L}_{\odot}$ respectively. We find upper
limits to the FIR luminosity of the galaxies using a spectral energy
distribution template of the local galaxy NGC 6946 and taking into account the
effects of the Cosmic Microwave Background on the mm observations. For IOK-1,
SDF J132415.7+273058 and SDF J132408.3+271543 we find upper limits for the FIR
luminosity of $<2.33$, $3.79$ and $7.72\times10^{11}{\rm L}_{\odot}$
respectively. For the lensed galaxy MACS0647-JD, one of the highest redshift
galaxy candidate to date with $z_{\rm ph}=10.7^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ we put an upper
limit in the [CII] emission of $<1.36\times10^{8}\times(\mu/15)^{-1}{\rm
L}_{\odot}$ and an upper limit in the FIR luminosity of
$<6.1\times10^{10}\times(\mu/15)^{-1}{\rm L}_{\odot}$ (where $\mu$ is the
magnification factor). We explore the different conditions relevant for the
search for [CII] emission in high redshift galaxies as well as the difficulties
for future observations with ALMA and CCAT.

in the analysis of many kind of high-dimensional data. It is used in signal
processing, mechanical engineering, psychometrics, and other fields under
different names. It still bears the same mathematical idea: the decomposition
of variation of a high dimensional object into uncorrelated factors or
components. However, in many of the above applications, one is interested in
capturing the tail variables of the data rather than variation around the mean.
Such applications include weather related event curves, expected shortfalls,
and speeding analysis among others. These are all high dimensional tail objects
which one would like to study in a PCA fashion. The tail character though
requires to do the dimension reduction in an asymmetric norm rather than the
classical $L_2$-type orthogonal projection. We develop an analogue of PCA in an
asymmetric norm. These norms cover both quantiles and expectiles, another tail
event measure. The difficulty is that there is no natural basis, no `principal
components', to the $k$-dimensional subspace found. We propose two definitions
of principal components and provide algorithms based on iterative least
squares. We prove upper bounds on their convergence times, and compare their
performances in a simulation study. We apply the algorithms to a Chinese
weather dataset with a view to weather derivative pricing

helioscope. As its primary physics goal, IAXO will look for axions or
axion-like particles (ALPs) originating in the Sun via the Primakoff conversion
of the solar plasma photons. In terms of signal-to-noise ratio, IAXO will be
about 4-5 orders of magnitude more sensitive than CAST, currently the most
powerful axion helioscope, reaching sensitivity to axion-photon couplings down
to a few $\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and thus probing a large fraction of the
currently unexplored axion and ALP parameter space. IAXO will also be sensitive
to solar axions produced by mechanisms mediated by the axion-electron coupling
$g_{ae}$ with sensitivity $-$for the first time$-$ to values of $g_{ae}$ not
previously excluded by astrophysics. With several other possible physics cases,
IAXO has the potential to serve as a multi-purpose facility for generic axion
and ALP research in the next decade. In this paper we present the conceptual
design of IAXO, which follows the layout of an enhanced axion helioscope, based
on a purpose-built 20m-long 8-coils toroidal superconducting magnet. All the
eight 60cm-diameter magnet bores are equipped with focusing x-ray optics, able
to focus the signal photons into $\sim 0.2$ cm$^2$ spots that are imaged by
ultra-low-background Micromegas x-ray detectors. The magnet is built into a
structure with elevation and azimuth drives that will allow for solar tracking
for $\sim$12 h each day.

years, some evaluation methods are presented that utilize only a single feature
like color feature to detect similarity between automatic video summaries and
ground-truth user summaries. One of the drawbacks of using a single feature is
that sometimes it gives a false similarity detection which makes the assessment
of the quality of the generated video summary less perceptual and not accurate.
In this paper, a novel method for evaluating automatic video summaries is
presented. This method is based on comparing automatic video summaries
generated by video summarization techniques with ground-truth user summaries.
The objective of this evaluation method is to quantify the quality of video
summaries, and allow comparing different video summarization techniques
utilizing both color and texture features of the video frames and using the
Bhattacharya distance as a dissimilarity measure due to its advantages. Our
Experiments show that the proposed evaluation method overcomes the drawbacks of
other methods and gives a more perceptual evaluation of the quality of the
automatic video summaries.

Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation. Here we review that approach, together
with the functional Taylor expansion that the KPZ nonequilibrium potential
(NEP) admits. Such expansion becomes naturally truncated at third order, giving
rise to a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation to be regarded as
a gradient-flow counterpart to the KPZ equation. A dynamic renormalization
group analysis at one-loop order of this new mesoscopic model yields the KPZ
scaling relation alpha+z=2, as a consequence of the exact cancelation of the
different contributions to vertex renormalization. This result is quite
remarkable, considering the lower degree of symmetry of this equation, which is
in particular not Galilean invariant. In addition, this scheme is exploited to
inquire about the dynamical behavior of the KPZ equation through a
path-integral approach. Each of these aspects offers novel points of view and
sheds light on particular aspects of the dynamics of the KPZ equation.
