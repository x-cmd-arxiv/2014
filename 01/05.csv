phenomenologically described changing the typical dynamical and/or kinematical
scales characterizing the free nucleon case. In a holographic approach, this
rescaling is an analytical property of the computed structure function
$F_2(x,Q^2)$. This function is given by the sum of a conformal term and of a
contribution due to quark confinement, depending on IR hard-wall parameter
$z_0$ and on the mean square distances, related to a parameter $Q^\prime$,
among quarks and gluons in the target. The holographic structure function per
nucleon in a nucleus $A$ is evaluated showing that a rescaling of the typical
nucleon size, $z_0$ and $Q^\prime$, due to nuclear binding, can be reabsorbed
in a $Q^2$-rescaling scheme. The difference between neutron and proton
structure functions and the effects of the longitudinal structure functions can
also be taken into account. The obtained theoretical results favourably compare
with the experimental data.

sources for the next generation of space-based detectors sensitive to low
frequency waves. Here we investigate periastron precession in these sources as
a result of general relativistic, tidal, and rotational effects; such
precession is expected to be detectable for at least some of the detected
binaries of this type. Currently, two eccentric NS-WD binaries are known in the
galactic field, PSR J1141-6545 and PSR B2303+46, both of which have orbits too
wide to be relevant in their current state to GW observations. However,
population synthesis studies predict the existence of a significant Galactic
population of such systems. Though small in most of these systems, we find that
tidally induced periastron precession becomes important when tides contribute
to more than 3% of the total precession rate. For these systems, accounting for
tides when analyzing periastron precession rate measurements can improve
estimates of the WD component mass inferred and, in some cases, will prevent us
from misclassifying the object. However, such systems are rare due to rapid
orbital decay. To aid the inclusion of tidal effects when using periastron
precession as a mass measurement tool, we derive a function that relates the WD
radius and periastron precession constant to the WD mass.

Halpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12micron and 22micron
luminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to
$z<0.5$. To illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micron
star formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific star
formation within the GAMA-WISE sample and underscore the ability of WISE to
detect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. Within galaxy groups (determined by
a sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies with

we define a simple model, based on the majority rule voting, in order to
consider the role of conformity. Conformity is a central issue in social
psychology as it represents one of people's behaviors that emerges as a result
of their interactions. The proposed model represents agents, arranged in a
network and provided with an individual behavior, that change opinion in
function of those of their neighbors. In particular, agents can behave as
conformists or as nonconformists. In the former case, agents change opinion in
accordance with the majority of their social circle (i.e., their neighbors); in
the latter case, they do the opposite, i.e., they take the minority opinion.
Moreover, we investigate the nonconformity both on a global and on a local
perspective, i.e., in relation to the whole population and to the social circle
of each nonconformist agent, respectively. We perform a computational study of
the proposed model, with the aim to observe if and how the conformity affects
the related outcomes. Moreover, we want to investigate whether it is possible
to achieve some kind of equilibrium, or of order, during the evolution of the
system. Results highlight that the amount of nonconformist agents in the
population plays a central role in these dynamics. In particular, conformist
agents play the role of stabilizers in fully-connected networks, whereas the
opposite happens in complex networks. Furthermore, by analyzing complex
topologies of the agent network, we found that in the presence of radical
nonconformist agents the topology of the system has a prominent role; otherwise
it does not matter since we observed that a conformist behavior is almost
always more convenient. Finally, we analyze the results of the model by
considering that agents can change also their behavior over time.

that for a general discrete-time stochastic control problem, Bellman error
minimization using instrumental variables is equivalent to both variants of
projected Bellman error minimization. An alternative to these API methods is
direct policy search based on knowledge gradient. The practical performance of
these three approximate dynamic programming methods are then investigated in
the context of an application in energy storage, integrated with an
intermittent wind energy supply to fully serve a stochastic time-varying
electricity demand. We create a library of test problems using real-world data
and apply value iteration to find their optimal policies. These benchmarks are
then used to compare the developed policies. Our analysis indicates that API
with instrumental variables Bellman error minimization prominently outperforms
API with least-squares Bellman error minimization. However, these approaches
underperform our direct policy search implementation.

component has been mired in a Maunder-Minimum-like low state since 2005,
initially recognized by XMM. But now, A finally appears to be climbing out of
the extended lull. If interpreted simply as an over-long cycle, the period
would be 19.1+/-0.7 yr, with a minimum-to-peak contrast of 3.4. The short X-ray
cycle of B, and possibly long cycle of A, are not unusual compared with the
diverse (albeit much lower amplitude) chromospheric variations recorded, for
example, by the HK Project. Further, the deep low state of A also is not
unusual, but instead is similar to the Sun during recent minima of the sunspot
cycle.

electron systems with novel and unprecedented properties distinct from any
quantum Hall-like or spin-Hall effects. Their Z$_2$ topological order can be
realized at room temperatures without magnetic fields and they can be turned
into magnets, exotic superconductors or Kondo insulators leading to worldwide
interest and activity in the topic. We review the basic concepts defining such
topological matter and the experimental discovery via the key experimental
probe that revealed the Z$_2$ topological order in the bulk of these spin-orbit
interaction dominated insulators for the first time. This review focuses on the
key results that demonstrated the fundamental Z$_2$ topological properties such
as spin-momentum locking, non-trivial Berry's phases, mirror Chern number,
absence of backscattering, bulk-boundary correspondence (topology), protection
by time-reversal and other discrete (mirror) symmetries and their remarkable
persistence up to the room temperature elaborating on results first briefly
discussed in an early review by M.Z. Hasan and C.L. Kane [Rev. of Mod. Phys.,
82, 3045 (2010)]. Additionally, key results on broken symmetry phases such as
quantum magnetism and superconductivity induced in topological materials are
briefly discussed. Topological insulators beyond the Z$_2$ classification such
as Topological Crystalline Insulators (TCI) are discussed based on their spin
properties (mirror Chern invariants). The experimental methodologies detailed
here have been used in most of the subsequent studies of Z$_2$ topological
physics in almost all bulk topological insulator materials to this date.

reduced basis techniques for the application to nonlinear partial differential
equations. The major new ingredient to accomplish this goal is the introduction
of the adaptive empirical projection method, which is an adaptive integration
algorithm based on the (generalized) empirical interpolation method. Different
from other partitioning concepts for the empirical interpolation method we
perform an adaptive decomposition of the spatial domain. We project both the
variational formulation and the range of the nonlinear operator onto reduced
spaces. Those reduced spaces combine the full dimensional (finite element)
space in an identified dominant spatial direction and a reduction space or
collateral basis space spanned by modal orthonormal basis functions in the
transverse direction. Both the reduction and the collateral basis space are
constructed in a highly nonlinear fashion by introducing a parametrized problem
in the transverse direction and associated parametrized operator evaluations,
and by applying reduced basis methods to select the bases from the
corresponding snapshots. Rigorous a priori and a posteriori error estimators,
which do not require additional regularity of the nonlinear operator are proven
for the adaptive empirical projection method and then used to derive a rigorous
a posteriori error estimator for the resulting hierarchical model reduction
approach. Numerical experiments for an elliptic nonlinear diffusion equation
demonstrate a fast convergence of the proposed dimensionally reduced
approximation to the solution of the full-dimensional problem. Runtime
experiments verify a close to linear scaling of the reduction method in the
number of degrees of freedom used for the computations in the dominant
direction.

high-dimensional datasets with thousands of variables. Our use of concave
regularization, as opposed to the more popular $\ell_0$ (e.g. BIC) penalty, is

asymptotic results when the underlying distribution is Gaussian. Most notably,
our framework does not require the existence of a so-called faithful DAG

nonidentifiability of the estimation problem in a novel way. Finally, as a
matter of independent interest, we provide a comprehensive comparison of our
approach to several standard structure learning methods using open-source
packages developed for the R language. Based on these experiments, we show that
our algorithm is significantly faster than other competing methods while
obtaining higher sensitivity with comparable false discovery rates for
high-dimensional data. In particular, the total runtime for our method to
generate a solution path of 20 estimates for DAGs with 8000 nodes is around one

multi-user wireless video transmission applications, ensuring that all video
senders have sufficient transmission opportunities to use before their delay
deadlines expire is a longstanding research problem. We propose a novel
solution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level
knowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time. Instead, we
translate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender's video packets into
a monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time
horizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability
for deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders' video
streams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA)
approach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the
deadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA
approach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends
on the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal
for weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time. We further
implement our framework for real-time video streaming in wireless personal area
networks that are gaining significant traction within the new
Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. For multiple surveillance videos encoded
with H.264/AVC and streamed via the 6tisch framework that simulates the

ingoing to quark phase probably reduces the system to a non-equilibrium state,

nuclear reactions that nuclei emit neutrons and absorb them under appropriate

obstruction (over $\mathbb{C}$) for matroids, and we estimate the number of
essential components in the first complex resonance variety of $\mathcal{A}$.

  corrections",,,,"math.OC cs.LG math.NA stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study general Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm (SPQN) regularized
matrix minimization problems. In particular, we first introduce a class of
first-order stationary points for them, and show that the first-order
stationary points introduced in [11] for an SPQN regularized $vector$
minimization problem are equivalent to those of an SPQN regularized $matrix$
minimization reformulation. We also show that any local minimizer of the SPQN
regularized matrix minimization problems must be a first-order stationary
point. Moreover, we derive lower bounds for nonzero singular values of the
first-order stationary points and hence also of the local minimizers of the
SPQN regularized matrix minimization problems. The iterative reweighted
singular value minimization (IRSVM) methods are then proposed to solve these
problems, whose subproblems are shown to have a closed-form solution. In
contrast to the analogous methods for the SPQN regularized $vector$
minimization problems, the convergence analysis of these methods is
significantly more challenging. We develop a novel approach to establishing the
convergence of these methods, which makes use of the expression of a specific
solution of their subproblems and avoids the intricate issue of finding the
explicit expression for the Clarke subdifferential of the objective of their
subproblems. In particular, we show that any accumulation point of the sequence
generated by the IRSVM methods is a first-order stationary point of the
problems. Our computational results demonstrate that the IRSVM methods
generally outperform some recently developed state-of-the-art methods in terms
of solution quality and/or speed.

analysis of mammograms. It aims at separating the breast tissue from the
background of the mammogram and it includes two independent segmentations. The
first segments the background region which usually contains annotations, labels
and frames from the whole breast region, while the second removes the pectoral
muscle portion (present in Medio Lateral Oblique (MLO) views) from the rest of
the breast tissue. In this paper we propose hybridization of Connected
Component Labeling (CCL), Fuzzy, and Straight line methods. Our proposed
methods worked good for separating pectoral region. After removal pectoral
muscle from the mammogram, further processing is confined to the breast region
alone. To demonstrate the validity of our segmentation algorithm, it is
extensively tested using over 322 mammographic images from the Mammographic
Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database. The segmentation results were evaluated
using a Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Hausdroff Distance (HD), Probabilistic Rand
Index (PRI), Local Consistency Error (LCE) and Tanimoto Coefficient (TC). The
hybridization of fuzzy with straight line method is given more than 96% of the
curve segmentations to be adequate or better. In addition a comparison with
similar approaches from the state of the art has been given, obtaining slightly
improved results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

their specific manufacture dates and workshop localities are unknown. Relying
on subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification

approaches with machine-learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives
on the classification and attribution of this early Iron Age corpus. The study
sample consisted of 162 sculptures of female figures. We have developed an
algorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and
anthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely
statistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical
classifications, while revealing new perspectives, especially with regard to
the contested Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition. Specifically, we have
identified that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition may
be more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects; we
offer a reconsideration of a subset of Phoenician objects, and we confirm
Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate stylistic subgroups that might distinguish
networks of acquisition among the sites of Nimrud, Khorsabad, Arslan Tash and
the Levant. We have also identified which features are most significant in our
cluster assignments and might thereby be most diagnostic of regional carving
traditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual
classification methods and demonstrates how machine-learning techniques may be
employed to reveal complementary information not accessible through the

presented the Possibility and Certainty model. This model uses reputation value

nodes in network activities improves the Packet Delivery Ratio which enhances
the throughput of the MANET. On the other hand when node strength is poor we

uncorrelated transmit antennas at the nodes, but using only one RF transmit
chain and space-time coding across these antennas can give a better performance
without using any extra resources and without increasing the hardware
implementation cost and complexity. In the first transmission scheme, two
antennas are used only at the relay, Adaptive Network Coding (ANC) is employed
at the relay and the relay transmits a CIOD Space Time Block Code (STBC). This
gives a better performance compared to an existing ANC scheme for two-way relay
channel which uses one antenna each at all the three nodes. It is shown that
for this scheme at high SNR the average end-to-end symbol error probability
(SEP) is upper bounded by twice the SEP of a point-to-point fading channel. In
the second transmission scheme, two transmit antennas are used at all the three
nodes, CIOD STBC's are transmitted in multiple access and broadcast phases.
This scheme provides a diversity order of two for the average end-to-end SEP

problem stands out from profit-maximizing auction design literature as it
requires no probabilistic assumptions on buyers' valuations and employs the
framework of competitive analysis. Our objective is to optimize the worst-case
performance of an auction, measured by the ratio between a given benchmark and
revenue generated by the auction.
  We establish a sufficient and necessary condition that characterizes
competitive ratios for all monotone benchmarks. The characterization identifies
the worst-case distribution of instances and reveals intrinsic relations
between competitive ratios and benchmarks in the competitive analysis. With the
characterization at hand, we show optimal competitive auctions for two natural
benchmarks.
  The most well-studied benchmark $\mathcal{F}^{(2)}(\cdot)$ measures the
envy-free optimal revenue where at least two buyers win. Goldberg et al. [13]
showed a sequence of lower bounds on the competitive ratio for each number of
buyers n. They conjectured that all these bounds are tight. We show that
optimal competitive auctions match these bounds. Thus, we confirm the
conjecture and settle a central open problem in the design of digital goods
auctions. As one more application we examine another economically meaningful
benchmark, which measures the optimal revenue across all limited-supply Vickrey
auctions. We identify the optimal competitive ratios to be
$(\frac{n}{n-1})^{n-1}-1$ for each number of buyers n, that is $e-1$ as $n$

signals residing on weighted graphs, an additional design challenge is to
incorporate the intrinsic geometric structure of the irregular data domain into
the atoms of the dictionary. In this work, we propose a parametric dictionary
learning algorithm to design data-adapted, structured dictionaries that
sparsely represent graph signals. In particular, we model graph signals as
combinations of overlapping local patterns. We impose the constraint that each
dictionary is a concatenation of subdictionaries, with each subdictionary being
a polynomial of the graph Laplacian matrix, representing a single pattern
translated to different areas of the graph. The learning algorithm adapts the
patterns to a training set of graph signals. Experimental results on both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the dictionaries learned by the
proposed algorithm are competitive with and often better than unstructured
dictionaries learned by state-of-the-art numerical learning algorithms in terms
of sparse approximation of graph signals. In contrast to the unstructured
dictionaries, however, the dictionaries learned by the proposed algorithm

Galaxy. Existence of its deuterated isotopomers (HDCl+ & D2Cl+) are till date
not discussed in the literature. We find that these deuterated gas phase ions
could be destroyed by various ion-molecular reactions, dissociative
recombination (DR) and by cosmic rays (CR). We compute all the Ion-molecular
(polar) reaction rates by using the parameterized trajectory theory and the
Ion-molecular (non-polar) reaction rates by using the Langevin theory. For DR
and CR induced reactions, we adopt two well behaved rate formulas. We also
include these rate coefficients into our large gas-grain chemical network to
study the chemical evolution of these species around the outer edge of the cold
dense cloud. In order to study spectral properties of chloronium ion and its
two deuterated isotopomers, we have carried out quantum chemical simulations.
We calculated ground state properties of these species by employing second

correlation consistent (aug-cc-pVQZ) basis set. Infrared and electronic
absorption spectra of these species are calculated by using the same level of
theory. MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory is used to report the different
spectroscopic constants of these gas phase species. These spectroscopic
constants are essential to predict rotational transitions of these species. Our
predicted column densities of D2Cl^+, HDCl^+ along with the spectral
information may enable their future identification around outer edges of cold
dark clouds.

colossal magneto-resistance (CMR) has been generally considered to be an
inhomogeneous ground state. An alternative explanation of phase-coexistence as
the manifestation of a disorder-broadened first order magnetic phase transition
being interrupted by the glasslike arrest of kinetics is now gradually gaining
ground. This kinetic arrest of a first order phase transitions, between two
states with long-range magnetic order, has actually been observed in various
other classes of magnetic materials in addition to the CMR manganites. The
underlying common features of this kinetic arrest of a first order phase
transition are discussed in terms of the phenomenology of glasses. The possible

first order phase transitions in dielectric solids and in multiferroic

variable-rate codes which assign the same rate to all source blocks of the same
type class. Then, using the exponent bounds, we derive bounds on the optimal
rate functions, namely, the minimal rate assigned to each type class, needed in
order to achieve a given target error exponent. The resulting excess-rate
exponent is then evaluated. Iterative algorithms are provided for the
computation of both bounds on the optimal rate functions and their excess-rate
exponents. The resulting Slepian-Wolf codes bridge between the two extremes of
fixed-rate coding, which has minimal error exponent and maximal excess-rate
exponent, and average-rate coding, which has maximal error exponent and minimal
excess-rate exponent.

by discrete least squares projection onto a polynomial space using a specially
designed deterministic point set. The independent variables of the function are
assumed to be random variables, stemming from the motivating application of
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
  Our deterministic points are inspired by a theorem due to Andr\'e Weil. We
first work with the Chebyshev measure and consider the approximation in
Chebyshev polynomial spaces. We prove the stability and an optimal convergence
estimate, provided the number of points scales quadratically with the dimension
of the polynomial space. A possible application for quantifying
\textit{epistemic} uncertainties is then discussed. We show that the point set
asymptotically equidistributes to the product-Chebyshev measure, allowing us to
propose a weighted least squares framework, and extending our method to more
general polynomial approximations. Numerical examples are given to confirm the
theoretical results. It is shown that the performance of our deterministic
points is similar to that of randomly-generated points. However our
construction, being deterministic, does not suffer from probabilistic
qualifiers on convergence results. (E.g., convergence ""with high probability"".)

continuation for the Schr\""odinger equation $(i\partial_t+\Delta)u=V(x)u$. In
general the problem is to find a class of potentials $V$ which allows the
unique continuation. The key point of our work is to make a direct link between
the problem and the weighted $L^2$ resolvent estimates
$\|(-\Delta-z)^{-1}f\|_{L^2(|V|)}\leq C\|f\|_{L^2(|V|^{-1})}$. We carry out it
in an abstract way, and thereby we do not need to deal with each of the
potential classes. To do so, we will make use of limiting absorption principle
and Kato $H$-smoothing theorem in spectral theory, and employ some tools from
harmonic analysis. Once the resolvent estimate is set up for a potential class,
from our abstract theory the unique continuation would follow from the same
potential class. Also, it turns out that there can be no dented surface on the
boundary of the maximal open zero set of the solution $u$. In this regard,
another main issue for us is to know which class of potentials allows the
resolvent estimate. We establish such a new class which contains previously
known ones, and will also apply it to the problem of well-posedness for the
equation.

compatible with the formation of a condensate of permanent excitons. The

using more antennas at the base-station (BS) side in cellular networks, the
effect of BS antenna topology on the capacity scaling behavior is little
understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study on the ergodic
capacity of a downlink single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system
where BS antennas are either co-located at the center or grouped into uniformly
distributed antenna clusters in a circular cell. By assuming that the number of
BS antennas and the number of user antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio
$L\gg 1$, the asymptotic analysis reveals that the average per-antenna
capacities in both cases logarithmically increase with $L$, but in the orders
of $\log_2 L$ and $\tfrac{\alpha}{2}\log_2 L$, for the co-located and
distributed BS antenna layouts, respectively, where $\alpha>2$ denotes the
path-loss factor. The analysis is further extended to the multi-user case where
a 1-tier (7-cell) MIMO cellular network with $K\gg 1$ uniformly distributed
users in each cell is considered. By assuming that the number of BS antennas
and the number of user antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio $L\gg K$, an
asymptotic analysis is presented on the downlink rate performance with block
diagonalization (BD) adopted at each BS. It is shown that the average
per-antenna rates with the co-located and distributed BS antenna layouts scale
in the orders of $\log_2 \tfrac{L}{K}$ and $\log_2
\frac{(L-K+1)^{\alpha/2}}{K}$, respectively. The rate performance of MIMO
cellular networks with small cells is also discussed, which highlights the
importance of employing a large number of distributed BS antennas for the
next-generation cellular networks.
