at the {\it Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Interoperability and Cooperation (MANIAC)
Challenge 2013}. The theme of the MANIAC Challenge 2013 was ``Mobile Data
Offloading,'' and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating
strategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc
forwarding using handheld devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones). According to
the challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest (or ``auction'') should
decide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each
team should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in
order to get their traffic across the network. In this application scenario,
the incentive for customers to join the ad hoc network is discounted monthly
fees, while operators should benefit from decreased infrastructure costs.
Following the rules of MANIAC Challenge 2013, this paper proposes a strategy
that is based on the concept of how ``tight'' a node is to successfully deliver
a packet to its destination within a given deadline. This ``tightness'' idea
relies on a shortest-path analysis of the underlying network graph, and it is
used to define three sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an
auction; b) how to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the
announced auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource
utilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.

the canonical model of slow-roll inflation. We work in the leading slow-roll
approximation where the calculation can be done in de Sitter space. Our
calculation uses techniques drawn from the AdS/CFT correspondence to find the
wave function at late times and then calculate the four point function from it.
The answer we get agrees with an earlier result in the literature, obtained
using different methods. Our analysis reveals a subtlety with regard to the
Ward identities for conformal invariance, which arises in de Sitter space and
has no analogue in AdS space. This subtlety arises because in de Sitter space
the metric at late times is a genuine degree of freedom, and hence to calculate
correlation functions from the wave function of the Universe at late times, one
must fix gauge completely. The resulting correlators are then invariant under a
conformal transformation accompanied by a compensating coordinate
transformation which restores the gauge.

the unknown log-likelihood function are used to exploit continuity and

multi-dimensional domains, globally bounded classical solutions are obtained
for a parabolic-elliptic system under proper assumptions on the system
parameters. These global existence results make it possible to study bounded
steady states in order to model species segregation phenomenon. We then
investigate the stationary problem in one-dimensional domains. Through
bifurcation theory, we obtain the existence of nonconstant positive steady
states, which are small perturbations from the positive equilibrium; we also
study the stability of these bifurcating solutions when the diffusion
coefficient of the escaper is large and the diffusion coefficient of its
competitor is small. In the limit of large advection rate, we show that the
reaction-advection-diffusion system converges to a shadow system involving the
competitor population density and an unknown positive constant. The existence

each permutation of combining two sets of objects (AKA the Shuffle Product).
This algorithm provides an efficient way to navigate this problem, as each

manipulated mathematically to find the next permutation. The routes taken to
find each of the permutations then form a series of associations or adjacencies
which can be represented in a tree graph which appears to possess some
properties of a fractal.
  This algorithm was discovered while attempting to identify every possible
end-state of a Tic-Tac-Toe (Naughts and Crosses) board. It was found to be a
viable and efficient solution to the problem, and now---in its more generalized
state---it is my belief that it may find applications among a wide range of

this algorithm sheds light on a more generic principle of combinatorics and as

a few different scenarios, ranging from email thread filtering to RSS news feed
recommendation on a smartphone. An efficient novelty detection algorithm can
save the user a great deal of time and resources when browsing through relevant
yet usually previously-seen content. Most of the recent research on detection
of novel documents in text streams has been building upon either geometric
distances or distributional similarities, with the former typically performing
better but being much slower due to the need of comparing an incoming document
with all the previously-seen ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
novelty detection in text streams. We describe a resource-aware mechanism that
is able to handle massive text streams such as the ones present today thanks to
the burst of social media and the emergence of the Web as the main source of
information. We capitalize on the historical Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
that was known for capturing well term specificity and we show that it can be
used successfully at the document level as a measure of document novelty. This
enables us to avoid similarity comparisons with previous documents in the text
stream, thus scaling better and leading to faster execution times. Moreover, as
the collection of documents evolves over time, we use a temporal variant of IDF
not only to maintain an efficient representation of what has already been seen
but also to decay the document frequencies as the time goes by. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed approach on a real-world news articles dataset
created for this task. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
all of the baselines while managing to operate efficiently in terms of time
complexity and memory usage, which are of great importance in a mobile setting
scenario.

avoid duplication of reduction work at run-time, thereby speeding up execution.
We show how a maximal degree of sharing can be obtained for programs expressed
as terms in the lambda calculus with letrec. We introduce a notion of `maximal
compactness' for lambda-letrec-terms among all terms with the same infinite
unfolding. Instead of defined purely syntactically, this notion is based on a
graph semantics. lambda-letrec-terms are interpreted as first-order term graphs
so that unfolding equivalence between terms is preserved and reflected through
bisimilarity of the term graph interpretations. Compactness of the term graphs
can then be compared via functional bisimulation.
  We describe practical and efficient methods for the following two problems:
transforming a lambda-letrec-term into a maximally compact form; and deciding
whether two lambda-letrec-terms are unfolding-equivalent. The transformation of
a lambda-letrec-term $L$ into maximally compact form $L_0$ proceeds in three
steps:
  (i) translate L into its term graph $G = [[ L ]]$; (ii) compute the maximally
shared form of $G$ as its bisimulation collapse $G_0$; (iii) read back a
lambda-letrec-term $L_0$ from the term graph $G_0$ with the property $[[ L_0 ]]
= G_0$. This guarantees that $L_0$ and $L$ have the same unfolding, and that
$L_0$ exhibits maximal sharing.
  The procedure for deciding whether two given lambda-letrec-terms $L_1$ and
$L_2$ are unfolding-equivalent computes their term graph interpretations $[[
L_1 ]]$ and $[[ L_2 ]]$, and checks whether these term graphs are bisimilar.
  For illustration, we also provide a readily usable implementation.

to destroy fermionic coherence at ""hot spots"" of the Fermi surface but coherent
quasiparticles survive in the rest of the Fermi surface. A large part of the
Fermi surface is not really ""cold"" but rather ""lukewarm"" in a sense that
coherent quasiparticles in that part survive but are strongly renormalized
compared to the non-interacting case. We discuss the self-energy of lukewarm
fermions and their contribution to the optical conductivity, $\sigma(\Omega)$,
focusing specifically on scattering off composite bosons made of two critical
magnetic fluctuations. Recent study [S.A. Hartnoll et al., Phys. Rev. B {\bf
84}, 125115 (2011)] found that composite scattering gives the strongest
contribution to the self-energy of lukewarm fermions and suggested that this
may give rise to non-Fermi liquid behavior of the optical conductivity at the
lowest frequencies. We show that the most singular term in the conductivity
coming from self-energy insertions into the conductivity bubble,
$\sigma'(\Omega)\propto \ln^3\Omega/\Omega^{1/3}$, is canceled out by the
vertex-correction and Aslamazov-Larkin diagrams. However, the cancelation does
not hold beyond logarithmic accuracy, and the remaining conductivity still
diverges as $1/\Omega^{1/3}$. We further argue that the $1/\Omega^{1/3}$
behavior holds only at asymptotically low frequencies, well inside the
frequency range affected by superconductivity. At larger $\Omega$, up to
frequencies above the Fermi energy, $\sigma'(\Omega)$ scales as $1/\Omega$,
which is reminiscent of the behavior observed in the superconducting cuprates.

passing from the dynamic variability of the calculus to the modern
set-theoretic formulation of mathematical analysis. This offers a re-evaluation
of the relationship between the natural geometry and algebra of elementary
calculus that continues to be used in applied mathematics, and the formal set
theory of mathematical analysis that develops in pure mathematics and evolves
into the logical development of non-standard analysis using infinitesimal
concepts. It suggests that educational theories developed to evaluate student
learning are themselves based on the conceptions of the experts who formulate
them. It encourages us to reflect on the principles that we use to analyse the

understand the rationale of differing theoretical viewpoints.

Maxwell's equations. This procedure is convenient and intuitive but ad hoc. We
show that both effects emerge naturally by including coupling to quantum modes
of the radiation field in the vacuum state to second order. This approach is
systematic and suggests a more general class of corrections that only arise in
a QED framework. In the semi-classical theory, which only includes classical
field modes, the susceptibility of a collection of $N$ non-interacting

generates an effective retarded interaction that leads to cascading and local

Recently, reduced-order unsteady aerodynamic models have been developed for a
pitching and plunging airfoil by linearizing the discretized Navier-Stokes

based on these low-dimensional state-space models for simulations of a rigid
flat plate at Reynolds number 100. Various controllers are implemented for

\alpha_0=10^\circ$, and $\alpha_0=20^\circ$. The resulting control laws are
able to track an aggressive reference lift trajectory while attenuating sensor

Those components come from different complex steps in the supply chain of the
product from sourcing to distribution. This economic point of view also takes
place in the determination of goods and services in wireless networks. Indeed,
before transmitting customer data, a network operator has to lease some
frequency range from a spectrum owner and also has to establish agreements with
electricity suppliers. The goal of this paper is to compare two pricing
schemes, namely a power-based and a flat rate, and give a possible explanation
why flat rate pricing schemes are more common than power based pricing ones in
a deregulated wireless market. We suggest a hierarchical game-theoretical model
of a three level supply chain: the end users, the service provider and the
spectrum owner. The end users intend to transmit data on a wireless network.
The amount of traffic sent by the end users depends on the available frequency
bandwidth as well as the price they have to pay for their transmission. A
natural question arises for the service provider: how to design an efficient
pricing scheme in order to maximize his profit. Moreover he has to take into
account the lease charge he has to pay to the spectrum owner and how many
frequency bandwidth to rent. The spectrum owner itself also looks for
maximizing its profit and has to determine the lease price to the service
provider. The equilibrium at each level of our supply chain model are
established and several properties are investigated. In particular, in the case
of a power-based pricing scheme, the service provider and the spectrum owner
tend to share the gross provider profit. Whereas, considering the flat rate
pricing scheme, if the end users are going to exploit the network intensively,
then the tariffs of the suppliers (spectrum owner and service provider)
explode.

which it is particularly ill-suited. One such input is used to construct a
counterexample, indicating that the Shamai-Laroia expression does not always
bound even the achievable rate of the channel, thus excluding a natural
relaxation of the original conjectured bound. However, this relaxed bound is
then shown to hold for any finite entropy input and ISI channel, when the SNR
is sufficiently high. Finally, new simple bounds for the achievable rate are
proven, and compared to other known bounds. Information-Estimation relations
and estimation-theoretic bounds play a key role in establishing our results.

bifurcations of this operator. Such a kind of bifurcations only occurs when

domain. Therefore, its quantum mechanical version has a discrete energy
spectrum. We compute the discrete energy spectrum and the corresponding
eigenfunctions. The energies depend on a noncommutative parameter $\beta$. We
compute the scale factor expected value ($\left<a\right>$) for several values
of $\beta$. For all of them, $\left<a\right>$ oscillates between maxima and
minima values and never vanishes. It gives an initial indication that those
models are free from singularities, at the quantum level. We improve this

$\left<a\right>$ behavior, for the present model, is a drastic modification of
the $\left<a\right>$ behavior in the corresponding commutative version of the

variable. Therefore, if the present model may represent the early stages of the

also compute the Bohmian trajectories for $a$, which are in accordance with

applications remain scarce. One reason is that the complexity of the decision
rules that emerge from standard statistical learning impedes biological
understanding, in particular, any mechanistic interpretation. Here we explore
decision rules for binary classification utilizing only the ordering of
expression among several genes; the basic building blocks are then two-gene
expression comparisons. The simplest example, just one comparison, is the TSP
classifier, which has appeared in a variety of cancer-related discovery
studies. Decision rules based on multiple comparisons can better accommodate
class heterogeneity, and thereby increase accuracy, and might provide a link
with biological mechanism. We consider a general framework (""rank-in-context"")

number and identity of the genes in the support (""context""). We then specialize
to two examples: voting among several pairs and comparing the median expression
in two groups of genes. Comprehensive experiments assess accuracy relative to
other, more complex, methods, and reinforce earlier observations that simple
classifiers are competitive.

desirable, but is, unfortunately, not well-defined. However, feasible
strategies for such an inverse design process may be successfully developed for
specific purposes. We discuss options for calculating 'jacket' potentials that

binding the small molecule to be activated. The jacket potential can be
represented within a full quantum model or by a sequence of approximations of
which a field of electrostatic point charges is the simplest. In a second step,
the jacket potential needs to be replaced by a chemically viable chelate-ligand
structure for which the geometry gradients on all of its atoms are also
required to vanish. In order to analyze the feasibility of this approach, we
dissect a known dinitrogen-fixating catalyst to study possible design
strategies that must eventually produce the known catalyst.

mechanism hides essentially all of the effects of the fifth force inside
haloes. In the case of the Quartic model, the screening mechanism leaves behind
residual modifications to gravity, which make the effective gravitational
strength time-varying and smaller than the standard value. Compared to normal
gravity, this causes a deficiency of massive haloes and leads to a weaker

enhancement and suppression occurs. As this result of dynamic balance, the
region of effective enhanced magnetic diffusivity is confined to a narrow

advantage of the different phase space distributions of the two GC

anisotropy of the GC system. Red GCs show the same spatial distribution and
behaviour as the starlight, whereas blue GCs have a shallower density profile,
a larger velocity dispersion and a lower kurtosis, all of which suggest a
different orbital distribution. We use a dispersion-kurtosis Jeans analysis and
find that the solutions of separate analyses for the two GC subpopulations
overlap in the halo parameter space. The solution converges on a massive dark
matter halo, consistent with expectations from $\Lambda$CDM and WMAP7 cosmology
in terms of virial mass ($\log M_{DM} \sim13.3 M_{sun}$) and concentration
($c_{vir}\sim8$). This is the first such analysis that solves the dynamics of
the different GC subpopulations in a self-consistent manner. Our method
improves the uncertainties on the halo parameter determination by a factor of
two and opens new avenues for the use of elliptical galaxy dynamics as tests of
predictions from cosmological simulations. The implied stellar mass-to-light
ratio derived from the dynamical modelling is fully consistent with a Salpeter
initial mass function (IMF) and rules out a bottom light IMF. The different GC
subpopulations show markedly distinct orbital distributions at large radii,
with red GCs having an anisotropy parameter $\beta\sim0.4$ outside $\sim3R_e$,

properties within seven dynamically-motivated galactic environments, finding
that GMCs in the spiral arms and in the central region are brighter and have
higher velocity dispersions than inter-arm clouds. Globally, the GMC mass
distribution does not follow a simple power law shape. Instead, we find that
the shape of the mass distribution varies with galactic environment: the
distribution is steeper in inter-arm region than in the spiral arms, and
exhibits a sharp truncation at high masses for the nuclear bar region. We
propose that the observed environmental variations in the GMC properties and
mass distributions are a consequence of the combined action of large-scale

gravitational field. This leads to both dissipative and conservative
corrections to the motion, which can be interpreted as a self-force acting on
the object. The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on
the Green function of the linear differential operator that governs
gravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green
functions in non-trivial black hole spacetimes has been an open problem until
recently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects
using sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the
global Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that
employs the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the
original self-force expressions. Our quantitative method involves two stages:
(i) numerical approximation of the retarded Green function in the background
spacetime; (ii) evaluation of convolution integrals along the worldline of the
object. This novel approach can be used along arbitrary worldlines, including
those currently inaccessible to more established computational techniques.
Furthermore, it yields geometrical insight into the contributions to
self-interaction from curved geometry (back-scattering) and trapping of null
geodesics. We demonstrate the method on the motion of a scalar charge in
Schwarzschild spacetime. This toy model retains the physical history-dependence
of the self-force but avoids gauge issues and allows us to focus on basic
principles. We compute the self-field and self-force for many worldlines
including accelerated circular orbits, eccentric orbits at the separatrix, and
radial infall. This method, closely modeled after the original formalism,
provides a promising complementary approach to the self-force problem.

Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) 3 pi survey, we demonstrate that our reddening estimates are
unbiased, and accurate to ~0.13 mag in E(B-V) for the typical star. Based on
comparisons with mock catalogs, we expect distances for main-sequence stars to
be constrained to within ~20% - 60%, although this range can vary, depending on
the reddening of the star, the precise stellar type and its position on the
sky. A further paper will present a 3D map of dust over the three quarters of
the sky surveyed by PS1. Both the individual stellar inferences and the 3D dust
map will enable a wealth of Galactic science in the plane. The method we
present is not limited to the passbands of the PS1 survey, but may be extended
to incorporate photometry from other surveys, such as 2MASS, SDSS (where
available), and in the future, LSST and Gaia.

Hamiltonian systems in the neighborhood of a $0^2 iw$ resonance. The existence
of a family of periodic orbits surrounding the equilibrium is well-known and we
show here the existence of homoclinic connections with several loops for every
periodic orbit close to the origin, except the origin itself. To prove this
result, we first show a Hamiltonian normal form theorem inspired by the
Elphick-Tirapegui-Brachet-Coullet-Iooss normal form. We then use a local
Hamiltonian normalization relying on a result of Moser. We obtain the result of
existence of homoclinic orbits by geometrical arguments based on the low
dimension and with the aid of a KAM theorem which allows to confine the loops.
The same problem was studied before for reversible non Hamiltonian
vectorfields, and the splitting of the homoclinic orbits lead to exponentially
small terms which prevent the existence of homoclinic connections to
exponentially small periodic orbits. The same phenomenon occurs here but we get
round this difficulty thanks to geometric arguments specific to Hamiltonian
systems and by studying homoclinic orbits with many loops.

massive galaxies were already old, quiescent systems with little to no residual
star formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least an
order of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals, their descendants.
Little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellar
populations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr
earlier (at 3<z<6). Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise
to such starbursts which produce dense remnants. Sub-millimeter selected
galaxies (SMGs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich, starbursts. With a
new, representative spectroscopic sample of compact quiescent galaxies at z=2
and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs, we show that z=3-6 SMGs are
consistent with being the progenitors of z=2 quiescent galaxies, matching their
formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses and
internal velocities. Assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densities
also match if the mean duty cycle of SMG starbursts is 42 (+40/-29) Myr
(consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of stars
in these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge of
star-formation. These results suggests a coherent picture of the formation
history of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burst
of violent star-formation through their appearance as high stellar-density
galaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.

Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski and Sully (AMPS) have argued that an observer

of entanglement monogamy - that late time Hawking radiation is maximally
entangled with early time Hawking radiation and also with infalling radiation -
something impossible in quantum field theory. However, as pointed out by Hayden
and Harlow, this experiment is infeasible, as the time required to perform the
experiment is almost certainly longer than the lifetime of the black hole. Here
we propose an alternative firewall experiment which could actually be performed
within the black hole's lifetime. The alternative experiment involves forming
an entangled black hole in which the unscrambling of information is precomputed
on a quantum memory prior to the creation of the black hole and without acting
on the matter which forms the black hole or emerges from it. This would allow
an observer near a black hole to signal faster than light. As another
application of our precomputing strategy, we show how one can produce entangled
black holes which acts like ``flat mirrors'', in the sense that information
comes out almost instantly (as in the Hayden-Preskill scenario), but also
emerge unscrambled, so that it can actually be observed instantly as well.
Finally, we prove that a black hole in thermal equilibrium with its own
radiation, is uncorrelated with this radiation.

trying to build up Physics without the concept of number, or to understand the
origin of species without including the mechanism of natural selection. In this
paper I propose some new conceptual and methodological tools, which seem to
offer a real opportunity to understand the logic of cognitive processes. I
propose a new method to properly treat the concepts of structure and schema,
and to perform on them operations of structural analysis. These operations
allow to move straightforwardly from concrete to more abstract representations.
With these tools I will suggest a definition for the concept of rule, of
regularity and of emergent phenomena. From the analysis of some important
aspects of the rules, I suggest to distinguish them in operational and
associative rules. I propose that associative rules assume a dominant role in
cognition. I also propose a definition for the concept of problem. At the end I
will briefly illustrate a possible general model for cognitive systems.

by corner sharing isosceles triangles of $Fe^{3+}$ ions occupying two

crystallographic $b$-axis and are structurally confined from one another via
diamagnetic (AsO$_{4}$)$^{3-}$ units along the $a$-axis, and Rb$^+$ cations
along the $c$-axis direction. Neutron diffraction measurements indicate the
onset of a long range antiferromagnetic order below approximately 25 K. The
magnetic structure consists of ferrimagnetic chains which are
antiferromagnetically coupled with each other. Within each chain, one of the
two Fe sites carries a moment which lies along the \emph{b}-axis, while the
second site bears a canted moment in the opposite direction. Externally applied
magnetic field induces a transition to a ferrimagnetic state, in which the
coupling between the sawtooth chains becomes ferromagnetic. Magnetization
measurements performed on optically-aligned single crystals reveal evidence for
an uncompensated magnetization at low magnetic fields that could emerge from to
a phase-segregated state with ferrimagnetic inclusions or from
antiferromagnetic domain walls. The observed magnetic states and the
competition between them is expected to arise from strongly frustrated

graphs are intersection graphs of chords in a convex $k$-sided polygon where
each chord has its endpoints on distinct sides. The $k$-polygon graphs, for $k

class of permutation graphs. The union of all of those graph classes is the
class of circle graphs. The polygon number $\gp(G)$ of a circle graph $G$ is
the minimum $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-polygon graph. Given a circle graph $G$
and an integer $k$, determining whether $\gp(G) \le k$ is NP-complete, while
the problem is solvable in polynomial time for fixed $k$.
  In this paper, we show that $\gp(G)$ is always at least as large as the
asteroidal number of $G$, and equal to the asteroidal number of $G$ when $G$ is
a connected distance hereditary graph that is not a clique. This implies that
the classes of distance hereditary permutation graphs and distance hereditary
AT-free graphs are the same, and we give a forbidden subgraph characterization
of that class. We also establish the following upper bounds: $\gp(G)$ is at
most the clique cover number of $G$ if $G$ is not a clique, at most 1 plus the
independence number of $G$, and at most $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ where $n \ge 3$ is

finding the minimum number of corners that must be added to a given circle

transferred angular momentum to the planet. Here we present observations of
four exoplanet host stars which utilize the excellent resolving power of the
Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI) on the Gemini North telescope.
Two of the stars are giants and two are dwarfs. Each star is host to a giant
planet with an orbital eccentricity > 0.5 and whose radial velocity data
contain a trend in the residuals to the Keplerian orbit fit. These observations
rule out stellar companions 4-8 magnitudes fainter than the host star at
passbands of 692nm and 880nm. The resolution and field-of-view of the
instrument result in exclusion radii of 0.05-1.4 arcsecs which excludes stellar
companions within several AU of the host star in most cases. We further provide
new radial velocities for the HD 4203 system which confirm that the linear
trend previously observed in the residuals is due to an additional planet.

eccentricities, constraints on additional planetary companions, and informs the

experiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an
advantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer
hardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These
engineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a
decohering thermal bath. Therefore, we study the finite-temperature critical
behavior of the standard benchmark problem used to assess the computational
capabilities of these complex machines. We simulate both random-bond Ising
models and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave
Chimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of
finding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not
polynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin
glasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that
benchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might
not be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose
alternative benchmarks by embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera
topology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant) disorder-temperature phase
diagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show that a
finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)%
antiferromagnetic bonds. Beyond this threshold the system only displays a
zero-temperature spin-glass phase. Our results therefore show that a careful
design of the hardware architecture and benchmark problems is key when building

pronounced dips in the fiber transmission. We show that such consistent and
reversible transmission modulations depend on both particle and fiber diameter,
and may be used as a reference point for in-situ nanofiber or particle size
measurement. Therefore we combine SEM size measurements with nanofiber
transmission data to provide calibration for particle-based fiber assessment.
We also demonstrate how the optical tweezers can be used to create a particle
jet to feed a supply of microspheres to the nanofiber surface, forming a
particle conveyor belt. This integrated optical platform provides a method for
selective evanescent field manipulation of micron-sized particles and
facilitates studies of optical binding and light-particle interaction dynamics.

astronomy, medical diagnosis, and biology science, has been shown in [49] quite
different from reflection imaging used in our everyday life. Understanding the
structures of images (the prior information) is important for designing,
testing, and choosing image processing methods, and good image processing
methods are helpful for further uses of the image data, e.g., increasing the
accuracy of the object reconstruction methods in transmission imaging
applications. In reflection imaging, the images are usually modeled as
discontinuous functions and even piecewise constant functions. In transmission
imaging, it was shown very recently in [49] that almost all images are
continuous functions. However, the author in [49] considered only the case of
parallel beam geometry and used some too strong assumptions in the proof, which
exclude some common cases such as cylindrical objects. In this paper, we
consider more general beam geometries and simplify the assumptions by using
totally different techniques. In particular, we will prove that almost all
images in transmission imaging with both parallel and divergent beam geometries
(two most typical beam geometries) are continuous functions, under much weaker
assumptions than those in [49], which admit almost all practical cases.
Besides, taking into accounts our analysis, we compare two image processing
methods for Poisson noise (which is the most significant noise in transmission
imaging) removal. Numerical experiments will be provided to demonstrate our
analysis.

detected before 2013 August, and characterize them into four categories based
on how likely they may harbor a magnetar central engine: Gold, Silver,
Aluminum, and Non-magnetar. We also independently analyze the data of short
GRBs with a putative magnetar central engine. We then perform a statistical
study of various properties of the magnetar samples and the non-magnetar
sample, and investigate whether the data are consistent with the hypothesis
that there exist two types of central engines. By deriving the physical
parameters of the putative magnetars, we find that the observations of the Gold
and Silver samples are generally consistent with the predictions of the
magnetar model. For a reasonable beaming factor for long GRBs, the derived
magnetar surface magnetic field $B_p$ and initial spin period $P_0$ fall into
the reasonable range. Magnetar winds in short GRBs, on the other hand, are
consistent with being isotropic. No GRB in the magnetar sample has a
beam-corrected total energy exceeding the maximum energy budget defined by the
initial spin energy of the magnetar, while some non-magnetar GRBs do violate
such a limit. With beaming correction, on average the non-magnetar sample is
more energetic and luminous than the magnetar samples. Our analysis hints that
millisecond magnetars are likely operating in a good fraction, but probably not
all, GRBs.

old, rich open cluster -- possibly a twin of NGC 7789 -- it is useful to
characterize it. To this end, we determine here the abundance of several
elements and their ratios in a sample of stars in the clump of Trumpler 20. The
primary goal is to measure Trumpler 20 metallicity, so far very poorly
constrained, and revise the cluster's fundamental parameters. We present
high-resolution spectroscopy of eight clump stars. Based on their radial
velocities, we identify six bona fide cluster members, and for five of them
(the sixth being a fast rotator) we perform a detailed abundance analysis.
  We find that Trumpler 20 is slightly more metal-rich than the Sun, having
[Fe/H]=+0.09$\pm$0.10. The abundance ratios of alpha-elements are generally
solar. In line with recent studies of clusters as old as Trumpler 20, Ba is
overabundant compared to the Sun. Our analysis of the iron-peak elements (Cr
and Ni) does not reveal anything anomalous. Based on these results, we
re-estimate the cluster age to be 1.5$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Gyr. Its distance to the
Galactic centre turns out to be 7.3 kpc. With this distance and metallicity,
Trumpler 20 fits fairly well in the metallicity gradient for the galactic inner
disc. With this new study, the characterization of Trumpler~20 is now on much
more solid ground. Further studies should focus on the estimate of the binary
fraction and on its main sequence membership.

  structure-property relationships of phenylalanine, tyrosine and dopa",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Density functional theory and ab initio methods have been employed to address
the impacts of hydroxyl (OH) group substitutions on the physico-chemical
properties of levodopa (or L-dopa) against the natural amino acids,
phenylalanine and tyrosine. L-dopa, which is an important therapeutic drug for
Parkinson's disease, shares structural homology with the amino acids, whose
structures differ only by OH substitutions in their phenyl side chains. It is
revealed that the backbone geometries of the aromatic molecules do not show
apparent OH-dependent differences; however, their other molecular-level
properties, such as molecular dipole moment, electronic properties and
aromaticity, change significantly. The core binding energy spectra indicate
that the atom sites that undergo modifications exhibit large energy shifts, so
as to accommodate the changes in the intra-molecular chemical environment of
the molecules. The binding energies of the modified C 1s sites in the molecules
shift as much as 1.8 eV, whereas the electronic changes in their O 1s spectra
happen in the higher energy region (ca. 536 eV). The valence spectra provide
enhanced insights on the reactivity and chemical properties of the aromatic
molecules. The impacts of OH moieties on the valence spectra are predominantly
focussed in the energy band<16 eV, where the frontier molecular orbitals
display much reorganization and energy shifts from the amino acids to L-dopa.
Of the three molecules, L-dopa also has the least HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which
can readily explain its proactivity as a drug compound. Furthermore, the
nuclear independent chemical shift calculations suggest that L-dopa also has
more aromaticity features than those of the amino acids. The OH groups,
therefore, play a more prominent role in shaping the physico-chemical
properties of L-dopa, which significantly improve its drug potency.

abundance is comparable to that of protons, important features may be observed
such as quasi-thermal multi-GeV neutrinos in coincidence with a subphotospheric
$\gamma$-ray emission, nucleosynthesis at later times and rebrightening of the
afterglow emission. Additionally, thermal MeV neutrinos are created by
electron-positron annihilation, electron (positron) capture on protons
(neutrons) and nucleonic bremsstrahlung. Although MeV neutrinos are difficult
to detect, quasi-thermal GeV neutrinos are expected in km$^3$ detectors and/or
DeepCore+IceCube. In this paper, we show that neutrino oscillations have
outstanding implications for the dynamics of the fireball evolution and also
that they can be detected through their flavor ratio on Earth. For that we
derive the resonance and charged-neutrality conditions as well as the neutrino
self-energy and effective potential up to order $m_W^{-4}$ at strong, moderate
and weak magnetic field approximation to constrain the dynamics of the

suppressed for high baryon densities as well as neutrons abundance larger than
that of protons and ii) the effect of magnetic field is to decrease the
proton-to-neutron ratio aside from the number of multi-GeV neutrinos expected
in DeepCore detector. Also we estimate the GeV neutrino flavor ratios along the

in the literature. Two of them are the weighted mean method and the method put
forth by Micke et al and Mayer et al. The purpose of this work was to compare
their results and to develop a generalized channel-independent perturbations
framework in which both methods enter as special cases.
  Methods: Four models of channel-independent perturbations were compared:
weighted mean, Micke-Mayer method, uniform distribution and truncated normal
distribution. A closed-form formula to calculate film doses and the associated
Type B uncertainty for all four models was deduced. To evaluate the models,
film dose distributions were compared with planned and measured dose
distributions. At the same time, several elements of the dosimetry process were
compared: film type EBT2 versus EBT3, different waiting-time windows,
reflection mode versus transmission mode scanning, and planned versus measured
dose distribution for film calibration and for gamma-index analysis. The
methods and the models described in this study are publicly accessible through
IRISEU. Alpha 1.1 (http://www.iriseu.com). IRISEU. is a cloud computing web
application for calibration and dosimetry of radiochromic films.
  Results: The truncated normal distribution model provided the best agreement
between film and reference doses, both for calibration and gamma-index
verification, and proved itself superior to both the weighted mean model, which
neglects correlations between the channels, and the Micke-Mayer model, whose
accuracy depends on the properties of the sensitometric curves.
  Conclusions: The truncated normal distribution model of channel-independent
perturbations was found superior to the other three models under comparison and
we propose its use for multichannel dosimetry.

reflection models to the determination of the spin and the inner radius of the
disc in accreting black holes. Observationally, the nature of the corona is
uncertain a priori, but a robust determination of the inner disk radius can be
made when the disc emissivity index is tightly constrained. When the inner disc
is well illuminated, the black hole spin can also be determined. Using
reflection modelling derived from ray tracing, we show that robust
determination of disc truncation requires that the location of the coronal
source is quasi-static and at a height and radius less than the truncation
radius of the disc. Robust spin measurements require that at least part of the
corona lies less than about 10 gravitational radii above the black hole in
order that the innermost regions, including the innermost stable circular
orbit, are well illuminated. The width of the blurring kernel (e.g., the iron
line) has a strong dependence on coronal height. These limitations may be
particularly applicable at low Eddington fractions (e.g. the low/hard state,
and low-luminosity AGN) where the height of the corona may be relatively large,
or outflowing, and tied to jet production.

circumstellar envelopes, protoplanetary discs, and other environments due to UV
radiation from stellar sources and the presence of cosmic rays. This source of
N atoms initiates the formation of complex N-bearing species and influences
their isotopic composition. To study the photodissociation rates of 14N15N by
UV continuum radiation and both isotopologues in a field of cosmic ray induced
photons. To determine the effect of these on the isotopic composition of more
complex molecules. High-resolution photodissociation cross sections of N2 are
used from an accurate and comprehensive quantum- mechanical model of the
molecule based on laboratory experiments. A similarly high-resolution spectrum
of H2 emission following interactions with cosmic rays has been constructed.
The spectroscopic data are used to calculate dissociation rates which are input
into isotopically differentiated chemical models, describing an interstellar
cloud and a protoplanetary disc. The dissociation rate of 14N15N in a Draine
field assuming 30K excitation is 1.73x10-10s-1 and the rate due to cosmic rays
assuming an H2 ionisation rate of 10-16s-1 is about 10-15s-1, with up to a
factor of 10 difference between isotopologues. Shielding functions for 14N15N
by 14N2, H2, and H are presented. Incorporating these into an interstellar
cloud model, an enhancement of the atomic 15N/14N ratio is obtained due to the
self-shielding of external radiation at an extinction of about 1.5 mag. This
effect is larger where grain growth has reduced the opacity of dust to
ultraviolet radiation. The transfer of photolytic isotopic fractionation N2 to
other molecules is significant in a disc model, and is species dependent with
15N enhancement approaching a factor of 10 for HCN.

$V(\vec k)$ of ad-atom with Dirac electrons in graphene -- which arises for
vacancies and hollow-site impurities -- we study the nature of magnetic moment
formation within the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). Compared to the
s-wave hybridization function, we find that the local moments formed within the
Hartree mean field are robust against the change in the parameters of the
model. Further we investigate the stability of the local moments with respect
to quantum fluctuations by going beyond the Hartree approximation. We find that
for parameter regimes where local moments formed by top-site ad-atoms are
completely washed out by quantum fluctuations, those formed by vacancies (or
hollow-site impurities) survive the quantum fluctuations captured by
post-Hartree approximation. Hence vacancies and hollow-site ad-atoms are
suitable candidates to produce stable local moments.

fluorescent protein imaging time series data are available for a population of
cells. Based on van Kampen's linear noise approximation, we derive a dynamic
state space model for molecular populations which is then extended to a
hierarchical model. This model has potential to address the sources of
variability relevant to single-cell data, namely, intrinsic noise due to the
stochastic nature of the birth and death processes involved in reactions and
extrinsic noise arising from the cell-to-cell variation of kinetic parameters.
In order to infer such a model from experimental data, one must also quantify
the measurement process where one has to allow for nonmeasurable molecular
species as well as measurement noise of unknown level and variance. The
availability of multiple single-cell time series data here provides a unique
testbed to fit such a model and quantify these different sources of variation

agreement with those derived from other radio-stacking measurements of
mass-selected passive and star-forming galaxies, but inconsistent with those
generated from semi-analytic models, which tend to underestimate SFRs and
SSFRs. There is a need for deeper high-resolution radio surveys such as those

the missing data. The problem of imputing missing data is complicated by the
fact that statistical data often have to satisfy certain edit rules and that
values of variables across units sometimes have to sum up to known totals. For
numerical data, edit rules are most often formulated as linear restrictions on
the variables. For example, for data on enterprises edit rules could be that
the profit and costs of an enterprise should sum up to its turnover and that
the turnover should be at least zero. The totals of some variables across units
may already be known from administrative data (e.g., turnover from a tax
register) or estimated from other sources. Standard imputation methods for
numerical data as described in the literature generally do not take such edit
rules and totals into account. In this article we describe algorithms for
imputing missing numerical data that take edit restrictions into account and
ensure that sums are calibrated to known totals. These algorithms are based on
a sequential regression approach that uses regression predictions to impute the
variables one by one. To assess the performance of the imputation methods, a
simulation study is carried out as well as an evaluation study based on a real
data set.

more extended, diffuse, rounder outer halo. Such external structure can be
traced to the very edge of our image out to 50 kpc from the disk plane. The

spacer layer can be, nevertheless, dynamically coupled via spin currents
emitted by the spin-pump and absorbed through the spin-torque effects at the
neighboring interfaces. A decrease of damping in both layers due to a partial
compensation of the angular momentum leakage in each layer was previously
observed at the coincidence of the two ferromagnetic resonances. In case of
non-zero magnetic coupling, such a dynamic exchange will depend on the mutual
precession of the magnetic moments in the layers. A difference in the linewidth
of the resonance peaks is expected for the acoustic and optical regimes of
precession. However, the interlayer coupling hybridizes the resonance responses
of the layers and therefore can also change their linewidths. The interplay
between the two mechanisms has never been considered before. In the present
work, the joint influence of the hybridization and non-local damping on the
linewidth has been studied in weakly coupled NiFe/CoFe/Cu/CoFe/MnIr spin-valve
multilayers. It has been found that the dynamic exchange by spin currents is
different in the optical and acoustic modes, and this difference is dependent
on the interlayer coupling strength. In contrast to the acoustic precession
mode, the dynamic exchange in the optical mode works as an additional damping
source. A simulation in the framework of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism
for two ferromagnetic layers coupled magnetically and by spin currents has been
done to separate the effects of the non-local damping from the resonance modes
hybridization. In our samples both mechanisms bring about linewidth changes of

function of metallicity in late-type dwarf galaxies, with the goal of
understanding the relation between dust content and metallicity. The dust
content of late-type dwarf galaxies with episodic star formation is studied
with a multicomponent model of dust evolution, which includes dust input from
AGB stars, type II SNe and dust mass growth by accretion of gas species in the
ISM. Dust growth in the ISM becomes an important dust source in dwarf galaxies,
on the timescale of 0.1 - few Gyrs. It increases the dust-to-gas ratio (DGR)
during post-burst evolution, unlike type II SNe, which eject grains into the
ISM only during starbursts. Before the dust growth in the ISM overtakes the
dust production, AGB stars can be major sources of dust in metal-poor dwarf
galaxies. Our models reproduce the relation between the DGR and oxygen
abundance, derived from observations of a large sample of dwarf galaxies. The
steep decrease in the DGR at low O values is explained by the relatively low
efficiency of dust condensation in stars. The scatter observed at higher O
values is determined mainly by different critical metallicities for the
transition from stardust- to ISM-growth dominated dust production, depending on
the star formation history. In galaxies with episodic star formation,
additional dispersion in the DGR is introduced by grain destruction during
starbursts, followed by an increase of the dust mass due to dust growth in the
ISM during post-burst evolution. We find that the carbon-to-silicate ratio
changes dramatically, when the ISM growth becomes the dominant dust source,
therefore this ratio can be used as an indicator of the transition. The
observed DGR-O relation in dwarf galaxies favours low condensation efficiencies
in type II SNe, together with an increase in the total dust mass by means of
dust growth in the ISM.

using engineered artificial full-reflection layers (metamirrors) as arrays of
electrically small resonant bi-anisotropic particles. In this scenario, fully
reflecting mirrors do not contain any continuous ground plane, but only arrays
of small particles. Bi-anisotropic omega coupling is required to get asymmetric
response in reflection phase for plane waves incident from the opposite sides
of the composite mirror. It is shown that with this concept one can
independently tailor the phase of electromagnetic waves reflected from both

states. Using driven stochastic lattice gases, we ask whether consistent
definitions of an effective chemical potential mu, and an effective temperature
T_e, are possible. mu and T_e are determined via coexistence, i.e., zero flux
of particles and energy between the driven system and a reservoir. In the
lattice gas with nearest-neighbor exclusion, temperature is not relevant, and
we find that the effective chemical potential, a function of density and drive
strength, satisfies the zeroth law, and correctly predicts the densities of
coexisting systems. In the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn driven lattice gas both mu and
T_e need to be defined. We show analytically that in this case the zeroth law
is violated for Metropolis exchange rates, and determine the size of the
violations numerically. The zeroth law appears to be violated for generic
exchange rates. Remarkably, the system-reservoir coupling proposed by Sasa and
Tasaki [J. Stat. Phys. 125, 125 (2006)], is free of inconsistencies, and the
zeroth law holds. This is because the rate depends only on the state of the
donor system, and is independent of that of the acceptor.

here in its most simple and yet physically relevant form: the classical density
functional theory of an ideal fluid of classical particles. For illustration
purpose, it is applied to the prediction of the molecular structure of liquid
neon. The numerical experiment proposed therein is built around the writing of
a cDFT code by students in Mathematica. Students thus have to deal with (i) the
cDFT theory, (ii) some basic concepts of statistical mechanics of simple

illustrate electronic DFT, if one highlights the analogies between the quantum

integral dissipation strength $\Gamma_0$, the width $\sigma$ and the array
period $d$. In the linear case, setting $\sigma\to0$, while keeping $\Gamma_0$

delta-functions, i.e. the complex Kroning-Penney model, where an infinite
number of nondecaying modes appear with the Bloch index being either at the
center, $k= 0$, or at the boundary, $k= \pi/d $, of an analog of the Brillouin

persist for $\sigma$ such that $\sigma/d\ll1$ and have the same Bloch index.
The nondecaying modes persist also if a real-valued periodic potential is added
to the spatially periodic array of dissipations, with the period of the
dissipative array being multiple of that of the periodic potential. We also
consider evolution of the soliton-shaped pulses in the nonlinear Schr\""odinger

interventions on some outcome of interest. In addition to the treatment
assignment and outcome, data on baseline covariates, such as demographic
characteristics or biomarker measurements, are typically collected.
Incorporating such auxiliary covariates in the analysis of randomized trials
can increase power, but questions remain about how to preserve type I error
when incorporating such covariates in a flexible way, particularly when the
number of randomized units is small. Using the Young Citizens study, a
cluster-randomized trial of an educational intervention to promote HIV
awareness, we compare several methods to evaluate intervention effects when
baseline covariates are incorporated adaptively. To ascertain the validity of
the methods shown in small samples, extensive simulation studies were
conducted. We demonstrate that randomization inference preserves type I error
under model selection while tests based on asymptotic theory may yield invalid
results. We also demonstrate that covariate adjustment generally increases
power, except at extremely small sample sizes using liberal selection
procedures. Although shown within the context of HIV prevention research, our
conclusions have important implications for maximizing efficiency and
robustness in randomized trials with small samples across disciplines.

quartetting wins over pairing. At zero temperature, in analogy to pairing, a
set of equations for the quartet order parameter is given. Contrary to pairing,
quartetting only exists for strong coupling and breaks down for weak coupling.
Reasons for this finding are detailed. In an application to nuclear matter, the
critical temperature for alpha particle condensation can reach values up to
around 8 MeV. The disappearance of alpha particles with increasing density,
i.e. the Mott transition, is investigated. In finite nuclei the Hoyle state,

condensate' state. It is conjectured that such states also exist in heavier

Hertzian dipole above flat lossy ground, which represents the well known in the
literature Sommerfeld radiation problem. The problem is formulated in a novel
spectral domain approach, and by inverse three dimensional Fourier
transformation the expressions for the received electric and magnetic field in
the physical space are derived as one dimensional integrals over the radial
component of wavevector, in cylindrical coordinates. Subsequent use of the
Stationary Phase Method in the high frequency regime yields closed form
analytical solutions for the received EM field vectors, which coincide with the
corresponding reflected EM field originating from the image point. In this way,
we conclude that the so called in the literature space wave, i.e. line of sight
plus reflected EM field, represents the total solution of the Sommerfeld
problem in the high frequency regime, in which case the surface wave can be
ignored. Finally, numerical results in the high frequency regime are presented
in this paper, in comparison with corresponding numerical results based on
Norton solution of the problem, i.e. space and surface waves.

requires effective models of packet reception at the physical layer in the
presence of interference. Despite recent progress in analytic and simulations
research into worst-case behavior from interference effects, these efforts
generally assume geometric path loss and isotropic transmission, assumptions
which have not been borne out in experiments.
  Our paper aims to provide a methodology for grounding theoretical results
into wireless interference in experimental reality. We develop a new framework
for wireless algorithms in which distance-based path loss is replaced by an
arbitrary gain matrix, typically obtained by measurements of received signal
strength (RSS). Gain matrices allow for the modeling of complex environments,
e.g., with obstacles and walls. We experimentally evaluate the framework in two
indoors testbeds with 20 and 60 motes, and confirm superior predictive
performance in packet reception rate for a gain matrix model over a geometric
distance-based model.
  At the heart of our approach is a new parameter $\zeta$ called metricity
which indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric, effectively
measuring the complexity of the environment. A powerful theoretical feature of
this parameter is that all known SINR scheduling algorithms that work in
general metric spaces carry over to arbitrary gain matrices and achieve
equivalent performance guarantees in terms of $\zeta$ as previously obtained in
terms of the path loss constant. Our experiments confirm the sensitivity of
$\zeta$ to the nature of the environment. Finally, we show analytically and
empirically how multiple channels can be leveraged to improve metricity and
thereby performance. We believe our contributions will facilitate experimental
validation for recent advances in algorithms for physical wireless interference
models.

(0 km/s <= V_SOHO - V_bg <= 500 km/s), and 6 slow (V_SOHO - V_bg < 0 km/s)
ICMEs, where V_SOHO and V_bg are the initial speed of ICMEs and the speed of
the background solar wind, respectively. For slow ICMEs, we found the following
results: i) They accelerate toward the speed of the background solar wind
during their propagation, and reach their final speed by 0.34 (+-) 0.03 AU. ii)
The acceleration ends when they reach 479 (+-) 126 km/s; this is close to the
typical speed of the solar wind during the period of this study. iii) When k_1
and k_2 are assumed to be constants, a quadratic equation for the acceleration
a = -k_2(V - V_bg)|V - V_bg| is more appropriate than a linear one a = -k_1(V -
V_bg), where V is the propagation speed of ICMEs, while the latter gives a
smaller chi-square value than the former. For the motion of the fast and
moderate ICMEs, we found a modified drag equation. From the viewpoint of fluid
dynamics, we interpret this equation as indicating that ICMEs with 0 km/s <= V
- V_bg <= 2300 km/s are controlled mainly by the hydrodynamic Stokes drag
force, while the aerodynamic drag force is a predominant factor for the
propagation of ICME with V - V_bg > 2300 km/s.

vibrated can transit to an absorbing state in which all particles bounce
vertically in phase with the box, with no horizontal motion. In principle, this
state can be reached for any density lower than the one corresponding to one
complete monolayer, which is then the critical density. Below this critical
value, the transition to the absorbing state is of first order, with long
metastable periods, followed by rapid transitions driven by homogeneous
nucleation. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments show that there is a
dramatic increase on the metastable times far below the critical density; in
practice, it is impossible to observe spontaneous transitions close to the
critical density. This peculiar feature is a consequence of the non-equilibrium
nature of this first order transition to the absorbing state. A Ginzburg-Landau
model, with multiplicative noise, describes qualitatively the observed
phenomena and explains the macroscopic size of the critical nuclei. The nuclei
become of small size only close to a second critical point where the active
phase becomes unstable via a saddle node bifurcation. It is only close to this
second critical point that experiments and simulations can evidence spontaneous
transitions to the absorbing state while the metastable times grow dramatically

break down this problem into simpler sub-problems that ensure there is no

characterization of solution points of these sub-problems that correspond to
Nash equilibria of the underlying game and for this purpose, we derive a set of
necessary and sufficient SG-SP (Stochastic Game - Sub-Problem) conditions.
Using these conditions, we develop two actor-critic algorithms: OFF-SGSP
(model-based) and ON-SGSP (model-free). Both algorithms use a critic that
estimates the value function for a fixed policy and an actor that performs
descent in the policy space using a descent direction that avoids local minima.
We establish that both algorithms converge, in self-play, to the equilibria of
a certain ordinary differential equation (ODE), whose stable limit points
coincide with stationary NE of the underlying general-sum stochastic game. On a
single state non-generic game (see Hart and Mas-Colell [2005]) as well as on a

as an efficient algorithm of inspecting percolation which takes advantage of
the Markov stochastic theory, in order to study the percolation threshold of
carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers. Our Markov-chain based algorithm carries out the
inspection of percolation by performing repeated sparse matrix-vector
multiplications, which allows parallelized computation to accelerate the
inspection for a given configuration. With this approach, we determine that the
site-percolation transition of CNT fibers occurs at p_c =0.1533+-0.0013, and
analyze the dependence of the effective percolation threshold (corresponding to
0.5 percolation probability) on the length and the aspect ratio of a CNT fiber
on a finite-size-scaling basis. We also discuss the aspect ratio dependence of
percolation probability with various values of p (not restricted to p_c).

implies that its workings have a nonlocal component. To check whether
consciousness as an entity leaves a physical trace, we propose that laboratory
searches for such a trace should be for nonlocality, where probabilities do not
conform to local expectations. Starting with the idea that nonlocality may be
veiled as one of the ways cosmic censorship operates, we further argue that in
order to preserve the ordinary objective reality described by local realism and
general relativity, veiled nonlocality and cosmic censorship are indispensable
operational aspects of the interactions of observers with physical systems.
Nevertheless, it may be possible to indirectly detect traces of nonlocality in
experiments where humans and other sentient subjects are involved

  Lorentz force electrical impedance tomography",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a mathematical analysis and a numerical framework for Lorentz
force electrical conductivity imaging. Ultrasonic vibration of a tissue in the
presence of a static magnetic field induces an electrical current by the
Lorentz force. This current can be detected by electrodes placed around the
tissue; it is proportional to the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse, but depends
nonlinearly on the conductivity distribution. The imaging problem is to
reconstruct the conductivity distribution from measurements of the induced
current. To solve this nonlinear inverse problem, we first make use of a
virtual potential to relate explicitly the current measurements to the
conductivity distribution and the velocity of the ultrasonic pulse. Then, by
applying a Wiener filter to the measured data, we reduce the problem to imaging
the conductivity from an internal electric current density. We first introduce
an optimal control method for solving such a problem. A new direct
reconstruction scheme involving a partial differential equation is then
proposed based on viscosity-type regularization to a transport equation
satisfied by the current density field. We prove that solving such an equation
yields the true conductivity distribution as the regularization parameter
approaches zero. We also test both schemes numerically in the presence of
measurement noise, quantify their stability and resolution, and compare their
performance.

"1401.2371","Charles Gunn","Charles Gunn","Rational trigonometry via projective geometric algebra","7 pages",,,,"math.GM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We show that main results of rational trigonometry (as developed by NJ
Wildberger, ""Divine Proportions"", 2005) can be succinctly expressed using
projective geometric algebra (PGA). In fact, the PGA representation exhibits
distinct advantages over the original vector-based approach. These include the
advantages intrinsic to geometric algebra: it is coordinate-free, treats lines
and points in a unified framework, and handles many special cases in a uniform
and seamless fashion. It also reveals structural patterns not visible in the
original formulation, for example, the exact duality of spread and quadrance.
The current article handles only a representative (euclidean) subset of the
full content of Wildberger's work, but enough to establish the value of this
approach for further development. The metric-neutral framework of PGA makes it
especially promising also to handle universal geometry, which extends rational
trigonometry to the hyperbolic plane.

Synthetic Aperture Radar images provided to our research group by SET 163
Working Group on SAR radar techniques. This method uses the blanket technique
to provide useful information for SAR image classification. It is based on the
calculation of the volume of a blanket, corresponding to the image to be
classified, and then on the calculation of the corresponding Fractal Area curve
and Fractal Dimension curve of the image. The main idea concerning this
proposed technique is the fact that different terrain types encountered in SAR
images yield different values of Fractal Area curves and Fractal Dimension
curves, upon which classification of different types of terrain is possible. As
a result, a classification technique for five different terrain types, i.e.
urban, suburban, rural, mountain and sea, is presented in this paper.

  management","15 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With an increasing share of electric energy produced from non-dispatchable
renewable sources both energy storage and demand side management might gain
tremendously in importance. While there has been significant progress in
general properties and technologies of energy storage, the systematic
characterization of features particular to demand side management such as its
intermittent, time-dependent potential seems to be lagging behind. As a
consequence, the development of efficient and sustainable strategies for demand
side management and its integration into large-scale energy system models are
impeded. This work introduces a novel framework for a systematic time-resolved
characterization of the potential for demand side management. It is based on
the specification of individual devices both with respect to their scheduled
demand and their potential of load shifting. On larger scales sector-specific
profiles can straightforwardly be taken into account. The potential for demand
side management is then specified in terms of size and capacity of an
equivalent storage device. This intermediate layer of abstraction isolates the
gross effects and opportunities of demand side management from questions
concerning the operation of individual devices, which eases the integration of
the results in existing schemes for the commitment of production units and
system models. The novel framework is applicable for conceptual or predictive
approaches and for real-time optimization and operation of energy systems
involving demand side management.

communities are trying hard to find out a way to cope with this problem.
Meanwhile, despite abundant funding these efforts did not lead to any
meaningful result (only in Europe, only in the past ten years, Cognitive
Robotics research funding has reached a ceiling of 1.39 billion euros). In the
next ten years, a similar budget is going to be spent to tackle the Cognitive

to expect that this time the result will be different. I would like to try to

To circumvent this problem, we propose to discretize the symmetry pseudo-group
action. Using the theory of moving frames, joint invariants of the discretized
action are algorithmically constructed. Computer simulations indicate that
numerical schemes constructed from these joint invariants can produce better
numerical results than standard schemes.
