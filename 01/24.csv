  theory, a shorter version will appear in Proc. IEEE ISIT 2015",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we take a unified approach for network information theory and
prove a coding theorem, which can recover most of the achievability results in
network information theory that are based on random coding. The final
single-letter expression has a very simple form, which was made possible by
many novel elements such as a unified framework that represents various network
problems in a simple and unified way, a unified coding strategy that consists
of a few basic ingredients but can emulate many known coding techniques if
needed, and new proof techniques beyond the use of standard covering and
packing lemmas. For example, in our framework, sources, channels, states and
side information are treated in a unified way and various constraints such as
cost and distortion constraints are unified as a single joint-typicality
constraint.
  Our theorem can be useful in proving many new achievability results easily
and in some cases gives simpler rate expressions than those obtained using
conventional approaches. Furthermore, our unified coding can strictly
outperform existing schemes. For example, we obtain a generalized
decode-compress-amplify-and-forward bound as a simple corollary of our main
theorem and show it strictly outperforms previously known coding schemes. Using
our unified framework, we formally define and characterize three types of
network duality based on channel input-output reversal and network flow
reversal combined with packing-covering duality.

further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size $2^{m \cdot r}$,

AG codes. These attacks consist in the blind reconstruction either of an Error
Correcting Pair (ECP), or an Error Correcting Array (ECA) from the single data
of an arbitrary generator matrix of a code. An ECP provides a decoding
algorithm that corrects up to $\frac{d^*-1-g}{2}$ errors, where $d^*$ denotes
the designed distance and $g$ denotes the genus of the corresponding curve,
while with an ECA the decoding algorithm corrects up to $\frac{d^*-1}{2}$

these attacks run in $O(n^4\log (n))$ operations in $\mathbb F_q$ for the
reconstruction of an ECP and $O(n^5)$ operations for the reconstruction of an
ECA. A probabilistic shortcut allows to reduce the complexities respectively to
$O(n^{3+\varepsilon} \log (n))$ and $O(n^{4+\varepsilon})$. Compared to the
previous known attack due to Faure and Minder, our attack is efficient on codes
from curves of arbitrary genus. Furthermore, we investigate how far these

  Methods: Simultaneous optical ($0.4-0.9$ $\mu$m) and near-infrared ($0.9-2.3$
$\mu$m) linear spectropolarimetric data of the earthshine were acquired by
observing the nightside of the waxing Moon. The data have sufficient spectral
resolution (2.51 nm in the optical, and 1.83 and 2.91 nm in the near-infrared)
to resolve major molecular species present in the Earth atmosphere.
  Results: We find the highest values of linear polarization ($\ge 10\%$) at
the bluest wavelengths, which agrees with the literature. Linear polarization
intensity steadily decreases towards red wavelengths reaching a nearly flat
value beyond $\sim$0.8 $\mu$m. In the near-infrared, we measured a polarization
degree of $\sim4.5 \%$ for the continuum. We report the detection of molecular
features due to O$_{2}$ at $0.760, 1.25 \mu$m and H$_{2}$O at 0.653$-$0.725

particular, the broad H$_{2}$O 1.12 $\mu$m band displays a polarimetric

prevailing hypothesis for the origin of water on Earth is by delivery through
water-rich small Solar system bodies. In this paper, the isotopic and chemical
evolution of water during the early history of the solar nebula, before the
onset of planetesimal formation, is studied. A gas-grain chemical model that
includes multiply-deuterated species and nuclear spin-states is combined with a
steady-state solar nebula model. To calculate initial abundances, we simulated
1 Myr of evolution of a cold and dark TMC1-like prestellar core. Two
time-dependent chemical models of the solar nebula are calculated over 1 Myr:
(1) a laminar model and (2) a model with 2D turbulent mixing. We find that the
radial outward increase of the H2O D/H ratio is shallower in the
chemo-dynamical nebular model compared to the laminar model. This is related to
more efficient de-fractionation of HDO via rapid gas-phase processes, as the 2D
mixing model allows the water ice to be transported either inward and thermally
evaporated or upward and photodesorbed. The laminar model shows the Earth water
D/H ratio at r ~<2.5 AU, while for the 2D chemo-dynamical model this zone is
larger, r ~<9 AU. Similarly, the water D/H ratios representative of the
Oort-family comets, ~2.5-10 x 10-4, are achieved within ~2-6 AU and ~2-20 AU in
the laminar and the 2D model, respectively. We find that with regards to the
water isotopic composition and the origin of the comets, the mixing model seems
to be favored over the laminar model.

independent and identically distributed (IID) random variables is addressed.
Whereas previous approaches assume a known probability density function (PDF)
at the start of the sequence, the problem addressed is the detection of a
single change in distribution among a finite number of known 'equal-energy'
PDFs, but where the initial and final distributions are not known a priori. A
Bayesian multiple hypothesis approach is proposed where (i) unlike previous
threshold policies, the minimum cost hypothesis is tracked through time, (ii)
under an exponential delay-cost function that satisfies an upper bound
determined by the distances between hypotheses, the probability of detecting a
change from an incorrect initial distribution asymptotically vanishes with
time, (iii) computation is recursive and constant per unit time, and (iv) the
unknown initial state gives rise to unavoidable incorrect detections that be
made to vanish with a constant test threshold with negligibly small effect on
correct detection delay for change times beyond a lower bound. Simulations
illustrate the analysis and reveal that average delay approaches that of the
optimal CUSUM test after an initial transient period determined by an incorrect
detection probability constraint.

domains with partial information and sensing actions, presenting a new planner:
SDR (Sample, Determinize, Replan). At each step we generate a solution plan to
a classical planning problem induced by the original problem. We execute this
plan as long as it is safe to do so. When this is no longer the case, we
replan. The classical planning problem we generate is based on the
translation-based approach for conformant planning introduced by Palacios and
Geffner. The state of the classical planning problem generated in this approach
captures the belief state of the agent in the original problem. Unfortunately,
when this method is applied to planning problems with sensing, it yields a
non-deterministic planning problem that is typically very large. Our main
contribution is the introduction of state sampling techniques for overcoming
these two problems. In addition, we introduce a novel, lazy, regression-based
method for querying the agents belief state during run-time. We provide a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the planner, showing that it scales
better than the state-of-the-art CLG planner on existing benchmark problems,

round-robin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances
traveled by all n teams. We introduce the Linear Distance Traveling Tournament
Problem (LD-TTP), and solve it for n=4 and n=6, generating the complete set of
possible solutions through elementary combinatorial techniques. For larger n,
we propose a novel ""expander construction"" that generates an approximate

expander construction produces a feasible double round-robin tournament

optimal solution, regardless of where the n teams are located. This
4/3-approximation for the LD-TTP is stronger than the currently best-known
ratio of 5/3 + epsilon for the general TTP. We conclude the paper by applying
this linear distance relaxation to general (non-linear) n-team TTP instances,
where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply ""assuming"" the n teams
lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem. We show that this

accomplish this task, we first construct polar codes for both the superposition

constraints that are assumed to hold between the auxiliary random variables and

focuses on global evolution moves and, for simplicity, restricts to Euclidean

order to link the covariant and canonical picture, the dynamics of the quantum
states is generated by propagators which satisfy the canonical constraints and

to non-unitary, and thus irreversible, projections of physical Hilbert spaces

  Using this framework, we obtain new results for the Ising model on

total-variation mixing exhibits cutoff with an $O(1)$-window around the time at
which the magnetization is the square-root of the volume. (Previously, cutoff
in the full high temperature regime was only known for $d\leq 2$, and only with
an $O(\log\log n)$-window.)

the initial state on the mixing time. We demonstrate this on the 1D Ising

distribution asymptotically halves the mixing time, whereas almost every
deterministic starting state is asymptotically as bad as starting from the

during four science runs (VSR1, VSR2, VSR3 and VSR4) between May 2007 and
September 2011, with increasing sensitivity.
  In this paper, the method used to reconstruct, in the range 10 Hz-10 kHz, the
gravitational wave strain time series $h(t)$ from the detector signals is
described. The standard consistency checks of the reconstruction are discussed
and used to estimate the systematic uncertainties of the $h(t)$ signal as a
function of frequency. Finally, an independent setup, the photon calibrator, is
described and used to validate the reconstructed $h(t)$ signal and the
associated uncertainties.
  The uncertainties of the $h(t)$ time series are estimated to be 8% in
amplitude. The uncertainty of the phase of $h(t)$ is 50 mrad at 10 Hz with a
frequency dependence following a delay of 8 $\mu$s at high frequency. A bias
lower than $4\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and depending on the sky direction of the GW is
also present.

configuration of the traps for which a crossing of two energy eigenvalues
occurs and the transfer of the atom fails. Instead the wavefunction is robustly
split into a coherent superposition between two of the traps. We show that this
process can be used to construct a single-atom interferometer and discuss its
performance in terms of the final population distribution among the asymptotic
eigenstates of the individual traps. This interferometric scheme could be used
to study space dependent fields from ultrashort to relatively large distances,

predict the possible magnetic ground state of the studied systems by employing
the mean field approach and in certain cases by spin dynamics calculations. We
point out that the number of shells considered for the isotropic exchange
interactions plays a crucial role in the determination of the magnetic ground
state. In the case of Ta substrate we demonstrate that the out-of-plane
relaxation of the Fe monolayer causes a transition from ferromagnetic to
antiferromagnetic ground state. We examine the relative magnitude of nearest
neighbour Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D) and isotropic (J) exchange interactions in
order to get insight into the nature of magnetic pattern formations. For the
Fe/Os(0001) system we calculate a very large D/J ratio, correspondingly, a spin
spiral ground state. We find that, mainly through the leading isotropic
exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, the inward layer relaxation
substantially influences the magnetic ordering of the Fe monolayer. For the
Fe/Re(0001) system characterized by large antiferromagnetic interactions we
also determine the chirality of the $120^{\circ}$ N\'eel-type ground state.

model, considering both the real and imaginary components of the complex field.
Using transport techniques, we calculate the full allowed range of $n_s$, $r$
and $f_{\rm NL}$ for different choices of the single free parameter, $v$, and
present the probability distribution of these signatures given a simple choice
for the prior distribution of initial conditions. Our work provides a case
study of multi-field inflation in a simple but realistic setting, with
important lessons that are likely to apply more generally. For example, we find
that there are initial conditions consistent with observations of $n_s$ and $r$
for values of $v$ that would be excluded if only evolutions in the real field
direction were to be considered, and that these may yield enhanced values of
$f_{\rm NL}$. Moreover, we find that initial conditions fixed at high energy
density, where the potential is close to quartic in form, can still lead to
evolutions in a concave region of the potential during the observable number of
e-folds, as preferred by present data. The Wess-Zumino model therefore provides
an illustration that multi-field dynamics must be taken into account when
seeking to understand fully the phenomenology of such models of inflation.

spontaneous volume magnetostriction, and their relationship in disordered
face-centered-cubic Fe$_{0.72}$Pt$_{0.28}$ and Fe$_{0.65}$Ni$_{0.35}$ in the
temperature interval $0 \leq T/T_{\rm C} < 1$. It relies on the disordered
local moment formalism and the observation that the reduced magnetization in
each of the investigated materials is accurately described by an equation of
the form $M(T)/M(0) = [ 1 -s (T/T_{\rm C})^{3/2}- (1-s)(T/T_{\rm C})^{p}
]^{q}$. The present approach yields interesting results. The alloys at zero
Kelvin share several physical properties: the volume in a partially disordered
local moment state shrinks as the fraction of Fe moments which point down
increases in the interval $0 < x^{{\rm Fe}\downarrow} < 1/2$, following closely
$V(0) - 4 [V(0)-V(1/2)] x^{{\rm Fe}\downarrow} (1-x^{{\rm Fe}\downarrow})$,
while the magnetization collapses, following closely $M(0) - 2 M(0) x^{{\rm
Fe}\downarrow}$; the volume in the homogeneous ferromagnetic state greatly
exceeds that in the disordered local moment state; $x^{{\rm Fe}\downarrow}(0)$
is close to zero. These common properties can account for a variety of
intriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys, including the anomaly in the
magnetostriction at zero Kelvin and, more surprisingly perhaps, the scaling
between the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared
below the Curie temperature. However, the thermal evolution of the fraction of
Fe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration.
This, in turn, can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature
dependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys.

anti-x-particles, and y-particles, and postulates that a y-particle can decay

The wave function is a multi-time version of a time-dependent state vector in
Fock space (or rather, the appropriate product of Fock spaces) in the

bounded subsets and topologically bounded subsets. It is natural to ask (1)
whether an order bounded subset is topologically bounded and (2) whether a

partial answer to (1) by saying that an order bounded subset of a locally solid
Riesz space is topologically bounded. This paper attempts to further
investigate these two questions. In particular, we show that (i) there exists a
non-locally solid topological Riesz space in which every order bounded subset
is topologically bounded; (ii) if a topological Riesz space is not locally
solid, an order bounded subset need not be topologically bounded; (iii) a

neighborhood of zero even if every topologically bounded subset is order

self-consistent turbulent initial conditions and vary the mean mass-to-flux
ratio relative to the critical value over 2, 10, and infinity to gauge the
influence of magnetic fields on star cluster formation. We find, in good
agreement with previous studies, that magnetic fields of typically observed
strengths lower the star formation rate by a factor of 2.4 and reduce the
amount of fragmentation by a factor of 2 relative to the zero-field case. We
also find that the field increases the characteristic sink particle mass, again
by a factor of 2.4. The magnetic field also increases the degree of clustering
in our simulations, such that the maximum stellar densities in the strong field
case are higher than the others by again a factor of 2. This clustering tends
to encourage the formation of multiple systems, which are more common in the
rad-MHD runs than the rad-hydro run. The companion frequency in our simulations
is consistent with observations of multiplicity in Class I sources,
particularly for the strong field case. Finally, we find evidence of primordial
mass segregation in our simulations reminiscent of that observed in star
clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster.

the planet at approximately the local orbital rate (1751.6 degrees/day), and
that the ringlet's pericenter precesses at 38.243+/-0.008 degrees/day,
consistent with the expected apsidal precession rate at this location due to
Saturn's higher-order gravitational harmonics. Surprisingly, we also find that
the ringlet's semi-major axis appears to be decreasing with time at a rate of
2.4+/-0.4 km/year between 2005 and 2013. A closer look at these measurements,
along with a consideration of earlier Voyager observations of this same

possibility of distinct instabilities: the large-scale dynamo instability,

pressure instability (NEMPI) operating in the strongly stratified surface
layers. The latter might be important in connection with magnetic spot
formation, but the growth rate of NEMPI is suppressed with increasing rotation
rates, although recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) have shown a
subsequent increase in the growth rate. We examine quantitatively whether this
increase in the growth rate of NEMPI can be explained by an alpha squared
mean-field dynamo, and whether both NEMPI and the dynamo instability can
operate at the same time. We use both DNS and mean-field simulations (MFS) to
solve the underlying equations numerically either with or without an imposed
horizontal field. We use the test-field method to compute relevant dynamo
coefficients. DNS show that magnetic flux concentrations are still possible up
to rotation rates above which the large-scale dynamo effect produces mean
magnetic fields. The resulting DNS growth rates are quantitatively well
reproduced with MFS. As expected, for weak or vanishing rotation, the growth
rate of NEMPI increases with increasing gravity, but there is a correction term
for strong gravity and large turbulent magnetic diffusivity. Magnetic flux
concentrations are still possible for rotation rates above which dynamo action
takes over. For the solar rotation rate, the corresponding turbulent turnover
time is about 5 hours, with dynamo action commencing in the layers beneath.

  and Language Resources (Lingvistic{\ae} Investigationes), 2014",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the key issues in both natural language understanding and generation
is the appropriate processing of Multiword Expressions (MWEs). MWEs pose a huge
problem to the precise language processing due to their idiosyncratic nature
and diversity in lexical, syntactical and semantic properties. The semantics of
a MWE cannot be expressed after combining the semantics of its constituents.
Therefore, the formalism of semantic clustering is often viewed as an
instrument for extracting MWEs especially for resource constraint languages
like Bengali. The present semantic clustering approach contributes to locate
clusters of the synonymous noun tokens present in the document. These clusters
in turn help measure the similarity between the constituent words of a
potentially candidate phrase using a vector space model and judge the
suitability of this phrase to be a MWE. In this experiment, we apply the
semantic clustering approach for noun-noun bigram MWEs, though it can be
extended to any types of MWEs. In parallel, the well known statistical models,
namely Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR),
Significance function are also employed to extract MWEs from the Bengali
corpus. The comparative evaluation shows that the semantic clustering approach
outperforms all other competing statistical models. As a by-product of this
experiment, we have started developing a standard lexicon in Bengali that
serves as a productive Bengali linguistic thesaurus.

by exploiting the probability of collision in a random permutation. In order to
speed up the computation, a random permutation can be approximated by using an
universal hash function such as the $h_{a,b}$ function proposed by Carter and
Wegman. A better estimate of the Jaccard Index can be achieved by using many of
these hash functions, created at random. In this paper a new iterative
procedure to generate a set of $h_{a,b}$ functions is devised that eliminates
the need for a list of random values and avoid the multiplication operation
during the calculation. The properties of the generated hash functions remains
that of an universal hash function family. This is possible due to the random
nature of features occurrence on sparse datasets. Results show that the
uniformity of hashing the features is maintaned while obtaining a speed up of
up to $1.38$ compared to the traditional approach.

importance in probabilistic data analysis, because it is involved in
calculating the posterior probability of a model or re-weighting a mixture of
models conditioned on data. It is, however, extremely challenging to compute.
This paper presents a geometric-path Monte Carlo method, inspired by
multi-canonical Monte Carlo to evaluate the fully marginalized likelihood. We
show that the algorithm is very fast and easy to implement and produces a
justified uncertainty estimate on the fully marginalized likelihood. The
algorithm performs efficiently on a trial problem and multi-companion model
fitting for radial velocity data. For the trial problem, the algorithm returns
the correct fully marginalized likelihood, and the estimated uncertainty is
also consistent with the standard deviation of results from multiple runs. We
apply the algorithm to the problem of fitting radial velocity data from HIP
88048 ($\nu$ Oph) and Gliese 581. We evaluate the fully marginalized likelihood
of 1, 2, 3, and 4-companion models given data from HIP 88048 and various
choices of prior distributions. We consider prior distributions with three
different minimum radial velocity amplitude $K_{\mathrm{min}}$. Under all three
priors, the 2-companion model has the largest marginalized likelihood, but the
detailed values depend strongly on $K_{\mathrm{min}}$. We also evaluate the
fully marginalized likelihood of 3, 4, 5, and 6-planet model given data from
Gliese 581 and find that the fully marginalized likelihood of the 5-planet
model is too close to that of the 6-planet model for us to confidently decide
between them.

Luminosity Function (LF) at 0.4<z<1.3 from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic
Redshift Survey (VIPERS) using ~45,000 galaxies with precise spectroscopic
redshifts down to i'_AB<22.5 over ~10.32 deg^2 in two fields. From z=0.5 to
z=1.3 the LF and CMR are well defined for different galaxy populations and
M^*_B evolves by ~1.04(1.09)+/-0.06(0.10) mag for the total (red) galaxy
sample. We compare different criteria for selecting early-type galaxies (ETGs):
(1) fixed cut in rest-frame (U-V) colours, (2) evolving cut in (U-V) colours,
(3) rest-frame (NUV-r')-(r'-K) colour selection, and (4) SED classification.
Regardless of the method we measure a consistent evolution of the red-sequence
(RS). Between 0.4<z<1.3 we find a moderate evolution of the RS intercept of
Delta(U-V)=0.28+/-0.14 mag, favouring exponentially declining star formation
(SF) histories with SF truncation at 1.7<=z<=2.3. Together with the rise in the
ETG number density by 0.64 dex since z=1, this suggests a rapid build-up of
massive galaxies (M>10^11 M_sun) and expeditious RS formation over a short
period of ~1.5 Gyr starting before z=1. This is supported by the detection of
ongoing SF in ETGs at 0.9<z<1.0, in contrast with the quiescent red stellar
populations of ETGs at 0.5<z<0.6. There is an increase in the observed CMR
scatter with redshift, two times larger than in galaxy clusters and at variance
with theoretical models. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that support
the observed evolution of the red galaxy population. Our findings point out
that massive galaxies have experienced a sharp SF quenching at z~1 with only
limited additional merging. In contrast, less-massive galaxies experience a mix
of SF truncation and minor mergers which build-up the low- and
intermediate-mass end of the CMR.

proton or neutron recoiling almost back to back to the missing momentum,
leaving the residual A=2 system at low excitation energy. These data were used
to identify two-nucleon short-range correlated pairs and to deduce their
isospin structure as a function of missing momentum in a region where the
nucleon-nucleon force is expected to change from predominantly tensor to
repulsive. Neutron-proton pairs dominate the high-momentum tail of the nucleon
momentum distributions, but their abundance is reduced as the nucleon momentum
increases beyond ~500 MeV/c. The extracted fraction of proton-proton pairs is
small and almost independent of the missing momentum in the range we studied.

and non vanishing in the limit of zero viscosity, which results in the
fundamental anomaly of time irreversibility. It was considered straightforward
to deduce from this the Lagrangian velocity anomaly, $\left< d u^2/dt\right>=-4
\bar{\epsilon}$ at $t=0$, where $\vec{u}$ is the velocity difference of a pair
of particles, initially separated by a fixed distance. In this letter we
demonstrate that this derivation assumed first taking the limit $t \to 0$ and
then $\nu \to 0$, while the true anomaly requires taking viscosity to zero
first. For compressible turbulence we find that the limits $t \to 0$ and $\nu
\to 0$ do not commute and the Lagrangian anomaly is completely altered: $\left<
d u^2/dt\right>$ has different values forward and backward in time. We show
that this new anomaly is related to the particles entering/exiting shocks
forward/backward in time. For incompressible flows, on the other hand, we show
that the limits can be interchanged and the Lagrangian anomaly is still induced
by the flux law, apparently due to a homogeneous distribution of fluid
particles at all times.

and $\Pi$ is a commuting set of parametric derivations. The procedure developed
by Dreyfus reduces the computation of $R_u(H)$ to solving a creative
telescoping problem, whose effective solution requires the assumption that the
maximal reductive quotient $H / R_u(H)$ is a $\Pi$-constant linear differential
algebraic group. When this condition is not satisfied, we compute a new set of
parametric derivations $\Pi'$ such that the associated differential Galois
group $H'$ has the property that $H'/ R_u(H')$ is $\Pi'$-constant, and such
that $R_u(H)$ is defined by the same differential equations as $R_u(H')$. Thus
the computation of $R_u(H)$ is reduced to the effective computation of

extending the applicability of some recent algorithms developed by Minchenko,

for outage probability and spectral efficiency in both single and multi-tier
cellular wireless networks. The analysis accounts for per user equipment (UE)
power control as well as the maximum power limitations for UEs. More
specifically, for interference mitigation and robust uplink communication, each
UE is required to control its transmit power such that the average received
signal power at its serving base station (BS) is equal to a certain threshold
$\rho_o$. Due to the limited transmit power, the UEs employ a truncated channel
inversion power control policy with a cutoff threshold of $\rho_o$. We show
that there exists a transfer point in the uplink system performance that
depends on the tuple: BS intensity ($\lambda$), maximum transmit power of UEs
($P_u$), and $\rho_o$. That is, when $P_u$ is a tight operational constraint
with respect to [w.r.t.] $\lambda$ and $\rho_o$, the uplink outage probability
and spectral efficiency highly depend on the values of $\lambda$ and $\rho_o$.
In this case, there exists an optimal cutoff threshold $\rho^*_o$, which
depends on the system parameters, that minimizes the outage probability. On the
other hand, when $P_u$ is not a binding operational constraint w.r.t. $\lambda$
and $\rho_o$, the uplink outage probability and spectral efficiency become
independent of $\lambda$ and $\rho_o$. We obtain approximate yet accurate
simple expressions for outage probability and spectral efficiency which reduce

prospective candidates for the still elusive progenitors of SNeIa. We propose
that statistics of novae in nearby galaxies may be a powerful tool to gauge the
role of such systems in producing SNeIa. Using multicycle nova evolutionary
models, we compute the number and temporal distribution of novae that would be
produced by a typical (unstably burning) SNIa progenitor before reaching the
Chandrasekhar mass limit (M_ch) and exploding. Combined with the observed nova
rates, this can be used to constrain the maximal contribution of the nova
channel to the SNIa rate in nearby galaxies. The M31 nova rate measured by the
POINT-AGAPE survey is 65/yr. Assuming that all these novae will reach M_ch, we
obtain the maximal SNIa rate novae may produce to be (1-5)x10^-4/yr. This
constrains the overall contribution of the nova channel to the SNIa rate in M31
at <2-7%. Furthermore, ~80% of novae generated by a successful SNIa progenitor
have short decay times (t2<10 days), and are produced when the WD mass is close
to M_ch. We point out that statistics of such fast novae can provide a
sensitive diagnostic of the contribution of the nova channel to the final
stages of mass accumulation by the single degenerate (SD) SNIa progenitors. To
explore the prospects of their use, we investigate the efficiency of detecting
fast novae in an M31 nova survey of the PTF class. We find that a survey with
limiting magnitude of m_R~22 observing at least every 2nd night will catch ~90%
of fast novae expected in the SD scenario. Such surveys should be detecting
fast novae in M31 at a rate of the order of >10^3xf per yr, where f is the
fraction of SNeIa which accreted in the unstable nuclear burning regime while
accumulating the final ~0.1M_sun before the SNIa explosion.

The source of this dark material has been identified with the low albedo
asteroids, but it is still a matter of debate whether the delivery of the dark
material is associated with a few large impact events, to micrometeorites or to
the continuous, secular flux of impactors on Vesta. The continuous flux
scenario predicts that a significant fraction of the exogenous material
accreted by Vesta should be due to non-dark impactors likely analogous to
ordinary chondrites, which instead represent only a minor contaminant in the
HED meteorites. We explored the continuous flux scenario and its implications
for the composition of the vestan regolith, taking advantage of the data from
the Dawn mission and the HED meteorites. We used our model to show that the
stochastic events scenario and the micrometeoritic flux scenario are natural
consequences of the continuous flux scenario. We then used the model to
estimate the amounts of dark and hydroxylate materials delivered on Vesta since
the LHB and we showed how our results match well with the values estimated by
the Dawn mission. We used our model to assess the amount of Fe and siderophile
elements that the continuous flux of impactors would mix in the vestan
regolith: concerning the siderophile elements, we focused our attention on the
role of Ni. The results are in agreement with the data available on the Fe and
Ni content of the HED meteorites and can be used as a reference frame in future
studies of the data from the Dawn mission and of the HED meteorites. Our model
cannot yet provide an answer to the fate of the missing non-carbonaceous
contaminants, but we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy.

most precise extraction of the charge radius of the proton which is currently
in conflict with other determinations based on $e-p$ scattering and hydrogen
spectroscopy. This discrepancy could be the result of some new muon-specific
force with O(1-100) MeV force carrier---in this paper we concentrate on vector
mediators. Such an explanation faces challenges from the constraints imposed by
the $g-2$ of the muon and electron as well as precision spectroscopy of muonic
atoms. In this work we complement the family of constraints by calculating the
contribution of hypothetical forces to the muonium hyperfine structure. We also
compute the two-loop contribution to the electron parity violating amplitude
due to a muon loop, which is sensitive to the muon axial-vector coupling.
Overall, we find that the combination of low-energy constraints favors the mass
of the mediator to be below 10 MeV, and that a certain degree of tuning is
required between vector and axial-vector couplings of new vector particles to
muons in order to satisfy constraints from muon $g-2$. However, we also observe
that in the absence of a consistent standard model embedding, high energy
weak-charged processes accompanied by the emission of new vector particles are
strongly enhanced by $(E/m_V)^2$, with $E$ a characteristic energy scale and
$m_V$ the mass of the mediator. In particular, leptonic $W$ decays impose the
strongest constraints on such models completely disfavoring the remainder of

equation y'(x)=\cos[\pi xy(x)] subject to the initial condition y(0)=a.
Although the differential equation is nonlinear, the solutions to this
initial-value problem bear a striking resemblance to solutions to the
time-independent Schroedinger eigenvalue problem. As x increases from x=0, y(x)
oscillates and thus resembles a quantum wave function in a classically allowed
region. At a critical value x=x_{crit}, where x_{crit} depends on a, the
solution y(x) undergoes a transition; the oscillations abruptly cease and y(x)
decays to 0 monotonically as x-->\infty. This transition resembles the
transition in a wave function that occurs at a turning point as one enters the
classically forbidden region. Furthermore, the initial condition a falls into
discrete classes; in the nth class of initial conditions a_{n-1}<a<a_n
(n=1,2,3,...), y(x) exhibits exactly n maxima in the oscillatory region. The
boundaries a_n of these classes are the analogs of quantum-mechanical
eigenvalues. An asymptotic calculation of $a_n$ for large $n$ is analogous to a
high-energy semiclassical (WKB) calculation of eigenvalues in quantum
mechanics. The principal result of this paper is that as n-->\infty,
a_n~A\sqrt{n}, where A=2^{5/6}. Numerical analysis reveals that the first
Painleve transcendent has an eigenvalue structure that is quite similar to that
of the equation y'(x)=\cos[\pi xy(x)] and that the nth eigenvalue grows with n
like a constant times n^{3/5} as n-->\infty. Finally, it is noted that the
constant A is numerically very close to the lower bound on the power-series
constant P in the theory of complex variables, which is associated with the
asymptotic behavior of zeros of partial sums of Taylor series.

macroscopic collisions, or through more steady micrometeoroid bombardment. The
ring was discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 24 $\mu$m and has a
normal optical depth of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-8}$ (Verbiscer et al. 2009). We

dwarfs would be manifested in observations of their atmospheric pollution.
Archival observations of pollution levels for unbiased samples of DA and non-DA
white dwarfs are used to derive the distribution of accretion rates, confirming
that rates become systematically lower as sinking time is decreased, with no
discernable dependence on cooling age. The accretion rates expected from
planetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) are
explored both analytically and using a Monte Carlo model, quantifying how
measured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since different
sinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. However,
that dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.
Consideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal masses
uncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (rather
than stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion of
such planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;
smaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. A
reasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions is
found with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved mass
distribution up to Pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distribution
consistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequence
A stars. With these parameters, while both DA and non-DA white dwarfs accrete
from the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that the
pollution seen in DAs is dominated by the continuous accretion of <35km
objects, and that in non-DAs by >35km objects (though the dominant size varies
between stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)...

we detect a pair of inner X-ray cavities, an outer X-ray cavity, a shock front,

pre-initial configuration (preIC), the order of the Lagrangian perturbation
theory (LPT), and the initial redshift, on the statistics associated with the
large scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, the
density power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures.
We find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at
$z\lesssim 2$. However, the initial excess of power in the glass initial
conditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the mass
function at high redshifts. The LPT order used to generate the ICs of the
simulations is found to play a crucial role. First-order LPT (1LPT) simulations
underestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2LPT)
ones, typically by 2% at $10^{14} h^{-1} M_\odot$ for an initial redshift of
23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6% near the Nyquist
frequency for $z_\mathrm{ini} = 23$. Moreover, at higher redshifts, the
high-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1LPT
simulations. On the other hand, when the LPT order is fixed, the starting
redshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function.

analytically why lower values of $m_1$ require a high level of fine tuning in

stringent constraint for a specific model or class of models, such as
$SO(10)$-inspired models, and shows that some models cannot realise strong
thermal leptogenesis for any value of $m_1$. A scatter plot analysis fully

laboratories to study the effects of their high UV radiation, powerful winds,
and strong ejection events onto the surrounding gas and dust. The LBV
G79.29+0.46 powered two concentric infrared rings which may interact with the
infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G79.3+0.3. The Effelsberg 100m telescope was used to
observe the NH_3 (1,1), (2,2) emission surrounding G79.29+0.46 and the IRDC. In
addition, we observed particular positions in the (3,3) transition toward the
strongest region of the IRDC. We report here the first coherent shell-like
structure of dense NH_3 gas associated with an evolved massive star. The shell,
two or three orders of magnitude more tenuous than the IRDC, is well traced in
both ammonia lines, and surrounds the ionized nebula. The NH_3 emission in the
IRDC is characterized by a low and uniform rotational temperature (T_rot ~ 10
K) and moderately high opacities in the (1,1) line. The rest of the observed
field is spotted by warm or hot zones (T_rot > 30 K) and characterized by
optically thin emission of the (1,1) line. The NH_3 abundances are about
10^{-8} in the IRDC, and 10^{-10}-10^{-9} elsewhere. The warm temperatures and
low abundances of NH_3 in the shell suggest that the gas is being heated and
photo-dissociated by the intense UV field of the LBV star. An outstanding
region is found to the south-west (SW) of the LBV star within the IRDC. The
NH_3 (3,3) emission at the centre of the SW region reveals two velocity
components tracing gas at temperatures > 30K. The northern edge of the SW
region agrees with the border of the ring nebula and a region of continuum
enhancement; here, the opacity of the (1,1) line and the NH_3 abundance do not
decrease as expected in a typical clump of an isolated cold dark cloud. This
strongly suggests some kind of interaction between the ring nebula and the
IRDC.

To examine these landscapes we introduce a random matrix model that describes
the correlations between various derivatives and we propose an efficient
algorithm that allows for a numerical study of high dimensional random fields.
Using these novel tools, we find that the vast majority of metastable critical
points in $N$ dimensional random supergravities are either approximately
supersymmetric with $|F|\ll M_{\text{susy}}$ or supersymmetric. Such
approximately supersymmetric points are dynamical attractors in the landscape
and the probability that a randomly chosen critical point is metastable scales
as $\log(P)\propto -N$. We argue that random supergravities lead to potentially

parameter $\beta^{\prime}$. We introduce two new global shape parameters
$\zeta_A$ and $\zeta_B$ which replace the kurtosis as a more statistically
robust measure of the shape of the line of sight velocity distribution. We show
that in the case of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies these new parameters can
significantly reduce the range of density profiles that are otherwise
consistent with the observed stellar kinematics (a problem sometimes known as
the $\beta$ degeneracy). Specifically, we find that $\zeta_A$ focuses tightly
on a subset of solutions where cusped density profiles are degenerate with more
concentrated cored dark matter halos. If the number density of stars $\nu(r)$
is fixed, then introducing $\zeta_B$ can further reduce the space of solutions
by constraining the outer slope of the dark matter density profile. Assuming a
Plummer profile for $\nu(r)$ we recover the surprising result that the dark
matter in Sculptor may be cuspy after all, in contrast to the conclusions of

nowadays known to be implicated into a wide range of brain-related disorders.
However, it was not before the advent of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(dMRI) that researches have been able to examine the properties of white matter
in vivo. Presently, among a range of various methods of dMRI, high angular
resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is known to excel in its ability to
provide reliable information about the local orientations of neural fasciculi
(aka fibre tracts). Moreover, as opposed to the more traditional diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI), HARDI is capable of distinguishing the orientations of
multiple fibres passing through a given spatial voxel. Unfortunately, the
ability of HARDI to discriminate between neural fibres that cross each other at
acute angles is always limited, which is the main reason behind the development
of numerous post-processing tools, aiming at the improvement of the directional
resolution of HARDI. Among such tools is spherical deconvolution (SD). Due to
its ill-posed nature, however, SD standardly relies on a number of a priori
assumptions which are to render its results unique and stable. In this paper,
we propose a different approach to the problem of SD in HARDI, which accounts
for the spatial continuity of neural fibres as well as the presence of
isotropic diffusion. Subsequently, we demonstrate how the proposed solution can
be used to successfully overcome the effect of partial voluming, while
preserving the spatial coherency of cerebral diffusion at moderate-to-severe
noise levels. In a series of both in silico and in vivo experiments, the
performance of the proposed method is compared with that of several available
alternatives, with the comparative results clearly supporting the viability and
usefulness of our approach.

enhanced diffuse X-ray emission to the projected distances beyond r_{200} radii
of these two clusters. The large-scale X-ray emission is consistent with being
azimuthally symmetric at the projected radii of the QSO (0.36 and 0.8 times the

de-projected temperature and density profiles of the X-ray-emitting gas.
Excluding the cool cores that are detected, we find that the mean temperature
of the hot gas is about 4.0 keV for Abell 2246 and 5.5 keV for GMBCG

purely gravitational hierarchical structure formation. This comparison shows
that the ICM in the outer region of the clusters is likely in a clumpy and

$k$-forcing number of $G$, denoted $F_k(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices
that need to be initially colored so that all vertices eventually become
colored during the discrete dynamical process described by the following rule.
Starting from an initial set of colored vertices and stopping when all vertices
are colored: if a colored vertex has at most $k$ non-colored neighbors, then
each of its non-colored neighbors becomes colored. When $k=1$, this is
equivalent to the zero forcing number, usually denoted with $Z(G)$, a recently
introduced invariant that gives an upper bound on the maximum nullity of a
graph. In this paper, we give several upper bounds on the $k$-forcing number.
Notable among these, we show that if $G$ is a graph with order $n \ge 2$ and
maximum degree $\Delta \ge k$, then $F_k(G) \le \frac{(\Delta-k+1)n}{\Delta - k
+ 1 +\min{\{\delta,k\}}}$. This simplifies to, for the zero forcing number case
of $k=1$, $Z(G)=F_1(G) \le \frac{\Delta n}{\Delta+1}$. Moreover, when $\Delta
\ge 2$ and the graph is $k$-connected, we prove that $F_k(G) \leq
\frac{(\Delta-2)n+2}{\Delta+k-2}$, which is an improvement when $k\leq 2$, and
specializes to, for the zero forcing number case, $Z(G)= F_1(G) \le
\frac{(\Delta -2)n+2}{\Delta -1}$. These results resolve a problem posed by
Meyer about regular bipartite circulant graphs. Finally, we present a
relationship between the $k$-forcing number and the connected $k$-domination
number. As a corollary, we find that the sum of the zero forcing number and
connected domination number is at most the order for connected graphs.

  Problem","14 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables",,,,"math.OC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Designing efficient car parking mechanisms that can be potentially integrated
into future intelligent transportation systems is of crucial importance.
Usually, the related design problems are combinatorial and the worst-case
complexity of optimal solution approaches grows exponentially with the problem
sizes. Therefore, such optimal approaches are not scalable and practically
undesirable. As a result, almost all existing methods for parking slot
assignment are simple and greedy approaches, where each car is assigned a free
parking slot, which is closer to its destination. Moreover, no emphasis is
placed to optimize the social benefit of the users during the parking slot
assignment. In this paper, the fairness as a metric for modeling the aggregate
social benefit of the users is considered and a distributed algorithm based on
Lagrange duality theory is developed. The proposed algorithm is gracefully
scalable compared to the optimal methods. In addition, it is shown that the
proposed car parking mechanism preserves privacy in the sense that any car
involved in the algorithm will not be able to discover the destination of any
other car during the algorithm iterations. Numerical results illustrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the optimal assignment and a
greedy method. They show that our algorithm yields a good tradeoff between the
implementation-level simplicity and the performance. Even though the main
emphasis in this paper resides in the car parking slot assignment problem, our
formulation and the algorithms, in general, can also be applied or adopted in
fair agent-target assignment problems in other application domains.

hyper-differential filter as a means of increasing the accuracy of the AD-LES
model without increasing the computational cost. Box filters, Pad\'{e} filters,
and differential filters with a wide range of parameters are studied in the
AD-LES framework. The AD-LES model, in conjunction with these spatial filters,
is tested in the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional Taylor-Green
vortex problem. The numerical results are benchmarked against direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data. An under-resolved numerical simulation is also used for
comparison purposes. Four criteria are used to investigate the AD-LES model
equipped with these spatial filters: (i) the time series of the volume-averaged
enstrophy; (ii) the volume-averaged third-order structure function; (iii) the
$L^2$-norm of the velocity and vorticity errors; and (iv) the volume-averaged
velocity and vorticity correlation coefficients. According to these criteria,
the numerical results yield the following two conclusions: first, the AD-LES
model equipped with any of these spatial filters yields accurate results at a
fraction of the computational cost of DNS. Second, the most accurate results
are obtained with the hyper-differential filter, followed by the differential
filter. We demonstrate that the results highly depend on the selection of the
filtering procedure. Although a careful parameter choice makes each class of
filters used in this study competitive, it seems that filters whose transfer
function resembles that of the Fourier cut-off filter (such as the
hyper-differential filters) tend to perform best.

broadcast channel (BC) with rate-limited feedback from one or both receivers.
They improve over the nofeedback capacity region for a large class of channels,
including the class of \emph{strictly essentially less-noisy BCs} that we
introduce in this article. Examples of strictly essentially less-noisy BCs are
the binary symmetric BC (BSBC) or the binary erasure BC (BEBC) with unequal
cross-over or erasure probabilities at the two receivers. When the feedback
rates are sufficiently large, our schemes recover all previously known capacity
results for discrete memoryless BCs with feedback.
  In both our schemes, we let the receivers feed back quantization messages
about their receive signals. In the first scheme, the transmitter simply
\emph{relays} the quantization information obtained from Receiver 1 to Receiver
2, and vice versa. This provides each receiver with a second observation of the
input signal and can thus improve its decoding performance unless the BC is
physically degraded. Moreover, each receiver uses its knowledge of the
quantization message describing its own outputs so as to attain the same
performance as if this message had not been transmitted at all.
  In our second scheme the transmitter first \emph{reconstructs and processes}
the quantized output signals, and then sends the outcome as a common update
information to both receivers. A special case of our second scheme applies also
to memoryless BCs without feedback but with strictly-causal state-information
at the transmitter and causal state-information at the receivers. It recovers
all previous achievable regions also for this setup with state-information.

linear waves in its wake. In a dc current-biased Josephson-junction (JJ) array
these manifest as electromagnetic (EM) waves excited by a (magnetic field
induced) chain of propagating magnetic vortices. When the vortex velocity and
the phase velocity of one of the excited EM waves match, phase-locking occurs.
This produces resonant steps in the current-voltage characteristics where
amplification of EM radiation occurs. We report the first observation of
phase-locking-induced amplification of EM radiation at 77K and above in JJ
arrays made of high temperature superconductors.

neural network (FNN) learning system which randomly assigns the connections
with and within hidden neurons in the first stage and tunes the connections
with output neurons in the second stage. Therefore, ELM training is essentially
a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational
burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction
does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that
whether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical
feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part
on this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation
function, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation
sense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show
that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one
hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of
ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically
justify that there also exists an activation function such that the
corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we
prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is
essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use
of ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the
well-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the
generalization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential
characteristic of ELM and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.

in consecutive cooperative learning. Taking consecutive course projects of
software engineering in a university as examples, we examine the relation
between team stability and learning performance in consecutive cooperative
learning from two parts: learning score and learning satisfaction. Through
empirical analysis, it arrives at the conclusion that learning score is in weak
positive correlation with team stability. Through questionnaire and interviews,
it finds out 78% of the students did not value the importance of team
stability, and 67% of the teachers never recommend the students to keep stable
teams. Finally, we put forward an expected correlation model of learning
performance as future work and discuss instability as well.

studied using models of the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
(KPZ) classes during their growth regimes in dimensions $d=1$ and $d=2$.
Scaling arguments and simulation results are combined to predict the relaxation
of the difference in the roughness of the perturbed and the unperturbed
interfaces, $\Delta W^2 \sim s^c t^{-\gamma}$, where $s$ is the time of the
change and $t>s$ is the observation time after that event. The previous
analytical solution for the EW-EW changes is reviewed and numerically discussed
in the context of lattice models, with possible decays with $\gamma=3/2$ and
$\gamma=1/2$. Assuming the dominant contribution to $\Delta W^2$ to be
predicted from a time shift in the final growth dynamics, the scaling of
KPZ-KPZ changes with $\gamma = 1-2\beta$ and $c=2\beta$ is predicted, where
$\beta$ is the growth exponent. Good agreement with simulation results in $d=1$
and $d=2$ is observed. A relation with the relaxation of a local autoresponse
function in $d=1$ cannot be discarded, but very different exponents are shown
in $d=2$. We also consider changes between different dynamics, with the KPZ-EW
as a special case in which a faster growth, with dynamical exponent $z_i$,
changes to a slower one, with exponent $z$. A scaling approach predicts a
crossover time $t_c\sim s^{z/z_i}\gg s$ and $\Delta W^2 \sim s^c F\left(
t/t_c\right)$, with the decay exponent $\gamma=1/2$ of the EW class. This rules
out the simplified time shift hypothesis in $d=2$ dimensions. These results
help to understand the remarkable differences in EW smoothing of correlated and
uncorrelated surfaces, and the approach may be extended to sudden changes
between other growth dynamics.

quasi-category of algebras for a homotopy coherent monad could be described as
a weighted limit with projective cofibrant weight, so these results immediately

for a well known theorem which shows that limits lift to the category of
algebras for any monad, regardless of whether its functor part preserves those
limits. The second half of this paper establishes this more general result in
the quasi-categorical setting: showing that the monadic forgetful functor of
the quasi-category of algebras for a homotopy coherent monad creates all limits
that exist in the base quasi-category, without further assumption on the monad.
This proof relies upon a more delicate and explicit analysis of the particular

described by the metric tensor $g$ and the Ricci tensor $S$ of type $(0, 2)$
whereas the energy momentum tensor of type $(0,2)$ describes the physical
contents of the spacetime. Einstein's field equations relate $g$, $S$ and the
energy momentum tensor and describe the geometry and physical contents of the
spacetime. By solving Einstein's field equations for empty spacetime (i.e. $S =
0$) for a non-static spacetime metric, one can obtain the interior black hole
solution, known as the interior black hole spacetime which infers that a
remarkable change occurs in the nature of the spacetime, namely, the external
spatial radial and temporal coordinates exchange their characters to temporal
and spatial coordinates, respectively, and hence the interior black hole
spacetime is a non-static one as the metric coefficients are time dependent.
For the sake of mathematical generalizations, in the literature, there are many
rigorous geometric structures constructed by imposing the restrictions to the
curvature tensor of the space involving first order and second order covariant
differentials of the curvature tensor. Hence a natural question arises that
which geometric structures are admitted by the interior black hole metric. The
main aim of this paper is to provide the answer of this question so that the
geometric structures admitting by such a metric can be interpreted physically.

changes of the surface abundances of EMP stars by the accretion of interstellar
matter (ISM). We also consider metal-enrichment of intergalactic medium (IGM)
by galactic winds and the resultant pre-enrichment of proto-galaxies. The trend
and scatter of the observed r-process abundances are well reproduced by our
hierarchical model with $\sim 10\%$ of core-collapse supernovae in low-mass end
($\sim 10M_{\odot}$) as a dominant r-process source and the star formation
efficiency of $\sim 10^{-10} \hbox{yr}^{-1}$. For neutron star mergers as an
r-process source, their coalescence timescale has to be $ \sim 10^7$yrs, and
the event rates $\sim 100$ times larger than currently observed in the Galaxy.
We find that the accretion of ISM is a dominant source of r-process elements

presented amplitudes constitute several of the largest atomic parity-violating
signals predicted so far. Experiments using these systems may be performed to
determine values for the nuclear anapole moment, a P-odd T-even nuclear moment
given rise to by parity-violating nuclear forces. Such measurements may prove
to be valuable tools in the study of parity violation in the hadron sector. The
considered spin-independent transitions could also be used to measure the ratio
of weak charges for different isotopes of the same atom, the results of which
would serve as a test of the standard model and also of neutron distributions.
Barium, with seven stable isotopes, is particularly promising in this regard.

Weyl groups.
  For the former, we obtain a refinement of Brenti's $q$-Eulerian polynomials
of type $D$, and then show that these refined Eulerian polynomials satisfy
certain recurrence relation. By using the Routh--Hurwitz theory and the
recurrence relation, we prove that these polynomials form a mutually

For $q=1$, our result reduces to the real-rootedness of the Eulerian
polynomials of type $D$, which were originally conjectured by Brenti and
recently proved by Savage and Visontai.
  For the latter, we introduce a family of polynomials based on Savage and

naturally described in terms of finite and invariant canonical geometric
objects. Consequently, one can write field equations which are equivalent to
Einstein's at non-singular points, but in addition remain well-defined and
smooth at singularities. The black hole singularities appear to be less
undesirable than it was thought, especially after we remove the part of the
singularity due to the coordinate system. Black hole singularities are then
compatible with global hyperbolicity, and don't make the evolution equations
break down, when these are expressed in terms of the appropriate variables. The
charged black holes turn out to have smooth potential and electromagnetic
fields in the new atlas. Classical charged particles can be modeled, in General
Relativity, as charged black hole solutions. Since black hole singularities are
accompanied by dimensional reduction, this should affect Feynman's path
integrals. Therefore, it is expected that singularities induce dimensional
reduction effects in Quantum Gravity. These dimensional reduction effects are
very similar to those postulated in some approaches to making Quantum Gravity
perturbatively renormalizable. This may provide a way to test indirectly the
effects of singularities, otherwise inaccessible.

realized above the metallic phase around the isotropic point. In general, this
spin liquid state, continuously connected with the metallic state, changes to a
magnetic state as the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ increases, but it persists
up to large $U$ limit in a small window between 120$^\circ$ N\'eel and
collinear phases. For very large $U$ another spin liquid state, separated from
the metallic state by magnetic states, emerges around a narrow region where
both N\'eel and 120$^\circ$ N\'eel orderings are highly suppressed due to the

variety of binary-lens systems, as the binarity of the lens introduces
deviations from the typical (single-lens) Paczy\'nski behaviour in the event

light curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an
oversimplified model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the
binary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are
fitted well by a Paczy\'nski curve. We show that an accurate timing analysis of
the residuals (calculated with respect to the best-fitting Paczy\'nski model)
is usually sufficient to infer the orbital period of the binary lens. It goes
without saying that the independently estimated period may be used to further
constrain the orbital parameters obtained by the best-fitting procedure, which
often gives degenerate solutions. We also present a preliminary analysis of the
event OGLE-2011-BLG-1127 / MOA-2011-BLG-322, which has been recognized to be
the result of a binary lens. The period analysis results in a periodicity of
\simeq 12 days, which confirms the oscillation of the observed data around the
best-fitting model. The estimated periodicity is probably associated with an
intrinsic variability of the source star, and therefore there is an opportunity
to use this technique to investigate either the intrinsic variability of the
source or the effects induced by the binary-lens orbital motion.

(DFT) in the local density approximation and dynamical mean-field theory

state of iron is 2, the formal valence of Fe in KFe2As2 is 2.5, corresponding
to an effective doping with 0.5 hole per iron atom compared to, for example,
BaFe2As2. This shifts the chemical potential and thereby reduces the distance
between the peaks in the spectral functions of KFe2As2 and the Fermi energy as
compared to BaFe2As2. The shift, which is clearly seen on the level of DFT as
well as in DMFT, is further enhanced by the strong electronic correlations in
KFe2As2. In BaFe2As2 the presence of these peaks results [Phys. Rev. B 86,
125124 (2012)] in a temperature increase of the susceptibility up to a maximum
at ~1000 K. While the temperature increase was observed experimentally the
decrease at even higher temperatures is outside the range of experimental
observability. We predict that in KFe2As2 the situation is different. Namely,
the reduction of the distance between the peaks and the Fermi level due to
doping is expected to shift the maximum in the susceptibility to much lower
temperatures, such that the decrease of the susceptibility should become
visible in experiment.

be different from that of the gluino. These features are explicitly checked

terms of friction drops and kinetic energy release associated with frictional
weakening events. We find that larger vibration amplitude induces larger
frictional weakening events. The results show evidence of a threshold below
which no induced frictional weakening takes place. Friction drop size is found
to be dependent on the shear stress at the time of vibration. A significant
increase in the ratio between the number of slipping contacts to the number of
sticking contacts in the granular layer is observed for large vibration
amplitudes. These vibration-induced contact rearrangements enhance particle
mobilization and induces a friction drop and kinetic energy release. This

Logic as a Programming Language} was a breakthrough for the use of logic in
computer science. It introduced two fundamental ideas: on the declarative side,
the use of the Horn clause logic fragment of classical logic, which was soon
extended with negation as failure, on the procedural side the procedural
interpretation which made it possible to write algorithms in the formalism.
  Since then, strong progress was made both on the declarative understanding of
the logic programming formalism and in automated reasoning technologies,
particularly in SAT solving, Constraint Programming and Answer Set Programming.
This has paved the way for the development of an extension of logic programming
that embodies a more pure view of logic as a modelling language and its role
for problem solving.
  In this paper, we present the \idp language and system. The language is
essentially classical logic extended with one of logic programmings most
important contributions to knowledge representation: the representation of
complex definitions as rule sets under well-founded semantics. The system is a
knowledge base system: a system in which complex declarative information is
stored in a knowledge base which can be used to solve different computational
problems by applying multiple forms of inference. In this view, theories are
declarative modellings, bags of information, descriptions of possible states of
affairs. They are neither procedures nor descriptions of computational
problems. As such, the \idp language and system preserve the fundamental idea
of a declarative reading of logic programs, while they break with the
fundamental idea of the procedural interpretation of logic programs.

strength of these new terms scales with the mass of the system, they become
dominant at the macroscopic level, making sure that wave functions of

exactly the same stability function, therefore sharing the same stability
properties that turn out to be optimum. Their respective accuracy however
differs significantly and depends on the physical situation involved. In order
to test this accuracy, we use a predictor-corrector scheme in which the
predictor is either Fatunla's or Arnoldi's algorithm and the corrector, a fully
implicit four-stage Radau IIA method of order 7. We consider two physical
processes. The first one is the ionization of an atomic system by a short and
intense electromagnetic pulse; the atomic systems include a one-dimensional
Gaussian model potential as well as atomic hydrogen and helium, both in full
dimensionality. The second process is the decoherence of two-electron quantum
states when a time independent perturbation is applied to a planar two-electron
quantum dot where both electrons are confined in an anharmonic potential. Even
though the Hamiltonian of this system is time independent the corresponding
differential equation shows a striking stiffness. For the one-dimensional
Gaussian potential we discuss in detail the possibility of monitoring the time
step for both explicit algorithms. In the other physical situations that are
much more demanding in term of computations, we show that the accuracy of both
algorithms depends strongly on the degree of stiffness of the problem.

to be fragments of crust of differentiated objects. Most V-type asteroids in
the main belt are found in the inner main belt, and are either current members
of the Vesta dynamical family (Vestoids), or past members that drifted away.
However, several V-type photometric candidates have been recently identified in
the central and outer main belt.
  The origin of this large population of V-type objects is not well understood.
Since it seems unlikely that Vestoids crossing the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonance
with Jupiter could account for the whole population of V-type asteroids in the
central and outer main belt, origin from local sources, such as the parent
bodies of the Eunomia, and of the Merxia and Agnia asteroid families, has been
proposed as an alternative mechanism.
  In this work we investigated the dynamical evolution of the V-type
photometric candidates in the central main belt, under the effect of
gravitational and non-gravitational forces. Our results show that dynamical
evolution from the parent bodies of the Eunomia and Merxia/Agnia families on
timescales of 2 Byr or more could be responsible for the current orbital
location of most of the low-inclined V-type asteroids.

the framework with the learning subroutine being restricted as a binary

bound on the PAA query complexity of SAC algorithms. We further compare SAC
algorithms with the uniform search in different situations. Under the
error-target independence condition, we show that SAC algorithms can achieve
polynomial speedup to the uniform search, but not super-polynomial speedup.
Under the one-side-error condition, we show that super-polynomial speedup can
be achieved. This work only touches the surface of the framework. Its power
under other conditions is still open.

spectral window around 530 nm. The RPL dose response was found to be linear up
to 50 kGy and sublinear in the range of 50 kGy to 1 MGy for MCP detectors and
linear up to 3 kGy and next sublinear in the range from 5 kGy to 1 MGy for MTS

higher than 100 kGy. The observed differences between MCP and MTS may suggest,
that the RPL effect in LiF is not entirely governed by intrinsic defects (F2

the non-destructive character of the RPL measurement, it is suggested to apply
combined RPL/TL readouts, what should improve accuracy of high-dose dosimetry.

realistically operational networks. The Fluid network model, for which the
interfering BS are replaced by a continuum of infinitesimal interferers, allows
to establish closed-form formula for the SINR (Signal on Interference plus

The two models establish very close results. As a consequence, the Fluid
network model can be used to analyze hexagonal networks. In this paper, we show
that the Fluid network model can also be used to analyze Poisson networks.
Therefore, the analysis of performance and quality of service becomes very

an error threshold, below which quantum information is protected, without

high scalability. Furthermore, since the engineered dissipative dynamics we

encoded video streams to mobile users sharing a common wireless resource. Video
quality fairness, as well as similar delivery delays are targeted among
streams. The proposed controller is implemented within some aggregator located
near the bottleneck of the network. The transmission rate among streams is
adapted based on the quality of the already encoded and buffered packets in the
aggregator. Encoding rate targets are evaluated by the aggregator and fed back
to each remote video server (fully centralized solution), or directly evaluated
by each server in a distributed way (partially distributed solution). Each
encoding rate target is adjusted for each stream independently based on the
corresponding buffer level or buffering delay in the aggregator. Communication
delays between the servers and the aggregator are taken into account. The
transmission and encoding rate control problems are studied with a
control-theoretic perspective. The system is described with a multi-input
multi-output model. Proportional Integral (PI) controllers are used to adjust
the video quality and control the aggregator buffer levels. The system
equilibrium and stability properties are studied. This provides guidelines for
choosing the parameters of the PI controllers. Experimental results show the
convergence of the proposed control system and demonstrate the improvement in
video quality fairness compared to a classical transmission rate fair streaming
solution and to a utility max-min fair approach.

expects that only the parton distributions at the soft scale should affect the
results. The other effects of the parton distributions should have cancelled.
This means that the kernels for parton evolution should be related to the
shower splitting functions. If the initial state partons can have non-zero
masses, this requires that the evolution kernels cannot be the usual MSbar
kernels. We work out what the parton evolution kernels should be to match the
shower evolution contained in the parton shower event generator Deductor, in
which the b and c quarks have non-zero masses.

which named XAUI0 and XAUI1. The former works as the main channel while the
latter redundant channel. When XAUI0 is out of service for some reasons, XAUI1
will start to work to keep the business. (3) RTL (Register Transfer Level)

connect the ALTGX_RECO?FIG with the ALTGX instances. After RTL coding, the

regions is a central topic in star formation research. Chemistry is employed as
a unique tool 1) to investigate the underlying physical processes and 2) to
characterize the evolution of the chemical composition. We observed a sample of
59 high-mass star-forming regions at different evolutionary stages varying from
the early starless phase of infrared dark clouds to high-mass protostellar
objects to hot molecular cores and, finally, ultra-compact HII regions at 1mm
and 3mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. We determined their large-scale chemical
abundances and found that the chemical composition evolves along with the
evolutionary stages. On average, the molecular abundances increase with time.
We modeled the chemical evolution, using a 1D physical model where density and
temperature vary from stage to stage coupled with an advanced gas-grain
chemical model and derived the best-fit chi^2 values of all relevant
parameters. A satisfying overall agreement between observed and modeled column
densities for most of the molecules was obtained. With the best-fit model we
also derived a chemical age for each stage, which gives the timescales for the
transformation between two consecutive stages. The best-fit chemical ages are
~10,000 years for the IRDC stage, ~60,000 years for the HMPO stage, ~40,000
years for the HMC stage, and ~10,000 years for the UCHII stage. The total
chemical timescale for the entire evolutionary sequence of the high-mass star
formation process is on the order of 10^5 years, which is consistent with
theoretical estimates. Furthermore, based on the approach of a multiple-line
survey of unresolved data, we were able to constrain an intuitive and
reasonable physical and chemical model. The results of this study can be used
as chemical templates for the different evolutionary stages in high-mass star
formation.

partition of N into connected subsets, that maximises the sum of the components
values. This problem is generally NP-complete; in particular, it is hard for a
defined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected
members - that is, two nodes have no effect on each other's marginal

provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general

solving corresponding instances of the problem. Furthermore, we derive linear

remains NP-complete for planar graphs, and hence, for any K_k minor free graphs

a coalition structure generation problem over a planar graph with O(m^2) nodes.
Importantly, our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation

set up an exercise regime that can be adhered to irrespective of the weather

process of assisted training or doing rehabilitation exercise through treadmill
is referred to as treadmill therapy. A modern treadmill is an automated machine

today are one dimensional and user can only walk in one direction. This paper
presents the idea of using omnidirectional treadmills which will be more
appealing to the patients as they can walk in any direction, hence encouraging
them to do exercises more frequently. This paper proposes a fuzzy control

and calculate the decay widths of the $B_1(5721)$, $B_2(5747)$, $B_{s1}(5830)$,
$B_{s2}(5840)$ and $B(5970)$, which can be confronted with the experimental
data in the future.

Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, then its one-dimensional projection has
positive Lebesgue measure for almost-all directions. In this article, we show
that if $M$ is a simply connected surface with non-positive curvature, then
Marstrand's theorem is still valid.

  Constant of Motion","6 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of the construction of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structures
starting from two first order equations of motion is presented. This new
approach requires the knowledge of one (time independent) constant of motion
for the dynamical system only. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures are
constructed, the Hamilton Jacobi equation is then written and solved and the
second (time dependent) constant of the motion for the problem is explicitly
exhibited.

any odd number of tokens to reach a stable state where exactly one token
remains. McIver and Morgan conjecture that the expected time taken for
stabilisation is maximised when there are three equally-spaced tokens. We prove
exact results on a related cost function, and obtain a bound on expected time
which is very close to the conjectured bound.
