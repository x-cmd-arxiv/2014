from those emitted by conduction band electrons, which can be achieved in an
elegant way by ultrafast techniques. Separating the electronic from the

assumed to be primarily due to heating during the decay phase. The decay phase
heating necessary to account for the discrepancy is quantified and found be
~50% of the total thermally radiated energy as calculated with GOES. This decay
phase heating is found to scale with the observed peak thermal energy. It is
predicted that approximating the total thermal energy from the peak is
minimally affected by the decay phase heating in small flares. However, in the

several times greater than the peak thermal energy.

a per-database manner (rather than taking the worst case), and ones that do not
depend on the payments made to players (which might not be observable to an
adversary). To bypass this impossibility result, we study a natural special
setting where individuals have mono- tonic privacy valuations, which captures
common contexts where certain values for private data are expected to lead to
higher valuations for privacy (e.g. having a particular disease). We give new
mech- anisms that are individually rational for all players with monotonic
privacy valuations, truthful for all players whose privacy valuations are not
too large, and accurate if there are not too many players with too-large
privacy valuations. We also prove matching lower bounds showing that in some
respects our mechanism cannot be improved significantly.

sub-mm galaxies amplified by foreground structures confirm that the
cross-correlation is explained by weak gravitational lensing ($\mu<2$). The
simulations also show that the measured amplitude and range of angular scales
of the signal are larger than can be accounted for by galaxy-galaxy weak
lensing. However, for scales $\lesssim 2\,$arcmin, the signal can be reproduced
if SDSS/GAMA galaxies act as signposts of galaxy groups/clusters with halo

emission measure) peak temperatures determined with AIA with those determined
by GOES and RHESSI using the isothermal assumption. In a set of 149 M- and
X-class flares observed during the first two years of the SDO mission, AIA
finds DEM peak temperatures at the time of the peak GOES 1-8 A flux to have an
average of Tp = 12.0+/-2.9 MK and Gaussian DEM widths of log10(sigma_T) =
0.50+/-0.13. From GOES observations of the same 149 events, a mean temperature
of Tp = 15.6+/-2.4 MK is inferred, which is systematically higher by a factor
of TGOES/TAIA = 1.4+/-0.4. We demonstrate that this discrepancy results from
the isothermal assumption in the inversion of the GOES filter ratio. From
isothermal fits to photon spectra at energies of E ~ 6-12 keV of 61 of these
events, RHESSI finds the temperature to be higher still by a factor of
TRHESSI/TAIA = 1.9+/-1.0. We find that this is partly a consequence of the
isothermal assumption. However, RHESSI is not sensitive to the low-temperature
range of the DEM peak, and thus RHESSI samples only the high-temperature tail
of the DEM function. This can also contribute to the discrepancy between AIA
and RHESSI temperatures. The higher flare temperatures found by GOES and RHESSI
imply correspondingly lower emission measures. We conclude that self-consistent
flare DEM temperatures and emission measures require simultaneous fitting of
EUV (AIA) and soft X-ray (GOES and RHESSI) fluxes.

and P for a pseudoscalar meson) for different particles virtualities remains a
challenge for the theory of strong interactions. While their chiral limit is
well understood, recent measurements of the gamma^* omega pi^0 and gamma^*
gamma pi^0 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the
simplest scaling behavior suggested by QCD. Here we attempt to describe them in
their whole measured energy regimes within the Resonance Chiral Theory, a
framework which naturally incorporates the chiral limit constraints and extends
to higher energies by including the resonances as active fields.
  Specifically, we obtained an accurate description of the data up to 2 GeV on
the former form factor by including three multiplets of vector resonances. Good
agreement with measurements of the latter was possible even in the single
resonance approximation, although we propose to measure the e^+e^- to
mu^+mu^-pi^0 cross-section and di-muon invariant mass distribution to better
characterize this form factor. We have then evaluated the pion exchange
contribution to the muon g-2 obtaining (6.66\pm0.21)x10^{-10} with an accurate
determination of the errors. We have also recalled that approximating the whole
pion exchange by the pion pole contribution underestimates the corresponding
result for the anomaly (by (15,20)%). Based on these results, we have predicted
the eta^(\prime) transition form factors obtaining good agreement with data and
obtained their respective contributions to the muon anomaly. In this way, the
contribution of the three lightest pseudoscalars to it yields
(10.47\pm0.54)x10^{-10}, in agreement with previous evaluations but with
smaller error.

appropriate sign of helicity can compensate the Faraday depolarization
resulting from the superposition of Faraday-rotated polarization planes from a
spatially extended source. For radio emission from a helical magnetic field,
the polarization as a function of the square of the wavelength becomes
asymmetric with respect to zero. Mathematically speaking, the resulting
emission occurs then either at observable or at unobservable (imaginary)
wavelengths. We demonstrate that rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows for the
reconstruction of the underlying Faraday dispersion function in the former
case, but not in the latter. The presence of positive magnetic helicity can
thus be detected by observing positive RM in highly polarized regions in the
sky and negative RM in weakly polarized regions. Conversely, negative magnetic
helicity can be detected by observing negative RM in highly polarized regions
and positive RM in weakly polarized regions. The simultaneous presence of two
magnetic constituents with opposite signs of helicity is shown to possess
signatures that can be quantified through polarization peaks at specific
wavelengths and the gradient of the phase of the Faraday dispersion function.
Similar polarization peaks can tentatively also be identified for the
bi-helical magnetic fields that are generated self-consistently by a dynamo
from helically forced turbulence, even though the magnetic energy spectrum is
then continuous. Finally, we discuss the possibility of detecting magnetic
fields with helical and non-helical properties in external galaxies using the

probabilistic learning using sampling-based algorithms and (2) loss-specific
training based on MAP estimate. After investigating existing training
approaches, it turns out that the performance of the loss-specific training has
been significantly underestimated in existing work. In this paper, we revisit
this approach and use techniques from bi-level optimization to solve it. We
show that we can get a substantial gain in the final performance by solving the

eighty lenses and large number of source positions in each case. The influence
of the lens neighbourhood and the line of sight introduces the spread into the

set of descriptive supporting points, which allow for an accurate
reconstruction of the original image. It turns out in practice that this is a
challenging problem even for the simplest Laplacian interpolation model. In
this paper, we revisit the Laplacian interpolation compression model and
introduce two fast algorithms, namely successive preconditioning primal dual
algorithm and the recently proposed iPiano algorithm, to solve this problem
efficiently. Furthermore, we extend the Laplacian interpolation based
compression model to a more general form, which is based on principles from
bi-level optimization. We investigate two different variants of the Laplacian
model, namely biharmonic interpolation and smoothed Total Variation
regularization. Our numerical results show that significant improvements can be
obtained from the biharmonic interpolation model, and it can recover an image
with very high quality from only 5% pixels.

fueling and feedback phenomena. NGC 1566 has a nuclear bar of 1.7 kpc radius
and a conspicuous grand design spiral starting from this radius. The ALMA field
of view, of diameter 0.9 kpc, lies well inside the nuclear bar and reveals a
molecular trailing spiral structure from 50 to 300~pc in size, which is
contributing to fuel the nucleus, according to its negative gravity torques.
  The spiral starts with a large pitch angle from the center and then winds up
in a pseudo-ring at the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the nuclear bar.
  This is the first time that a trailing spiral structure is clearly seen
driving the gas inwards inside the ILR ring of the nuclear bar. This phenomenon
shows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influence
on the gas, triggering its fueling.
  The gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen through
extinction in HST images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mm
continuum. This continuum emission must come essentially from cold dust heated
by the interstellar radiation field. The HCN(4-3) and HCO+(4-3) lines were
simultaneously mapped and detected in the nuclear spiral. The HCO+(4-3) line is
3 times stronger than the HCN(4-3), as expected when star formation excitation
dominates over active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating. The CO(3-2)/HCO+(4-3)
integrated intensity ratio is \sim 100.
  The molecular gas is in remarkably regular rotation, with only slight
non-circular motions at the periphery of the nuclear spiral arms. These
perturbations are quite small, and no outflow nor AGN feedback is detected.

complement to traditional univariate methods of analyzing neuroimaging data. We
propose to replace the standard 'decoding' approach to searchlight-based MVPA,
measuring the performance of a classifier by its accuracy, with a method based
on the multivariate form of the general linear model. Following the
well-established methodology of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), we
define a measure that directly characterizes the structure of multi-voxel data,
the pattern distinctness $D$. Our measure is related to standard multivariate
statistics, but we apply cross-validation to obtain an unbiased estimate of its
population value, independent of the amount of data or its partitioning into
'training' and 'test' sets. The estimate $\hat D$ can therefore serve not only
as a test statistic, but as an interpretable measure of multivariate effect
size. The pattern distinctness generalizes the Mahalanobis distance to an
arbitrary number of classes, but also the case where there are no classes of
trials because the design is described by parametric regressors. It is defined
for arbitrary estimable contrasts, including main effects (pattern differences)
and interactions (pattern changes). In this way, our approach makes the full
analytical power of complex factorial designs known from univariate fMRI
analyses available to MVPA studies. Moreover, we show how the results of a
factorial analysis can be used to obtain a measure of pattern stability, the
equivalent of 'cross-decoding'.

properties. First, the number of variables grows linearly with the input size.
Second, the objective function is linear in the input parameters and the

These properties imply that, once a feasible point is found, the computation of
a lower bound on the communication cost in any two-party process is linearly
complex. The studied scenario goes beyond quantum processes and includes the
communication complexity scenario introduced by Yao. We illustrate the method
by analytically deriving some non-trivial lower bounds. Finally, we conjecture

and dissipative torques is important for understanding the planet's spin state.
Dissipation results from tides and viscous, magnetic and topographic
core--mantle interactions. The dissipative core--mantle torques take the system
to an equilibrium state wherein both spins are fixed in the frame precessing
with the orbit, and in which the mantle and core are differentially rotating.
This equilibrium exhibits a mantle spin axis that is offset from the Cassini
state by larger amounts for weaker core--mantle coupling for all three
dissipative core--mantle coupling mechanisms, and the spin axis of the core is
separated farther from that of the mantle, leading to larger differential
rotation. The relatively strong core--mantle coupling necessary to bring the
mantle spin axis to its observed position close to the Cassini state is not
obtained by any of the three dissipative core--mantle coupling mechanisms. For
a hydrostatic ellipsoidal core--mantle boundary, pressure coupling dominates
the dissipative effects on the mantle and core positions, and dissipation
together with pressure coupling brings the mantle spin solidly to the Cassini
state. The core spin goes to a position displaced from that of the mantle by
about 3.55 arcmin nearly in the plane containing the Cassini state. With the
maximum viscosity considered of $\nu\sim 15.0\,{\rm cm^2/s}$ if the coupling is
by the circulation through an Ekman boundary layer or $\nu\sim 8.75\times
10^5\,{\rm cm^2/s}$ for purely viscous coupling, the core spin lags the
precessing Cassini plane by 23 arcsec, whereas the mantle spin lags by only
0.055 arcsec. Larger, non hydrostatic values of the CMB ellipticity also result
in the mantle spin at the Cassini state, but the core spin is moved closer to
the mantle spin.

appreciable band-gap that depends on the number of layers. Our transport
studies indicate a carrier mobility that reflects its structural anisotropy and
is superior to MoS2. At room temperature, our phosphorene field-effect
transistors with 1.0 um channel length display a high on-current of 194 mA/mm,
a high hole field-effect mobility of 286 cm2/Vs, and an on/off ratio up to 1E4.
We demonstrate the possibility of phosphorene integration by constructing the
first 2D CMOS inverter of phosphorene PMOS and MoS2 NMOS transistors.

that the effective moduli do not surpass the Voigt upper bound. This
particularly implies that, while the geometric constraints among constituents
in a composite can stabilize negative-stiffness phases, the stabilization is
insufficient to allow for extreme overall static elastic moduli (exceeding
those of the constituents). Stronger bounds on the effective elastic moduli of

the regularized maximum likelihood estimation as a convex optimization problem,
which is solved by the primal-dual interior point method. Connections of our
method to large margin classifiers are presented, showing that the large margin

networks (WSNs) consisting of large number of energy-constrained sensor nodes.
Indeed, sensor nodes have different energy budgets assigned to data
transmission at individual nodes. Therefore, without energy-aware transmission
schemes, energy can deplete from sensor nodes with smaller energy budget faster
than from the rest of the sensor nodes in WSNs. This reduces the coverage area
as well as the lifetime of WSNs. Collaborative beamforming (CB) has been
proposed originally to achieve directional gain, however, it also inherently
distributes the corresponding energy consumption over the collaborative sensor
nodes. In fact, CB can be seen as a physical layer solution (versus the media
access control/network layer solution) to balance the lifetimes of individual
sensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the whole WSN. However, the
introduction of energy-aware CB schemes is critical for extending the WSNs
lifetime.
  In this paper, CB with power allocation (CB-PA) is developed to extend the
lifetime of a cluster of collaborative sensor nodes by balancing the individual
sensor node lifetimes. A novel strategy is proposed to utilize the residual
energy information available at each sensor node. It adjusts the energy
consumption rate at each sensor node while achieving the required average
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination. It is a semi-distributed
strategy and it maintains average SNR. Different factors affecting the energy
consumption are studied as well. Simulation results show that CB-PA outperforms
CB with Equal Power Allocation (CB-EPA) in terms of extending the lifetime of a
cluster of collaborative nodes.

however, mainly focused on the mean-field aspects of the virtual exciton
condensate, which ignores the presence of the underlying collective Fermi
liquid excitations. We show that this relationship can be exploited to
systematically derive the coupling of the condensate order-parameter to the
intraband Fermi liquid particle-hole excitations. Surprisingly, we find that
the static susceptibility is negative in the ordered phase when the coupling to
the Fermi liquid collective excitations are included, suggesting that a uniform
condensate of virtual excitons, with or without time reversal breaking, is an

challenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the
election authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board
correctly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even

implementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a
correct service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this
paper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,
motivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a
distributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires
careful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B
modelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design
against an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In
particular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving
correctly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board
distributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or
dishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The
verification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the
bulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a
peered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.

gain bandwidth. We show that the dc gain can be effectively improved by the
negative differential resistance provided by the cross-coupled pair. Contact
resistance is the main obstacle to achieving gain bandwidth products in the
terahertz range. Limitations of the proposed amplifier are identified with its
poor linearity and relatively large Miller capacitance.

aerodynamics research and engineering design. However, traditional sensitivity
analysis methods break down when applied to long-time averaged quantities in
turbulent fluid flow fields, specifically those obtained using high-fidelity
turbulence simulations. This is because of a number of dynamical properties of
turbulent and chaotic fluid flows, most importantly high sensitivity of the
initial value problem, popularly known as the ""butterfly effect"".
  The recently developed least squares shadowing (LSS) method avoids the issues
encountered by traditional sensitivity analysis methods by approximating the
""shadow trajectory"" in phase space, avoiding the high sensitivity of the
initial value problem. The following paper discusses how the least squares
problem associated with LSS is solved. Two methods are presented and are
demonstrated on a simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, a 4th order chaotic partial differential
equation. We find that while LSS computes fairly accurate gradients, faster,
more efficient linear solvers are needed to apply both LSS methods presented in
this paper to larger simulations.

from neutral hydrogen from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Due to their very
low signal-to-noise ratio, these observations aim for a statistical detection
of the signal by measuring its power spectrum. We investigate the extraction of
the variance of the signal as a first step towards detecting and constraining
the global history of the EoR. Signal variance is the integral of the signal's
power spectrum, and it is expected to be measured with a high significance. We
demonstrate this through results from a simulation and parameter estimation
pipeline developed for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-EoR experiment. We show
that LOFAR should be able to detect the EoR in 600 hours of integration using
the variance statistic. Additionally, the redshift ($z_r$) and duration
($\Delta z$) of reionization can be constrained assuming a parametrization. We
use an EoR simulation of $z_r = 7.68$ and $\Delta z = 0.43$ to test the
pipeline. We are able to detect the simulated signal with a significance of 4
standard deviations and extract the EoR parameters as $z_r =
7.72^{+0.37}_{-0.18}$ and $\Delta z = 0.53^{+0.12}_{-0.23}$ in 600 hours,
assuming that systematic errors can be adequately controlled. We further show
that the significance of detection and constraints on EoR parameters can be
improved by measuring the cross-variance of the signal by cross-correlating
consecutive redshift bins.

remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility
of universal quantum computation via magic state distillation. This is a
conceptually satisfying link because contextuality provides one of the
fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena and, moreover,
magic state distillation is the leading model for experimentally realizing
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, this connection suggests a
unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the nonlocality of
quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality and nonlocality is already
known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum
communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work
advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of
practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs
between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust
quantum computation and bounding the overhead cost for the classical simulation
of quantum algorithms.

young stellar clusters, focusing on the role they can play in our understanding
of star and planet formation as a whole. Young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor
clouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density without
forming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final
stellar density. For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the
gas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formation
timescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulated
to high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two
environments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent
density thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of
similar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial
protostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental
properties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests
stellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar
density. We review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on
three key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant
(im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial
protostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a
formation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas
expulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age
spreads much smaller than their mean age. Finally, we show that it is plausible
that metal-rich globular clusters may have formed in a similar way to YMCs in
nearby galaxies. In summary, the study of YMC formation bridges star/planet
formation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the local
Universe. [abridged]

the distribution of the age of variants occurring exactly twice (f2 variants)

older with median ages for haplotypes shared between Europe and Asia ranging
from 320 to 670 generations. The distribution of the ages of f2 haplotypes is
informative about their demography, revealing recent bottlenecks, ancient

of selection in the observation that functional variants are significantly
younger than nonfunctional variants of the same frequency. This approach is
relatively insensitive to mutation rate and complements other nonparametric

Based on the network equivalence framework, this paper presents scalable upper

channel decoupling method is proposed to decompose wireless networks into
decoupled multiple-access channels (MACs) and broadcast channels (BCs). The
upper bounding model, consisting of only point-to-point bit pipes, is
constructed by firstly extending the ""one-shot"" upper bounding models developed

lower bounding model, consisting of both point-to-point and point-to-points bit
pipes, is constructed based on a two-step update of the lower bounding models
to incorporate the broadcast nature of wireless transmission. The main
advantages of the proposed methods are their simplicity and the fact that they
can be extended easily to large networks with a complexity that grows linearly
with the number of nodes. It is demonstrated that the resulting upper and lower

brighter and more variable. Emission during the active state varies over the
course of the orbital period and is redder than the companion star. These
optical/infrared states last for weeks or months. V4641 Sgr spends
approximately 85% of X-ray quiescence in the passive state and 15% in the
active. We analyze passive colors and spectroscopy of V4641 Sgr and show that
they are consistent with a reddened B9III star (with E(B-V) = 0.37 +/- 0.19)
with little or no contribution from the accretion disk. We use X-ray
observations with an updated ephemeris to place an upper limit on the duration
of an X-ray eclipse of <8.3 deg in phase (~1.6 hours). High resolution
spectroscopy yields a greatly improved measurement of the rotational velocity
of the companion star of V_rot_sin(i) = 100.9 +/- 0.8 km s^-1. We fit
ellipsoidal models to the passive state data and find an inclination angle of i
= 72.3 +/- 4.1 deg, a mass ratio of Q = 2.2 +/- 0.2, and component masses for
the system of M_BH = 6.4 +/- 0.6 M_sun and M_2 = 2.9 +/- 0.4 M_sun. Using these
values we calculate an updated distance to V4641 Sgr of 6.2 +/- 0.7 kpc.

N-body models. We compare our maps with the Tight Winding Approximation model
analytical predictions. We see that for all barred models spiral arms rotate
closely to a rigid body manner and the vertex deviation values correlate with
the density peaks position bounded by overdense and underdense regions. In such
cases, vertex deviation sign changes from negative to positive when crossing
the spiral arms in the direction of disk rotation, in regions where the spiral
arms are in between corotation (CR) and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR). By
contrast, when the arm sections are inside the CR and outside the OLR, l$_v$
changes from negative to positive.We propose that measurements of the vertex

the spiral arms. We propose that this technique might exploit future data from
Gaia and APOGEE surveys. For unbarred N-body simulations with spiral arms
corotating with disk material at all radii, our analysis suggests that no clear

quantum probes. In particular, we focus on estimation and discrimination
problems involving the fractal dimension of the trajectories of a system
subject to fractional Brownian noise. We assume that the classical degree of
freedom exposed to the environmental noise is coupled to a quantum degree of
freedom of the same system, e.g. its spin, and exploit quantum limited
measurements on the spin part to characterize the classical fractional noise.
More generally, our approach may be applied to any two-level system subject to
dephasing perturbations described by fractional Brownian noise, in order to
assess the precision of quantum limited measurements in the characterization of
the external noise. In order to assess the performances of quantum probes we
evaluate the Bures metric, as well as the Helstrom and the Chernoff bound, and
optimize their values over the interaction time. We find that quantum probes
may be successfully employed to obtain a reliable characterization of
fractional Gaussian process when the coupling with the environment is weak or
strong. In the first case decoherence is not much detrimental and for long
interaction times the probe acquires information about the environmental
parameters without being too much mixed. Conversely, for strong coupling,
information is quickly impinged on the quantum probe and can effectively
retrieved by measurements performed in the early stage of the evolution. In the
intermediate situation, none of the two above effects take place: information
is flowing from the environment to the probe too slowly compared to
decoherence, and no measurements can be effectively employed to extract it from
the quantum probe. The two regimes of weak- and strong-coupling are defined in
terms of a threshold value of the coupling, which itself increases with the
fractional dimension.

Importantly, we demonstrate that both the deterministic terms necessary to

the stochastic terms necessary to generate the hydrodynamically-correlated

numerically only once per time step. This is accomplished by including a
stochastic contribution to the stress tensor in the fluid equations consistent
with fluctuating hydrodynamics. We develop novel temporal integrators that
account for the multiplicative nature of the noise in the equations of Brownian
dynamics and the strong dependence of the mobility on the configuration for
confined systems. Notably, we propose a random finite difference approach to
approximating the stochastic drift proportional to the divergence of the

shape of $p(C\vert k)$ does collapse with each other, indicating a
nonintermittent cascade. The measured scaling exponent $\zeta_{\omega}^I(q)$ is
linear with the statistical order $q$, i.e., $\zeta_{\omega}^I(q)=-q/3$,

  The measured scaling exponent $\zeta_{\omega}^F(q)$ is nonlinear with $q$ and
can be described very well by a log-Poisson fitting:
$\zeta_{\omega}^F(q)=\frac{1}{3}q+0.45\left(1-0.43^{q}\right)$. However, the
extracted vorticity scaling exponents $\zeta_{\omega}(q)$ for both inverse
energy cascade and forward enstrophy cascade are not consistent with

Fluid Mech. \textbf{140}, 63 (1984)] have found that the autocorrelation
function of velocity increment has a minimum value, whose location is
approximately equal to $\ell$. Taking statistical stationary assumption, we
link the velocity increment and the autocorrelation function with the power
spectrum of the original variable. We then propose an analytical model of the
autocorrelation function. With this model, we prove that the location of the
minimum autocorrelation function is exactly equal to the separation {time}
$\ell$ when the scaling of the power spectrum of the original variable belongs
to the range $0<\beta<2$. This model also suggests a power law expression for
the minimum autocorrelation. Considering the cumulative function of the
autocorrelation function, it is shown that the main contribution to the
autocorrelation function comes from the large scale part. Finally we argue that
the autocorrelation function is a better indicator of the inertial range than
the second order structure function.

toward the circumplanetary disks affects the particle motion through gas drag
force, we use hydrodynamic simulation data for the gas drag term to calculate
the motion of solid materials. We consider wide range of size for the solid
particles ($10^{-2}$-$10^6$m), and find that the accretion efficiency of the
solid particles peaks around 10m-sized particles because energy dissipation of
drag with circum-planetary disk gas in this size regime is most effective. The
efficiency for particles larger than 10m size becomes lower because gas drag
becomes less effective. For particles smaller than 10m, the efficiency is lower
because the particles are strongly coupled with the back-ground gas flow, which
prevent particles from accretion. We also find that the distance from the
planet where the particles are captured by the circumplanetary disks is in a
narrow range and well described as a function of the particle size.

low-temperature physics is described by a fixed point consisting of two leads
coupled to the topological superconductor, and the electrical transport
properties through the point contact at low temperature and low bias are
dominated by the tunneling via the Majorana edge channel. We compute the
temperature dependence of the zero-bias tunneling conductance and study the
full counting statistics for the tunneling current at zero temperature.

oligopoly with strategic producers possessing private information (private

  We propose a market mechanism that has the following features. (F1) It is
individually rational. (F2) It is budget balanced. (F3) It is price efficient,
that is, at equilibrium the price of electricity is equal to the marginal cost
of production. (F4) The energy production profile corresponding to every
non-zero Nash equilibrium of the game induced by the mechanism is a solution of
the corresponding centralized problem where the objective is the maximization
of the sum of the producers' and consumers' utilities.

In
surprising twist, it is inferred from plasmonic investigations that
collectively excited graphene electrons must exhibit non-zero mass and its
inertial acceleration is essential for graphene plasmonics. Despite such
importance, this collective mass has defied direct unequivocal measurement. It
may be directly measured by accelerating it with a time-varying voltage and
quantifying the phase delay of the resulting current; this voltage-current
phase relation would manifest as kinetic inductance, representing the
collective inertia's reluctance to accelerate. However, at optical (infrared)
frequencies phase measurement of current is generally difficult and at
microwave frequencies the inertial phase delay has been buried under electron
scattering. Here we directly, precisely measure the kinetic inductance, thus,
collective mass, by combining innovative device engineering that reduces
electron scattering and delicate microwave phase measurements. Particularly,
encapsulation of graphene between hexagonal-boron-nitride layers,
one-dimensional edge contacts, and a proximate top gate configured as microwave
ground together enable resolving the inertial phase delay from the electron
scattering. Beside the fundamental importance, the kinetic inductance
demonstrated here to be orders-of-magnitude larger than magnetic inductance can
dramatically miniaturize radio-frequency integrated circuits. Moreover, its
bias-dependency heralds a solid-state voltage-controlled inductor to complement
the prevalent voltage-controlled capacitor.

For G29-38, the observed composition can be best interpreted as a blend of a
chondritic object with some refractory-rich material, a result from
post-nebular processing. Water is very depleted in the parent body accreted
onto G29-38, based on the derived oxygen abundance. The inferred total mass
accretion rate in GD 133 is the lowest of all known dusty white dwarfs,
possibly due to non-steady state accretion. We continue to find that a variety

requires custom-tailored process models that fit the organizational and project
goals as well as the development contexts. These models are a necessary
prerequisite for creating project plans that are expected to fulfill business
goals. Although project planners require individual process models
custom-tailored to their constraints, software or system developing
organizations also require generic processes (i.e., reference processes) that
capture project-independent knowledge for similar development contexts. The
latter is emphazised by assessment approaches (such as CMMI, SPICE) that
require explicit process descriptions in order to reach a certain capability or
maturity level. Among other concepts such as polymorphism, templates, or
generator-based descriptions, software process patterns are used to describe
generic process knowledge. Several approaches for describing the architecture
of process patterns have already been published (e.g., [7]). However, there is
a lack of descriptions on how to compose process patterns for a specific
decelopment context in order to gain a custom-tailored process model for a
project. This paper focuses on the composition of process patterns in a
goal-oriented way. First, the paper describes which information a process
pattern should contain so that it can be used for systematic composition.
Second, a composition method is sketched. Afterwards, the results of a
proof-of-concept evaluation of the method are described. Finally, the paper is
summarized and open research questions are sketched.

  In our previous paper [1], we used the mean field approximation for case (i).
In that study, if the reference number $r$ is above three, phase transition
occurs and the solution converges to one of the equilibria. However, the
conclusion is different from mean field approximation. In this paper, we show
that the solution oscillates between the two states. A good (bad) equilibrium
is where a majority of $r$ select the correct (wrong) candidate. In this paper,
we show that there is no phase transition when $r$ is finite. If the annealing
schedule is adequately slow from finite $r$ to infinite $r$, the voting rate
converges only to the good equilibrium.
  In case (ii), the state of reference votes is equivalent to that of Kirman's
ant colony model, and it follows beta binomial distribution.
  In case (iii), we show that the model is equivalent to the finite-size
kinetic Ising model. If the voters are rational, a simple herding experiment of
information cascade is conducted. Information cascade results from the
quenching of the kinetic Ising model.As case (i) is the limit of case (iii)
when $\tanh$ function becomes a step function, the phase transition can be
observed in infinite size limit. We can confirm that there is no phase
transition when the reference number $r$ is finite.

finite-size corrections. We then review the exact time evolution of quantum
states constructed from yrast states shown by the Bethe ansatz. In time
evolution the density profile of an initially localized quantum state
constructed from yrast states collapses into a flat profile in the case of a
large particle number such as N=1000, while recurrence of the localized state
occurs in the case of a small particle number such as N=20. We suggest that the
dynamical relaxation behavior for the large N case is consistent with the

distinction in universality classes is not as clear and few are the examples,
as phase separation and kinetic roughening, for which universality has allowed
to classify results in a general spirit. Here we focus on an out-of-equilibrium
case, unstable crystal growth, lying in between phase ordering and pattern
formation. We consider a well established 2+1 dimensional family of continuum
nonlinear equations for the local height $h(\mathbf{x},t)$ of a crystal surface
having the general form ${\partial_t h(\mathbf{x},t)} = -\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot
{[\mathbf{j}(\nabla h) + \mathbf{\nabla}(\nabla^2 h)]}$: $\mathbf{j}(\nabla h)$
is an arbitrary function, which is linear for small $\nabla h$, and whose
structure expresses instabilities which lead to the formation of pyramid-like
structures of planar size $L$ and height $H$. Our task is the choice and
calculation of the quantities that can operate as critical exponents, together
with the discussion of what is relevant or not to the definition of our
universality class. These aims are achieved by means of a perturbative,
multiscale analysis of our model, leading to phase diffusion equations whose
diffusion coefficients encapsulate all relevant informations on dynamics. We
identify two critical exponents: i) the coarsening exponent, $n$, controlling
the increase in time of the typical size of the pattern, $L\sim t^n$; ii) the
exponent $\beta$, controlling the increase in time of the typical slope of the
pattern, $M \sim t^{\beta}$ where $M\approx H/L$. Our study reveals that there
are only two different universality classes...

process with rate depending on its membrane potential. At its spiking time, the
membrane potential of the spiking neuron is reset to the value 0 and,
simultaneously, the membrane potentials of the other neurons are increased by
an amount of potential 1/N . This mimics the effect of chemical synapses.

minimization methods. It is shown that essential structural knowledge about the
unknown data matrices in the data equation that relates Hankel matrices
constructed from input and output data can be used in the first step of the
numerical solution presented. The structural knowledge comprises the low rank
property of a matrix that is the product of the extended observability matrix
and the state sequence and the Toeplitz structure of the matrix of Markov
parameters (of the system in innovation form). The new subspace identification
method is referred to as the N2SID (twice the N of Nuclear Norm and SID for
Subspace IDentification) method. In addition to include key structural
knowledge in the solution it integrates the subspace calculation with
minimization of a classical prediction error cost function. The nuclear norm
relaxation enables us to perform such integration while preserving convexity.
The advantages of N2SID are demonstrated in a numerical open- and closed-loop
simulation study. Here a comparison is made with another widely used SID
method, i.e. N4SID. The comparison focusses on the identification with short
data batches, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small multiple of the
system order.

to use per- mutation graphs to efficiently generate exhaustive collections of
permutative automorphisms. Permutation graphs provide a natural link to the
textile systems representing induced endo- morphisms on the edge shift of the

repeated aggregate collisions at the bouncing barrier. About 100 SiO$_2$ dust
aggregates of 1 mm in size were observed interacting with each other.
Collisions occured within a velocity range from below mm/s up to cm/s.
Aggregates continuously interacted with each other over a period of 900 s.
During this time more than $10^5$ collisions occured. Nearly 2000 collisions
were analyzed in detail. No temporal stable net growth of larger aggregates was
observed even though sticking collision occur. Larger ensembles of aggregates
sticking together are formed but were disassembled again during the further
collisional evolution. The concept of a bouncing barrier supports the formation
of planetesimals by seeded collisional growth as well as by gravitational
instability favouring a significant total mass being limited to certain size
ranges. Within our parameter set the experiments confirm that bouncing barriers

Fibonacci nanostructure model is investigated within a tight-binding framework.
Periodic linear chains are side-attached to a Fibonacci chain, giving it the
shape of an aperiodic comb. The effect of the side-attachments on the usual
Cantor set energy spectrum of a Fibonacci chain is analyzed using the Greens
function technique. A special correlation between the coupling of the
side-attached chain with the Fibonacci chain and the inter-atomic coupling of
the Fibonacci chain results in a dramatic triggering of the fragmented Cantor
set energy spectrum into multiple sets of continuous sub-bands of extended
eigenstates. The result is valid even for a disordered comb and turns out to be
a rare exception of the conventional Anderson localization problem. The
electronic transport thus can be made selectively ballistic within desired
energy regimes. The number and the width of such continuous sub-bands can be
easily controlled by tuning the number of atomic sites in the side-coupled
periodic linear chains. This gives us a scope of proposing such aperiodic
nanostructures as potential candidates for prospective energy selective
nanoscale filtering devices.

variable renewable energy sources (VRES), wind power and solar photovoltaics,
into the European electricity grid. The future electricity supply will be based
to a large extend on these fluctuating resources. We have conducted a study,
extrapolating national historical and targeted wind and solar power
penetrations in Europe up to 100% VRES (R.A. Rodriguez et al, Renewable Energy
63, p. 467, Mar 2014 and S. Becker et al, Energy 64, p. 404, Jan 2014). A high
share of VRES means large fluctuations in the generation, causing
overproduction and deficits. One way to reduce such mismatches is power
transmission spatially smoothing out the fluctuations. This has the potential
to reduce the remaining shortages by sharing the surplus production of others.
We find that shortages can at maximum be reduced by 40% in the hypothetical
case of unlimited transmission capacities across all of Europe. A more
realistic extension of the transmission grid, roughly quadrupling today's
installation, turns out to be sufficient to harvest 90% of this potential
benefit. Finally, the import and export of single countries is investigated. We
conclude that a country's load size as well as its position in the network are
the determining factors for its import/export opportunities.

and para-hydrogen, corresponding to the two different spin configurations of
the two hydrogen atoms. The relative abundances of the two flavours in the
interstellar medium are still very uncertain, and this abundance ratio has a
significant impact on the thermal properties of the gas. In the context of star
formation, theoretical studies have recently adopted two different strategies
when considering the ortho:para ratio (OPR) of H2 molecules; the first
considers the OPR to be frozen at 3:1 while the second assumes that the species
are in thermal equilibrium. As the OPR potentially affects the protostellar
cores which form as a result of the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular
cloud, the aim of this paper is to quantify precisely what role the choice of
OPR plays in the properties and evolution of the cores. We used two different
ideal gas equations of state for a hydrogen and helium mix in a radiation
hydrodynamics code to simulate the collapse of a dense cloud and the formation
of the first and second Larson cores; the first equation of state uses a fixed
OPR of 3:1 while the second assumes thermal equilibrium. Simulations using an
equilibrium ratio collapse faster at early times and show noticeable
oscillations around hydrostatic equilibrium, to the point where the core
expands for a short time right after its formation before resuming its
contraction. In the case of a fixed 3:1 OPR, the core's evolution is a lot
smoother. The OPR was however found to have little impact on the size, mass and
radius of the two Larson cores. We conclude that if one is solely interested in
the final properties of the cores when they are formed, it does not matter
which OPR is used. On the other hand, if one's focus lies primarily in the
evolution of the first core, the choice of OPR becomes important.

inclined plane was investigated. A theoretical approach for investigating the
behaviour of such a cylinder was proposed. The critical angle of the plane that
allows the system to roll downward is presented. A simple experiment using six
types of granules consistently confirmed the theoretical predictions. We showed
that the critical angle is independent of the size distribution of the
granules. We observed that the sliding angle of granules inside the cylinder is
constant and, surprisingly, similar to the avalanche angle of the granules. Our
theoretical prediction can be used to determine the critical angle without
considering the shape, surface roughness and size distribution of the granules.
Additionally, we derived the oscillation frequency of the system when it is
slightly deviated from equilibrium, showing the frequency initially increases
and then decreases with increasing granular volume. The oscillation is absent
when the cylinder is empty or fully filled with granules. Furthermore, the
dissipation of energy as a function of the fractional volume and fractional
mass of the cylinder system were determined. This work might help students
understand rolling motions other than the standard rolling motion commonly
taught in the classroom.

interpreting and reusing evidence for most research results is a challenging
task. Additional contextual descriptions are needed to understand how those
results were generated and/or the circumstances under which they were
concluded. Because of this, scientists are calling for models that go beyond
the publication of datasets to systematically capture the life cycle of
scientific investigations and provide a single entry point to access the
information about the hypothesis investigated, the datasets used, the
experiments carried out, the results of the experiments, the people involved in
the research, etc. In this paper we present the Research Object (RO) suite of
ontologies, which provide a structured container to encapsulate research data
and methods along with essential metadata descriptions. Research Objects are
portable units that enable the sharing, preservation, interpretation and reuse
of research investigation results. The ontologies we present have been designed
in the light of requirements that we gathered from life scientists. They have
been built upon existing popular vocabularies to facilitate interoperability.

the conventional compressed sensing to such applications, the continuous
parameter space has to be discretized to a finite set of grid points.
Discretization, however, incurs errors and leads to deteriorated recovery
performance. To address this issue, we propose an iterative reweighted method
which jointly estimates the unknown parameters and the sparse signals.
Specifically, the proposed algorithm is developed by iteratively decreasing a
surrogate function majorizing a given objective function, which results in a
gradual and interweaved iterative process to refine the unknown parameters and
the sparse signal. Numerical results show that the algorithm provides superior
performance in resolving closely-spaced frequency components.

number of decoding iterations to achieve a certain residual erasure probability
for complexity metric. We first propose a quite accurate approximation of the
number of iterations for the BEC. Moreover, a simple but efficient utility
function corresponding to the number of iterations is developed. Using the
aforementioned approximation and the utility function, two optimization
problems w.r.t. complexity are formulated to find the code degree
distributions. We show that both optimization problems are convex. In
particular, the problem with the proposed approximation belongs to the class of
semi-infinite problems which are computationally challenging to be solved.
However, the problem with the proposed utility function falls into the class of
semi-definite programming (SDP) and thus, the global solution can be found
efficiently using available SDP solvers. Numerical results reveal the

understand the dual canonical basis conjecture for skew-symmetrizable quantum
cluster algebras. In the symmetrizable types it is known that dual canonical
basis elements need not have positive multiplicative structure constants, while
this is still suspected to hold for skew-symmetrizable quantum cluster
algebras. We propose an alternate conjecture for the symmetrizable types: the
cluster monomials should correspond to irreducible characters of a KLR algebra.
Indeed, the main conjecture of this note would establish this ""KLR conjecture""
for acyclic skew-symmetrizable quantum cluster algebras: that is, we conjecture
that the images of rigid representations under the quantum shuffle character
give irreducible characters for KLR algebras.

trusted and untrusted. Hence, JavaScript security is of paramount importance. A
specific interesting problem is information flow control (IFC) for JavaScript.
In this paper, we develop, formalize and implement a dynamic IFC mechanism for
the JavaScript engine of a production Web browser (specifically, Safari's
WebKit engine). Our IFC mechanism works at the level of JavaScript bytecode and
hence leverages years of industrial effort on optimizing both the source to
bytecode compiler and the bytecode interpreter. We track both explicit and
implicit flows and observe only moderate overhead. Working with bytecode
results in new challenges including the extensive use of unstructured control
flow in bytecode (which complicates lowering of program context taints),
unstructured exceptions (which complicate the matter further) and the need to
make IFC analysis permissive. We explain how we address these challenges,
formally model the JavaScript bytecode semantics and our instrumentation, prove
the standard property of termination-insensitive non-interference, and present
experimental results on an optimized prototype.

the relationship between the health outcome fat mass and physical activity (PA)

physical activity as counts per epoch over a given period of time. We use data
from the Avon longitudinal study of parents and children (ALSPAC) where
accelerometer data is available as a time series of accelerometer counts per
minute over seven days for a subset of children. In order to compare
accelerometer profiles between individuals and to reduce the high dimension a
functional summary of the profiles is used. We use the histogram as a
functional summary due to its simplicity, suitability and ease of
interpretation. Our model is an extension of generalised regression of scalars
on functions or signal regression. It allows also multi-dimensional functional
predictors and additive non-linear predictors for metric covariates. The
additive multidimensional functional predictors allow investigating specific
questions about whether the effect of PA varies over its intensity, by gender,
by time of day or by day of the week. The key feature of the model is that it
utilises the full profile of measured PA without requiring cut-points defining
intensity levels for light, moderate and vigorous activity. We show that the
(not necessarily causal) effect of PA is not linear and not constant over the
activity intensity. Also, there is little evidence to suggest that the effect
of PA intensity varies by gender or whether it happens on weekdays or on
weekends.

generated by the exchange of a heavy scalar electroweak triplet. When endowed
with additional heavy fields, such as right-handed neutrinos or extra triplets,
it also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We
derive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying
leptogenesis in the flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations
which hold among the chemical potentials of the various particle species in the
thermal bath. This takes into account the SM Yukawa interactions of both
leptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the
temperature, may be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We
find that when leptogenesis is enabled by the presence of an extra triplet,
lepton flavor effects allow the production of the $B-L$ asymmetry through
lepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon
as the triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this
case, the way the $B-L$ asymmetry is created through flavor effects is novel:
instead of invoking the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays faster than the
Hubble rate, it involves the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays slower than
the Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number
violating CP asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation
of the $B-L$ asymmetry, pointing out that as long as $L$-violating triplet
decays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet gauge scattering
processes decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all
washout suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount
of $B-L$ asymmetry produced is limited only by a universal gauge suppression
effect, which nevertheless goes away for large triplet decay rates.

the lightest modulus which produces Standard Model particles, dark matter and

common origin allows us to find an interesting correlation between dark matter
and dark radiation. By combining present upper bounds on the effective number
of neutrino species N_eff with lower bounds on the reheating temperature as a
function of the dark matter mass m_DM from Fermi data, we obtain strong

corresponds to non-thermal scenarios with Higgsino-like dark matter. Thermal
dark matter can be allowed only if N_eff tends to its Standard Model value. We

Bayesian inference for parameters governing stochastic kinetic models defined
as Markov (jump) processes (MJPs). Each iteration of the scheme requires an
estimate of the marginal likelihood calculated from the output of a sequential
Monte Carlo scheme (also known as a particle filter). Consequently, the method
can be extremely computationally intensive. We therefore aim to avoid most
instances of the expensive likelihood calculation through use of a fast
approximation. We consider two approximations: the chemical Langevin equation
diffusion approximation (CLE) and the linear noise approximation (LNA). Either
an estimate of the marginal likelihood under the CLE, or the tractable marginal
likelihood under the LNA can be used to calculate a first step acceptance
probability. Only if a proposal is accepted under the approximation do we then
run a sequential Monte Carlo scheme to compute an estimate of the marginal
likelihood under the true MJP and construct a second stage acceptance
probability that permits exact (simulation based) inference for the MJP. We
therefore avoid expensive calculations for proposals that are likely to be
rejected. We illustrate the method by considering inference for parameters
governing a Lotka-Volterra system, a model of gene expression and a simple
epidemic process.

spin-orbit (S-O) interaction splits the valence band structure at Gamma point
in good agreement with the experimental data, and this effect strongly depends

hole-like Fermi surface pockets lead to a change in electron transport
properties, which are investigated using the Boltzmann approach. In addition,
the simple and efficient method is presented for the calculation of density of
states effective mass m*, and then used to examine the impact of relativistic
effects on m*. It is found that S-O coupling of the valence bands reduces
effective mass and therefore significantly lowers the thermopower, primarily in
Mg2Sn, but also in Mg2Ge. A detrimental influence of the S-O interaction on
thermoelectric performance of p-type Mg2X is analyzed in function of
temperature (10-900 K) and carrier concentration (10^18-10^22 cm-3).

central planet and affected by tidal torques. The model is ruled by the
oblateness parameter of the satellite, the orbital eccentricity, the

reliable indication on the transient time which is needed to reach an attractor
in the spin-orbit model; the method is based on an analytical result, precisely
a suitable normal form construction. This method provides also information
about the frequency of motion. A variant of such normal form used to
parametrize invariant attractors provides a specific formula for the drift
parameter, which in turn yields a constraint - which might be of interest in
astronomical problems - between the oblateness of the satellite and its orbital
eccentricity.

a cut-off energy of E_c = (6.0 +2.0 -1.2) TeV. The TeV emission is
significantly extended and overlaps with the north-western part of the shell of
the SNR G338.3-0.0. The new H.E.S.S. results, a re-analysis of archival
XMM-Newton data, and multi-wavelength observations suggest that a significant
part of the gamma-ray emission from HESS J1640-465 originates in the SNR shell.
In a hadronic scenario, as suggested by the smooth connection of the GeV and
TeV spectra, the product of total proton energy and mean target density could
be as high as W_p n_H ~ 4 x 10^52 (d/10kpc)^2 erg cm^-3.

intimately linked to the topology of the surface and not limited to foams of

that conduction in the foam derives from first- and second-neighbor
interactions between $p_\|$ orbitals lying in the surface plane, which are
related to $p_\perp$ orbitals of graphene. The topologically protected
conducting state occurs on bare and hydrogen-terminated foam surfaces and is
thus unrelated to dangling bonds. Our results for carbon foam indicate that the
conductance behavior may be further significantly modified by surface

We present a suite of unigrid cosmological simulations (up to $2048^3$) using a
two-fluid model in the grid code ENZO. The simulations include the dynamical
effects of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and cover a range of theoretically motivated
acceleration efficiencies. For the bulk of the cosmic volume the modelling of
CR processes is rather stable with respect to resolution, provided that a
minimum (cell) resolution of $\approx 100 ~\rm kpc/h$ is employed. However, the
results for the innermost cluster regions depend on the assumptions for the
baryonic physics. Inside clusters, non-radiative runs at high resolution tend
to produce an energy density of CRs that are below available upper limits from
the FERMI satellite, while the radiative runs are found to produce a higher
budget of CRs. We show that weak ($M \leq 3-5$) shocks and shock-reacceleration
are crucial to set the level of CRs in the innermost region of clusters, while
in the outer regions the level of CR energy is mainly set via direct injection
by stronger shocks, and is less sensitive to cooling and feedback from active
galactic nuclei and supernovae.

different memories are attached at cell surface determinants which are the

recombination actually takes place during a short period of early development

presented in which switchboard neurons play a key role in the storage and
retrieving of memory. And as a consequence, they play a major role in the
process of learning and form the basic material for consciousness. In the
original model there was insufficient explanation for the realization of the
internal connection of one cell surface determinant to the other. We realized
that tubulin should play a role in these intracellular connections. The tubulin
molecules can form a connective wire because of a change of shape of the
individual tubulin dimers. This way the fast switch is realized by the switch
of the tubulin dimer configuration. Because the cell should remember which
switch was activated and which one was not or less activated, we postulate the
memristor quality of microtubules.

since Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 570-495 BC) is known as the music of the
spheres, is briefly reviewed from the Renaissance up to contemporary research.
Copernicus' heliocentric model from 1543 suggested that the planets of our
solar system form a kind of mutually ordered and quasi-synchronized system.
From 1596 to 1619 Kepler formulated preliminary mathematical relations of
approximate commensurabilities among the planets, which were later reformulated
in the Titius-Bode rule (1766-1772) that successfully predicted the orbital
position of Ceres and Uranus. Following the discovery of the ~11 yr sunspot
cycle, in 1859 Wolf suggested that the observed solar variability could be
approximately synchronized with the orbital movements of Venus, Earth, Jupiter
and Saturn. Modern research have further confirmed that: (1) the planetary
orbital periods can be approximately deduced from a simple system of resonant
frequencies; (2) the solar system oscillates with a specific set of
gravitational frequencies, and many of them (e.g. within the range between 3 yr
and 100 yr) can be approximately constructed as harmonics of a base period of
~178.38 yr; (3) solar and climate records are also characterized by planetary
harmonics from the monthly to the millennia time scales. This short review
concludes with an emphasis on the contribution of the author's research on the
empirical evidences and physical modeling of both solar and climate variability
based on astronomical harmonics. The general conclusion is that the solar
system works as a resonator characterized by a specific harmonic planetary
structure that synchronizes also the Sun's activity and the Earth's climate.
