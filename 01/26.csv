to motivate the collaboration of smartphone users on both data acquisition and
distributed computing applications. To collect massive sensitive data from
users, we propose a reward-based collaboration mechanism, where the master
announces a total reward to be shared among collaborators, and the
collaboration is successful if there are enough users wanting to collaborate.
We show that if the master knows the users' collaboration costs, then he can
choose to involve only users with the lowest costs. However, without knowing
users' private information, then he needs to offer a larger total reward to
attract enough collaborators. Users will benefit from knowing their costs
before the data acquisition. Perhaps surprisingly, the master may benefit as
the variance of users' cost distribution increases.
  To utilize smartphones' computation resources to solve complex computing
problems, we study how the master can design an optimal contract by specifying
different task-reward combinations for different user types. Under complete
information, we show that the master involves a user type as long as the
master's preference characteristic outweighs that type's unit cost. All
collaborators achieve a zero payoff in this case. If the master does not know
users' private cost information, however, he will conservatively target at a
smaller group of users with small costs, and has to give most benefits to the
collaborators.

of finitely generated (right) $R$-modules which is closed under finite direct
sums, direct summands, and isomorphisms. Then the set $\mathcal V (\mathcal C)$
of isomorphism classes of modules is a commutative semigroup with operation
induced by the direct sum. This semigroup encodes all possible information
about direct sum decompositions of modules in $\mathcal C$. If the endomorphism
ring of each module in $\mathcal C$ is semilocal, then $\mathcal V (\mathcal
C)$ is a Krull monoid. Although this fact was observed nearly a decade ago, the
focus of study thus far has been on ring- and module-theoretic conditions
enforcing that $\mathcal V(\mathcal C)$ is Krull. If $\mathcal V(\mathcal C)$
is Krull, its arithmetic depends only on the class group of $\mathcal
V(\mathcal C)$ and the set of classes containing prime divisors. In this paper
we provide the first systematic treatment to study the direct-sum
decompositions of modules using methods from Factorization Theory of Krull
monoids. We do this when $\mathcal C$ is the class of finitely generated
torsion-free modules over certain one- and two-dimensional commutative

this model functions similarly to previous 2D Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo
models that employ a double-ring prescription for poloidal field generation but
we generalize this prescription into a 3D flux emergence algorithm that places
BMRs on the surface in response to the dynamo-generated toroidal field. In this
way, the model can be regarded as a unification of BL dynamo models (2D in
radius/latitude) and surface flux transport models (2D in latitude/longitude)
into a more self-consistent framework that captures the full 3D structure of
the evolving magnetic field. The model reproduces some basic features of the
solar cycle including an 11-yr periodicity, equatorward migration of toroidal
flux in the deep convection zone, and poleward propagation of poloidal flux at
the surface. The poleward-propagating surface flux originates as trailing flux
in BMRs, migrates poleward in multiple non-axisymmetric streams (made
axisymmetric by differential rotation and turbulent diffusion), and eventually
reverses the polar field, thus sustaining the dynamo. In this letter we briefly
describe the model, initial results, and future plans.

various amorphous solids, mechanical stability can be lost either by reducing
connectedness or by increasing pressure. We present an effective medium theory
of elasticity that extends previous approaches by incorporating the effect of
compression, of amplitude $e$, allowing one to describe quantitative features
of sound propagation, transport, the boson peak, and elastic moduli near the
elastic instability occurring at a compression $e_c$. The theory disentangles
several frequencies characterizing the vibrational spectrum: the onset
frequency $\omega_0\sim \sqrt{e_c-e}$ where strongly-scattered modes appear in
the vibrational spectrum, the pressure-independent frequency $\omega_*$ where
the density of states displays a plateau, the boson peak frequency
$\omega_{BP}$, and the Ioffe-Regel frequency $\omega_{IR}$ where scattering
length and wavelength become equal. We predict that sound attenuation crosses
over from $\omega^4$ to $\omega^2$ behaviour at $\omega_0$. We predict that a
frequency-dependent length scale $l_s(\omega)$ and speed of sound $\nu(\omega)$
characterize vibrational modes, and could be extracted from scattering data.
One key result is the prediction of a flat diffusivity above $\omega_0$, in
agreement with previously unexplained observations. We find that the shear
modulus does not vanish at the elastic instability, but drops by a factor of 2.
We check our predictions in packings of soft particles and study the case of
covalent networks and silica. Overall, our approach unifies sound attenuation,
transport and length scales entering elasticity in a single framework where
disorder is not the main parameter controlling the boson peak, in agreement
with observations. This framework leads to a phase diagram where various
glasses can be placed, connecting microscopic structure to vibrational
properties.

galaxies in the comoving frame and along the past lightcone of observationally
constrained LTB models and to compare those results with their standard model
counterparts.
  We derived integral number densities and differential number densities using
different cosmological distance definitions in the LTB models. Then, we
computed selection functions and consistency functions for the luminosity
functions in the combined fields of the Herschel/PACS evolutionary probe (PEP)
survey in both standard and void cosmologies, from which we derived the
observed values of the above-mentioned densities. We used the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics to study both the evolution of the consistency
functions and its connection to the evolution of the comoving density of
sources. Finally, we fitted the power-law behaviour of the densities along the
observer's past lightcone.
  The analysis of the comoving number density shows that the increased
flexibility of the LTB models is not enough to fit the observed redshift
evolution of the number counts, if it is specialised to a recent best-fit giant
void parametrisation. The results for the power-law fits of the densities along
the observer's past lightcone show general agreement across both cosmological
models studied here around a slope of -2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 for the integral number
density on the luminosity-distance volumes. The differential number densities
show much bigger slope discrepancies.

lightcone were still rendered dependent on the cosmological model by the flux
limits of the PEP survey. In addition, we show that an intrinsic evolution of
the sources must be assumed to fit the comoving number-density redshift
evolution in the giant void parametrisation for the LTB models used in this

nominalisations, whose meaning is related to the event expressed by their base
verb. The literature about nominalisations often assumes that the semantics of
the base verb completely defines the structure of action nominals. We argue
that the information in the base verb is not sufficient to completely determine
the semantics of action nominals. We exhibit some data from different
languages, especially from Romance language, which show that nominalisations
focus on some aspects of the verb semantics. The selected aspects, however,
seem to be idiosyncratic and do not automatically result from the internal
structure of the verb nor from its interaction with the morphological suffix.
We therefore propose a partially lexicalist approach view of deverbal nouns. It
is made precise and computable by using the Montagovian Generative Lexicon, a
type theoretical framework introduced by Bassac, Mery and Retor\'e in this
journal in 2010. This extension of Montague semantics with a richer type system
easily incorporates lexical phenomena like the semantics of action nominals in
particular deverbals, including their polysemy and (in)felicitous
copredications.

influence their inner density profile, by means of an extended version of the

takes into account the effect of baryons adiabatic contraction, ordered and
random angular momentum, dynamical friction, and adds to the previous the
effect of gas cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and reionization.
Our model shows that dwarf galaxies are bulgeless, in agreement with
observations showing that the large majority of them has no stellar bulges, and
are characterized by a flat profile well described by a Burkert profile. {We
then studied the effect of a bulge, added to the {cored} DM halo, on the
density profile}. In the case of a galaxy having a mass $10^{11} M_{\odot}$ the
inner density profile has a slope $\alpha \simeq 0.65$, for a bulge of $4.5
\times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, while if bulge formation is not considered, the slope
would be $\alpha \simeq 0.55$. If the bulge is larger, $6.5 \times 10^{9}
M_{\odot}$ the slope is $\alpha \simeq 0.7$. In the case of a larger galaxy
with $10^{12} M_{\odot}$ the slope is $\alpha \simeq 0.85$, while in absence of
bulge it is $\alpha \simeq 0.75$. We finally study how the inner slope $\alpha$
changes with the bulge mass, and we find a correlation among the two
quantities. The result shows that bulge formation has an important role in
shaping the inner DM density profile in agreement with Inoue & Saitoh (2011)
result. The result implies that going from Sc to SO Hubble type the slope is
slightly steepening due to the bulge formation, and due to the fact that early
type galaxies have larger bulges.

new window into the time domain behavior of young stellar objects. Here we
provide an overview of the observations, focusing on results from Spitzer and
CoRoT. The highlight of this work is detailed analysis of 162 classical T Tauri
stars for which we can probe optical and mid-infrared flux variations to 1%
amplitudes and sub-hour timescales. We present a morphological variability
census and then use metrics of periodicity, stochasticity, and symmetry to
statistically separate the light curves into seven distinct classes, which we
suggest represent different physical processes and geometric effects. We
provide distributions of the characteristic timescales and amplitudes, and
assess the fractional representation within each class. The largest category
(>20%) are optical ""dippers"" having discrete fading events lasting ~1-5 days.
The degree of correlation between the optical and infrared light curves is
positive but weak; notably, the independently assigned optical and infrared
morphology classes tend to be different for the same object. Assessment of flux
variation behavior with respect to (circum)stellar properties reveals
correlations of variability parameters with H$\alpha$ emission and with
effective temperature. Overall, our results point to multiple origins of young
star variability, including circumstellar obscuration events, hot spots on the
star and/or disk, accretion bursts, and rapid structural changes in the inner
disk.

the \textit{radio number} of a graph $\text{rn}(G)$ is defined as the minimum

mixtures has been a very popular method since the 1970s. However, the vast
majority of such approximations are introduced in an ad-hoc manner without
theoretical grounding. This work is a continuation of [4, 5], where we
described a rigorous Gaussian mixture approximation to the solution of the
filtering problem. We deduce here a refined estimate of the rate of convergence
of the approximation. We do this by proving a central limit type theorem for
the error process. We also find the optimal variances of the Gaussian measures
are of order $1/\sqrt{n}$. This implies, in particular, that the mean square
error of the approximation as defined in [4, 5] is of order $1/n$.

those associated with meshing complex geometries and solving problems with
evolving domains and interfaces. Developing model reduction methods for
computational frameworks based on such methods seems however to be challenging.
Indeed, most popular model reduction techniques are projection-based, and rely
on basis functions obtained from the compression of simulation snapshots. In a
traditional interface-fitted computational framework, the computation of such
basis functions is straightforward, primarily because the computational domain
does not contain in this case a fictitious region. This is not the case however
for an embedded computational framework because the computational domain
typically contains in this case both real and ghost regions whose definitions
complicate the collection and compression of simulation snapshots. The problem
is exacerbated when the interface separating both regions evolves in time. This
paper addresses this issue by formulating the snapshot compression problem as a
weighted low-rank approximation problem where the binary weighting identifies
the evolving component of the individual simulation snapshots. The proposed
approach is application independent and therefore comprehensive. It is
successfully demonstrated for the model reduction of several two-dimensional,
vortex-dominated, fluid-structure interaction problems.

combinations of smoothing and shrinkage. All methods are tested on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from multiple subjects participating in
two different experiments related to reading, for both predicting neural
response to stimuli and decoding stimuli from responses. Interestingly, when
the regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation independently for
every voxel, low/high regularization is chosen in voxels where the
classification accuracy is high/low, indicating that the regularization

well, suggesting that beating basic smoothing and shrinkage will take not only
clever methods, but also careful modeling.

young stellar objects (YSOs) whose optical variability is dominated by short
duration flux bursts, which we infer are due to enhanced mass accretion rates.
These light curves show many brief -- several hour to one day -- brightenings
at optical and near-infrared (IR) wavelengths with amplitudes generally in the
range 5-50% of the quiescent value. Typically, a dozen or more of these bursts
occur in a thirty day period. We demonstrate that stars exhibiting this type of
variability have large ultraviolet (UV) excesses and dominate the portion of
the u-g vs. g-r color-color diagram with the largest UV excesses. These stars
also have large Halpha equivalent widths, and either centrally peaked, lumpy
Halpha emission profiles or profiles with blue-shifted absorption dips
associated with disk or stellar winds. Light curves of this type have been
predicted for stars whose accretion is dominated by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities at the boundary between their magnetosphere and inner
circumstellar disk, or where magneto-rotational instabilities modulate the
accretion rate from the inner disk. Amongst the stars with the largest UV
excesses or largest Halpha equivalent widths, light curves with this type of
variability greatly outnumber light curves with relatively smooth sinusoidal
variations associated with long-lived hot spots. We provide quantitative
statistics for the average duration and strength of the accretion bursts and
for the fraction of the accretion luminosity associated with these bursts.

quantify heterogeneous mixtures of dynamic processes within single phylogenies.
I developed a method that can identify arbitrary numbers of time-varying
diversification processes on phylogenies without specifying their locations in
advance. The method uses reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo to move
between model subspaces that vary in the number of distinct diversification
regimes. The model assumes that changes in evolutionary regimes occur across
the branches of phylogenetic trees under a compound Poisson process and
explicitly accounts for rate variation through time and among lineages. Using
simulated datasets, I demonstrate that the method can be used to quantify
complex mixtures of time-dependent, diversity-dependent, and constant-rate
diversification processes. I compared the performance of the method to the
MEDUSA model of rate variation among lineages. As an empirical example, I
analyzed the history of speciation and extinction during the radiation of
modern whales. The method described here will greatly facilitate the
exploration of macroevolutionary dynamics across large phylogenetic trees,

supernova remnant (SNR) G352.7-0.1 using archival data from observations made
with XMM-Newton and Chandra. Prior X-ray observations of this SNR revealed a
thermal center-filled morphology which contrasts with a shell-like radio
morphology, thus establishing G352.7$-$0.1 as a mixed-morphology SNR (MMSNRs).
Our study confirms that the X-ray emission comes from the SNR interior and must
be ejecta-dominated. Spectra obtained with XMM-Newton may be fit satisfactorily
with a single thermal component (namely a non-equilibrium ionization component
with enhanced abundances of silicon and sulfur). In contrast, spectra extracted
by Chandra from certain regions of the SNR cannot always be fit by a single
thermal component. For those regions, a second thermal component with solar
abundances or two thermal components with different temperatures and thawed
silicon and sulfur abundances (respectively) can generate a
statistically-acceptable fit. We argue that the former scenario is more
physically-plausible: based on parameters of our spectral fits, we calculate
physical parameters including X-ray-emitting mass (about 45 solar masses, for
solar abundances). We find no evidence for overionization in the X-ray emitting
plasma associated with the SNR: this phenomenon has been seen in other MMSNRs.
We have conducted a search for a neutron star within the SNR using a hard (2-10
keV) Chandra image but could not identify a firm candidate. We also present
(for the first time) the detection of infrared emission from this SNR as
detected at 24 micron by MIPS aboard Spitzer. Finally, we discuss the
properties of G352.7-0.1 in the context of other ejecta-dominated MMSNRs.

posses a thermal spectrum, as predicted. This contention is based on three
separate legs. The first is that the essential physics of the Hawking process
for black holes can be modelled in other physical systems. The second is the
white hole horizons are the time inverse of black hole horizons, and thus the
physics of both is the same. The third is that the quantum emission, which is
the Hawking process, is completely determined by measurements of the classical
parameters of a linear physical system. The experiment conducted in 2010
fulfills all of these requirements, and is thus a true measurement of Hawking
radiation.

synchronous point-to-point networks, where each directed link of the underlying
communication graph represents a communication channel between a pair of nodes.
We adopt the transient Byzantine link failure model [15, 16], where an
omniscient adversary controls a subset of the directed communication links, but
the nodes are assumed to be fault-free.
  Recent work has addressed the problem of reaching approximate consen- sus in
incomplete graphs with Byzantine nodes using a restricted class of iterative
algorithms that maintain only a small amount of memory across iterations [22,
21, 23, 12]. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
consider approximate consensus in the presence of Byzan- tine links. We extend
our past work that provided exact characterization of graphs in which the
iterative approximate consensus problem in the presence of Byzantine node
failures is solvable [22, 21]. In particular, we prove a tight necessary and
sufficient condition on the underlying com- munication graph for the existence
of iterative approximate consensus algorithms under transient Byzantine link
model. The condition answers (part of) the open problem stated in [16].

Instantly Decodable Network Coding (IDNC) were considered separately and were
thought to completely act against each other. Recently, some works aimed to
balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics but none of them
studied a further optimization of one by controlling the other. In this paper,
we study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion
time below its currently best known solution. We first derive the
decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall completion
times. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion
time is NP-hard, we design a novel heuristic that minimizes the probability of
increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time
expressions after each transmission through a layered control of their decoding
delays. Simulation results show that this new algorithm achieves both a lower
mean completion time and mean decoding delay compared to the best known
heuristic for completion time reduction. The gap in performance becomes
significant for harsh erasure scenarios.

have implications in economic theory, computational economics, and distributed

prices go up in response to excess demand, and down in response to excess
supply. This paper analyzes the convergence of a time-discrete t\^atonnement

converges (efficiently) to equilibrium prices and allocation in markets with
nested CES-Leontief utilities, generalizing some of the previous convergence
proofs for more restricted types of utility functions.

used to identify stylistic keywords in image patches, and keyword frequencies
are calculated for sub-images that each contains many patches. A generative

multi-component partially ionized plasmas, is discussed.
  Full multi-component theory is used, and similarities and differences
regarding the classic magnetohydrodynamic theory are presented.
  It is shown that the cut-off in partially ionized plasma in principle may
remain the same as predicted in classic magnetohydrodynamic works, although
multi-component theory also yields some essential differences. Due to electric
field, the ion motion is intrinsically two-dimensional and this results in
additional forced oscillations of neutrals. One new small parameter, containing
the ion inertial length, appears in the multi-component theory. This new small
parameter is missing in the magnetohydrodynamic description, and it turns out
that for some parameters it may be greater than the ions-to-neutrals density
ratio which is the only small parameter in the magnetohydrodynamic description.
Due to this the Alfven wave behavior can become much different as compared to
classic magnetohydrodynamic results. It is shown also that in plasmas with
unmagnetized ions, Alfv}n waves cannot be excited. This by all means applies to
the solar photosphere where the ion collision frequency may be far above the
ion gyro-frequency.

conductance-based model neuron driven by excitatory and inhibitory spikes from
a presynaptic population, where the rate and synchrony in the presynaptic
excitatory population may vary independently from the average rate. We find
that for a fixed input rate, the ISI distribution of the post synaptic neuron
depends on the level of synchrony and is well-described by a Gamma distribution
for synchrony levels less than 50%. For levels of synchrony between 15% and 50%
(restricted for technical reasons), we compute the optimum input distribution
that maximizes the mutual information per unit energy. This optimum
distribution shows that an increased level of synchrony, as it has been
reported experimentally in attention-demanding conditions, reduces the mode of
the input distribution and the excitability threshold of post synaptic neuron.
This facilitates a more energy efficient neuronal communication.

symmetry imposed to avoid tree-level flavour-changing neutral current, i.e.
type-I, type-II, type-X and type-Y models. We investigate the possibility to
discriminate the four models in the light of the flavour physics data,
including $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, $B_{s,d} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, $B\to \tau\nu$ and
$\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ decays, the recent LHC Higgs data, the direct search
for charged Higgs at LEP, and the constraints from perturbative unitarity and
vacuum stability. After deriving the combined constraints on the Yukawa
interaction parameters, we have shown that the correlation between the mass
eigenstate rate asymmetry $A_{\Delta\Gamma}$ of $B_{s} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and the
ratio $R={\cal B}(B_{s} \to \mu^+ \mu^-)_{exp}/ {\cal B}(B_{s} \to \mu^+
\mu^-)_{SM}$ could be sensitive probe to discriminate the four models with
future precise measurements of the observables in the $B_{s} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$
decay at LHCb.

presented. The approach is illustrated with the examples of the Toffoli gate
and the Quantum Fourier Transform for 3 and 4 qubits. It is shown that the
algorithms based on the open quantum walk formalism are more efficient than the
canonical dissipative quantum computing approach. In particular, the open
quantum walks can be designed to converge faster to the desired steady state
and to increase the probability of detection of the outcome of the computation.

classes are much more informative than the ones introduced by Milnor. In
particular, they see all the powers of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring,
contain the Arason invariant and it's higher analogues. Moreover, the new
classes allow to treat the J-invariant of quadrics. This invariant, introduced
in 2005, has been so far completely isolated from characteristic classes. In
addition, our classes allow to describe explicitly the structure of some
motives associated with quadratic forms.

25% to 1% reserve ratios at most layers of the banking system encompassing the
majority of its range in recent centuries. Here it is shown that multipliers
over 1 000 can occur from a new mechanism in banking. This new multiplier uses
a default insurance note to insure an outstanding loan in order to return the
value of the insured amount into capital. The economic impact of this invention
is calculably greater than the original invention of reserve banking. The
consequence of this lending invention is to render the existing money
multiplier equations of reserve banking obsolete where it occurs. The equations
describing this new multiplier do not converge. Each set of parameters for
reserve percentage, nesting depth, etc. creates a unique logarithmic curve
rather than approaching a limit. Thus it is necessary to show the behavior of
this new equation by numerical methods. Understanding this new multiplier and
associated issues is necessary for economic analyses of the Global Financial
Crisis.
