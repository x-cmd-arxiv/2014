We propose that dark energy of the Universe is vacuum energy. Our Universe
during its expansion is spending its vacuum energy for creation of new quantum
states, but in the quantum regime phase transitions were more effective in
reducing the vacuum energy than creation of new quantum states. Here we show
how the 123 crisis orders of the vacuum energy are reduced by conventional
physical processes in both the quantum and classical regimes of the Universe
evolution. Numeral estimates of dark energy evolution are also presented.

average queue length. Additionally, computational issues of the implementation

behavior, with logarithmic variation, resembles to the disorder enhanced

second-order languages from the viewpoint of categorical algebra as developed
by Lawvere. To this end, this paper introduces the notion of second-order
algebraic theory and develops its basic theory. A crucial role in the
definition is played by the second-order theory of equality $\M$, representing
the most elementary operators and equations present in every second-order
language. The category $\M$ can be described abstractly via the universal
property of being the free cartesian category on an exponentiable object.
Thereby, in the tradition of categorical algebra, a second-order algebraic
theory consists of a cartesian category $\Mlaw$ and a strict cartesian
identity-on-objects functor $\M \to \Mlaw$ that preserves the universal
exponentiable object of $\Mlaw$. Lawvere's functorial semantics for algebraic
theories can then be generalised to the second-order setting. To verify the
correctness of our theory, two categorical equivalences are established: at the
syntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order
algebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and
second-order functorial models.

study alternative models of diffusion on networks and we calibrate them using
input-output data on real-world inter-sectoral dependencies for several
European countries before the Great Depression. We show that the impact of
economic shocks strongly depends on the nature of the shock and country size.
Shocks that impact on final demand without changing production and the
technological relationships between sectors have on average a large but very
homogeneous impact on the economy. Conversely, when shocks change also the
magnitudes of input-output across-sector interdependencies (and possibly sector
production), the economy is subject to predominantly large but more
heterogeneous avalanche sizes. In this case, we also find that: (i) the more a
sector is globally central in the country network, the largest its impact; (ii)
the largest European countries, such as those constituting the core of the
European Union's economy, typically experience the largest avalanches,
signaling their intrinsic higher vulnerability to economic shocks.

provides firm evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Recently,
theta13 has been determined to be moderately large, quite close to its previous
upper bound. This represents a significant milestone in establishing the
three-flavor oscillation picture of neutrinos. It has opened up exciting
prospects for current and future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments
towards addressing the remaining fundamental questions, in particular the type
of the neutrino mass hierarchy and the possible presence of a CP-violating
phase. Another recent and crucial development is the indication of non-maximal
2-3 mixing angle, causing the octant ambiguity of theta23. In this paper, I
will review the phenomenology of long-baseline neutrino oscillations with a
special emphasis on sub-leading three-flavor effects, which will play a crucial
role in resolving these unknowns. First, I will give a brief description of
neutrino oscillation phenomenon. Then, I will discuss our present global
understanding of the neutrino mass-mixing parameters and will identify the
major unknowns in this sector. After that, I will present the physics reach of
current generation long-baseline experiments. Finally, I will conclude with a
discussion on the physics capabilities of accelerator-driven possible future
long-baseline precision oscillation facilities.

Kovacs hump is directly related to the monotonic relaxation function of the
energy. The analytical results are compared with extensive Monte Carlo
simulations, and an excellent agreement is found. Remarkably, the position of
the maximum in the Kovacs hump depends on the fact that the true asymptotic
behavior of the relaxation function is different from the stretched exponential
describing the relevant part of the relaxation at low temperatures.

systems that allow for uncoded exact repairs having the minimum repair
bandwidth. However, in contrast to minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes,
where a random set of a certain size of available nodes is used for a node
repair, the repairs with FR codes are table based. This usually allows to store
more data compared to MBR codes. In this work, we consider bounds on the
fractional repetition capacity, which is the maximum amount of data that can be
stored using an FR code. Optimal FR codes which attain these bounds are
presented. The constructions of these FR codes are based on combinatorial
designs and on families of regular and biregular graphs. These constructions of
FR codes for given parameters raise some interesting questions in graph theory.
These questions and some of their solutions are discussed in this paper. In
addition, based on a connection between FR codes and batch codes, we propose a
new family of codes for DSS, namely fractional repetition batch codes, which
have the properties of batch codes and FR codes simultaneously. These are the
first codes for DSS which allow for uncoded efficient exact repairs and load
balancing which can be performed by several users in parallel. Other concepts
related to FR codes are also discussed.

The formal limit of these equations for vanishing semiclassical parameter
$\epsilon$, the semiclassical equations, are numerically integrated up to the
formation of a shock. The use of parallelized algorithms allows to determine
the critical time $t_{c}$ and the critical solution for these $2+1$-dimensional
shocks. It is shown that the solutions generically break in isolated points
similarly to the case of the $1+1$-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation, i.e., cubic singularities in the defocusing case and square root
singularities in the focusing case. For small values of $\epsilon$, the full
Davey-Stewartson II equations are integrated for the same initial data up to
the critical time $t_{c}$. The scaling in $\epsilon$ of the difference between
these solutions is found to be the same as in the $1+1$ dimensional case,
proportional to $\epsilon^{2/7}$ for the defocusing case and proportional to
$\epsilon^{2/5}$ in the focusing case. We document the Davey-Stewartson II
solutions for small $\epsilon$ for times much larger than the critical time
$t_{c}$. It is shown that zones of rapid modulated oscillations are formed near
the shocks of the solutions to the semiclassical equations. For smaller
$\epsilon$, the oscillatory zones become smaller and more sharply delimited to
lens shaped regions. Rapid oscillations are also found in the focusing case for
initial data where the singularities of the solution to the semiclassical

size and denser resource employment, resulted from diminishing resource and
increasing communication demands. However, small cell may result in high
interference between cells. Moreover, the random geographic patterns of small
cell networks make them hard to analyze, at least excluding schemes in the
well-accepted hexagonal grid model. In this paper, a new model---the matrix
graph is proposed which takes advantage of the small cell size and high
inter-cell interference to reduce computation complexity. This model can
simulate real world networks accurately and offers convenience in frequency
allocation problems which are usually NP-complete. An algorithm dealing with
this model is also given, which asymptotically achieves the theoretical limit
of frequency allocation, and has a complexity which decreases with cell size
and grows linearly with the network size. This new model is specifically
proposed to characterize the next-generation cellular networks.

employed at the transmit side and is a dual to the successive interference
cancelation (SIC) detection at the receive side. Like SIC detection, the
performance of THP strongly depends on the ordering of the precoded symbols.
The optimal ordering algorithm, however, is impractical for multiuser MIMO
(MU-MIMO) systems with multiple receive antennas due to the fact that the users
are geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch THP
(MB-THP) scheme and algorithms that employ multiple transmit processing and
ordering strategies along with a selection scheme to mitigate interference in
MU-MIMO systems. Two types of multi-branch THP (MB-THP) structures are
proposed. The first one employs a decentralized strategy with diagonal weighted
filters at the receivers of the users and the second uses a diagonal weighted
filter at the transmitter. The MB-MMSE-THP algorithms are also derived based on
an extended system model with the aid of an LQ decomposition, which is much
simpler compared to the conventional MMSE-THP algorithms. Simulation results
show that a better bit error rate (BER) performance can be achieved by the
proposed MB-MMSE-THP precoder with a small computational complexity increase.

competing scenarios for these nuclei: (1) SE is an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) lost from NW due to a gravitational-wave recoil. (2) NW and SE each
contain an AGN, signaling a gravitational-slingshot recoil or inspiralling
AGNs. We present new images from the Very Large Array (VLA) at a frequency nu =
9.0 GHz and a FWHM resolution theta = 320 mas (1.6 kpc), and the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) at nu = 1.52 GHz and theta = 15 mas (75 pc). The VLA
imaging is sensitive to emission driven by AGNs and/or star formation, while
the VLBA imaging is sensitive only to AGN-driven emission. No radio emission is
detected at these frequencies. Folding in prior results, we find: (a) The
properties of SE and its adjacent X-ray feature resemble those of the
unobscured AGN in NGC 4151, albeit with a much higher narrow emission-line
luminosity. (b) The properties of NW are consistent with it hosting a
Compton-thick AGN that warms ambient dust, photoionizes narrow emission-line
gas and is free-free absorbed by that gas. Finding (a) is consistent with
scenarios (1) and (2). Finding (b) weakens the case for scenario (1) and
strengthens the case for scenario (2). Follow-up observations are suggested.

Chiral magnonic edge states of a Kagom\'e magnet offer, in addition, a
promising way to create, control and manipulate skyrmions. This has potential
for applications in spintronics, magnonics and skyrmionics, i.e., for

low carrier density by changing an externally applied in-plane magnetic field
parallel to the 2D layer. d\rho/dT changes its sign at some nonuniversal
sample-dependent critical carrier density n_c separating an effective 2D metal
(d\rho/dT >0) for n>n_c from an effective 2D insulator (d\rho/dT<0) for n<n_c.
We study the 2D MIT phenomenon as a possible strong localization induced
crossover process controlled by the Ioffe-Regel criterion, k_F l=1. Calculating
the quantum mean free path (l) in the effective metallic phase from a realistic
transport theory including disorder scattering effects, we solve the integral
equation defined by the Ioffe-Regel criterion to obtain the nonuniversal
critical density n_c as a function of the applicable physical experimental
parameters including disorder strength, in-plane magnetic field, spin and
valley degeneracy, background dielectric constant and carrier effective mass,
and temperature. The key physics underlying the nonuniversal parameter
dependence of the n_c is the temperature and density dependence of the Coulomb
disorder. Our calculated results for the crossover n_c appear to be in
qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement with the available experimental
data in different 2D semiconductor systems lending credence to the possibility
that the apparent 2D MIT signals the onset of the strong localization crossover
in disordered 2D systems. We provide some results for graphene where a
low-temperature 2D MIT becomes possible in the presence of intervalley
scattering. We also provide an extensive comparison with the theoretical

instruments such as the Portable Infrared Mineral Analyser (PIMA, Integrated

using a PIMA instrument. A survey was carried out on the Strelley Pool Chert,
an outcrop of stro- matolitic, silicified Archean carbonate and clastic
succession in the Pilbara Craton, interpreted as being modified by hydrothermal
processes. The results of this study demonstrate the ca- pability of SWIR
techniques to add significantly to the geological interpretation of such hy-

pyrophyllite in a bleached and altered unit directly beneath the succession
suggests acidic, sulfur-rich hydrothermal activity may have interacted with the
silicified sediments of the Strelley Pool Chert.

  Approach",,,,,"math.CT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we give an accessible introduction to the theory of orbispaces
via groupoids. We define a certain class of topological groupoids, which we
call orbigroupoids. Each orbigroupoid represents an orbispace, but just as with
orbifolds and Lie groupoids, this representation is not unique: orbispaces are
Morita equivalence classes of orbigroupoids. We show how to formalize this
equivalence by defining the category of orbispaces as a bicatecory of fractions
from the category of orbigroupoids. We focus particularly on laying the
groundwork for future work in creating mapping objects for orbispaces which are
themselves orbispaces, and providing a concrete description of how this mapping
space construction will get its orbispace structure. Throughout this paper, we
illustrate our definitions and results with numerous examples which we hope
will be useful in seeing how the categorical point of view is used to study
these spaces.

superconducting circuit behind the proposed simulator entails an array of
transmon qubits and microwave resonators. By applying microwave driving fields
to the qubits, a small-polaron Bloch state with an arbitrary quasimomentum can
be prepared in this system within times several orders of magnitude shorter
than the typical qubit decoherence times. We demonstrate that in this system --
by varying the circuit parameters -- one can readily reach the critical

namely class-a priori and class-conditional probabilities. Bayes' risk is the
minimum expected classification cost that is achieved by the Bayes' test, the
optimal decision rule. When no cost incurs for correct classification and unit
cost is charged for misclassification, Bayes' test reduces to the maximum a
posteriori decision rule, and Bayes risk simplifies to Bayes' error, the
probability of error. Since calculating this probability of error is often
intractable, several techniques have been devised to bound it with closed-form
formula, introducing thereby measures of similarity and divergence between
distributions like the Bhattacharyya coefficient and its associated
Bhattacharyya distance. The Bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened
using the Chernoff information that relies on the notion of best error
exponent. In this paper, we first express Bayes' risk using the total variation
distance on scaled distributions. We then elucidate and extend the
Bhattacharyya and the Chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized
weighted means. We provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical
divergences and affinity coefficients. We illustrate our technique by deriving
new upper bounds for the univariate Cauchy and the multivariate

of locally stable domain walls separating the two polarized ground states, and
the scaling collapse agrees with an interface depinning mechanism. In contrast,
avalanches in the fully frustrated kagome ice exhibit pronounced branching

field theories. These actions contain information about the low-energy field
content and dynamics of quantum field theories and are essential for
understanding their phenomenological and theoretical properties.
  In chapters 2 to 5, the covariant background field method is used to
investigate quantum corrections to sectors of a variety of supersymmetric field
theories at 1 and 2 loops. We start by looking at the background field
quantisation of a general N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory, rederiving the
well-known 1 loop finiteness conditions. This is followed by a reexamination of
the effective potential of the Wess-Zumino model, focusing on a derivation of
the full auxiliary fields' potential. Next, the 2 loop Euler-Heisenberg
effective action is constructed for N=1 supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics;
its renormalisation properties and self-dual limit are studied. The final
action studied is the 2 loop Kahler potential for beta-deformed N=4
super-Yang-Mills. This sector is purely a product of the deformation and its
finiteness is demonstrated in a general background before examining two special
cases.
  Chapter 6 studies spontaneously broken supersymmetry and the pure Goldstino
action. A general approach to constructing explicit field redefinitions is used
to relate all known models of the Goldstino and to study their nonlinear
supersymmetries. This approach is also used to construct the most general pure
Goldstino action and to examine its supersymmetry transformations. Finally, a
new embedding of the Goldstino into a complex linear superfield is presented.
Its interactions to matter and gravity are examined and compared to existing
Goldstino superfield constructions.

smoothness structure for the space-time. Here we consider a space-time with
topology $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$. In case of an exotic $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$,
there is a change in the spatial topology from a 3-sphere to a homology
3-sphere which can carry a hyperbolic structure. From the physical point of
view, we will discuss the path integral for the Einstein-Hilbert action with
respect to a decomposition of the space-time. The inclusion of the boundary
terms produces fermionic contributions to the partition function. The
expectation value of an area (with respect to some surface) shows an
exponential increase, i.e. we obtain inflationary behavior. We will calculate
the amount of this increase to be a topological invariant. Then we will
describe this transition by an effective model, the Starobinski or $R^{2}$
model which is consistent with the current measurement of the Planck satellite.
The spectral index and other observables are also calculated. Finally we obtain
a realistic cosmological constant.

Hinode/SOT is a unique resource to derive statistical properties of pores using
advanced digital image processing techniques. The study is based on two data
sets: (1) Photometric and morphological properties inferred from single G-band
images cover almost seven years from 2006 October 25 to 2013 August 31. (2)
Horizontal flow fields have been derived from 356 one-hour sequences of G-band
images using LCT for a shorter period of time from 2006 November 3 to 2008
January 6 comprising 13 active regions.
  A total of 7643/2863 (single/time-averaged) pores builds the foundation of
the statistical analysis. Pores are preferentially observed at low latitudes in
the southern hemisphere during the deep minimum of solar cycle No. 23. This
imbalance reverses during the rise of cycle No. 24, when the pores migrate from
high to low latitudes. Pores are rarely encountered in quiet-Sun G-band images,
and only about 10% of pores exists in isolation. In general, pores do not
exhibit a circular shape. Typical aspect ratios of the semi-major and -minor
axes are 3:2 when ellipses are fitted to pores. Smaller pores (more than
two-thirds are smaller than 5~Mm^2) tend to be more circular, and their
boundaries are less corrugated. Both area and perimeter length of pores obey
log-normal frequency distributions. The frequency distribution of the intensity
can be reproduced by two Gaussians representing dark and bright components.
Bright features resembling umbral dots and even light-bridges cover about 20%
of the pore's area. Averaged radial profiles show a peak of the intensity at
normalized radius R_N = r /R_pore = 2.1, followed by maxima of the divergence
at R_N= 2.3 and the radial component of the horizontal velocity at R_N= 4.6.
The divergence is negative within pores.

that the nonlocal aspect of gravity in this theory can simulate dark matter;
indeed, in the Newtonian regime of nonlocal gravity, we recover the
phenomenological Tohline-Kuhn approach to modified gravity. A simple
generalization of the Kuhn kernel in the context of nonlocal general relativity
leads to a two-parameter modified Newtonian force law that involves an
additional repulsive Yukawa-type interaction. We determine the parameters of
our nonlocal kernel by comparing the predictions of the theory with
observational data regarding the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The
best-fitting stellar mass-to-light ratio turns out to be in agreement with
astrophysical models; moreover, our results are consistent with the
Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies. Light deflection in nonlocal gravity
is consistent with general relativity at Solar System scales, while beyond
galactic scales an enhanced deflection angle is predicted that is compatible
with lensing by the effective ""dark matter"". Furthermore, we extend our results
to the internal dynamics of rich clusters of galaxies and show that the
dynamical mass of the cluster obtained from nonlocal gravity is consistent with
the measured baryonic mass.

Ejection (CME) on 2011 June 7. The material formed discrete concentrations, or
blobs, in the corona and fell back to the surface, appearing as dark clouds
against the bright corona. In this work we examined the density and dynamic
evolution of these blobs in order to formally assess the intriguing morphology
displayed throughout their descent. The blobs were studied in five wavelengths
(94, 131, 171, 193 and 211 \AA) using the Solar Dynamics Observatory
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), comparing background emission to
attenuated emission as a function of wavelength to calculate column densities
across the descent of four separate blobs. We found the material to have a
column density of hydrogen of approximately 2 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$,
which is comparable with typical pre-eruption filament column densities.
Repeated splitting of the returning material is seen in a manner consistent
with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Furthermore, the observed distribution of
density and its evolution are also a signature of this instability. By
approximating the three-dimensional geometry (with data from STEREO-A),
volumetric densities were found to be approximately 2 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ g
cm$^{-3}$, and this, along with observed dominant length-scales of the
instability, was used to infer a magnetic field of the order 1 G associated
with the descending blobs.

boundary on the equilibrium conformation. In gel sheet the boundary provides a
residual strain which leads to re-distribution of stress and impacts the shape
of equilibrium conformation accordingly. For sheet with boundary, the in-plane
stretching energy is far larger than the bending energy in some cases. It is
intrinsic different from closed membrane. In gel sheets, the boundary doesn't
only quantitatively amend to the elastic energy. The residual strain on
boundary cooperates with bending and stretching to determine the equilibrium
conformation rather than just the last two factors. Furthermore, on the
boundary of gel sheet, there is an additional energy induced by boundary line
tension $\gamma $. If $\gamma =0$, there is $10\%$ difference of elastic energy
from the experimental result. Finally, we discuss the effects of such line
tension $\gamma $ and propose a way to measure it by the border radius. It
redounds to study the physical origination of $\gamma $.

to the structure of the proposed schemes, the real and imaginary parts of each
user's symbols may be decoupled without any loss of performance. Finally, our
theoretical claims are corroborated by simulation results and the new IC scheme
for two-user MIMO MAC is shown to outperform the recently proposed two-user IC
scheme especially for high spectral efficiency while requiring significantly
less decoding complexity.

particles produced in proton - proton collisions at LHC energies is presented.
This is done using a thermodynamically consistent form of the Tsallis
distribution. All variables used are thermodynamical and in particular, the
temperature $T$ follows from the standard thermodynamic definition as being the
derivative of the energy with respect to the (Tsallis) entropy. The momentum
distribution of the final state particles obtained describe the transverse
momentum distributions very well. The values of the parameters are determined
from measurements by the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations and are discussed
in detail. In particular, the Tsallis parameter, $q$ is found with consistent
values for all the transverse momentum distributions despite large differences
in kinematic regions and shows a slight increase with beam energy, reaching a
value of 1.15 at 7 TeV. It is concluded that the hadronic system created in
high-energy p - p collisions can be seen as obeying Tsallis thermodynamics.

initially reported to be larger by a factor of 1.63 than the one to the 2+_1
state from lifetime measurements with the Doppler-shift attenuation method
(DSAM) using the (n,n'gamma) reaction [E. Elhami et al., Phys. Rev. C 75,
011301(R) (2007)]. This surprising behavior was recently revised in a new
measurement by the same group using the same experimental technique leading to
a ratio below unity as expected in vibrational nuclei. Purpose: The goal is an
independent determination of the ratio of B(E2) strengths for the transitions
to the 2+_(1,2) states of 94Zr with inelastic electron scattering. Method: The
relative population of the 2+_(1,2) states in (e,e') reactions was measured at
the SDALINAC in a momentum transfer range q = 0.17 - 0.51 fm^(-1) and analyzed
in plane-wave Born approximation with the method described in A. Scheikh Obeid
et al., Phys. Rev. C 87, 014337 (2013). Results: The extracted B(E2) strength
ratio of 0.789(43) between the excitation of the 2+_1 and 2+_2 states of 94Zr
is consistent with but more precise than the latest (n,n'gamma) experiment.
Using the B(E2) transition strength to the first excited state from the
literature a value of 3.9(9) W.u. is deduced for the B(E2; 2+_2 -> 0+_1)
transition. Conclusions: The electron scattering result independently confirms
the latest interpretation of the different (n,n'gamma) results for the
transition to the 2+_2 state in 94Zr.

greatly affect the design of appropriate protocols and protocol stacks in

the vastly differing environment in a mobile adhoc network is highly
problematic for standard TCP. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome
these difficulties. Mobile agent based congestion control Technique is proposed
to avoid congestion in adhoc network. When mobile agent travels through the
network, it can select a less-loaded neighbor node as its next hop and update
the routing table according to the node congestion status. With the aid of
mobile agents, the nodes can get the dynamic network topology in time. In this

presented. The equation contains terms depending on the bottom topography
(there are six new terms in all, three of which are caused by the unevenness of
the bottom). It is obtained in the second order perturbative approach in the
weakly nonlinear, dispersive and long wavelength limit. Only treating all these
terms in the second order perturbation theory made the derivation of this
KdV-type equation possible. The motion of a wave, which starts as a KdV
soliton, is studied according to the new equation in several cases by numerical
simulations. The quantitative changes of a soliton's velocity and amplitude
appear to be directly related to bottom variations. Changes of the soliton's
velocity appear to be almost linearly anticorrelated with changes of water
depth whereas correlation of variation of soliton's amplitude with changes of
water depth looks less linear. When the bottom is flat, the new terms narrow
down the family of exact solutions, but at least one single soliton survives.
This is also checked by numerics.

reduce the impact of anisotropies as is expected. We find a correlation between
an observed peak in the -- occasionally triple-peaked -- spectrum at the

we present here radial velocities for 6392 RC stars. We derive a radial
velocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be
compared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected
velocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is
consistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA
survey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b=-2, closer to
the Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong
evidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0,-1) and (0,-2), possibly
indicative of a high density peak in the central 250 pc of the bulge

there exists some mechanism to sustain the high mass-loss rates of Type IIn

shorter eruptive mass loss events observed in some Type IIn supernova

with $K$ single antenna user terminals (UTs). We consider the problem of

Through analysis we study the impact of system parameters on the optimal EE.
System parameters consists of the average channel gain to the users and the
power consumption parameters (PCPs) (e.g., power consumed by each RF
antenna/receiver at BS). When the average user channel gain is high or else the
BS/UT design is power inefficient, our analysis reveals that it is optimal to
have a few BS antennas and a single user, i.e., non-massive MIMO regime.
Similarly, when the channel gain is small or else the BS/UT design is power
efficient, it is optimal of have a larger (M,K), i.e., massive MIMO regime.
Tight analytical bounds on the optimal EE are proposed for both these regimes.
The impact of the system parameters on the optimal EE is studied and several
interesting insights are drawn.

magnetic field structures, which interact with the near-surface turbulent
convective motions. Furthermore, it is probable that some of these magnetic
fields are generated locally by a convective dynamo mechanism. In addition to
the well-known granular and supergranular convective scales, various
observations have indicated that there is an intermediate scale of convection,
known as mesogranulation, with vertical magnetic flux concentrations
accumulating preferentially at mesogranular boundaries. Our aim is to
investigate the small-scale dynamo properties of a convective flow that
exhibits both granulation and mesogranulation, comparing our findings with
solar observations. Adopting an idealised model for a localised region of quiet
Sun, we use numerical simulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics, in a 3D
Cartesian domain, to investigate the parametric dependence of this system
(focusing particularly upon the effects of varying the aspect ratio and the
Reynolds number). In purely hydrodynamic convection, we find that
mesogranulation is a robust feature of this system provided that the domain is
wide enough to accommodate these large-scale motions. The mesogranular peak in
the kinetic energy spectrum is more pronounced in the higher Reynolds number
simulations. We investigate the dynamo properties of this system in both the
kinematic and the nonlinear regimes and we find that the dynamo is always more
efficient in larger domains, when mesogranulation is present. Furthermore, we
use a filtering technique in Fourier space to demonstrate that it is indeed the
larger scales of motion that are primarily responsible for driving the dynamo.
In the nonlinear regime, the magnetic field distribution compares very
favourably to observations, both in terms of the spatial distribution and the
measured field strengths.

communication and information spreading on a network. Here we investigate the
underlying undirected topology of different biological networks which support
faster spreading of information and are better in communication. We analyze the
good expansion property by using the spectral gap and communicability between
nodes. Different epidemic models are also used to study the transmission of
information in terms of disease spreading through individuals (nodes) in those
networks. More- over, we explore the structural conformation and properties
which may be responsible for better communication. Among all biological
networks studied here, the undirected structure of neuronal networks not only
pos- sesses the small-world property but the same is expressed remarkably to a
higher degree than any randomly generated network which possesses the same
degree sequence. A relatively high percentage of nodes, in neuronal networks,
form a higher core in their structure. Our study shows that the underlying
undirected topology in neuronal networks is significantly qualitatively
different than the same from other biological networks and that they may have
evolved in such a way that they inherit a (undirected) structure which is
excellent and robust in communication.

a Si/SiO$_2$ dielectric coating produced with the ion plating technique. The
ion plating technique is distinct from the standard state-of-the-art ion beam
sputtering technique since it uses a higher processing temperature of about
250$^\circ$C, higher particle energies, and generally results in higher
refractive indices of the deposited films. Our coating stack was fabricated for
a reflectivity of $R=99.95\,\%$ for s-polarized light at $1550\,\rm{nm}$ and
for an angle of incidence of 44$^\circ$. We used the photothermal self-phase
modulation technique to measure the coating absorption in s-polarization and
p-polarization. We obtained $\alpha^{\rm coat}_{s}=(1035 \pm 42)\,\rm{ppm}$ and
$\alpha^{\rm coat}_{p}=(1428 \pm 97)\,\rm{ppm}$. These results correspond to an
absorption coefficient which is lower than literature values for a-Si which
vary from $100\,\rm{/cm}$ up to $2000\,\rm{/cm}$. It is, however, still orders
of magnitude higher than expected for c-Si and thus still too high for GWD

Understanding the heating and cooling mechanisms in these galaxies can give us
insight to the driving mechanisms that fuel the starburst. Molecular emission
lines play a crucial role in the cooling of the excited gas. With SPIRE on the
Herschel Space Observatory we have observed the rich molecular spectrum towards
the central region of NGC 253. CO transitions from J=4-3 to 13-12 are observed
and together with low-J line fluxes from ground based observations, these lines
trace the excitation of CO. By studying the CO excitation ladder and comparing
the intensities to models, we investigate whether the gas is excited by UV
radiation, X-rays, cosmic rays, or turbulent heating. Comparing the $^{12}$CO
and $^{13}$CO observations to large velocity gradient models and PDR models we
find three main ISM phases. We estimate the density, temperature,and masses of
these ISM phases. By adding $^{13}$CO, HCN, and HNC line intensities, we are
able to constrain these degeneracies and determine the heating sources. The
first ISM phase responsible for the low-J CO lines is excited by PDRs, but the
second and third phases, responsible for the mid to high-J CO transitions,
require an additional heating source. We find three possible combinations of
models that can reproduce our observed molecular emission. Although we cannot
determine which of these are preferable, we can conclude that mechanical
heating is necessary to reproduce the observed molecular emission and cosmic
ray heating is a negligible heating source. We then estimate the mass of each
ISM phase; $6\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$ for phase 1 (low-J CO lines), $3\times
10^7$ M$_\odot$ for phase 2 (mid-J CO lines), and $9\times 10^6$ M$_\odot$ for
phase 3 (high-J CO lines) for a total system mass of $1\times10^{8}$ M$_\odot$.

approach is thoroughly reviewed, and the strengths and shortcomings of D-CTCs

equivalent predictions to D-CTCs, while avoiding some of the difficulties of

P-CTCs is used to motivate an analysis of the features one might require of a
theory of quantum time travel, following which two overlapping classes of new
theories are identified. One such theory, the theory of ""transition

not to have certain undesirable features---such as time travel paradoxes, the
ability to distinguish non-orthogonal states with certainty, and the ability to
clone or delete arbitrary pure states---that are present with D-CTCs and

photometric observations for this source. The light curves show that the
variability amplitudes in $\gamma$-ray and optical bands are larger than those
in the hard X-ray and radio bands and that the spectral energy distribution
(SED) peaks move to shorter wavelengths when the source becomes brighter, which
are similar to other blazars, i.e., more variable at wavelengths shorter than
the SED peak frequencies. Analysis shows that the characteristic variability
timescales in the 14.5 GHz, the optical, the X-ray, and the $\gamma$-ray bands
are comparable to each other. The variations of the hard X-ray and 14.5 GHz
emissions are correlated with zero-lag, so are the V band and $\gamma$-ray
variations, which are consistent with the leptonic models. Coincidences of
$\gamma$-ray and optical flares with a dramatic change of the optical
polarization are detected. Hadronic models do not have the same nature
explanation for these observations as the leptonic models. A strong optical
flare correlating a $\gamma$-ray flare whose peak flux is lower than the
average flux is detected. Leptonic model can explain this variability
phenomenon through simultaneous SED modeling. Different leptonic models are
distinguished by average SED modeling. The synchrotron plus synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) model is ruled out due to the extreme input parameters.
Scattering of external seed photons, such as the hot dust or broad line region
emission, and the SSC process are probably both needed to explain the

semiconductor laser on the basis of a model with intensity coupling. The
dynamics, coupled to the constraints of the system and the below-threshold
initial conditions, imposes a faster growth of the side modes in the initial
stages of the transient, thereby leading the laser through a sequence of states
where the modal intensity distribution dramatically differs from the asymptotic
one. A detailed analysis of the below-threshold, deterministic dynamical
evolution allows us to explain the modal dynamics in the strongly coupled
regime where the total intensity peak and relaxation oscillations take place,
thus providing an explanation for the modal dynamics observed in the slow,
hidden evolution towards the asymptotic state (cf. Phys. Rev. A 85, 043823
(2012)). The dynamics of this system can be interpreted as the transient
response of a driven, globally coupled ensemble of nonlinear modes evolving
towards an equilibrium state. Since the qualitative dynamics do not depend on
the details of the interaction but only on the structure of the coupling, our
results hold for a whole class of globally, bilinearly coupled oscillators.

$L$ in $M$. Thomas and Yau math.DG/0104196, math.DG/0104197 conjectured that
there should be a notion of ""stability"" for such $L$, and that if $L$ is stable
then Lagrangian mean curvature flow $\{L^t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$ with $L^0=L$
should exist for all time, and $L^\infty=\lim_{t\to\infty}L^t$ should be the
unique special Lagrangian in the Hamiltonian isotopy class of $L$. This paper
is an attempt to update the Thomas-Yau conjectures, and discuss related issues.
  It is a folklore conjecture that there exists a Bridgeland stability
condition $(Z,\mathcal P)$ on the derived Fukaya category $D^b\mathcal F(M)$ of
$M$, such that an isomorphism class in $D^b\mathcal F(M)$ is $(Z,\mathcal
P)$-semistable if (and possibly only if) it contains a special Lagrangian,
which must then be unique.
  We conjecture that if $(L,E,b)$ is an object in an enlarged version of
$D^b\mathcal F(M)$, where $L$ is a compact, graded Lagrangian in $M$ (possibly
immersed, or with ""stable singularities""), $E\to M$ a rank one local system,
and $b$ a bounding cochain for $(L,E)$ in Lagrangian Floer cohomology, then
there is a unique family $\{(L^t,E^t,b^t):t\in[0,\infty)\}$ such that
$(L^0,E^0,b^0)=(L,E,b)$, and $(L^t,E^t,b^t)\cong(L,E,b)$ in $D^b\mathcal F(M)$
for all $t$, and $\{L^t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$ satisfies Lagrangian MCF with
surgeries at singular times $T_1,T_2,\dots,$ and in graded Lagrangian integral
currents we have $\lim_{t\to\infty}L^t=L_1+\cdots+L_n$, where $L_j$ is a
special Lagrangian integral current of phase $e^{i\pi\phi_j}$ for
$\phi_1>\cdots>\phi_n$, and $(L_1,\phi_1),\ldots,(L_n,\phi_n)$ correspond to
the decomposition of $(L,E,b)$ into $(Z,\mathcal P)$-semistable objects.
  We also give detailed conjectures on the nature of the singularities of
Lagrangian MCF that occur at the finite singular times $T_1,T_2,\ldots.$

It was shown that an abnormal transport is a consequence of the equilibrium
distortion and not stationary diffusion. The particular case of fixed

that a system structure can resist a weak disturbance in the vicinity of the
