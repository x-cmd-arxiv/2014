is to determine whether there exists a sequence of feasible solutions
connecting given feasible solutions $s$ and $t$ such that each pair of
consecutive solutions is adjacent according to a specified adjacency relation.
Two dominating sets are adjacent if one can be formed from the other by the
addition or deletion of a single vertex.
  For various values of $k$, we consider properties of $D_k(G)$, the graph
consisting of a vertex for each dominating set of size at most $k$ and edges
specified by the adjacency relation. Addressing an open question posed by Haas

connected, for $\Gamma(G)$ the maximum cardinality of a minimal dominating set

bounded tree-width, or $b$-partite for $b \ge 3$. Moreover, we construct an
infinite family of graphs such that $D_{\gamma(G)+1}(G)$ has exponential
diameter, for $\gamma(G)$ the minimum size of a dominating set. On the positive

mechanisms in stabilizing both magnetic and ferroelectric orderings. The (x, T)
phase diagram reflects the effect of lattice distortions induced by the
substitution of $Gd^{3+}$ ion by smaller $Y^{3+}$ ion, which gradually
unbalances the antiferromagnetic against the ferromagnetic exchange
interactions, enabling the emergence of ferroelectricity for higher
concentrations of yttrium. For $x \leq 0.1$, the paramagnetic phase is followed
by a presumably incommensurate collinear antiferromagnetic phase, then a weak
ferromagnetic canted A-type antiferromagnetic ordering is established at lower
temperatures.For $0.2 \leq x \leq 0.4$, a different phase sequence is obtained.
The canted A-type antiferromagnetic arrangement is no more stable, and instead
a pure antiferromagnetic ordering is stabilized below T$_{lock}$ $\approx$ 14 -
17 K, with an improper ferroelectric character. From these results, a cycloid
modulated spin arrangement at low temperatures is proposed, accordingly to the

contact-instantons arise as non-perturbative contributions. In this note, we
revisit such configurations and discuss their generalizations. We propose for
contact-instantons a cohomological theory whose BRST observables are invariants
of the background contact geometry. To make the formalism more concrete, we
study the moduli problem of contact- instanton, and we find that it is closely
related to the eqiuivariant index of a canonical Dirac-Kohn operator associated
to the geometry. An integral formula is given when the geometry is K-contact.
We also discuss the relation to 5d N = 1 super-Yang- Mills, and by studying a
contact-instanton solution canonical to the background geometry, we discuss a
possible connection between N = 1 theory and contact homology. We also uplift
the 5d theory a 6d cohomological theory which localizes to
Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau instantons when placed on special geometry.

the development of a more complete formulation of the calculation of this
effect. While most effects on the CMB anisotropies are widely studied through
direct solutions of the Boltzmann equation, the non-linear effect of CMB
lensing is formulated through the solutions of the geodesic equation. In this
paper, we present a new formalism to the calculation of the lensing effect by
\emph{directly solving the Boltzmann equation}, as we did in the calculation of
the CMB anisotropies at recombination. In particular, we developed a
diagrammatic approach to efficiently keep track of all the interaction terms
and calculate all possible non-trivial correlations to arbitrary high orders.
Using this formalism, we explicitly articulate the approximations required to
recover the usual remapping approach used in current studies of the weak
lensing. In addition, we point out additional unexplored corrections that are
manifest in our formalism to which experiments may be sensitive. As an example,
we calculate the correction to the CMB temperature power spectrum for the
\emph{lens-lens} coupling effects which are neglected in standard calculations.
We find that the correction is $\lesssim 0.1\%$ of the CMB temperature power
spectrum for $\ell$ up to 3000 and thus is comparable to the cosmic variance.

but with orbital elements typical for a member of the inner asteroid Main Belt.
  We monitored the object from 2013 Aug. 30 until Oct. 05 using the CFHT, NTT,
CA 1.23m, Perkins 1.8m (Lowell), and the 0.6m TRAPPIST telescopes. We measured
its nuclear radius to be r < 0.25-0.29km, and its colours g-r = 0.58+/-0.05 and
r-i = 0.23+/-0.06, typical for an S-class asteroid. We failed to detect any
rotational light curve, with an amplitude < 0.05mag and a double-peaked
rotation period < 20h. A detailed Finson-Probstein analysis of deep NTT and
CFHT images indicated that the object was active since at least late January
2013 until the time of the latest observations in 2013 September, with at least
two peaks of activity around 2013 June 14+/-10d and 2013 July 22+/-3d. The
changes of activity level and the activity peaks were extremely sharp and
short, shorter than the temporal resolution of our observations (about 1d). The
dust distribution was similar during these two events, with dust grains
covering at least the 1-1000{\mu}m range. The total mass ejected in grains <1mm
was estimated to be 3.0 10$^6$kg and 2.6 10$^7$kg around the two activity
peaks.
  Rotational disruption cannot be ruled out as the cause of the dust ejection.
We also propose that the components of a contact binary might gently rub and
produce the observed emission. Volatile sublimation might also explain what
appears as cometary activity over a period of 8 months. However, while Main
Belt comets best explained by ice sublimation are found in the outskirts of the
Main Belt, where water ice is believed to be able to survive buried in
moderately large objects for the age of the solar system deeply, the presence
of volatiles in an object smaller than 300m in radius would be very surprising

distributed detection schemes over fully decentralized networks. The combined
attributes of cooperation and adaptation are necessary to enable networks of
detectors to continually learn from streaming data and to continually track
drifts in the state of nature when deciding in favor of one hypothesis or
another. The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the
steady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow
adaptation regime, when the agents interact with each other according to
distributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes. The latter are
critical to enable continuous adaptation and learning. The work establishes
three key results. First, it is shown that the output of the collaborative
process at each agent has a steady-state distribution. Second, it is shown that
this distribution is asymptotically Gaussian in the slow adaptation regime of
small step-sizes. And third, by carrying out a detailed large deviations
analysis, closed-form expressions are derived for the decaying rates of the
false-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. Interesting insights are gained.
In particular, it is verified that as the step-size $\mu$ decreases, the error
probabilities are driven to zero exponentially fast as functions of $1/\mu$,
and that the error exponents increase linearly in the number of agents. It is
also verified that the scaling laws governing errors of detection and errors of
estimation over networks behave very differently, with the former having an
exponential decay proportional to $1/\mu$, while the latter scales linearly
with decay proportional to $\mu$. It is shown that the cooperative strategy
allows each agent to reach the same detection performance, in terms of
detection error exponents, of a centralized stochastic-gradient solution.

this method rapidly deteriorates with increasing noise and thus calls for a
more robust procedure that combines signal detection and field estimation. We
introduce an estimation method that provides not only the effective or mean
longitudinal magnetic field from an observed Stokes V profile but also uses the
net absolute polarization of the profile to obtain an estimate of the apparent
(i.e., velocity resolved) absolute longitudinal magnetic field. By combining
the COG method with an orthogonal-matching-pursuit (OMP) approach, we were able
to decompose observed Stokes profiles with an overcomplete dictionary of
wavelet-basis functions to reliably reconstruct the observed Stokes profiles in
the presence of noise. The elementary wave functions of the sparse
reconstruction process were utilized to estimate the effective longitudinal
magnetic field and the apparent absolute longitudinal magnetic field. A
multiresolution analysis complements the OMP algorithm to provide a robust

the reliability and accuracy of the magnetic OMP approach.

between exposure and outcome. Conventional estimation methods require complete
knowledge about all the instruments' validity; a valid instrument must not have
a direct effect on the outcome and not be related to unmeasured confounders.
Often, this is impractical as highlighted by Mendelian randomization studies
where genetic markers are used as instruments and complete knowledge about
instruments' validity is equivalent to complete knowledge about the involved
genes' functions.
  In this paper, we propose a method for estimation of causal effects when this
complete knowledge is absent. It is shown that causal effects are identified
and can be estimated as long as less than $50$% of instruments are invalid,
without knowing which of the instruments are invalid. We also introduce
conditions for identification when the 50% threshold is violated. A fast
penalized $\ell_1$ estimation method, called sisVIVE, is introduced for
estimating the causal effect without knowing which instruments are valid, with
theoretical guarantees on its performance. The proposed method is demonstrated
on simulated data and a real Mendelian randomization study concerning the
effect of body mass index on health-related quality of life index. An R package
\emph{sisVIVE} is available online.

  Systems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When designing optimal controllers for any system, it is often the case that
the true state of the system is unknown to the controller, for example due to
noisy measurements or partially observable states. Incomplete state information
must be taken into account in the controller's design in order to preserve its
optimality. The same is true when performing reachability calculations. To
estimate the probability that the state of a stochastic system reaches, or
stays within, some set of interest in a given time horizon, it is necessary to
find a controller (or at least prove one exists) that drives the system to that
set with maximum probability. This controller, however, does not have access to
the true state of the system. To date, little work has been done on stochastic
reachability calculations with partially observable states. What work has been
done relies on converting the reachability optimization problem to one with an
additive cost function, for which theoretical results are well known. Our
approach is to preserve the multiplicative cost structure when deriving a
sufficient statistic that reduces the problem to one of perfect state
information. Our transformation includes a change of measure that simplifies
the distribution of the sufficient statistic conditioned on its previous value.
We develop a dynamic programming recursion for the solution of the equivalent
perfect information problem, proving that the recursion is valid, an optimal
solution exists, and results in the same solution as to the original problem.
We also show that our results are equivalent to those for the reformulated
additive cost problem, and so such a reformulation is not required.

  Methods: To investigate the efficiency of each of the integration methods
considered here, a test suite of temperature and density versus time profiles
is used. This suite provides a range of situations ranging from constant
temperature and density to the dramatically varying conditions present in white
dwarf mergers, novae, and x-ray bursts. Some of these profiles are obtained
separately from full hydrodynamic calculations. The integration efficiencies
are investigated with respect to input parameters that constrain the desired
accuracy and precision.
  Results: Gear's backward differentiation method is found to improve accuracy,
performance, and stability in integrating nuclear reaction networks. For
temperature-density profiles that vary strongly with time, it is found to
outperform the Bader-Deuflehard method (although that method is very powerful
for more smoothly varying profiles). Wagoner's method, while relatively fast
for many scenarios, exhibits hard-to-predict inaccuracies for some choices of
integration parameters owing to its lack of error estimations.

explain the sn stars, although this scenario was subsequently questioned. We
aim to derive abundances for a sample of 9 stars, including sn and non-sn
stars, to determine the possible relation between sn and CP stars. We analysed
the photospheric chemical composition of sn stars and show that approximately
40% of them display chemical peculiarities (such as He-weak and HgMn stars)
within a range of temperature of 10300 - 14500 K. We have studied the possible
contribution of different processes to the broad He I lines present in the sn
stars. Although NLTE effects could not be completely ruled out, it seems that
NLTE is not directly related to the broad He I profiles observed in the sn
stars. The broad-line He I 4026 is the clearest example of the sn
characteristics in our sample. We succesfully fit this line in 4 out of 7 sn
stars by using the appropriate Stark broadening tables, while small differences
appear in the other 3 stars. Studying the plots of abundance vs depth for the
He I lines resulted in some sn stars probably being stratified in He. However,
a further study of variability in the He I lines would help for determining
whether a possible non-uniform He superficial distribution could also play a
role in these sn stars. We conclude that the broad He I lines that characterize
the sn class could be modelled (at least in some of these stars) by the usual
radiative transfer process with Stark broadening, without needing another
broadening mechanism. The observed line broadening in sn stars seems to be
related to the ""normal"" He line formation that originates in these atmospheres.

is to study quantitative properties of graphs in a slightly different way than
it is in the standard definition of expanders. While in the definition of
expanders it is required that the number of edges between any pair of
sufficiently large sets is close to the expected number, we consider partitions
and require this condition only for most of the pairs of blocks. As a result,
the blocks can be substantially smaller.
  We show that for some range of parameters, to be a partition expander a
random graph needs exponentially smaller degree than any expander would require
in order to achieve similar expanding properties.
  We apply the concept of partition expanders in communication complexity.
First, we give a PRG for the SMP model of the optimal seed length, n+O(log k).
Second, we compare the model of SMP to that of Simultaneous Two-Way
Communication, and give a new separation that is stronger both qualitatively
and quantitatively than the previously known ones.

optical pulse with graphene is determined by strong wave vector dependence of
the interband dipole matrix elements, which are singular at the Dirac points of
graphene. The electron dynamics in optical pulse is highly irreversible with
large residual population of the conduction band. The residual conduction band
population as a function of the wave vector is nonuniform with a few localized
spots of high conduction band population. The spots are located near the Dirac
points and the number of spots depends on the pulse intensity. The optical
pulse propagating through graphene layer generates finite transferred charge,
which, as a function of pulse intensity, changes its sign. At small pulse
intensity, the charge is transferred in the direction of the pulse maximum,
while at large pulse intensity, the direction of the charge transfer is
opposite to the direction of pulse maximum. This property opens unique
possibility of controlling the direction of the charge transfer by variation of
the pulse intensity.

approach for studying the chemo-odynamical evolution in disk galaxies, focusing
on the Milky Way. Here we extend these results to different distances from the
Galactic center, looking for variations of observables that can be related to
on-going and future spectroscopic surveys. By separating the effects of
kinematic heating and radial migration, we show that migration is much more
important, even for the oldest and hottest stellar population. The
distributions of stellar birth guiding radii and final guiding radii
(signifying contamination from migration and heating, respectively) widen with
increasing distance from the Galactic center. As a result, the slope in the
age-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than
solar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show
significant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the
mixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is
found from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to
negative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk
plane. We relate this to the combined effect of (i) the predominance of young
stars close to the disk plane and old stars away from it, (ii) the more
concentrated older stellar component, and (iii) the flaring of mono-age disk
populations. We also investigate the effect of recycled gas flows on the mean
[Fe/H] and find that in the region 4<r<12 kpc the introduced errors are less
than 0.05-0.1 dex, related to the fact that inward and outward flows mostly
cancel in that radial range. We show that radial migration cannot compete with
the inside-out formation of the disk, exposed by the more centrally
concentrated older disk populations, and consistent with recent observations.

embedded in extended halos of dark matter, much of it formed by the infall of
smaller systems at earlier times. The true extent of a galaxy remains poorly
determined, with the virial radius (R_vir) providing a characteristic
separation between collapsed structures in dynamical equilibrium and external
infalling matter. Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational
influence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and
""galactopause"" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of
outflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed
to define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,
M_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at
""assembly redshifts"" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and
dark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean
R_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS
detections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the
Milky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153
(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03. The frequency
per unit redshift of low-redshift O VI absorption lines in QSO spectra suggests
absorber sizes ~150 kpc when related to intervening 0.1L* galaxies. This
formalism is intended to clarify semantic differences arising from observations
of extended gas in galactic halos, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and filaments

hypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. According
to general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes the
gravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive this
potential in different ways depending on their properties. Cluster galaxy
velocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereas
photon trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potential
plus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. We exploit
this phenomenon to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of the
fluid, primarily DM, contained in galaxy clusters. We use the complementary
information provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxy
cluster MACS 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging and
spectroscopic campaign within the CLASH survey. The unprecedented high quality
of our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determine
the EoS parameter of the cluster fluid. Since baryons contribute at most $15\%$
to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the EoS
parameter we derive describes the behavior of the DM fluid. We obtain the most
stringent constraint on the DM EoS parameter to date,

absorption bands can be good tracers of chromospheric activity in brown dwarfs.
In our previous study, we found that there are difficulties in explaining
entire spectra between 1.0 and 5.0 microns with the Unified Cloudy Model (UCM),
a brown dwarf atmosphere model. Based on simple radiative equilibrium,
temperature in a model atmosphere usually decreases monotonically with height.
However, if a brown dwarf has a chromosphere, as inferred by some observations,
the temperature in the upper atmosphere is higher. We construct a simple model
that takes into account heating due to chromospheric activity by setting a
temperature floor in an upper atmosphere, and find that the model spectra of 3
brown dwarfs with moderate H-alpha emission, an indicator of chromospheric
activity, are considerably improved to match the AKARI spectra. Because of the
higher temperatures in the upper atmospheres, the amount of CH_4 molecules is
reduced and the absorption band strengths become weaker. The strengths of the
absorption bands of H_2O and CO also become weaker. On the other hand, other
objects with weak H-alpha emission cannot be fitted by our treatment. We also
briefly discuss magnetic heating processes which possibly operate in upper
atmospheres, by extending our numerical simulations for the Sun and stars with
surface convection to brown dwarf atmospheres.

collapse of gas in T_{vir} > 10^4 K halos; however, this requires the
suppression of H_2 cooling to prevent fragmentation. In this paper, we examine
a proposed new mechanism for this suppression which relies on cold-mode
accretion flows leading to shocks at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^{-3}) and
temperatures (T > 10^4 K). In such gas, H_2 is efficiently collisionally
dissociated. We use high-resolution numerical simulations to test this idea,
demonstrating that such halos typically have lower temperature progenitors, in
which cooling is efficient. Those halos do show filamentary flows; however, the
gas shocks at or near the virial radius (at low densities), thus preventing the
proposed collisional mechanism from operating. We do find that, if we
artificially suppress H_2 formation with a high UV background, so as to allow
gas in the halo center to enter the high-temperature, high-density ""zone of no
return"", it will remain there even if the UV flux is turned off, collapsing to
high density at high temperature. Due to computational limitations, we
simulated only three halos. However, we demonstrate, using Monte Carlo
calculations of 10^6 halo merger histories, that a few rare halos could
assemble rapidly enough to avoid efficient H_2 cooling in all of their
progenitor halos, provided that the UV background exceeds J_{21} ~ few at
redshifts as high as z ~ 20.

escapes a black hole; an important question is to identify the mechanism or

radiation with average energy flux matching Hawking's. Information can be
encoded with no change in net flux via fine-grained modulation of the Hawking
radiation. In an approximate effective field theory description, couplings to
the stress tensor of the black hole atmosphere that depend on the internal
state of the black hole are a promising alternative for inducing such
modulation. These can be picturesquely thought of as due to state-dependent
metric fluctuations in the vicinity of the horizon. Such couplings offer the
prospect of emitting information without extra energy flux, and can be shown to
do so at linear order in the couplings, with motivation given for possible
extension of this result to higher orders. The potential advantages of such
couplings to the stress tensor thus extend beyond their universality, which is
helpful in addressing constraints from black hole mining.

the question remains how absorption modifies the transmission channels in

on the maximal transmission and minimal reflection channels in a
two-dimensional disordered waveguide. In the weak absorption regime, where the
system length is less than the diffusive absorption length, the maximal
transmission channel is dominated by diffusive transport and it is equivalent
to the minimal reflection channel. Its frequency bandwidth is determined by the
underlying quasimode width. However, when the absorption is strong, light
transport in the maximal transmission channel undergoes a sharp transition and
becomes ballistic-like transport. Its frequency bandwidth increases with
absorption, and the exact scaling varies with the sample's realization. The
minimal reflection channel becomes different from the maximal transmission
channel and becomes dominated by absorption. Counterintuitively, we observe in
some samples that the minimum reflection eigenvalue increases with absorption.

that moving the domain wall to different locations in a Josephson junction will
change the quantum ground state from being in a 0 state to a $\pi$ state.
Remarkably, we also show that domain wall motion can be used to turn on and off
superconductivity: the position of the domain wall determines the critical
temperature $T_c$ and thus if the system is in a resistive state or not,
causing even a quantum phase transition between the dissipationless and normal

X-ray peak, has been named the EUV late phase. These flares have the distinct
properties of i) having a complex magnetic field structure with two initial
sets of coronal loops, with one upper set overlaying a lower set, ii) having an
eruptive flare initiated in the lower set and disturbing both loop sets, iii)
having the hot coronal emissions emitted only from the lower set, and iv)
having the first peak of the warm coronal emissions associated with the lower
set and its second peak emitted from the upper set much later. The disturbance
of the coronal loops by the eruption is at about the same time, but the
relaxation and cooling down of the heated coronal loops during the post-flare
reconnections have different time scales with the longer, upper loops being
significantly delayed from the lower loops. The difference in these cooling
time scales is related to the difference between the two peak times of the warm
coronal emission and is also apparent in the decay profile of the X-ray
emissions having two distinct decays, with the first decay slope being steeper
and the delayed decay slope being smaller during the time of the warm coronal
emission second peak. The frequency and relationship of the EUV late-phase
decay times between the Fe XVI two flare peaks and X-ray decay slopes are
examined using three years of SDO/EVE data, and the X-ray dual-decay character

the initial deformation-induced microstructure can be dominated by parallel
lamellae of epsilon martensite or mechanical twinning, which cannot efficiently
provide nucleation sites for strain-induced martensite. Hence, alpha martensite
nucleation occurs independently by a stress-assisted process that enhances
transformation-induced plasticity in ultrafine-grained austenite. This
metallurgical principle was validated experimentally by using a combination of

linearized gravitational field equations in Minkowski spacetime, with source
given by a particle moving on a null geodesic. In the scalar case and in the
Lorenz gauge in the electromagnetic and gravitational cases, the retarded
integral over the infinite past of the source does not converge as a
distribution, so we cut off the null source suitably at a finite time $t_0$ and
then consider two different limits: (i) the limit as the observation point goes
to null infinity at fixed $t_0$, from which the ``$1/r$'' part of the fields
can be extracted and (ii) the limit $t_0 \to - \infty$ at fixed ``observation
point.'' The limit (i) gives rise to a ``velocity kick'' on distant test
particles in the scalar and electromagnetic cases, and it gives rise to a
``memory effect'' (i.e., a permanent change in relative separation of two test
particles) in the linearized gravitational case, in agreement with previous
analyses. Although the second limit does not exist for the Lorenz gauge
potentials in the electromagnetic and linearized gravitational cases, we obtain
a well defined distributional limit for the electromagnetic field strength and
for the linearized Riemann tensor. In the gravitational case, this limit agrees
with the Aichelberg-Sexl solution, but there is no ``memory effect'' associated
with this limiting solution. This strongly suggests that the memory
effect---including nonlinear memory effect of Christodoulou---should not be
interpreted as arising simply from the passage of (effective) null stress
energy to null infinity but rather as arising from a ``burst of radiation''
associated with the creation of the null stress-energy (as in case (i) above)
or, more generally, with radiation present in the spacetime that was not
``produced'' by the null stress-energy.

inducing superconductivity in half of the wire, which can be tuned at will from
trivial to topological with a parallel magnetic field, while a perpendicular
field is used to gap out the normal part, except for two spatially separated
chiral channels. The combination of chiral mode transport and perfect Andreev

structures. Over the past decade, this empirical observation motivated the
investigation of detection, measurement, and modeling techniques to exploit
these low-dimensional intrinsic structures, yielding numerous implications for
high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and signal processing. Manifold
learning (where the low-dimensional structure is a manifold) and dictionary
learning (where the low-dimensional structure is the set of sparse linear
combinations of vectors from a finite dictionary) are two prominent theoretical
and computational frameworks in this area. Despite their ostensible
distinction, the recently-introduced Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA)
provides a robust, computationally efficient, multiscale procedure for
simultaneously learning manifolds and dictionaries.
  In this work, we prove non-asymptotic probabilistic bounds on the
approximation error of GMRA for a rich class of data-generating statistical
models that includes ""noisy"" manifolds, thereby establishing the theoretical
robustness of the procedure and confirming empirical observations. In
particular, if a dataset aggregates near a low-dimensional manifold, our
results show that the approximation error of the GMRA is completely independent
of the ambient dimension. Our work therefore establishes GMRA as a provably
fast algorithm for dictionary learning with approximation and sparsity
guarantees. We include several numerical experiments confirming these
theoretical results, and our theoretical framework provides new tools for
assessing the behavior of manifold learning and dictionary learning procedures
on a large class of interesting models.

are affected by materials defects and nonidealities. We present measurements of
the conductance slope for various InAs/GaSb heterojunctions via two-terminal
electrical measurements, which removes three-terminal parasitics and enables
direct study on the effect of microstructure on tunnelling. Using this, we can
predict how subthreshold swings in TFETs can depend on microstructure. We also
demonstrate growth and electrical characterization for structures grown by
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) - a generally more scalable
process compared to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We determine that misfit
dislocations and point defects near the interface can lead to energy states in
the band-gap and local band bending that result in trap-assisted leakage routes
and nonuniform band alignment across the junction area that lower the steepness
of the conductance slope. Despite the small lattice mismatch, misfit
dislocations still form in InAs on GaSb due to relaxation as a result of large
strain from intermixed compositions. This can be circumvented by growing GaSb
on InAs, straining the GaSb underlayer, or lowering the InAs growth temperature
in the region of the interface. The conductance slope can also be improved by
annealing the samples at higher temperatures, which we believe acts to
annihilate point defects and average out major fluctuations in band alignment
across the interface. Using a combination of these techniques, we can greatly
improve the steepness of the conductance slope which could result in steeper
subthreshold swings in TFETs in the future.

existence of a converging radial flow that significantly intensifies the flow
rotation. Evolution and amplification of the vorticity present in the flow play
important roles in the formation of the vortex. When rotation in the flow
becomes sufficiently strong - and this implies validity of the strong swirl
approximation developed by Einstein and Li (1951), Lewellen (1962), Turner
(1966) and Lundgren (1985) - the analysis of Klimenko (2001a-c) and of the
present work determine that further amplification of vorticity is moderated by
interactions of vorticity and velocity. This imposes physical constraints on
the flow resulting in the so-called compensating regime, where the radial
distribution of the axial vorticity is characterised by the 4/3 and 3/2 power
laws. This asymptotic treatment of a strong swirl is based on vorticity
equations and involves higher order terms. This treatment incorporates
multiscale analysis indicating downstream relaxation of the flow to the
compensating regime. The present work also investigates and takes into account
viscous and transient effects. One of the main points of this work is the
applicability of the power laws of the compensating regime to intermediate
regions in large atmospheric vortices, such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes.

compactly as planning instances, the paths are usually represented explicitly

all major cities in developed countries. To tackle this problem, it is possible
(i) to act on the supply side, increasing the number of roads or lanes in a
network, (ii) to reduce the demand, restricting the access to urban areas at
specific hours or to specific vehicles, or (iii) to improve the efficiency of
the existing network, by means of a widespread use of so-called Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS). In line with the recent advances in smart
transportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising
field of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular,
multiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and
implementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous
agents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby
generating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system
and maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms
for the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.
  In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the
management of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous
vehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact
with the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the
road network. Building on the reservation-based intersection control model
proposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a
single intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we
analyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for
the allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a
traffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers
route choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that
integrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive
traffic assignment strategy.

depressions. Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the
heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a
solution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA*, easily become trapped
in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be
updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art
real-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA* or LRTA*(k), improve LRTA*s
mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those
algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions.
This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle
to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a
heuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be
implemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies
on top of LSS-LRTA* and RTAA*, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search
algorithms: aLSS-LRTA*, daLSS-LRTA*, aRTAA*, and daRTAA*. When the objective is
to find a single solution by running the real-time search algorithm once, we
show that daLSS-LRTA* and daRTAA* outperform their predecessors sometimes by
one order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA* produces the best
solutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning

finite search spaces, they find a solution if one exists, and converge to an
optimal after a number of trials.

tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning. COLIN combines
FF-style forward chaining search, with the use of a Linear Program (LP) to
check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at

problems described in declarative languages giving the action preconditions and
effects. One important application area for such technology is the creation of
new processes in Business Process Management (BPM), which is essential in an
ever more dynamic business environment. A major obstacle for the application of
Planning in this area lies in the modeling. Obtaining a suitable model to plan
with -- ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language
-- is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly. Our core observation in
this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with
model-based software development. Our application at SAP, one of the leading
vendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use
is possible.
  The model in question is called Status and Action Management (SAM). It
describes the behavior of Business Objects (BO), i.e., large-scale data
structures, at a level of abstraction corresponding to the language of business
experts. SAM covers more than 400 kinds of BOs, each of which is described in
terms of a set of status variables and how their values are required for, and
affected by, processing steps (actions) that are atomic from a business
perspective. SAM was developed by SAP as part of a major model-based software
engineering effort. We show herein that one can use this same model for
planning, thus obtaining a BPM planning application that incurs no modeling
overhead at all.
  We compile SAM into a variant of PDDL, and adapt an off-the-shelf planner to
solve this kind of problem. Thanks to the resulting technology, business
experts may create new processes simply by specifying the desired behavior in
terms of status variable value changes: effectively, by describing the process
in their own language.

this problem, seen as a Markov Decision Problem, building effective policies
for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles.
  Our solution exploits and adapts several existing techniques: planning for
deterministic mixed discrete-continuous problems and Monte Carlo sampling for
policy learning. The paper describes the development of planning techniques to
allow solution of the non-linear continuous dynamic models capturing the
battery behaviours. This approach depends on carefully handled discretisation
of the temporal dimension. The construction of policies is performed using a
classification approach and this idea offers opportunities for wider
exploitation in other problems. The approach and its generality are described
in the paper.
  Application of the approach leads to construction of policies that, in
simulation, significantly outperform those that are currently in use and the
best published solutions to the battery management problem. We achieve
solutions that achieve more than 99% efficiency in simulation compared with the
theoretical limit and do so with far fewer battery switches than existing
policies. Behaviour of physical batteries does not exactly match the simulated
models for many reasons, so to confirm that our theoretical results can lead to
real measured improvements in performance we also conduct and report
experiments using a physical test system. These results demonstrate that we can
obtain 5%-15% improvement in lifetimes in the case of a two battery system.

thus a significant effort has been devoted to the development of good SAT
encoding techniques for them. Some of these encodings first construct a Binary
Decision Diagram (BDD) for the constraint, and then encode the BDD into a
propositional formula. These BDD-based approaches have some important
advantages, such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients, or
being able to share the same BDD for representing many constraints.
  We first focus on the size of the resulting BDDs, which was considered to be
an open problem in our research community. We report on previous work where it
was proved that there are Pseudo-Boolean constraints for which no polynomial
BDD exists. We also give an alternative and simpler proof assuming that NP is
different from Co-NP. More interestingly, here we also show how to overcome the
possible exponential blowup of BDDs by phcoefficient decomposition. This allows
us to give the first polynomial generalized arc-consistent ROBDD-based encoding
for Pseudo-Boolean constraints.
  Finally, we focus on practical issues: we show how to efficiently construct
such ROBDDs, how to encode them into SAT with only 2 clauses per node, and
present experimental results that confirm that our approach is competitive with
other encodings and state-of-the-art Pseudo-Boolean solvers.

Artificial Intelligence. A description of a planning task consists of an
initial world state, a goal, and a set of actions for modifying the world
state. The objective is to find a sequence of actions, that is, a plan, that
transforms the initial world state into a goal state. In optimal planning, we
are interested in finding not just a plan, but one of the cheapest plans. A
prominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic state-space
search, guided by admissible heuristic functions. Numerous admissible
heuristics have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and
it is well known that there is no single ""best heuristic for optimal planning
in general. Thus, which heuristic to choose for a given planning task is a
difficult question. This difficulty can be avoided by combining several
heuristics, but that requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each
state, and the tradeoff between the time spent doing so and the time saved by
the combined advantages of the different heuristics might be high. We present a
novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for
optimal planning, while maintaining its benefits. Using an idealized search
space model, we formulate a decision rule for choosing the best heuristic to
compute at each state. We then present an active online learning approach for
learning a classifier with that decision rule as the target concept, and employ
the learned classifier to decide which heuristic to compute at each state. We
evaluate this technique empirically, and show that it substantially outperforms
the standard method for combining several heuristics via their pointwise
maximum.

trace the star formation history. So long GRBs may be a useful tool of
measuring the high-redshift star formation rate (SFR). The collapsar model
explains GRB formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star with
$M> 30M_\odot$ into a black hole, which may imply a decrease of SFR at high
redshift. However, we find that the \emph{Swift} GRBs during 2005-2012 are
biased tracing the SFR, including a factor about $(1+z)^{0.5}$, which is in
agreement with recent results. After taking this factor, the SFR derived from
GRBs does not show steep drop up to $z\sim 9.4$. We consider the GRBs produced
by rapidly rotating metal-poor stars with low masses to explain the
high-redshift GRB rate excess. The chemically homogeneous evolution scenario
(CHES) of rapidly rotating stars with mass larger than $12M_\odot$ is
recognized as a promising path towards collapsars in connection with long GRBs.
Our results indicate that the stars in the mass range $12M_\odot<M<30M_\odot$
for low enough metallicity $Z\leq 0.004$ with the GRB efficiency factor
$10^{-5}$ can fit the derived SFR with good accuracy. Combining these two
factors, we find that the conversion efficiency from massive stars to GRBs is
enhanced by a factor of 10, which may be able to explain the excess of the
high-redshift GRB rate. We also investigate the cosmic reionization history
using the derived SFR. The GRB-inferred SFR would be sufficient to maintain
cosmic reionization over $6<z<10$ and reproduce the observed optical depth of
Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background.

sharply around periastron. This X-ray minimum has two distinct phases - the
lowest flux phase in the first ~3 weeks and a brighter phase thereafter. In
2009, the Chandra X-ray Observatory monitored the first phase five times and
found the lowest observed flux at ~1.9e-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 (3-8 keV). The
spectral shape changed such that the hard band above ~4 keV dropped quickly at
the beginning and the soft band flux gradually decreased to its lowest observed
value in ~2 weeks. The hard band spectrum had begun to recover by that time.
This spectral variation suggests that the shocked gas producing the hottest
X-ray gas near the apex of the wind-wind collision (WWC) is blocked behind the
dense inner wind of the primary star, which later occults slightly cooler gas
downstream. Shocked gas previously produced by the system at earlier orbital
phases is suggested to produce the faint residual X-ray emission seen when the
emission near the apex is completely blocked by the primary wind. The brighter
phase is probably caused by the re-appearance of the WWC plasma, whose
emissivity significantly declined during the occultation. We interpret this to
mean that the X-ray minimum is produced by a hybrid mechanism of an occultation
and a decline in emissivity of the WWC shock.

as Pauli tracking. Methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are
compatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum
teleportation protocols. These protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and
result in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation. These
byproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself.
Instead, byproduct operators are tracked through the circuit and output results
reinterpreted. This tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it
is assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed. In this work

simultaneously. We find that the combined tidal model works as a very efficient
realignment mechanism; it predicts three distinct states of the spin-orbit

latter two states eventually approach the parallel spin-orbit configuration.
The intermediate spin-orbit angles as measured in recent observations are
difficult to be achieved. Therefore the current model cannot reproduce the
observed broad distribution of the spin-orbit angles, at least in its simple
form. This indicates that the observed diversity of the spin-orbit angles may
emerge from more complicated interactions with outer planets and/or may be the
consequence of the primordial misalignment between the proto-planetary disk and
the stellar spin, which requires future detailed studies.

LCLS. The optical assemblies holding the crystals were designed to provide
mounting on a rigid substrate and to minimize mounting-induced crystal strain.
The induced strain was evaluated using double-crystal X-ray topography and was
found to be small over the 5 X 2 mm2 working regions of the crystals.

We show that by entangling and postselecting $n$ ancillas, the postselection

fixed (compared to $n$ uncorrelated attempts with one ancilla), which is the
optimal scaling with $n$ that is expected from quantum metrology. Furthermore,
we show the surprising result that the quantum Fisher information about the
detected parameter can be almost entirely preserved in the postselected state,
which allows the sensitive estimation to approximately saturate the optimal
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. To illustrate this protocol we provide simple
quantum circuits that can be implemented using current experimental

attempts to argue that geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking

dependence and spatial heterogeneity, and point out that the notion of spatial
heterogeneity in current spatial statistics is only used to characterize local
variance of spatial dependence. I subsequently argue for a broad perspective on
spatial heterogeneity, and suggest it be formulated as a scaling law. I further
discuss the implications of Paretian thinking and the scaling law for better

of charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors over the blinking dynamics of
quantum dots to the tracer dispersion in living biological cells. Here we study
the effects of aging on one of the most fundamental properties of a stochastic
process, the first passage dynamics. We find that for an aging continuous time
random walk process the scaling exponent of the density of first passage times
changes twice as the aging progresses and reveals an intermediate scaling
regime. The first passage dynamics depends on $t_a$ differently for
intermediate and strong aging. Similar crossovers are obtained for the first
passage dynamics for a confined and driven particle. Comparison to the motion
of an aged particle in the quenched trap model with a bias shows excellent
agreement with our analytical findings. Our results demonstrate how first
passage measurements can be used to unravel the age $t_a$ of a physical system.

their unique physiochemical properties and prospective applications in various
nanotechnologies. A critical problem hampering the application processing of
BNNTs is the outer sidewall functionalization, which is primarily acquired to
lead BNNTs dispersible in various solvents. Furthermore, the surface of BNNTs
should be intelligently designed and precisely controlled to satisfy the
specific demands of different applications. For these purposes, covalent and
noncovalent approaches have been factually developed for opening up the key
door of applications. Importantly, wrapping the outermost sidewall of BNNTs
with either water-soluble polymers or biomolecules through weak noncovalent
interactions has been proved to be efficient for giving BNNTs considerable
dispersity in aqueous media, and endowing novel chemical functions to the BNNTs
with almost no change in their pristine physiochemical properties. This
contribution is made to summarize recent progresses, and further addresses the
future perspectives on the noncovalent functionalization of BNNTs for promoting
their application processing.

carried out for studying the relationship between the dynamics of a
perpendicular shock and microinstabilities generated at the shock foot. The
structure and dynamics of collisionless shocks are generally determined by
Alfven Mach number and plasma beta, while microinstabilities at the shock foot
are controlled by the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron
thermal velocity and the ratio of the plasma-to-cyclotron frequency. With a
fixed Alfven Mach number and plasma beta, the ratio of the upstream bulk
velocity to the electron thermal velocity is given as a function of the
ion-to-electron mass ratio. The present 2D full PIC simulations with a
relatively low Alfven Mach number (M_A ~ 6) show that the modified two-stream
instability is dominant with higher ion-to-electron mass ratios. It is also
confirmed that waves propagating downstream are more enhanced at the shock foot
near the shock ramp as the mass ratio becomes higher. The result suggests that
these waves play a role in the modification of the dynamics of collisionless

understanding of the dynamics of galaxies and groups of galaxies is grossly
incomplete: assuming the validity of Newton's law of gravity on astronomical
scales, the observed mass (stored in stars and interstellar gas) of stellar
systems can account only for roughly 10% of the dynamical (gravitating) mass
required to explain the high velocities of stars in those systems. The standard
approach to this ""missing mass problem"" has been the postulate of ""dark
matter"", meaning an additional, electromagnetically dark, matter component that
provides the missing mass. However, direct observational evidence for dark
matter has not been found to date. More importantly, astronomical observations
obtained during the last decade indicate that dark matter cannot explain the
kinematics of galaxies. Multiple observations show that the discrepancy between
observed and dynamical mass is a function of gravitational acceleration (or
field strength) but not of other parameters (size, rotation speed, etc.) of a
galaxy; the mass discrepancy appears below a characteristic and universal
acceleration (""Milgrom's constant""). Consequently, the idea of a modified law
of gravity, specifically the ansatz of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), is
becoming increasingly important in astrophysics. MOND has successfully
predicted various important empirical relations of galaxy dynamics, including
the famous Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations. MOND is found to be
consistent with stellar dynamics from binary stars to clusters of galaxies,
thus covering stellar systems spanning eight orders of magnitude in size and 14
orders of magnitude in mass. These developments have the potential to initiate
a paradigm shift from dark matter to a modified law of gravity as the physical
mechanism behind the missing mass problem.

Monte Carlo simulations then reveals that the superfluid-Mott insulator quantum
phase transition still exists despite the periodic driving and that the
location of the quantum phase boundary turns out to depend quite sensitively on
the driving amplitude. A more detailed quantitative analysis shows even that
the effect of driving can be described within the usual Bose-Hubbard model
provided that the hopping is rescaled appropriately with the driving amplitude.

gives rise to ensembles of string vacua, providing a scientific basis for a
stringy notion of naturalness. Of particular interest in this context is the
ability to keep track of algebraic information (such as the gauge group)
associated with individual vacua while dealing with statistics. In the present
work, we aim to clarify conceptual issues and sharpen methods for this purpose,
using compactification on ${\rm K3} \times {\rm K3}$ as a test case. Our first
approach exploits the connection between the stabilization of complex structure
moduli and the Noether-Lefschetz problem. Compactification data for F-theory,
however, involve not only a four-fold (with a given complex structure) $Y_4$
and a flux on it, but also an elliptic fibration morphism $Y_4 \longrightarrow
B_3$, which makes this problem complicated. The heterotic-F-theory duality
indicates that elliptic fibration morphisms should be identified modulo
isomorphism. Based on this principle, we explain how to count F-theory vacua on
${\rm K3} \times {\rm K3}$ while keeping the gauge group information.
Mathematical results reviewed/developed in our companion paper are exploited
heavily. With applications to more general four-folds in mind, we also clarify
how to use Ashok-Denef-Douglas' theory of the distribution of flux vacua in
order to deal with statistics of sub-ensembles tagged by a given set of
algebraic/topological information. As a side remark, we extend the
heterotic/F-theory duality dictionary on flux quanta and elaborate on its
connection to the semistable degeneration of a K3 surface.

that the results belong generically to non-separable systems, thus extending
the previous works which are concentrated on separable and chaotic systems.

derived from a multi-component photometric fit of the galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey optical images. We find that the nuclei in most of the

luminosities indicates that most of the systems are likely in the coalescence
stage of a major merger. This is supported by the existence of a single galaxy
disk in 65% of the systems studied and the finding of a correlation between
nuclear luminosity and host luminosity for the single-disk systems: those

provide a novel explanation as to why they are successful. We show that load
balance is sometimes a problem, but that the interaction of parallel search

atmosphere and consist of plasma that is cooler and denser than their
surroundings. They are visible for days -- and even weeks -- which suggests
that they are often in equilibrium with their environment before disappearing
or erupting. Several eruption models have been proposed that aim to reveal what
mechanism causes (or triggers) these solar eruptions. Validating these models
through observations represents a fundamental step in our understanding of
solar eruptions. We present an analysis of the observation of a filament
eruption that agrees with the torus instability model. This model predicts that
a magnetic flux rope embedded in an ambient field undergoes an eruption when
the axis of the flux rope reaches a critical height that depends on the
topology of the ambient field. We use the two vantage points of SDO and STEREO
to reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the filament, to follow its
morphological evolution and to determine its height just before eruption. The
magnetograms acquired by SDO/HMI are used to infer the topology of the ambient
field and to derive the critical height for the onset of the torus instability.
Our analysis shows that the torus instability is the trigger of the eruption.
We also find that some pre-eruptive processes, such as magnetic reconnection
during the observed flares and flux cancellation at the neutral line,
facilitated the eruption by bringing the filament to a region where the
magnetic field was more vulnerable to the torus instability.

substances exhibit continual fluctuations due to thermal agitation balancing

biological activity can give rise to non-equilibrium fluctuations that cause
``active diffusion"" in living cells. Because of the non-stationary and
non-equilibrium nature of such fluctuations, mean square displacement analysis,
relevant only to a steady state ensemble, may not be the most suitable choice
as it depends on the choice of the ensemble; hence, a new analytical method for
describing active diffusion is desired. Here we discuss the stochastic
energetics of a thermally fluctuating single active diffusion trajectory driven
by non-thermal random forces. Heat dissipation, usually difficult to measure,
can be estimated from the active diffusion trajectory; guidelines on the
analysis such as criteria for the time resolution and driving force intensity
are shown by a statistical test. This leads to the concept of an
``instantaneous diffusion coefficient"" connected to heat dissipation that may
be used to analyse the activity and molecular transport mechanisms of living
systems.

indications of rotational variability. We observed Varuna during two
consecutive nights in January 2011 with NICS@TNG obtaining a set of spectra
covering the whole rotation period of Varuna. After studying the spectra
corresponding to different rotational phases, we did not find any indication of
surface variability. In all the spectra, we detect an absorption at 2{\mu}m,
suggesting the presence of water ice on the surface. We do not detect any other
volatiles on the surface, although the S/N is not high enough to discard their
presence. Based on scattering models, we present two possible compositions

the collisional history of the Kuiper Belt. We find that the most probable
composition for the surface of Varuna is a mixture of amorphous silicates,
complex organics, and water ice. This composition is compatible with all the
materials being primordial. However, our data can also be fitted by models
containing up to a 10% of methane ice. For an object with the characteristics

primary (88604) 2001 QH293 and (60546) 2000 EE85 are ambiguous:
S/Sq/Q/K/L-type. Subtle spectral differences between them suggest the primary
may have more weathered material on its surface. Dynamical integrations have
constrained the ages of formation: 2110-44612 > 782 kyr; 10484-44645 = 348
(+823,-225) kyr; 88604-60546 = 925 (+842,-754) kyr. The spectral similarity of
seven complete pairs is ranked in comparison with nearby background asteroids.
Two pairs, 17198-229056 and 19289-278067, have significantly different spectra
between the components, compared to the similarity of spectra in the background
population. The other pairs are closer than typical, supporting an
interpretation of each pair's formation from a common parent body.

the notion of sparse representation. We use the sparsity pattern as side
information to efficiently restore block losses by iteratively imposing the
constraints of spatial and transform domains on the corrupted image. Two novel
features, including a pre-interpolation and a criterion for stopping the
iterations, are proposed to improve the performance. Also, to deal with
practical applications, we develop a technique to transmit the side information
along with the image. In this technique, we first compress the side information
and then embed its LDPC coded version in the least significant bits of the
image pixels. This technique ensures the error-free transmission of the side
information, while causing only a small perturbation on the transmitted image.
Mathematical analysis and extensive simulations are performed to validate the
method and investigate the efficiency of the proposed techniques. The results
verify that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts for image block
loss restoration.

as an efficient concept for deorbiting satellites and debris objects from low
Earth orbit. We simulate the interaction with the ionospheric plasma ram flow
with the plasma brake tether by a high performance electrostatic particle in
cell code to evaluate the thrust. The tether is assumed to be perpendicular to
the flow. We perform runs for different tether voltage, magnetic field
orientation and plasma ion mass. We show that a simple analytical thrust
formula reproduces most of the simulation results well. The interaction with
the tether and the plasma flow is laminar (i.e., smooth and not turbulent) when
the magnetic field is perpendicular to the tether and the flow. If the magnetic
field is parallel to the tether, the behaviour is unstable and thrust is
reduced by a modest factor. The case when the magnetic field is aligned with
the flow can also be unstable, but does not result in notable thrust reduction.
We also fix an error in an earlier reference. According to the simulations, the
predicted thrust of the plasma brake is large enough to make the method
promising for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite deorbiting. As a numerical
example we estimate that a 5 km long plasma brake tether weighing 0.055 kg
could produce 0.43 mN breaking force which is enough to reduce the orbital
altitude of a 260 kg object mass by 100 km during one year.

textures emerge at the left and right side of the scatterer, whose spatial

features such a rotating magnetic field component but also carries spin. The
laser's spin density, that can be expressed in terms of the lase's

relativistic correction to the Pauli equation. We show that the quantum
mechanical interaction of the electron's spin with the laser's rotating

a way that a net spin rotation remains with a precession frequency that is much
smaller than the frequency one would expect from the rotating magnetic field
alone. In particular, the frequency scales differently with the laser's
electric field strength depending on if relativistic corrections are taken into
account or not. Thus, the relativistic coupling of the electron's spin to the

qualitatively as compared to the nonrelativistic theory. The electron's spin

information protocols by Abramsky-Coecke. They also provide semantics for
Lambek's pregroup algebras, applied to formalizing the grammatical structure of
natural language, and are implicit in a distributional model of word meaning
based on vector spaces. Specifically, in previous work Coecke-Clark-Sadrzadeh
used the product category of pregroups with vector spaces and provided a
distributional model of meaning for sentences. We recast this theory in terms
of strongly monoidal functors and advance it via Frobenius algebras over vector
spaces. The former are used to formalize topological quantum field theories by
Atiyah and Baez-Dolan, and the latter are used to model classical data in
quantum protocols by Coecke-Pavlovic-Vicary. The Frobenius algebras enable us
to work in a single space in which meanings of words, phrases, and sentences of
any structure live. Hence we can compare meanings of different language
constructs and enhance the applicability of the theory. We report on

UKIDSS Large Area Survey 2 epoch proper motion catalogue. This object displays
significant spectral peculiarity, with the largest yet seen deviations from T6
and T7 templates in the Y and K bands for this subtype. Its large, ~1
arcsec/yr, proper motion suggests a large tangential velocity of Vtan = 240 -
340km/s, if we assume its MJ lies within the typical range for T6.5 dwarfs.
This makes it a candidate for membership of the Galactic halo population.
However, other metal poor T dwarfs exhibit significant under luminosity both in
specific bands and bolometrically. As a result, it is likely that its velocity
is somewhat smaller, and we conclude it is a likely thick disc or halo member.
This object represents the only T dwarf earlier than T8 to be classified as a
subdwarf, and is a significant addition to the currently small number of known
unambiguously substellar subdwarfs.

avoiding the use of approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equations. Moreover,

Ongoing reconnection has been identified in near-Earth space as being
responsible for the excitation of substorms, magnetic storms, generation of
field aligned currents and their consequences, the wealth of auroral phenomena.
Its theoretical understanding is now on the verge of being completed.
Reconnection takes place in thin current sheets. Analytical concepts proceeded
gradually down to the microscopic scale, the scale of the electron skin depth
or inertial length, recognizing that current layers that thin do preferentially
undergo spontaneous reconnection. Thick current layers start reconnecting when
being forced by plasma inflow to thin. For almost half a century the physical
mechanism of reconnection has remained a mystery. Spacecraft in situ
observations in combination with sophisticated numerical simulations in two and
three dimensions recently clarified the mist, finding that reconnection
produces a specific structure of the current layer inside the electron inertial
(also called electron diffusion) region around the reconnection site, the X
line. Onset of reconnection is attributed to pseudo-viscous contributions of
the electron pressure tensor aided by electron inertia and drag, creating a
complicated structured electron current sheet, electric fields, and an electron
exhaust extended along the current layer. We review the general background
theory and recent developments in numerical simulation on collisionless
reconnection. It is impossible to cover the entire field of reconnection in a
short space-limited review. The presentation necessarily remains cursory,
determined by our taste, preferences, and knowledge. Only a small amount of

One key towards a better understanding is baryon spectroscopy. Unfortunately,
in the past most baryon spectroscopy data have been obtained only using $\pi$ N
scattering. To gain access to resonances with small $\pi$ N partial width,
photoproduction experiments, investigating various final states, provide
essential information. In order to extract the contributing resonances, partial
wave analyses need to be performed. Here, the complete experiment is required
to unambiguously determine the contributing amplitudes. This involves the
measurement of carefully chosen single and double polarization observables.
  The Crystal Barrel/TAPS experiment with a longitudinally or transversely
polarized target and an energy tagged, linearly or circularly polarized photon
beam allows the measurement of a large set of polarization observables. Due to
its good energy resolution, high detection efficiency for photons, and the
nearly complete solid angle coverage, it is ideally suited for the measurement
of the photoproduction of neutral mesons decaying into photons.

atmosphere method. Comparison stars were observed and analysed with the same
method. The average value of [Fe/H] for the 32 stars of Group 2 is -0.42 +-
0.10 dex. The investigated group consists mainly of two 8- and 12-Gyr-old
stellar populations. Abundances of oxygen, alpha-elements, and
r-process-dominated elements are higher than in Galactic thin-disc dwarfs. This
elemental abundance pattern has similar characteristics as that of the Galactic
thick-disc. The similarity in chemical composition of stars in Group 2 with
that in stars of the thick-disc might suggest that their formation histories
are linked. The chemical composition together with the kinematic properties and
ages of stars in the investigated stars provides evidence of their common

surfaces, which is for instance involved in $2d$ string theory or in the
description of the fluctuations of metrics in $2d$ Liouville quantum gravity.
This is a probabilistic model that consists in weighting the classical Free
Field action with an interaction term given by the exponential of a Gaussian
multiplicative chaos. The main input of our work is the study of the
semiclassical limit of the theory, which is a prescribed asymptotic regime of
LFT of interest in physics literature (see \cite{witten} and references
therein). We derive exact formulas for the Laplace transform of the Liouville
field in the case of flat metric on the unit disk with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. As a consequence, we prove that the Liouville field concentrates on
the solution of the classical Liouville equation with explicit negative scalar
curvature. We also characterize the leading fluctuations, which are Gaussian
and massive, and establish a large deviation principle. Though considered as an
ansatz in the whole physics literature, it seems that it is the first rigorous
probabilistic derivation of the semiclassical limit of LFT. On the other hand,
we carry out the same analysis when we further weight the Liouville action with
heavy matter operators. This procedure appears when computing the $n$-points

goal of maximizing the secondary user (SU) throughput subject to constraints on
the primary user (PU) outage probability we formulate a joint problem of
spectrum sensing and channel state estimation. The problem is cast into a
sequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput
maximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled
with the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and
channel estimation strictly suboptimal. Using such a joint structure for
spectrum sensing and channel estimation we propose a distributed (cooperative)
dynamic spectrum access scheme under statistical channel state information
(CSI). In the proposed scheme, the SUs report their sufficient statistics to a
fusion center (FC) via level-triggered sampling, a nonuniform sampling
technique that is known to be bandwidth-and-energy efficient. Then, the FC
makes a sequential spectrum sensing decision using local statistics and channel
estimates, and selects the SU with the best transmission opportunity. The
selected SU, using the sensing decision and its channel estimates, computes the
transmit power and starts data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its conventional
counterparts, under the same PU outage constraints, in terms of the achievable
SU throughput.

to vanishing of Ricci scalar. Schwarzschild metric can be deduced from a
solution of our field equation if the spacetime preserve spherical symmetry.
Supposing spacetime to preserve the symmetry of ""Finslerian sphere"", we find a
non-Riemannian exact solution of the Finslerian vacuum field equation. The
solution is similar to the Schwarzschild metric. It reduces to Schwarzschild
metric while the Finslerian parameter $\epsilon$ vanishes. It is proved that
the Finslerian covariant derivative of the geometrical part of the
gravitational field equation is conserved. The interior solution is also given.
We get solutions of geodesic equation in such a Schwarzschild-like spacetime,
and show that the geodesic equation returns to the counterpart in Newton's
gravity at weak field approximation. The celestial observations give constraint
on the Finslerian parameter $\epsilon<10^{-4}$. And the recent Michelson-Morley
experiment requires $\epsilon<10^{-16}$. The counterpart of Birkhoff's theorem
exist in Finslerian vacuum. It shows that the Finslerian gravitational field

and how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these
representations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional
challenge of what we refer to as human task complexity users are rarely willing
to provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often
preferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing
all of these challenges i.e., designing a compactly representable model which
is amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking
data is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to
problems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently
proposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each
of the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical
connection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial
rankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and
exact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence
based represen- tations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also
shows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models
(in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial
rankings. Finally, using our inference algorithm, we introduce the first method
for learning riffled independence based models from partially ranked data.

underlying set of ratable aspects presented in the reviews of a product (e.g.,

sentiment of each aspect. This approach directly enables discovery of
highly-rated or inconsistent aspects of a product. Our generative model admits
an efficient variational mean-field inference algorithm. It is also easily
extensible, and we describe several modifications and their effects on model
structure and inference. We test our model on two tasks, joint aspect
identification and sentiment analysis on a set of Yelp reviews and aspect
identification alone on a set of medical summaries. We evaluate the performance
of the model on aspect identification, sentiment analysis, and per-word
labeling accuracy. We demonstrate that our model outperforms applicable
baselines by a considerable margin, yielding up to 32% relative error reduction
on aspect identification and up to 20% relative error reduction on sentiment
analysis.

anomalies stem from adversarial or unlikely events with unknown distributions.
However, the predictive performance of purely unsupervised anomaly detection
often fails to match the required detection rates in many tasks and there
exists a need for labeled data to guide the model generation. Our first
contribution shows that classical semi-supervised approaches, originating from
a supervised classifier, are inappropriate and hardly detect new and unknown
anomalies. We argue that semi-supervised anomaly detection needs to ground on
the unsupervised learning paradigm and devise a novel algorithm that meets this
requirement. Although being intrinsically non-convex, we further show that the
optimization problem has a convex equivalent under relatively mild assumptions.
Additionally, we propose an active learning strategy to automatically filter
candidates for labeling. In an empirical study on network intrusion detection
data, we observe that the proposed learning methodology requires much less
labeled data than the state-of-the-art, while achieving higher detection
accuracies.

important task for several natural language processing applications such as
Question Answering, Information Extraction, and Summarization. Since most
existing methods are supervised and require large corpora, which for many
languages do not exist, we have concentrated our efforts to reduce the need for
annotated data as much as possible. This paper presents two different
algorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised
machine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between
events. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an
annotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of ""one type of temporal
relation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of
topically related documents. We show that by combining the global information
of such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping
cross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between
events. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the
accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous
successful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction
is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used
different techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear
programming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental
results of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised
temporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.

than elsewhere in southern Africa. With a relatively small population and a
high GDP, Angola is in a good position to intervene decisively to control HIV.
The effectiveness, availability and affordability of anti-retroviral therapy
(ART) make it possible to contemplate ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS in
Angola. We consider what would have happened without ART, the No ART
counterfactual, the impact on the epidemic if the current roll-out of ART is
maintained, the Current Programme, the impact if coverage is rapidly increased
to reach 90% of people with CD4+ cell counts below 350/micro-litre by 2015 and
HIV-positive pregnant women are all offered ART for life (Option B+), the
Accelerated Programme, and what might be possible under the 2013 guidelines
from the World Health Organization, starting in 2015 and reaching full coverage
of ART by 2018, the Expanded Programme.If Angola is to reach the 2015 targets
in the Presidents Acceleration Plan testing services will need to be expanded.
A regular, uninterrupted supply of drugs will have to be assured. Existing
health staff will need to be strengthened. Community health workers will need
to be mobilized and trained to encourage people to be tested and accept
treatment, to monitor progress and to support people on treatment; this in turn
will help to reduce stigma and discrimination, loss to follow up of people
diagnosed with HIV, and improve adherence for those on treatment. Effective
monitoring and evaluation systems will have to be in place and data collection
will have to be extended and improved to support the development of reliable
estimates of the current and future state of the epidemic, the success of the
programme, levels of viral load suppression for those on ART and the incidence
of infection.

good-quality pseudorandom number generators. Subsequent analysis by Panneton

several weaknesses of such generators, verified experimentally using the
TestU01 suite. Nonetheless, many of the weaknesses of xorshift generators fade
away if their result is scrambled by a non-linear operation (as originally
suggested by Marsaglia). In this paper we explore the space of possible
generators obtained by multiplying the result of a xorshift generator by a
suitable constant. We sample generators at 100 equispaced points of their state
space and obtain detailed statistics that lead us to choices of parameters that
improve on the current ones. We then explore for the first time the space of
high-dimensional xorshift generators, following another suggestion in
Marsaglia's paper, finding choices of parameters providing periods of length
$2^{1024} - 1$ and $2^{4096} - 1$. The resulting generators are of extremely
high quality, faster than current similar alternatives, and generate
long-period sequences passing strong statistical tests using only eight logical
operations, one addition and one multiplication by a constant.
