applied to Diffusion Tensor Imaging measurements on tissues and porous media.
This new set is an alternative to the more common invariants such as fractional
anisotropy and the diffusion mode. The alternative invariant set possesses a
different structure to the other known invariant sets; the second and third
members of the curvilinear set measure the degree of orthotropy and
oblateness/prolateness, respectively. The proposed advantage of these
invariants is that they may work well in situations of low diffusion anisotropy
and isotropy, as is often observed in tissues such as cartilage.
  We also explore the other orthogonal invariant sets in terms of their
geometry in relation to eigenvalue space; a cylindrical set, a spherical set
(including fractional anisotropy and the mode), and a log-Euclidean set. These
three sets have a common structure. The first invariant measures the magnitude
of the diffusion, the second and third invariants capture aspects of the
anisotropy; the magnitude of the anisotropy and the shape of the diffusion
ellipsoid (the manner in which the anisotropy is realised). We also show a
simple method to prove the orthogonality of the invariants within a set.

the past. While general relativity indicates the theoretical possibility of
causality violation, it is now widely accepted that a theory of quantum gravity
must play an essential role in such cases. As a striking example, the logical
paradoxes usually associated with causality violation can be resolved by
quantum effects. We ask whether the explicit construction of a theory that
allows causality violation might in turn teach us something about quantum
gravity. Taking the toy model of Deutsch as a starting point, in Part I we
argue that, despite being a nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics, the
model does not imply superluminal signalling and its predictions can be
operationally verified by experimenters within an appropriate ontological
setting. In Part II we show that the model can be directly applied to scalar
quantum fields, provided the fields are sent back in time by an amount much
larger than the coherence time of the wavepackets. We propose a generalisation
of the model that lifts this constraint and recovers the predictions of
standard quantum field theory when the size of the temporal jump is much
smaller than the coherence time of the wavepackets. Finally, we discuss an
extension of the model to ordinary gravitational time dilation. The resulting
model generalises and extends earlier work on the topic and can be tested
experimentally using current technology.

topological sort, concerning the minimization of the (topological)

We observe that the lower bound $\frac{\dim(\mathcal{I}(G))}{2} - 2$ on the
connectedness of the independence complex $\mathcal{I}(G)$ of line graphs of
bipartite graphs $G$ is tight. In our main theorem we characterize the extremal
examples. Our proof of this characterization is based on topological machinery.
  Our motivation for studying this problem comes from a classical conjecture of
Ryser. Ryser's Conjecture states that any $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph
has a vertex cover of size at most $(r - 1)$-times the size of the largest
matching. For $r = 2$, the conjecture is simply K\""onig's Theorem. It has also
been proven for $r = 3$ by Aharoni using a beautiful topological argument. In a
separate paper we characterize the extremal examples for the $3$-uniform case
of Ryser's Conjecture (i.e., Aharoni's Theorem), and in particular resolve an
old conjecture of Lov\'asz for the case of Ryser-extremal $3$-graphs.
  Our main result in this paper will provide us with valuable structural
information for that characterization. Its proof is based on the observation
that link graphs of Ryser-extremal $3$-uniform hypergraphs are exactly the
bipartite graphs we study here.

film thickness and spacer layer in Pt/Co/(Pt, Cr)/CoO thin films. The exchange
bias characteristics, blocking temperature, magnetization of thin films
strongly depend on the spacer layer (Pt, Cr) between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic layers. While Pt/Co/Pt/CoO thin films show perpendicular
exchange bias, Pt/Co/Cr/CoO has easy magnetization axis in the film plane. We
have also observed very small hysteretic behavior from the hard axis
magnetization curve of Pt/Co/Cr/CoO film. This can be attributed to
misalignment of the sample or small perpendicular contribution from Pt/Co
bottom interface. We have also investigated the temperature and spacer layer
dependent exchange bias properties of the samples by VSM magnetometry. We
observed higher HEB and HC for the thicker Co layer in the Pt/Co/Pt/CoO sample.
In addition, onset of exchange bias effect starts at much lower temperatures
for Pt/Co/Cr/CoO thin film. This clearly shows that Cr spacer layer not only
removes the perpendicular exchange bias, but also reduces the exchange

a single minimal home-base hypergraph with matching number $k$ for every

$k$ are far from being unique. There are infinitely many of them and each of

even above the transition temperature makes the real-part of the potential more

These cumulative observations result the quarkonia to dissociate at higher
temperatures. Finally we extend our calculation to a medium, exhibiting local
momentum anisotropy, by calculating the leading anisotropic corrections to the
propagators in Keldysh representation. The presence of anisotropy makes the
real-part of the potential stronger but the imaginary-part is weakened
slightly. However, since the medium corrections to the imaginary-part is a
small perturbation to the vacuum part, overall the anisotropy makes the
dissociation temperatures higher, compared to isotropic medium.

is rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum
mechanics. On the basis of conceptual analysis, he arrived at an estimate for
the collapse time. To better understand his estimate, in this paper we present
a thought experiment, which singles out the role of time-dilations in massive
superpositions. First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock
containing a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock
contains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of
space time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a
smaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation.
Considering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces
an ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that
this time ambiguity can be thought to affect the time evolution of a state in
different ways and that the relative phase difference between these different
interpretations can be calculated. We postulate that the wave function collapse
will occur when this phase difference becomes of order unity. An absolute
energy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate for the
collapse time by equating the absolute energy scale to the rest mass of the
object.

be limited by mechanical thermal noise. In particular sub-Hertz laser frequency
stabilization and gravitational wave detectors, that are able to measure
fluctuations of 1E-18 m/rtHz or less, are being limited by thermal noise in the
dielectric coatings deposited on mirrors. In this paper we present a new
measurement of thermal noise in low absorption dielectric coatings deposited on
micro-cantilevers and we compare it with the results obtained from the
mechanical loss measurements. The coating thermal noise is measured on the
widest range of frequencies with the highest signal to noise ratio ever
achieved. In addition we present a novel technique to deduce the coating
mechanical losses from the measurement of the mechanical quality factor which
does not rely on the knowledge of the coating and substrate Young moduli. The
dielectric coatings are deposited by ion beam sputtering. The results presented
here give a frequency independent loss angle of (4.70 $\pm$ 0.2)x1E-4 with a
Young's modulus of 118 GPa for annealed tantala from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. For
as-deposited silica, a weak frequency dependence (~ f^{-0.025}) is observed in
this frequency range, with a Young's modulus of 70 GPa and an internal damping
of (6.0 $\pm$ 0.3)x1E-4 at 16 kHz, but this value decreases by one order of
magnitude after annealing and the frequency dependence disappears.

and $n$-degree polynomial in VP can also be computed by a depth three
$\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log^{3/2}n)}$. Over fixed-size
finite fields, Grigoriev and Karpinski proved that any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$
circuit that computes $Det_n$ (or $Perm_n$) must be of size $2^{\Omega(n)}$
[GK1998]. In this paper, we prove that over fixed-size finite fields, any
$\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit for computing the iterated matrix multiplication
polynomial of $n$ generic matrices of size $n\times n$, must be of size
$2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$. The importance of this result is that over fixed-size
fields there is no depth reduction technique that can be used to compute all
the $n^{O(1)}$-variate and $n$-degree polynomials in VP by depth 3 circuits of
size $2^{o(n\log n)}$. The result [GK1998] can only rule out such a possibility
for depth 3 circuits of size $2^{o(n)}$.
  We also give an example of an explicit polynomial ($NW_{n,\epsilon}(X)$) in
VNP (not known to be in VP), for which any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit computing
it (over fixed-size fields) must be of size $2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$. The
polynomial we consider is constructed from the combinatorial design. An
interesting feature of this result is that we get the first examples of two
polynomials (one in VP and one in VNP) such that they have provably stronger
circuit size lower bounds than Permanent in a reasonably strong model of
computation.
  Next, we prove that any depth 4
$\Sigma\Pi^{[O(\sqrt{n})]}\Sigma\Pi^{[\sqrt{n}]}$ circuit computing
$NW_{n,\epsilon}(X)$ (over any field) must be of size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log

first example of an explicit polynomial in VNP such that it requires
$2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ size depth four circuits, but no known matching

by one main galaxy, but may be affected by other mass along the line of sight

less significant perturbers (e.g. those that are projected far from the lens or
have a small mass), but higher order effects need to be included for objects
that are closer or more massive. We develop a framework for multiplane lensing
that can handle an arbitrary combination of tidal planes treated with shear and
convergence and planes treated exactly (i.e., including higher order terms).
This framework addresses all of the traditional lensing observables including
image positions, fluxes, and time delays to facilitate lens modelling that
includes the non-linear effects due to mass along the LOS. It balances accuracy
(accounting for higher-order terms when necessary) with efficiency (compressing
all other LOS effects into a set of matrices that can be calculated up front

degeneracy, in which the effective shear and convergence are sums over the
lensing planes with specific, redshift-dependent weighting factors.

comes to 3D, coming up with a deployment of sensors that gurantees $k$-coverage

we adopt very sparse Compressed Counting for nonnegative signal recovery. Our
design matrix is sampled from a maximally-skewed p-stable distribution (0<p<1),
and we sparsify the design matrix so that on average (1-g)-fraction of the
entries become zero. The idea is related to very sparse stable random
projections (Li et al 2006 and Li 2007), the prior work for estimating summary
statistics of the data.
  In our theoretical analysis, we show that, when p->0, it suffices to use M=
K/(1-exp(-gK) log N measurements, so that all coordinates can be recovered in
one scan of the coordinates. If g = 1 (i.e., dense design), then M = K log N.
If g= 1/K or 2/K (i.e., very sparse design), then M = 1.58K log N or M = 1.16K
log N. This means the design matrix can be indeed very sparse at only a minor
inflation of the sample complexity.
  Interestingly, as p->1, the required number of measurements is essentially M
= 2.7K log N, provided g= 1/K. It turns out that this result is a general
worst-case bound.

vector-isovector interactions at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu$ and
isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$ is demonstrated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) type model of QCD. The influence of this non-anomaly flavor-mixing on the
possible separate chiral transitions at nonzero $\mu_I$ is studied under the
assumption of the effective restoration of the $U(1)_A$ symmetry. We find that
for the weak isospin asymmetry, the two separate phase boundaries found
previously can be converted into one only if the vector-isovector coupling
$g_v^v$ is significantly stronger than the vector-isoscalar one $g_v^s$ without
the axial anomaly. When the weak Kabayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) interaction
is included, we find that the separation of the chiral transition with two
critical endpoints for the relatively strong isospin asymmetry can still be
removed owning to the vector interactions. In this case, it is not the vector
coupling difference but the strength of $g_v^v$ which is crucial for the only
phase boundary. We also point out that, in the NJL-type model with mismatched
vector interactions, the recently proposed equivalence for chiral transitions
at finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I$ does not hold even at the mean field approximation.

aggregated data alone. Hence, these studies face difficulties characterizing
the influence of factors such as transportation mode on mobility patterns. This
paper attempts to complement this research by looking at a category-rich
mobility data set. In order to shed light on the impact of categories, as a
case study, we use conventionally collected German mobility data. In contrast
to `check-in'-based data, our results are not biased by Euclidean distance
approximations. In our analysis, we show that aggregation can hide crucial
differences between trip length distributions, when subdivided by categories.
For example, we see that on an urban scale (0 to ~15 km), walking, versus
driving, exhibits a highly different scaling exponent, thus universality class.
Moreover, mode share and trip length are responsive to day-of-week and
time-of-day. For example, in Germany, although driving is relatively less
frequent on Sundays than on Wednesdays, trips seem to be longer. In addition,
our work may shed new light on the debate between distance-based and
intervening-opportunity mechanisms affecting mobility patterns, since mode may
be chosen both according to trip length and urban form.

global simplicity, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality while creating
a flexible nonlinear decision boundary. The resulting method is called Feature
Augmentation via Nonparametrics and Selection (FANS). We motivate FANS by
generalizing the Naive Bayes model, writing the log ratio of joint densities as
a linear combination of those of marginal densities. It is related to
generalized additive models, but has better interpretability and computability.
Risk bounds are developed for FANS. In numerical analysis, FANS is compared
with competing methods, so as to provide a guideline on its best application

influence of coupled piezo-electromechanical effects on the barrier

the strain, piezoelectric effects and spontaneous polarization. Based on the
developed 3D model, the band structures of electrons (holes) obtained from
results of modeling in Cartesian coordinates are in good agreement with those
values obtained from our earlier developed 2D model in cylindrical coordinates.
Several parameters such as lattice mismatch, piezo-electric fields, valence and
conduction band offsets at the heterojunction of $\mathrm{Al_xGa_{1-x}N/GaN}$
supperlattice can be varied as a function of the Al mole fraction. When the
band offsets at the heterojunction of $\mathrm{Al_xGa_{1-x}N/GaN}$ are very
small and the influence of the piezo-electromechanical effects can be
minimized, then the barrier material can no longer be treated as an infinite
potential well. In this situation, it is possible to visualize the penetration
of the Bloch wave function into the barrier material that provides an
estimation of critical radii of NWSLs. In this case, the NWSLs can act as
inversion layers. Finally, we investigate the influence of symmetry of the
square and cylindrical NWSLs on the band structures of electrons in the

result of this paper is that for any such dissipative Lagrangian system, with
losses accounted by a Rayleigh dissipative function, a rather universal
phenomenon occurs, namely, selective overdamping: The high-loss modes are all
overdamped, i.e., non-oscillatory, as are an equal number of low-loss modes,
but the rest of the low-loss modes remain oscillatory each with an extremely
high quality factor that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component
increases. We prove this result using a new time dynamical characterization of
overdamping in terms of a virial theorem for dissipative systems and the
breaking of an equipartition of energy.

Proxima passes in front of these stars, the relativistic deflection of light
will cause shifts in the positions of the background stars by ~0.5 and 1.5 mas,
respectively, readily detectable by HST imaging, and possibly by Gaia and
ground-based facilities such as VLT. Measurement of these astrometric shifts
offers a unique and direct method to measure the mass of Proxima. Moreover, if
Proxima has a planetary system, the planets may be detectable through their
additional microlensing signals, although the probability of such detections is
small. With astrometric accuracies of 0.03 mas (achievable with HST spatial
scanning), centroid shifts caused by Jovian planets are detectable at
separations of up to 2.0"" (corresponding to 2.6 AU at the distance of Proxima),
and centroid shifts by Earth-mass planets are detectable within a small band of
8 mas (corresponding to 0.01 AU) around the source trajectories. Jovian planets
within a band of about 28 mas (corresponding to 0.036 AU) around the source
trajectories would produce a brightening of the source by >0.01 mag and could
hence be detectable. Estimated timescales of the astrometric and photometric
microlensing events due to a planet range from a few hours to a few days, and
both methods would provide direct measurements of the planetary mass.

capture the fastest dynamics in molecules and materials. However, to date the
shortest attosecond (as) pulses have been produced only in the extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) region of the spectrum below 100 eV, which limits the range
of materials and molecular systems that can be explored. Here we use advanced
experiment and theory to demonstrate a remarkable convergence of physics: when
mid-infrared lasers are used to drive the high harmonic generation process, the
conditions for optimal bright soft X-ray generation naturally coincide with the
generation of isolated attosecond pulses. The temporal window over which phase
matching occurs shrinks rapidly with increasing driving laser wavelength, to
the extent that bright isolated attosecond pulses are the norm for 2 \mu m
driving lasers. Harnessing this realization, we demonstrate the generation of
isolated soft X-ray attosecond pulses at photon energies up to 180 eV for the
first time, that emerge as linearly chirped 300 as pulses with a transform
limit of 35 as. Most surprisingly, we find that in contrast to as pulse
generation in the EUV, long-duration, multi-cycle, driving laser pulses are
required to generate isolated soft X-ray bursts efficiently, to mitigate group
velocity walk-off between the laser and the X-ray fields that otherwise limit
the conversion efficiency. Our work demonstrates a clear and straightforward
approach for robustly generating bright attosecond pulses of electromagnetic
radiation throughout the soft X ray region of the spectrum.

However, the twist of a solar filament is very difficult to directly measure
from observation. In this paper, we carried out the measurement of the twist of
a solar filament by analyzing its leg rotation. An inverse S-shaped filament in
active region NOAA 11485 was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) on 2012 May 22. During its eruption, the
leg of the filament exhibited a significant rotation motion. The 304 \AA\
images were used to uncurl along the circles, whose centers are the axis of the
filament's leg. The result shows that the leg of the filament rotated up to
about 510 degrees (about 2.83$\pi$) around the axis of the filament within
twenty-three minutes. The maximal rotation speed reached 100 degrees per minute
(about 379.9 km/s at radius 18$^\prime$$^\prime$), which is the fastest
rotation speed that has been reported. We also calculated the decay index along
the polarity inversion line in this active region and found that the decline of
the overlying field with height is not so fast enough to trigger the torus
instability. According to the condition of kink instability, it is indicating
that the kink instability is the trigger mechanism for the solar filament
eruption.

Secondly, we propose a stochastic DCS in which, unlike the kinetic DCS, the

captured from the planetesimal disk during the early Solar System instability

Morbidelli 2007, AJ 133; hereafter NVM07). NVM07 already showed that the
irregular satellites of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were plausibly captured
during planetary encounters. Here we find that the current instability models
present favorable conditions for capture of irregular satellites at Jupiter as
well, mainly because Jupiter undergoes a phase of close encounters with an ice
giant. We show that the orbital distribution of bodies captured during
planetary encounters provides a good match to the observed distribution of
irregular satellites at Jupiter. The capture efficiency for each particle in
the original transplanetary disk is found to be (1.3-3.6)x10^-8. This is
roughly enough to explain the observed population of jovian irregular moons. We
also confirm NVM07's results for the irregular satellites of Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune.

by commercial search engines for surfacing relevant search results. However,
existing click models are lacking in two aspects. First, they do not share
information across search results when computing attractiveness. Second, they
assume that users interact with the search results sequentially. Based on our
analysis of the click logs of a commercial search engine, we observe that the
sequential scan assumption does not always hold, especially for sponsored

model. Our key insight is that sharing information across search results helps
in identifying important words or key-phrases which can then be used to
accurately compute attractiveness of a search result. Furthermore, we argue
that the click probability of a position as well as its attractiveness changes
during a user session and depends on the user's past click experience. Our
model seamlessly incorporates the effect of externalities (quality of other
search results displayed in response to a user query), user fatigue, as well as
pre and post-click relevance of a sponsored search result. We propose an

unloading are studied using a two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics
model. Simulations are performed for polycrystalline thin films passivated on
both surfaces. Dislocation climb lowers the overall level of the stress inside
thin films and reduces the work hardening rate. Climb decreases the density of
dislocations in pile-ups and reduces back stresses. These factors result in a
smaller Bauschinger effect on unloading compared to simulations without climb.
As dislocations continue to climb at the onset of unloading and the dislocation
density continues to increase, the initial unloading slope increases with
decreasing unloading rate. Because climb disperses dislocations, fewer
dislocations are annihilated during unloading, leading to a higher dislocation
density at the end of the unloading step.

subject to complex behaviour appearing as a result of the the interplay between
dynamics of the nodes and topology, namely synchronisation and cascade effects.
When dealing with smart grids, the system complexity increases even more: on
top of the physical network of power lines and controllable sources of
electricity, the modernisation brings information networks, renewable
intermittent generation, market liberalisation, prosumers, among other aspects.
In this case, we forecast a dynamical co-evolution of the smart grid and other
kind of networked systems that cannot be understood isolated. This review
compiles recent results that model electric power grids as complex systems,
going beyond pure technological aspects. From this perspective, we then
indicate possible ways to incorporate the diverse co-evolving systems into the

contribution and 1-loop correction of holographic R\'enyi entanglement entropy

limit. This allows the R\'enyi entanglement entropy to be a new window to study
the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper we generalize the study of R\'enyi
entanglement entropy in pure AdS$_3$ gravity to the massive gravity theories at
the critical points. For the cosmological topological massive gravity (CTMG),
the dual conformal field theory (CFT) could be a chiral conformal field theory
or a logarithmic conformal field theory (LCFT), depending on the asymptotic
boundary conditions imposed. In both cases, by studying the short interval
expansion of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals with
small cross ratio $x$, we find that the classical and 1-loop HRE are in exact
match with the CFT results, up to order $x^6$. To this order, the difference
between the massless graviton and logarithmic mode can be seen clearly.
Moreover, for the cosmological new massive gravity (CNMG) at critical point,
which could be dual to a logarithmic CFT as well, we find the similar agreement
in the CNMG/LCFT correspondence. Furthermore we read the 2-loop correction of
graviton and logarithmic mode to HRE from CFT computation. It has distinct
feature from the one in pure AdS$_3$ gravity.

Chebyshev polynomial technique, and calculate the long-time averaged
probabilities for the two different shift operators respectively. It is found
that the probability distributions for the moving and swapping shift operators
display completely different characteristics. For the moving shift operator,
the probability distribution exhibits high symmetry where the probabilities at
mirror positions are equal. The probabilities are inversely proportional to the
system size $N$ and approach to zero as $N\rightarrow \infty$. On the contrary,
for the swapping shift operator, the probability distribution is not symmetric,
the probability distribution approaches to a power-law stationary distribution
as $N\rightarrow \infty$ under certain coin parameter condition. We show that
such power-law stationary distribution is determined by the eigenstates of the
eigenvalues $\pm1$ and calculate the intrinsic probability for different
starting positions. Our findings suggest that the eigenstates corresponding to
eigenvalues $\pm1$ play an important role for the swapping shift operator.

It shows a strong elliptic dichroism though the four Dirac cones have the same
chiralities. Namely, it is found that the absorptions of the right- and
left-polarized light are different, depending on the sign of mass and the

measuring this elliptic dichroism it is possible to determine the anisotropy of

analytically by using spin-based models incorporating two different mechanisms
of solvent action: explicit solvent action through the formation of
solvent-polymer hydrogen bonds that can compete with the intrinsic
intra-polymer hydrogen bonded configurations (competing interactions) and
implicit solvent action, where the solvent-polymer interactions tune biopolymer
configurations by changing the activity of the solvent (non-competing
interactions). The overall spin Hamiltonian is comprised of three terms: the
background \emph{in vacuo} Hamiltonian of the ""Generalized Model of Polypeptide
Chain"" type and two additive terms that account for the two above mechanisms of
solvent action. We show that on this level the solvent degrees of freedom can
be {\sl explicitly} and {\sl exactly} traced over, the ensuing effective
partition function combining all the solvent effects in a unified framework. In
this way we are able to address helix-coil transitions for polypeptides,
proteins, and DNA, with different buffers and different external constraints.
Our spin-based effective Hamiltonian is applicable for treatment of such
diverse phenomena as cold denaturation, effects of osmotic pressure on the cold
and warm denaturation, complicated temperature dependence of the hydrophobic
effect as well as providing a conceptual base for understanding the behavior of
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and their analogues.

strong magnetic field. Observationally, anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft
gamma-ray repeaters are believed to be magnetar candidates. While more and more
multiwave observations of magnetars are available, unfortunately, we see
accumulating failed predictions of the traditional magnetar model. These
challenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the
alternative modelings. The release of magnetic energy may generate a particle
outflow (i.e., particle wind), that results in both an anomalous X-ray
luminosity and significantly high spindown rate. In this wind braking scenario,
only strong multipole field is necessary for a magnetar (a strong dipole field
is no longer needed). Wind braking of magnetars may help us to understand their
multiwave radiation properties, including (1) Non-detection of magnetars in
Fermi-LAT observations, (2) The timing behaviors of low magnetic field
magnetars, (3) The nature of anti-glitches, (4) The criterion for magnetar's
radio emission, etc. In the wind braking model of magentars, timing events of
magnetars should always be accompanied by radiative events. It is worth noting
that the wind engine should be the central point in the research since other
efforts with any reasonable energy mechanism may also reproduce the results.

in the Ising universality class. The new EOS guarantees the correct
universality and scaling behavior close to critical points and is formulated in
terms of the scaling fields only -- unlike the traditional Schofield
representation, which uses a parametric form. Close to a critical point, the
new EOS expresses the square of the strong scaling field $\Sigma$ as an
explicit function $\Sigma^2=D^{2e_{-1}}\Gamma(D^{-e_0}\Theta)$ of the thermal
scaling field $\Theta$ and the dependent scaling field $D>0$, with a smooth,
universal function $\Gamma$ and the universal exponents
$e_{-1}=\delta/(\delta+1)$, $e_0=1/(2-\alpha)$. A numerical expression for
$\Gamma$ is derived, valid close to critical points. As a consequence of the
construction it is shown that the dependent scaling field can be written as an
explicit function of the relevant scaling fields without causing strongly
singular behavior of the thermodynamic potential in the one-phase region.
Augmented by additional scaling correction fields, the new EOS also describes
the state space further away from critical points. It is indicated how to use
the new EOS to model multiphase fluid mixtures, in particular for
vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) where the traditional revised scaling
approach fails.

(1857-1933). Then in 1925 a French physiologist, Rene Wurmser (1890-1993),
wrote about the photon, and in July 1926 his compatriot, the physicist F.
Wolfers (ca. 1890-1971), did the same in the context of optical physics. None
of the four pre-Lewis versions of ""photon"" was well known and they were soon
forgotten.

cardinality. Assume that a weight function w is defined on its vertices. Then G
is w-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight.
  For every graph G, the set of weight functions w such that G is
w-well-covered is a vector space, denoted WCW(G). Let B be a complete bipartite
induced subgraph of G on vertex sets of bipartition B_X and B_Y. Then B is
generating if there exists an independent set S such that S \cup B_X and S \cup
B_Y are both maximal independent sets of G. A relating edge is a generating
subgraph in the restricted case that B = K_{1,1}.
  Deciding whether an input graph G is well-covered is co-NP-complete.
Therefore finding WCW(G) is co-NP-hard. Deciding whether an edge is relating is
co-NP-complete. Therefore, deciding whether a subgraph is generating is
co-NP-complete as well.
  In this article we discuss the connections among these problems, provide
proofs for NP-completeness for several restricted cases, and present polynomial
characterizations for some other cases.

process of the SDE, by the $ L^q $-distances of the differences of the local
characteristics for suitable $ p, q > 0 $. As application of our perturbation
theory, we establish strong convergence rates for numerical approximations of a
class of SODEs with non-globally monotone coefficients. As another application
of our perturbation theory, we prove strong convergence rates for spectral
Galerkin approximations of solutions of semilinear SPDEs with non-globally
monotone nonlinearities including Cahn-Hilliard-Cook type equations and
stochastic Burgers equations. Further applications of the perturbation theory
include the regularity of solutions of SDEs with respect to the initial values

proficient hydrogen storage material. Both exoherdal and endohedral hydrogen
adsorption on ExBox4+ are studied. Endohedral hydrogen molecules interact
strongly than exohedral ones. The hydrogen adsorption energy is as good as the
recently studied charged fullerenes. The hydrogen storage capacity appears to
be ~4.3 wt%. The endohedral CO sorption is also analysed with the help of DFT.
The first principle DFT calculation and MD simulation are performed to
investigate the effect of lithium doping on the gas adsorbing capacity and
adsorption enthalpy as well as adsorption energy of ExBox4+.The metal atom
interaction with ExBox4+is found to be pretty strong, and the interaction
energy appears to be higher than the metal cohesive energy.The thermodynamic
parameters suggest that metal doping method is spontaneous in nature. The
analysis of adsorption energy, thermodynamic properties and MD simulation
results suggest that Li doped ExBox4+ can be a promising gas adsorbing
material. Lithium doping increases the gas adsorption capacity of ExBox4+. The
Li decorated ExBox4+ is found to adsorb twenty four hydrogen molecules with a
gravimetric wt% of 6.23. Adsorption of CO on the metal decorated ExBox4+ is
also studied. AIM analysis is performed to obtain a general idea of the bonding
interaction between Li-H and Li-C.

The method is extended to conformal space with the intention to introduce the
strong interaction. It is then possible to use the wave equation, operating on
representation functions of the conformal group, to describe the dynamics of
matter fields. The resulting gauge groups resemble closely the gauge symmetries

the DUHOCAMIS (dual hollow cathode ion source for metal ions) was derived from
the hot cathode Penning ion source combined with the hollow cathode sputtering
experiments in 2007. It was interesting to investigate the behavior of this
discharge geometry in a stronger magnetic bottle-shaped field. So a new test
bench for DUHOCAMIS with a high magnetic bottle-shaped field up to 0.6 T has
been set up at Peking University, on which have been made primary experiments
in connection with discharge characteristics of the source. The experiments
with magnetic fields from 0.13 T to 0.52 T have shown that the magnetic flux
densities are very sensitive to the discharge behavior: discharge curves and
ion spectra. It has been found that the slope of discharge curves in a very
wide range can be controlled by changing the magnetic field as well as
regulated by adjusting cathode heating power. On the other hand, by comparison
of discharge curves between dual hollow cathode discharge (DHCD) mode and PIG
discharge mode, it was found a much stronger magnetic effect occurred on DHCD
mode. In this paper, the new test bench with ion source structure is described
in detail; and main experimental results are presented and discussed, including
the effects of cathode heating power and magnetic flux density on discharge
characteristics, also the ion spectra. The effects of the magnetic field on the
source operating are emphasized, and a unique behavior of the DUHOCAMIS
operating in the high magnetic field is expected and discussed especially.
