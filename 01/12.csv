network theory can facilitate understanding of complex financial markets. Main
part of these efforts is the study of correlation-based hierarchical networks.
This is somewhat surprising as the underlying assumptions of research looking
at financial markets is that they behave chaotically. In fact it's common for
econophysicists to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponent for log returns of a
given financial asset to confirm that prices behave chaotically. Chaotic
behaviour is only displayed by dynamical systems which are either non-linear or
infinite-dimensional. Therefore it seems that non-linearity is an important
part of financial markets, which is proved by numerous studies confirming
financial markets display significant non-linear behaviour, yet network theory
is used to study them using almost exclusively correlations and partial
correlations, which are inherently dealing with linear dependencies only. In
this paper we introduce a way to incorporate non-linear dynamics and
dependencies into hierarchical networks to study financial markets using mutual
information and its dynamical extension: the mutual information rate. We
estimate it using multidimensional Lempel-Ziv complexity and then convert it
into an Euclidean metric in order to find appropriate topological structure of
networks modelling financial markets. We show that this approach leads to
different results than correlation-based approach used in most studies, on the
basis of 15 biggest companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange in the period of
2009-2012 and 91 companies listed on NYSE100 between 2003 and 2013, using

evidenced by recent observations. Flat spectrum quasars and low synchrotron

the $\gamma$-ray absorption arguments, we propose that the jet-excited region

that the orientation and opening angle of the outflowing BLR can lead to

acceleration to very high energies. Constraints from numerous studies indicate
that the observed gamma-ray emission results primarily from hadronic processes,
providing direct evidence of highly relativistic ions that have been
accelerated by the SNR. Here we present an investigation of the dynamical and
spectral evolution of Tycho's SNR by carrying out hydrodynamical simulations
that include diffusive shock acceleration of particles in the amplified
magnetic field at the forward shock of the SNR. Our simulations provide a
consistent view of the shock positions, the nonthermal emission, the thermal
X-ray emission from the forward shock, and the brightness profiles of the radio
and X-ray emission. We compare these with the observed properties of Tycho to
determine the density of the ambient material, the particle acceleration
efficiency and maximum energy, the accelerated electron to-proton ratio, and
the properties of the shocked gas downstream of the expanding SNR shell. We
find that evolution of a typical Type Ia supernova in a low ambient density
(n_0 ~ 0.3 cm^{-3}), with an upstream magnetic field of ~5\ microGauss, and
with ~16% of the SNR kinetic energy being converted into relativistic electrons
and ions through diffusive shock acceleration, reproduces the observed
properties of Tycho. Under such a scenario, the bulk of observed gamma-ray
emission at high energies is produced by pi^0-decay resulting from the
collisions of energetic hadrons, while inverse-Compton emission is significant
at lower energies, comprising roughly half of the flux between 1 and 10 GeV.

for cellular communication that offers the promise of orders of magnitude
greater bandwidths combined with further gains via beamforming and spatial
multiplexing from multi-element antenna arrays. This paper surveys measurements
and capacity studies to assess this technology with a focus on small cell
deployments in urban environments. The conclusions are extremely encouraging;
measurements in New York City at 28 and 73 GHz demonstrate that, even in an
urban canyon environment, significant non-line-of-sight (NLOS) outdoor,
street-level coverage is possible up to approximately 200 m from a potential
low power micro- or picocell base station. In addition, based on statistical

more than an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current
state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks at current cell densities. Cellular
systems, however, will need to be significantly redesigned to fully achieve
these gains. Specifically, the requirement of highly directional and adaptive

possibilities of outage have strong implications on multiple access, channel

the paper discusses how various technologies including adaptive beamforming,

has promising performance which improves with increasing correlation, and is
robust against variations in noise level. The DQLC exhibits a constant gap to
the performance upper bound as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes large

developed for compressed sensing of signals under i.i.d. Gaussian measurement

has been shown that similar to its single terminal counterpart, the behavior of
MAMP algorithm is fully characterized by a `State Evolution' (SE) equation for
large block-lengths. This equation has been used to obtain the rate-distortion
curve of a multi-terminal memoryless source. It is observed that by spatially
coupling the measurement matrices, the rate-distortion curve of MAMP algorithm
undergoes a phase transition, where the measurement rate region corresponding
to a low distortion (approximately zero distortion) regime is fully
characterized by the joint and conditional Renyi information dimension (RID) of
the multi-terminal source. This measurement rate region is very similar to the
rate region of the Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding problem where the RID
plays a role similar to the discrete entropy.
  Simulations have been done to investigate the empirical behavior of MAMP

predictions of SE equation for reasonably large block-lengths.

Lagrangian a model of dark energy is developed. In order to evade any
unnecessary controversy regarding frames (i.e. Einstein .vs. Jordan) the theory
is treated using the original variables instead of transforming them to a
scalar-tensor theory. The field equations are derived directly from the
original Lagrangian using the variational principle. The cosmological equations
are different from the Friedmann equations, but the acceleration equation gives
the same result as the one of the $\Lambda $CDM model in the matter-dominated
era. Furthermore, it indicates an inflation in the early time and the
radiation-dominated era as the Starobinsky model. The cosmological constant
naturally emerges from the Yang-Mills terms of the Lagrangian rather than be
added artificially. The equation of state of the dark energy depends on the
density of the matter and then the coincidence and fine tuning problem is
solved naturally.
  In order to compare with the popular $\Lambda $CDM model, the cosmological
perturbations is investigated. The equations for linear perturbations of the
metric and for the density contrast growth are derived. The explicit analytic
solutions are obtained. The gravitational potential and the growth of the
baryon matter density perturbation can be used to clarify whether this model is
in agreement with standard $\Lambda $CDM predictions and experimental data.

thermodynamics of higher-dimensional rotating asymptotically flat and AdS black
holes and black rings in a canonical (fixed angular momentum) ensemble. We plot
the associated thermodynamic potential-the Gibbs free energy-and study its
behaviour to uncover possible thermodynamic phase transitions in these black
hole spacetimes. We show that the multiply-rotating Kerr-AdS black holes
exhibit a rich set of interesting thermodynamic phenomena analogous to the
""every day thermodynamics"" of simple substances, such as reentrant phase
transitions of multicomponent liquids, multiple first-order solid/liquid/gas
phase transitions, and liquid/gas phase transitions of the Van der Waals type.
Furthermore, the reentrant phase transitions also occur for multiply-spinning
asymptotically flat Myers-Perry black holes. The thermodynamic volume, a
quantity conjugate to the thermodynamic pressure, is studied for AdS black
rings and demonstrated to satisfy the reverse isoperimetric inequality; this
provides a first example of calculation confirming the validity of
isoperimetric inequality conjecture for a black hole with non-spherical horizon
topology. The equation of state P=P(V,T) is studied for various black holes

magnetic field of $B_{now}\simeq{10^{-14}G}$. In this paper we show that
starting from classical Einstein-Cartan-Maxwell strong gravity, a
spin-polarised ferromagnetic cylinder gives rise to a cosmological magnetic
field of the order $B_{now}\simeq{10^{-22}G}$. Vorticity of cylinder is used to
obtain galactic magnetic fields. Magnetic fields up to $B\sim{10^{9}G}$ can be
obtained from the spin density of the cylinder. If matching conditions are used
cosmological magnetic fields of the order of $B\sim{10^{-16}R\frac{Gauss}{cm}}$
where $R$ is the radius of the cosmic strings. For a cosmic string with the
radius of an hydrogen atom the cosmic magnetic field is $B\sim{10^{-32}Gauss}$
which is enough to seed galactic dynamos.

  correlated random variables, phase transition",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many fundamental questions in additive number theory (such as Goldbach's
conjecture, Fermat's last theorem, and the Twin Primes conjecture) can be
expressed in the language of sum and difference sets. As a typical pair of
elements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect that $|A-A| >
|A+A|$ for a finite set $A$. However, in 2006 Martin and O'Bryant showed that a
positive proportion of subsets of $\{0, \dots, n\}$ are sum-dominant, and Zhao
later showed that this proportion converges to a positive limit as $n \to
\infty$. Related problems, such as constructing explicit families of
sum-dominant sets, computing the value of the limiting proportion, and
investigating the behavior as the probability of including a given element in
$A$ to go to zero, have been analyzed extensively.
  We consider many of these problems in a more general setting. Instead of just
one set $A$, we study sums and differences of pairs of \emph{correlated} sets
$(A,B)$. Specifically, we place each element $a \in \{0,\dots, n\}$ in $A$ with
probability $p$, while $a$ goes in $B$ with probability $\rho_1$ if $a \in A$
and probability $\rho_2$ if $a \not \in A$. If $|A+B| > |(A-B) \cup (B-A)|$, we
call the pair $(A,B)$ a \emph{sum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair}. We prove
that for any fixed $\vec{\rho}=(p, \rho_1, \rho_2)$ in $(0,1)^3$, $(A,B)$ is a
sum-dominant $(p,\rho_1, \rho_2)$-pair with positive probability, and show that
this probability approaches a limit $P(\vec{\rho})$. Furthermore, we show that
the limit function $P(\vec{\rho})$ is continuous. We also investigate what
happens as $p$ decays with $n$, generalizing results of Hegarty-Miller on phase
transitions. Finally, we find the smallest sizes of MSTD pairs.

time-consuming task. Larger data sets improve the resolution of the light
curve, however, the time requirement scales with data volume. The data analysis
is often made more difficult by factors such as a lack of suitable calibration
sources and the need to correct for variations in observing conditions from one
image to another. Often these variations are unpredictable and corrections are
based on experience and intuition.
  The High Efficiency Image Detection & Identification (HEIDI) pipeline
software rapidly processes sets of astronomical images. HEIDI automatically
selects multiple sources for calibrating the images using an algorithm that
provides a reliable means of correcting for variations between images in a time
series. The algorithm takes into account that some sources may intrinsically
vary on short time scales and excludes these from being used as calibration
sources. HEIDI processes a set of images from an entire night of observation,
analyses the variations in brightness of the target objects and produces a
light curve all in a matter of minutes.
  HEIDI has been tested on three different time series of asteroid 939 Isberga
and has produced consistent high quality photometric light curves in a fraction
of the usual processing time. The software can also be used for other transient
sources, e.g. gamma-ray burst optical afterglows.
  HEIDI is implemented in Python and processes time series astronomical images
with minimal user interaction. HEIDI processes up to 1000 images per run in the
standard configuration. This limit can be easily increased. HEIDI is not
telescope-dependent and will process images even in the case that no telescope
specifications are provided. HEIDI has been tested on various Linux . HEIDI is
very portable and extremely versatile with minimal hardware requirements.

we study the private distributed optimization (PDOP) problem with the
additional requirement that the cost function of the individual agents should

Achieving differential privacy requires that any change of an individual's cost

achieves differential privacy and convergence to the optimal value. Our
analysis reveals the dependence of the achieved accuracy and the privacy levels

encountered in young patient populations. These tumors represent a difficult
challenge because many patients survive a decade or more and may be at a higher
risk for treatment-related complications. Specifically, radiation therapy is
known to have a relevant effect on survival but in many cases it can be
deferred to avoid side effects while maintaining its beneficial effect.
However, a subset of low-grade gliomas manifests more aggressive clinical
behavior and requires earlier intervention. Moreover, the effectiveness of
radiotherapy depends on the tumor characteristics. Recently Pallud et al.,
[Neuro-oncology, 14(4):1-10, 2012], studied patients with LGGs treated with
radiation therapy as a first line therapy. and found the counterintuitive
result that tumors with a fast response to the therapy had a worse prognosis
than those responding late. In this paper we construct a mathematical model
describing the basic facts of glioma progression and response to radiotherapy.
The model provides also an explanation to the observations of Pallud et al.
Using the model we propose radiation fractionation schemes that might be
therapeutically useful by helping to evaluate the tumor malignancy while at the
same time reducing the toxicity associated to the treatment.

definition of locality $r^{(\delta -1)}$ (i.e., locality $r$ with repair
tolerance $\delta -1$) under the most general structure of regenerating sets is
given. All previously studied locality turns out to be special cases of this
definition. Furthermore, three representative concepts of locality proposed
before are reinvestigated under the framework of regenerating sets, and their
respective upper bounds on the minimum distance are reproved in a uniform and

unbroken supersymmetry plays the leading role, we have shifted the attention to
the spontaneously broken supersymmetry. It turns out that in theories in which
half of supersymmetries is spontaneously broken, all physical fermions are just
the fermions of the nonlinear realization. Moreover, transformation properties
of these fermions with respect to broken supersymmetry are the same as in the
Volkov-Akulov model. Just this completely fixed all possible appearances of
fermions in the component action: they can enter the action through the
determinant of the vielbein and covariant derivatives, only. In our
parametrization of the coset the rest of physical components, i.e. all bosonic
components, transform as ""matter fields"" with respect to broken supersymmetry.
Clearly, the component action acquires the form of the Volkov-Akulov action for
these ""matter fields"". The complete form of the action can be further fixed by
two additional requirements: a) to reproduce the bosonic limit, which is
explicitly known in many interesting cases, and b) to have a proper linearized
form, which has to be invariant with respect to linearized unbroken
supersymmetry. In some cases additional Wess-Zumino terms (which disappear in
the bosonic limit) have to be added to the action. We supply the general
consideration by detailed examples of actions for the superparticle in D=3,5,
the on-shell component action for N=1, D=5 supermembrane and its dual cousins
and the component action of N=1 supermembrane in D=4, providing the exact proof

one is used to eliminate the dissipation in the system, another is used to
transfer the state. The control theory's stability ensures the system can be
transferred to the target state in high probability, and the coefficients in
control laws leads very fast convergence. The role of eliminating the
dissipation plays the suppression of decoherence effect. Numerical simulation
results show that under the realistic implementation conditions, the transfer
probability and fidelity can be increased up to 98.79% and 98.97%,
respectively. This is the first result directly applicable to a DQD system's

to the current dark matter distribution systematically overestimate the
concentration and underestimate the virial velocity of the corresponding

so accounting for compression is a necessary step for evaluating whether
massive galaxies are consistent with dark matter-only simulations. The inferred
primordial haloes broadly follow the c-V200 relation expected in a LCDM

fits at all for those galaxies whose current dark matter haloes are poorly

an energy transfer between the fields which consequently, affects the expansion
rate of the universe. The transfer direction is determined by the second law of
thermodynamics. The solution indicates that an accelerating expansion of the
universe can be described as a result of the energy flow from the chameleon
field to matter field.

standing open problem since the very initial study of the invariant theory in
the 19th century. Motivated by its significant role in characterizing
multipartite entanglement, we study the invariant polynomial rings of local
unitary group---the tensor product of unitary group, and local general linear
group---the tensor product of general linear group. For these two groups, we
prove polynomial upper bounds on the degree of the generators of invariant
polynomial rings. On the other hand, systematic methods are provided to to
construct all homogenous polynomials that are invariant under these two groups
for any fixed degree. Thus, our results can be regarded as a complete
characterization of the invariant polynomial rings. As an interesting
application, we show that multipartite entanglement is additive in the sense
that two multipartite states are local unitary equivalent if and only if
$r$-copies of them are LU equivalent for some $r$.

unstable yellow hypergiants (YHG) with the goal of detecting both the long-term
evolution of their radius and shorter term formation related to large mass-loss
events. We observed HR5171 A with AMBER/VLTI. We also examined archival
photometric data in the visual and near-IR spanning more than 60 years, as well
as sparse spectroscopic data. HR5171A exhibits a complex appearance. Our AMBER
data reveal a surprisingly large star for a YHG R*=1315+/-260Rsun\ (~6.1AU) at
the distance of 3.6+/-0.5kpc. The source is surrounded by an extended
nebulosity, and these data also show a large level of asymmetry in the
brightness distribution of the system, which we attribute to a newly discovered
companion star located in front of the primary star. The companion's signature
is also detected in the visual photometry, which indicates an orbital period of
Porb=1304+/-6d. Modeling the light curve with the NIGHTFALL program provides
clear evidence that the system is a contact or possibly over-contact eclipsing
binary. A total current system mass of 39^{+40}_{-22} solar mass and a high
mass ratio q>10 is inferred for the system. The low-mass companion of HR5171 A
is very close to the primary star that is embedded within its dense wind. Tight
constraints on the inclination and vsini of the primary are lacking, which
prevents us from determining its influence precisely on the mass-loss
phenomenon, but the system is probably experiencing a wind Roche-Lobe overflow.
Depending on the amount of angular momentum that can be transferred to the
stellar envelope, HR5171 A may become a fast-rotating B[e]/Luminous Blue
Variable (LBV)/Wolf-Rayet star. In any case, HR5171 A highlights the possible
importance of binaries for interpreting the unstable YHGs and for massive star
evolution in general.

outflow from supercritical accretion flow, we performed two-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations. We focus our discussion on the nature
of RHD instability in marginally optically thick, plane-parallel,
super-Eddington atmosphere. Initially we set two-layered atmosphere with a
density contrast of 100 exposed to strong, upward continuum-radiation force;
the lower layer is denser than the upper one, condition for an RHD instability.
We assume non-zero but negligible gravitational force, compared with the
radiation force. We find that short wavelength perturbations first grow,
followed by growth of longer wavelength patterns, which lead to the formation
of clumpy structure. The typical size of clumps (clouds) corresponds to about
one optical depth. An anti-correlation between the radiation pressure and the
gas pressure is confirmed: this anti-correlation provides a damping mechanism
of longer wavelength perturbations than the typical clump size. Matter and
radiation energy densities are correlated. These features are exactly what we
found in the radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (radiation-MHD) simulations of
supercritical outflow.

  Multilayer Theory","20 pages",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present an approach for the generalization of adsorption of
light gases in porous materials. This new theory goes beyond the Langmuir and
BET theories, which are the standard approaches that have limited application
to crystalline porous materials by their unphysical assumptions on the amount
of possible adsorption layers. The derivation of the more general equation for
any crystalline porous framework is presented; the Restricted Multilayer Theory
(RMT). Our approach allows the determination of gas uptake considering only
geometrical constraints of the porous framework and the interaction energy of
the guest molecule with the framework. Based on this theory, we calculated
optimal values for the adsorption enthalpy at different temperatures and
pressures. We also present the use of this theory to determine the optimal
linker length for a topological equivalent framework series. We validate this
theoretical approach by applying it to Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) and show
that it reproduces the experimental results for 7 different reported materials.
We obtained the universal equation for optimal linker length given the topology
of a porous framework. This work applied the general equation to MOFs and H$_2$
to create energy storage materials, however this theory can be applied to other
crystalline porous materials and light gases, which opens the possibility of
designing the next generations of energy storage materials by first considering
only the geometrical constraints of the porous materials.

0.4$ the grand unification group is not $SU(5)$, while when $R_1 > 1$ the grand
unification group is $E_6$. Moreover, when $R_2 > 0.3$, $E_6$ is implied. Main
ambiguities come from the diagonalizing matrices for quark and lepton mass
matrices in this calculation once we fix the vacuum expectation values of GUT
Higgs bosons. In this paper, we calculate $R_1$ and $R_2$ in $E_6\times
SU(2)_F$ SUSY GUT with anomalous $U(1)_A$ gauge symmetry, in which realistic
quark and lepton masses and mixings can be obtained though the flavor symmetry
$SU(2)_F$ constrains Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale. The ambiguities of
Yukawa couplings are expected to be reduced. We show that the predicted region
for $R_1$ and $R_2$ is more restricted than in the $E_6$ model without
$SU(2)_F$ as expected. Moreover, we re-examine the previous claim for the
identification of grand unification group with $100$ times more model points

Pulsars (AXP) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGR) within the scenario of
fall-back magnetic accretion onto a young isolated neutron star. The X-ray
emission of the pulsar in this case is originated due to accretion of matter
onto the surface of the neutron star from the magnetic slab surrounding its
magnetosphere. The expected spin-down rate of the neutron star within this
approach is close to the observed value. We show that these neutron stars are
relatively young and are going through a transition from the propeller state to
the accretor state. The pulsars activity in the gamma-rays is connected with
their relative youth and is provided by the energy stored in the
non-equilibrium layer located in the crust of low-mass neutron stars. This
energy can be released due to mixing of matter in the neutron star crust with
super heavy nuclei approaching its surface and getting unstable. The nuclei
fission in the low-density region initiates chain reactions leading to the
nuclear explosion. The outbursts are likely to be triggered by an instability
developing in the region where the matter accreted by the neutron star is
accumulated at the magnetic pole regions.
