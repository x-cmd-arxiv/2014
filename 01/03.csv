of thin-film multilayered stacks are investigated. Using a rigorous formalism
based on the inverse Helmholtz operator, properties associated to causality
principle and passivity are established when both temporal frequency and
spatial wavevector are continued in the complex plane. This result extends the
range of situations where the Kramers-Kronig relations can be used to deduce
the phase from the intensity. In particular, it is rigorously shown that
Kramers-Kronig relations for reflection and transmission coefficients remain
valid at a fixed angle of incidence. Possibilities to exploit the new
relationships are discussed.

lead-lag relationships between financial assets is negligible in efficient
markets. With the advance of technology, however, markets have become more
sophisticated. To determine whether this has resulted in an improved market
efficiency, we investigate whether statistically significant lagged correlation
relationships exist in financial markets. We introduce a numerical method to
statistically validate links in correlation-based networks, and employ our
method to study lagged correlation networks of equity returns in financial
markets. Crucially, our statistical validation of lead-lag relationships
accounts for multiple hypothesis testing over all stock pairs. In an analysis
of intraday transaction data from the periods 2002--2003 and 2011--2012, we
find a striking growth in the networks as we increase the frequency with which
we sample returns. We compute how the number of validated links and the
magnitude of correlations change with increasing sampling frequency, and
compare the results between the two data sets. Finally, we compare topological
properties of the directed correlation-based networks from the two periods
using the in-degree and out-degree distributions and an analysis of three-node
motifs. Our analysis suggests a growth in both the efficiency and instability
of financial markets over the past decade.

emission of the blazar PKS 1424+240 observed with the MAGIC telescopes. The
primary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization and
modeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recent
discovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z > 0.6 and makes it a promising
candidate to be the most distant VHE source. The source has been observed with
the MAGIC telescopes in VHE gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 h
from 2009 to 2011. The source was marginally detected in VHE gamma rays during
2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an optical
outburst in 2011. The combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2
sigma. The differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can be
described by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0
+/- 1.7. The MAGIC spectra corrected for the absorption due to the
extragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, with
the mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the Fermi-LAT. The
absorption-corrected MAGIC spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to
400 GeV. The multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio and
optical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of the
jet. The large separation between the two peaks of the constructed
non-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely high
Doppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-Compton model is applied. We
find that a two-component synchrotron self-Compton model describes the spectral
energy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.

synchronization, which is affected by age, diseases, and other factors. We
study the fine temporal structure of this synchrony in healthy young, healthy
elderly, and elderly subjects with coronary artery disease. We employ novel
time-series analysis to explore how phases of oscillations go in and out of the
phase-locked state at each cycle of oscillations. For the first time we show
that cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a
very specific temporal patterning of synchrony: the oscillations go out of
synchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually
within just one cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the
age and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher
(1:4) frequency-locking ratio between respiratory and cardiac rhythms, while
subjects with coronary artery disease exhibited relatively more 1:2 synchrony.
However, multiple short desynchronization episodes prevailed regardless of age
and disease status. The same average synchrony level could alternatively be
achieved with few long desynchronizations, but this was not observed in the
data. This implies functional importance of short desynchronizations dynamics.
These dynamics suggest that a synchronous state is easy to create if needed,
but is also easy to break. Short desynchronizations dynamics may facilitate the
mutual coordination of cardiac and respiratory rhythms by creating intermittent
synchronous episodes. It may be an efficient background dynamics to promote
adaptation of cardiorespiratory coordination to various external and internal
factors.

salvage reputation points. We notice some instances of accidental deletion of
good quality questions but such questions are voted back to be undeleted

along and across the flow and as a function of velocity. We analysed seven
optical spectra of the DG Tau jet, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph. The spectra were obtained by placing a long-slit parallel
to the jet axis and stepping it across the jet width. The resulting
position-velocity diagrams in optical forbidden emission lines allowed access
to plasma conditions via calculation of emission line ratios.
  We find at the base of the jet high electron density, $n_e \sim $ 10$^5$, and
very low ionisation, $x_e \sim 0.02-0.05$, which combine to give a total
density up to $n_H \sim $ 3 10$^6$. This analysis confirms previous reports of
variations in plasma parameters along the jet, (i.e. decrease in density by
several orders of magnitude, increase of $x_e$ from 0.05 to a plateau at 0.7
downstream at 2$''$ from the star). Furthermore, a spatial coincidence is
revealed between sharp gradients in the total density and supersonic velocity
jumps. This strongly suggests that the emission is caused by shock excitation.
The position-velocity diagrams indicate the presence of both fast accelerating
gas and slower, less collimated material. We derive the mass outflow rate,
$\dot{M}_j$, in the blue-shifted lobe in different velocity channels, that
contribute to a total of $\dot{M}_j \sim$ 8 $\pm$ 4 10$^{-9}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. We estimate that a symmetric bipolar jet would transport at the low
and intermediate velocities probed by rotation measurements, an angular
momentum flux of $\dot{L}_j \sim$ 2.9 $\pm$ 1.5 10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$
AU km s$^{-1}$.
  The derived properties of the DG Tau jet are demonstrated to be consistent
with magneto-centrifugal theory. However, non-stationary modelling is required
in order to explain all of the features revealed at high resolution.

thousand-fold and measure changes in source positions to a precision of 20--40
microarcseconds, more than an order of magnitude better than attainable in
pointed observations. This observing mode can usefully measure the parallaxes
of bright stars at distances of up to 5 kpc, a factor of ten farther than
achieved thus far with HST. Long-period classical Cepheid variable stars in the
Milky Way, nearly all of which reside beyond 1 kpc, are especially compelling
targets for parallax measurements from scanning, as they may be used to anchor
a determination of the Hubble constant to ~1%. We illustrate the method by
measuring to high precision the parallax of a classical Cepheid, SY Aurigae, at
a distance of more than 2 kpc, using 5 epochs of spatial-scan data obtained at
intervals of 6 months. Rapid spatial scans also enable photometric measurements
of bright Milky Way Cepheids---which would otherwise saturate even in the
shortest possible pointed observations---on the same flux scale as
extragalactic Cepheids, which is a necessity for reducing a leading source of
systematic error in the Hubble constant. We demonstrate this capability with
photometric measurements of SY Aur on the same system used for Cepheids in Type
Ia supernova host galaxies. While the technique and results presented here are
preliminary, an ongoing program with HST is collecting such parallax
measurements for another 18 Cepheids to produce a better anchor for the

lowest energy scale of interactions is pushed up to the Planck mass. This fact
points towards an absence of Vainshtein mechanism in this framework, but does
not prove it. By resorting to the exact vacuum equations of motion, we show
that there is indeed an obstruction that precludes any recovery of General
Relativity under the conditions of stationarity and spherical symmetry.
However, we argue that the latter are too restrictive and might miss some
important physical phenomena. Indeed, we point out that in generic non
spherically symmetric or time-dependent situations, interactions arising at
energies arbitrarily close to the energy scale of the decoupling limit
reappear. This leads us to question whether the small degree of spherical
symmetry breaking in the solar system can be sufficient to give rise to a
successful Vainshtein mechanism.

all previously known results for growth tightness of cocompact actions: every
already known example of a group that admits a growth tight action and has some
infinite, infinite index normal subgroups is relatively hyperbolic, and,
conversely, relatively hyperbolic groups admit growth tight actions. This also
allows us to prove that many CAT(0) groups, including flip-graph-manifold
groups and many Right Angled Artin Groups, and snowflake groups admit
cocompact, growth tight actions. These provide first examples of non-relatively
hyperbolic groups admitting interesting growth tight actions. Our main result
applies as well to cusp uniform actions on hyperbolic spaces and to the action
of the mapping class group on Teichmueller space with the Teichmueller metric.
Towards the proof of our main result, we give equivalent characterizations of
strongly contracting elements and produce new examples of group actions with
strongly contracting elements.

metal-poor stars HIP11952 and HIP13044 have challenged theoretical predictions
of the core-accretion model. According to this, the metal content of the
protoplanetary disk from which giant planets are formed is a key ingredient for
the early formation of planetesimals prior to the runaway accretion of the
surrounding gas.
  AIMS: We reanalyzed the original FEROS data that were used to detect the
planets to prove or refute their existence, employing our new reduction and
analysis methods.
  METHOD: We applied the cross-correlation technique to FEROS spectra to
measure the radial velocity variation of HIP13044 and HIP11952. We reached a
typical precision of $\sim$ 35 $ms^{-1}$ for HIP13044 and $\sim$ 25 $ms^{-1}$
for HIP11952, which is significantly superior to the uncertainties presented
previously.
  RESULTS: We found no evidence of the planet orbiting the metal-poor
extragalactic star HIP13044. We show that given our radial velocity precision,
and considering the large number of radial velocity epochs, the probability for
a non-detection of the radial velocity signal recently claimed is lower than
10$^{-4}$. Finally, we also confirm findings that the extremely metal-poor star
HIP11952 does not contain a system of two gas giant planets. These results
reaffirm the expectations from the core-accretion model of planet formation.

show that the pseudogap is likely a distinct phase, characterized by a medium
range and quasi-static charge ordering. However, the origin of the ordering
wavevector and the mechanism of the charge order is unknown. At the same time,
earlier data show that precursive superconducting fluctuations are also
associated with this phase. We propose that the pseudogap phase is a novel
pairing state where electrons on the same side of the Fermi surface are paired,
in strong contrast with conventional BCS theory which pair electrons on
opposite sides of the Fermi surface. In this state the Cooper pair carries a
net momentum and belong to a general class called pair density wave (PDW). The
microscopic pairing mechanism comes from a gauge theory formulation of the
resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, where electrons traveling in the same
direction feel an attractive force in analogy with Ampere's effects in
electromagnetism. We call this Amperean pairing. Charge order automatically
appears as a subsidiary order parameter. Our theory gives a prediction of the
ordering wavevector which is in good agreement with experiment. Furthermore,
the quasiparticle spectrum from our model explains many of the unusual features
reported in photoemission experiments. The Fermi arc and the unusual way the
tip of the arc terminates also come out naturally. We also discuss how the
onset of the Kerr effect in this state can be accommodated. Finally, we propose

can be matched continuously to the Kerr metric is an important open problem in
General Relativity. Its resolution is more than of academic interest, as it
allows to parametrize and quantify possible deviations from the no-hair
theorem. Various approaches to the problem have been proposed, all with their
own (severe) limitations. Here we discuss the metric recently proposed by
Johannsen and Psaltis, showing that (i) the original metric describes only
corrections that preserve the horizon area-mass relation of nonspinning
geometries; (ii) this unnecessary restriction can be relaxed by introducing a
new parameter that in fact dominates in both the post-Newtonian and
strong-field regimes; (iii) within this framework, we construct the most
generic spinning black-hole geometry which contains twice as many the
(infinite) parameters of the original metric; (iv) in the strong-field regime,
all parameters are roughly equally important. This fact introduces a severe
degeneracy problem in the case of highly-spinning black holes. Finally, we
prove that even our generalization fails to describe the few known spinning
black-hole metrics in modified gravity.

Research over the past three decades has revolutionized cosmology
while supporting the standard cosmological model. However, the cosmological
principle of Universal homogeneity and isotropy has always been in question,
since structures as large as the survey size have always been found each time
the survey size has increased. Until 2013, the largest known structure in our
Universe was the Sloan Great Wall, which is more than 400 Mpc long located
approximately one billion light years away.
  Aims. Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. As
they are associated with the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found
in and near distant galaxies, they are viable indicators of the dense part of
the Universe containing normal matter. The spatial distribution of gamma-ray
bursts can thus help expose the large scale structure of the Universe.
  Methods. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been measured. Subdividing
this sample into nine radial parts, each containing 31 GRBs, indicates that the
GRB sample having 1.6 < z < 2.1 differs significantly from the others in that
14 of the 31 GRBs are concentrated in roughly 1/8 of the sky. A two-dimensional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, a nearest-neighbour test, and a Bootstrap Point-Radius
Method explore the significance of this clustering.
  Results. All tests used indicate that there is a statistically significant
clustering of the GRB sample at 1.6 < z < 2.1. Furthermore, this angular excess
cannot be entirely attributed to known selection biases, making its existence
due to chance unlikely.
  Conclusions. This huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan
Great Wall, at a distance of approximately ten billion light years. The size of
the structure defined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six
times the size of the Sloan Great Wall.

measurements, but the only previously known such system, B1620-26 (with a
millisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit of
several decades), shows only weak interactions. Here we report precision timing
and multi-wavelength observations of PSR J0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in a

approximately 39.2 degrees). The unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circular
orbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from those
of known stellar systems. The gravitational field of the outer white dwarf
strongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and the
system will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strong
equivalence principle of general relativity.

investigation of quasar-driven winds on galaxy-wide scales. We conduct Gemini
Integral Field Unit spectroscopy of a sample of luminous unobscured (type 1)
quasars, to determine the morphology and kinematics of ionized gas around these
objects, predominantly via observations of the [O III]5007 emission line. We
find that ionized gas nebulae extend out to ~13 kpc from the quasar, that they
are smooth and round, and that their kinematics are inconsistent with gas in
dynamical equilibrium with the host galaxy. The observed morphological and
kinematic properties are strikingly similar to those of ionized gas around
obscured (type 2) quasars with matched [O III] luminosity, with marginal
evidence that nebulae around unobscured quasars are slightly more compact.
Therefore in samples of obscured and unobscured quasars carefully matched in [O
III] luminosity we find support for the standard geometry-based unification
model of active galactic nuclei, in that the intrinsic properties of quasars,
of their hosts and of their ionized gas appear to be very similar. Given the
apparent ubiquity of extended ionized regions, we are forced to conclude that
either the quasar is at least partially illuminating pre-existing gas or that
both samples of quasars are seen during advanced stages of quasar feedback. In
the latter case, we may be biased by our [O III]-based selection against
quasars in the early ""blow-out"" phase, for example due to dust obscuration.

data and 1244 sources with CRTS data. We calculate the intrinsic modulation

the gamma-ray detected objects to be more variable than the non-detected ones.
The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are more variable than the BL Lac
objects in our sample, but the significance of the difference depends on the
sample used. When dividing the objects based on their synchrotron peak
frequency, we find the low synchrotron peaked (LSP) objects to be significantly
more variable than the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) ones, explaining the
difference between the FSRQs and BL Lacs. This could be due to the LSPs being
observed near their electron energy peak, while in the HSPs the emission is
caused by lower energy electrons, which cool more slowly. We also find a
significant correlation between the optical and gamma-ray fluxes that is
stronger in the HSP BL Lacs than in the FSRQs. The FSRQs in our sample are also
more Compton dominated than the HSP BL Lacs. These findings are consistent with
models where the gamma-ray emission of HSP objects is produced by the
synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, while the LSP objects need an additional
external Compton component that increases the scatter in the flux-flux

boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar

perceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likely
formation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique population
that formed early and separately from the disk. However, recent studies of
individual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that they
span a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithic
structure. In this letter we demonstrate that the presence of young stars that
are located predominantly near the plane is expected for a bulge that has
formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. Using an N-body+SPH
simulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matter
halo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model and
the observations of young metal-rich stars in the bulge. We are also able to
partially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between results
that argue for a purely old bulge population and those which show a population
comprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look.

possible to provide multirate packet delivery outside of what is given by the
network min-cut. This is achieved by using a deterministic non-block-based
network coding scheme, which allows us to sidestep some of the limitations put
in place by the block coding model used to determine the network capacity.
  Under the network coding scheme we outline, the sender is able to transmit
network coded packets above the channel rate of some receivers, while ensuring
that they still experience nonzero delivery rates. Interestingly, in this
generalised form of asynchronous network coded broadcast, receivers are not
required to obtain knowledge of all packets transmitted so far. Instead, causal
feedback from the receivers about packet erasures is used by the sender to
determine a network coded transmission that will allow at least one, but often
multiple receivers, to deliver their next needed packet.
  Although the analysis of deterministic coding schemes is generally a
difficult problem, by making some approximations we are able to obtain
tractable estimates of the receivers' delivery rates, which are shown to match
reasonably well with simulation. Using these estimates, we design a fairness
algorithm that allocates the sender's resources so all receivers will
experience fair delivery rate performance.

of electromagnetic fields. These backgrounds possess a hidden SL(2,R) x SL(2,R)
x SO(3) symmetry and faithfully model the near horizon geometry of these black
holes, but locate them in a confining asymptotically conical box. For each
subtracted geometry we obtain two branches of quasi-normal modes, given in
terms of hypergeometric functions and spherical harmonics. One branch is
over-damped and the other under-damped and they exhibit rotational splitting.
No black hole bomb is possible because the Killing field which co-rotates with
the horizon is everywhere timelike outside the black hole. A five-dimensional
lift of these geometries is given locally by the product of a BTZ black hole
with a two-sphere. This allows an explicit analysis of the minimally coupled
massive five-dimensional scalar field. Again, there are two branches, both
damped, however now their oscillatory parts are shifted by the quantised wave
number $k$ along the fifth circle direction.

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are believed to play a key role in LambdaCDM cosmology

size of their accretion flows create a challenging imaging problem. We show
James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph
(JWST-NIRISS) Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode will enable true
imaging (i.e. without any requirement of prior assumptions on source geometry)
at ~65 mas angular resolution at the centers of AGNs. This is advantageous for
studying complex extended accretion flows around SMBHs, and in other areas of
angular-resolution-limited astrophysics. By simulating data sequences
incorporating expected sources of noise, we demonstrate that JWST-NIRISS AMI
mode can map extended structure at a pixel-to-pixel contrast of ~10^{-2} around
an L=7.5 point source, using short exposure times (minutes). Such images will
test models of AGN feedback, fuelling and structure (complementary with ALMA
observations), and are not currently supported by any ground-based IR
interferometer or telescope. Binary point source contrast with NIRISS is
~10^{-4} (for observing binary nuclei in merging galaxies), significantly
better than current ground-based optical or IR interferometry. JWST-NIRISS'

that has found wide applications in diverse fields. However, PSO suffers from
high computational complexity and slow convergence speed. High computational
complexity hinders its use in applications that have limited power resources
while slow convergence speed makes it unsuitable for time critical
applications. In this paper, we propose two techniques to overcome these
limitations. The first technique reduces the computational complexity of PSO
while the second technique speeds up its convergence. These techniques can be
applied, either separately or in conjunction, to any existing PSO variant. The
proposed techniques are robust to the number of dimensions of the optimization
problem. Simulation results are presented for the proposed techniques applied
to the standard PSO as well as to several PSO variants. The results show that
the use of both these techniques in conjunction results in a reduction in the
number of computations required as well as faster convergence speed while
maintaining an acceptable error performance for time-critical applications.

timescales of about 1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference
between the maximum and minimum observed rates within any given model. These
rates are comparable to the current estimated accretion rate in the immediate
vicinity of Sgr A*, although they represent only a small (<10%) increase over
the current expected feeding rate at the effective inner boundary of our
simulations $(r_\mathrm{acc} = 750 R_S \sim 10^{15} \mathrm{cm})$. We also
explore multiple possible equations of state to describe the gas. In examining
the Br-$\gamma$ light curves produced from our simulations, we find that all of

conformal point. We argue that when the quench time scale $\delta t$ is small
compared to the scale set by the relevant coupling, the expectation value of
the quenched operator scales universally as $\delta g/ \delta t ^{2\Delta-d}$
where $\delta g$ is the quench amplitude. This growth is further enhanced by a
logarithmic factor in even dimensions. We present explicit results for free
scalar and fermionic field theories, supported by an analytic understanding of
the leading contribution for fast quenches. Results from this Letter suggest
that this scaling result, first found in holography, is in fact universal to
quantum quenches. Our considerations also show that this limit of fast smooth
quenches is quite different from an instantaneous quench from one
time-independent Hamiltonian to another, where the Schrodinger picture state at
the time of the quench simply serves as an initial condition for subsequent
evolution with the final Hamiltonian.

template-based gestures, there are yet no metrics to analyze security of either

text-based passwords are not suitable for capturing the security and
memorability of free-form gestures. Hence, we modify a recently proposed metric
for analyzing information capacity of continuous full-body movements for this

angular shapes. We also implemented a multitouch recognizer to evaluate the
practicality of free-form gestures in a real authentication system and how they

clouds using the non-LTE code RADEX and the spectral synthesis code Cloudy. We
detect CO in 5 of the 6 galaxies, including first detections in Haro11 (Z~0.4
Zsun), Mrk930 (0.2 Zsun), and UM311 (0.5 Zsun), but CO remains undetected in
NGC4861 (0.2 Zsun). The CO luminosities are low while [CII] is bright in these
galaxies, resulting in [CII]/CO(1-0)>10000. Our dwarf galaxies are in
relatively good agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for total gas.
They show short molecular depletion time scales, even when considering
metallicity-scaled Xco factors. Those galaxies are dominated by their HI gas,
except Haro11 which has high star formation efficiency and is dominated by
ionized and molecular gas. We determine the mass of each ISM phase in Haro11
using Cloudy and estimate an equivalent Xco factor which is 10 times higher
than the Galactic value. Overall, our results confirm the emerging picture that
CO suffers from significant selective photodissociation in low-metallicity
dwarf galaxies.

extended-MHD model capable of calculating the propagation and turbulent
dissipation of Alfv\'en waves in any magnetic topology, against high resolution
spectra of the quiescent off-disk solar corona. Wave dissipation is the only
heating mechanism assumed in this model. Combining 3D model results with the
CHIANTI atomic database, we were able to create synthetic line-of-sight spectra
which include the effects of emission line broadening due to both thermal and
wave-related non-thermal motions. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time a global model is used to obtain synthetic non-thermal line
broadening. We obtained a steady-state solution driven by a synoptic
magnetogram and compared the synthetic spectra with SUMER observations of a
quiescent area above the solar west limb extending between 1.04 and 1.34 solar
radii at the equator. Both the predicted line widths and the total line fluxes
were consistent with the observations for 5 different ions. Using the 3D
solution, we were able to locate the region that contributes the most to the
emission used for measuring electron properties; we found that region to be a
pseudo-streamer, whose modeled electron temperature and density are consistent
with the measured ones. We conclude that the turbulent dissipation assumed in
the AWSoM model can simultaneously account for the observed heating rate and
the non-dissipated wave energy observed in this region.

by lifting the problem from circular permutations to the affine symmetric

which inversions are restricted to acting on two regions. This requires the
proof of new results in group theory, and suggests a vein of new combinatorial
problems concerning permutation groups on which group theorists will be needed

We firstly gave a brief introduction for the experimental measurements for

$R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ anomaly, the $P_5^\prime$ deviation for $B^0 \to K^{*0}

the relevant form factors in the light-cone QCD sum rule (LCSRs), the heavy
quark effective theory, and the perturbative QCD factorization approach. By
using the form factors calculated in the perturbative (pQCD) approach, we then
calculate and show the pQCD predictions for the decay rates of many
semileptonic decays of $B/B_s$ mesons. We also made careful phenomenological
analysis for these pQCD predictions and found, in general, the following
points: (a) For all the considered $B/B_s$ semileptonic decays, the
next-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD predictions for their decay rates agree well
with the data and those from other different theoretical methods; (b) For
$R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$, the pQCD predictions agree very well with the data, the
BaBar's anomaly of $R(D^{(*)})$ are therefore explained successfully in the
standard model by employing the pQCD approach; and (c) We defined several new
ratios $R_D^{l,\tau}$ and $R_{D_s}^{l,\tau}$, they may be more sensitive to the
QCD dynamics which controls the $B/B_s \to (D^{(*)},D_s^{(*)})$ transitions
than the old ratios, we therefore strongly suggest LHCb and the forthcoming
Super-B experiments to measure these new ratios.

criterion is applied for this definition). Barium abundances (or upper limits)
are available for the great majority of the CEMP stars, allowing for their

membership to the inner- and outer-halo populations of the Milky Way is
developed, making use of the integrals of motion, and applied to determine the
relative fractions of CEMP stars in these two sub-classes for each halo
component. Although limited by small-number statistics, the data suggest that
the inner halo of the Milky Way exhibits a somewhat higher relative number of
CEMP-$s$ stars than CEMP-no stars (57% vs. 43%), while the outer halo possesses
a clearly higher fraction of CEMP-no stars than CEMP-$s$ stars (70% vs. 30%).
Although larger samples of CEMP stars with known Ba abundances are required,
this result suggests that the dominant progenitors of CEMP stars in the two

intermediate-mass stars in the case of the inner halo.

wind on motion of bodies in the Solar System. The velocity density function for
the solar wind constituents is given by the $\kappa-$distribution. The relevant
contributions to the solar wind action contain also the sputtering and
reflection components in addition to direct impact. The solar wind effect is
more important than the action of the solar electromagnetic radiation, as for
the secular orbital evolution. The effect of the solar corpuscular radiation is
more important than the Poynting-Robertson effect even when mass of the dust
particle is considered to be constant, non-radial component of the solar wind
velocity is neglected and the time dependence of the solar wind properties is
ignored.
  The presented equation of motion of a body under the action of the solar
radiation, electromagnetic and corpuscular, respects reality in a much better
way than the conventionally used equation. The acceleration of the body is
proportional to the superposition of the radial velocity component multiplied
by the numerical coefficient $[2 + (\eta_{1} + \eta_{2})/ \overline{Q}
~'_{pr}]$ and the transversal velocity component multiplied by the numerical
coefficient $(1 + \eta_{2}/ \overline{Q} ~'_{pr})$, where $\overline{Q}
~'_{pr}$ is the dimensionless efficiency factor of the radiation pressure. Here
$\eta_{1}$ $\doteq$ 1.1, $\eta_{2}$ $\doteq$ 1.4 and the velocity is the body's
velocity with respect to the Sun. Also time variability of $\eta_{1}$ and
$\eta_{2}$ due to the solar cycle is given.

by anodizing in association with hydrothermal treatment. As-prepared Mo and N
co-doped TNAs were characterized by field emission scanning electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
ultraviolet-visible light diffuse reflection spectroscopy. Besides, the
photocatalytic activity of Mo and N co-doped TNAs for the degradation of
methylene blue (denoted as MB) under visible light irradiation was evaluated.
It was found that N in co-doped TNAs coexists in the forms of N-Ti-O and
N-O-Ti, while Mo exists as $Mo^{6+}$ by substituting Ti in the lattice of
$TiO_2$. In the meantime, Mo and N co-doping extends the absorption of TNAs
into the whole visible light region and results in remarkably enhanced
photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB under visible light
irradiation. This could be attributed to the synergetic effect between
Mo-doping and N-doping. Namely, Mo and N passivated co-doping produces new
states in TNAs, thereby narrowing the bandgap and decreasing the recombination
rate of electrons and holes. As a result, the visible light absorption and
photocatalytic activity of TNAs is greatly increased. Furthermore, Mo ions with
multiple valences in all co-doped samples could act as trapping sites to
effectively decrease the recombination rate of electrons and holes, which also
contribute to improved photocatalytic activity of Mo and N co-doped TNAs.

hot. Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick gas, are found
at relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples are the standard
thin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass accretion rate, and
the slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion flows are responsible
for luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to
the Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot
accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.
They occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as
the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because
of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general
lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency
decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot
accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments
suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are
believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black
hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*,
the ultra-low-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The
jet, wind and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion
flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the
evolution of the host galaxy. Details of this ""maintenance-mode feedback""
could, in principle, be worked out through theoretical studies and numerical
simulations of hot accretion flows.

Self-assembly pathways and rates for nanocomposites are derived via a
multiscale analysis of the classical Liouville equation. From a reduced
statistical framework, rigorous stochastic equations for population levels of
beginning, intermediate, and final aggregates are also derived. It is shown
that the definition of an assembly type is a self-consistency criterion that
must strike a balance between precision and the need for population levels to
be slowly varying relative to the time scale of atomic motion. The deductive
multiscale approach is complemented by a qualitative notion of multicomponent
association and the ensemble of exact atomic-level configurations consistent
with them. In processes such as viral self-assembly from proteins and RNA or
DNA, there are many possible intermediates, so that it is usually difficult to
predict the most efficient assembly pathway. However, in the current study,
rates of assembly of each possible intermediate can be predicted. This avoids
the need, as in a phenomenological approach, for recalibration with each new
application. The method accounts for the feedback across scales in space and
time that is fundamental to nanosystem self-assembly. The theory has
applications to bionanostructures, geomaterials, engineered composites, and
nanocapsule therapeutic delivery systems.

the two main tools used for Monte Carlo statistical inference: sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We present a novel PMCMC
algorithm that we refer to as particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling (PGAS).
PGAS provides the data analyst with an off-the-shelf class of Markov kernels
that can be used to simulate the typically high-dimensional and highly
autocorrelated state trajectory in a state-space model. The ancestor sampling
procedure enables fast mixing of the PGAS kernel even when using seemingly few
particles in the underlying SMC sampler. This is important as it can
significantly reduce the computational burden that is typically associated with
using SMC. PGAS is conceptually similar to the existing PG with backward
simulation (PGBS) procedure. Instead of using separate forward and backward
sweeps as in PGBS, however, we achieve the same effect in a single forward
sweep. This makes PGAS well suited for addressing inference problems not only
in state-space models, but also in models with more complex dependencies, such
as non-Markovian, Bayesian nonparametric, and general probabilistic graphical
models.

broad absorption line quasar (FeLoBAL QSO), the second-brightest and
second-closest known example of this class. He I* and Fe II together act as an
effective analytical tool, allowing us to obtain useful kinematic constraints
from photoionization models of the outflow without needing to assume any
particular acceleration model. The main outflow's log ionization parameter is
-1.5, the log hydrogen density [cm^(-3)] 5.5 to 8, the log hydrogen column
density [cm^(-2)] 21.7 to 21.9, the absorption radius 7.2 to 127 pc, and the
kinetic luminosity 0.16% to 4.5% of the bolometric luminosity. We obtain
line-of-sight covering fractions of ~0.25 for strong Fe II, ~0.5 for He I*, and
~0.6 for Mg II. Narrower and shallower absorption lines from weaker Fe II and
Mn II with outflow velocity ~3400 km/s have appeared between 2005 and 2011,
suggesting that dense cores may have condensed inside the main outflow.
Consideration of the literature might suggest that the FBQS J1151+3822 outflow
is a member of a rare and distinct sub-class of FeLoBALs with high densities
and correspondingly small absorption radii. We find, however, that such
outflows are not necessarily a distinct sub-class, and that their apparent
rarity could be a symptom of selection bias in studies using density-sensitive
lines.

concentration vary from 0 to 2 M. The conductivity of solutions without DNA but
with the same concentration of KCl salt are also performed. The results show
that in case of salt free solution of DNA the melting process of the double
helix is observed, while in case of DNA solution with added salt the
macromolecule denaturation is not featured. For salt concentrations lower than
some critical one (0.4 M) the conductivity of DNA solution is higher than the
conductivity of KCl water solution without DNA. Starting from the critical
concentration the conductivity of KCl solution is higher than the conductivity
of DNA solution with added salt. For description of the experimental data
phenomenological model is elaborated basing on electrolyte theory. In framework
of the developed model a mechanism of counterion ordering is introduced.
According to this mechanism under the low salt concentrations electrical
conductivity of the system is caused by counterions of DNA ion-hydrate shell.
Increasing the amount of salt to the critical concentration counterions
condense on DNA polyanion. Further increase of salt concentration leads to the
formation of DNA-salt complexes that decreases the conductivity of the system.

reverse is not always true due to the reduced symmetry in thin films. Here, we
predict from group theory and density functional calculations that two
intra-layer vibrational modes which are Raman inactive in bulk WSe2 in our
experimental configuration become Raman active in thin film WSe2, due to
reduced symmetry in thin films. This phenomenon explains the Raman peaks we
observe experimentally at ~310 cm-1 and 176 cm-1 in thin film WSe2.
Interestingly, the bulk mode at ~310 cm-1 that is Raman inactive can in fact be
detected in Raman measurements under specific wavelengths of irradiation,
suggesting that in this case, crystal symmetry selection rules may be broken
due to resonant scattering. Both theory and experiment indicate that the and
modes blue-shift with decreasing thickness, which we attribute to surface
effects. Our results shed light on a general understanding of the Raman/IR
activities of the phonon modes in layered transition metal dichalcogenide
materials and their evolution behavior from 3D to 2D.

simplified model of the fluid envelope of a planet (or the convective envelope
of a solar-type star) subject to the gravitational tidal perturbations of an
orbiting companion. Our model contains a perfectly rigid spherical core, which
is surrounded by an envelope of incompressible uniform density fluid. The
corresponding linear problem was studied in previous papers which this work
extends into the nonlinear regime, at moderate Ekman numbers (the ratio of
viscous to Coriolis accelerations). By performing high-resolution numerical
simulations, using a combination of pseudo-spectral and spectral element
methods, we investigate the effects of nonlinearities, which lead to
time-dependence of the flow and the corresponding dissipation rate. Angular
momentum is deposited non-uniformly, leading to the generation of significant
differential rotation in the initially uniformly rotating fluid, i.e. the body
does not evolve towards synchronism as a simple solid body rotator. This
differential rotation modifies the properties of tidally excited inertial
waves, changes the dissipative properties of the flow, and eventually becomes
unstable to a secondary shear instability provided that the Ekman number is
sufficiently small. Our main result is that the inclusion of nonlinearities
eventually modifies the flow and the resulting dissipation from what linear
calculations would predict, which has important implications for tidal
dissipation in fluid bodies. We finally discuss some limitations of our
simplified model, and propose avenues for future research to better understand
the tidal evolution of rotating planets and stars.

\textbf{measured} or derived from available data from literatures. We found
that the Doppler factor is on average larger in FBLs than in NFBLs, and the
$Fermi~ \gamma$-ray detection rate is higher in sources with higher Doppler
factor. In contrast, there are no significant differences in terms of the
intrinsic parameters of redshift, $ L_{\rm 408MHz}$, $ M_{\rm host}$ and $
P_{\rm NVSS}$. FBLs seem to have a higher probability of exhibiting measurable
proper motion. These results strongly indicate a higher beaming effect in FBLs
compared to NFBLs. The radio core flux is found to be strongly correlated with
$\gamma$-ray flux, which remains after excluding the common dependence of the
Doppler factor. At the fixed Doppler factor, FBLs have systematically larger
radio core flux than NFBLs, implying lower $\gamma$-ray emission in NFBLs since
the radio and $\gamma$-ray flux are significantly correlated. Our results
indicate that the Doppler factor is an important parameter of $\gamma$-ray
detection, the non-detection of $\gamma$-ray emission in NFBLs is likely due to
low beaming effect, and/or low intrinsic $\gamma$-ray flux, and the gamma-rays
are likely produced co-spatially with the arcsecond-scale radio core radiation
and mainly through the SSC process.

of a given shape into another one, which is optimal for a certain cost. It has
a number of applications in particular in medical imaging. In this article we
provide a new general approach to shape deformation analysis, within the
framework of optimal control theory, in which a deformation is represented as
the flow of diffeomorphisms generated by time-dependent vector fields. Using
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector fields, the general shape
deformation analysis problem is specified as an infinite-dimensional optimal
control problem with state and control constraints. In this problem, the states
are diffeomorphisms and the controls are vector fields, both of them being
subject to some constraints. The functional to be minimized is the sum of a
first term defined as geometric norm of the control (kinetic energy of the
deformation) and of a data attachment term providing a geometric distance to
the target shape. This point of view has several advantages. First, it allows
one to model general constrained shape analysis problems, which opens new
issues in this field. Second, using an extension of the Pontryagin maximum
principle, one can characterize the optimal solutions of the shape deformation
problem in a very general way as the solutions of constrained geodesic
equations. Finally, recasting general algorithms of optimal control into shape
analysis yields new efficient numerical methods in shape deformation analysis.
Overall, the optimal control point of view unifies and generalizes different
theoretical and numerical approaches to shape deformation problems, and also
allows us to design new approaches. The optimal control problems that result
from this construction are infinite dimensional and involve some constraints,
and thus are nonstandard. In this article we also provide a rigorous and
complete analysis of the infinite-dimensional shape space problem with
constraints and of its finite-dimensional approximations.

to recover 95% of all galaxies with projected radii within the virial radius
$r_{200}$ and 95% of the galaxies along the LOS. We then predict that 80 to 90%
of the galaxies in FoF groups should lie within their parent real-space groups
(RSGs), defined within their virial spheres. We test the FoF extraction for
16x16 pairs of LLs, using subsamples of galaxies, doubly complete in distance
and luminosity, of a flux-limited mock SDSS galaxy catalog. We find that
massive RSGs are more prone to fragmentation, while the fragments typically
have low estimated mass, with typically 30% of groups of low and intermediate
estimated mass being fragments. Group merging rises drastically with estimated
mass. For groups of 3 or more galaxies, galaxy completeness and reliability are
both typically better than 80% (after discarding the fragments). Estimated

sources: JHKs photometry from the 2MASS point source catalog; X-ray data from
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey; and radial velocities from literature sources. Within
the sample of 45 systems, we identify 21 candidate low-mass pre-main-sequence
members of nearby associations, including members of beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae,
Argus, AB Doradus, two ambiguous 30 Myr old systems, and one object that may be
a member of the Ursa Major moving group. Of the 21 candidate young systems, 14
are newly identified as a result of this work, and six of those are within 25
parsecs of the Sun.

wherein the logical operation is induced by spin-polarized currents which also
form the logical inputs. The operation is facilitated by the simultaneous
presence of a constant controlling magnetic field. The same spin-valve assembly
can also be used as a magnetic memory unit. We identify regions in the
parameter space of the system where the logical operations can be effectively
performed. The proposed gates retain the non-volatility of a magnetic random
access memory,(MRAM). We verify the functioning of the gate by numerically
simulating its dynamics, governed by the appropriate Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation with the spin-transfer torque term. The flipping time for the logical
states is estimated to be within nano seconds.

  differences: falsification of the purpose of achieving source-representative
  and closely comparable lab-results","20 Pages (including facts-illustrative [3] Tables and [2] Figures)",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently (arXiv:1101.0973), it has been pointed out by us that the possible
variation in any source (S) specific elemental isotopic (viz. 2H/1H) abundance
ratio SR can more accurately be assessed by its absolute estimate Sr [viz. as
(Sr - DR), with D as a standard-source] than by either corresponding
measured-relative (S/W-DELTA) estimate ([Sr/Wr] - 1) or
DELTA-scale-converted-relative (S/D-DELTA) estimate ([Sr/DR] - 1). Here, we
present the fundamentals behind scale-conversion, thereby enabling to
understand why at all Sr should be the source- and/ or variation-characterizing
key, i.e. why different lab-specific results should be more closely comparable
as absolute estimates (SrLab1, SrLab2) than as desired-relative (S/D-DELTALab1,
S/D-DELTALab2) estimates. Further, the study clarifies that: (i) the
DELTA-scale-conversion (S/W-DELTA into S/D-DELTA, even with the aid of
calibrated auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s)) cannot make the estimates (as
S/D-DELTA, and thus Sr) free of the measurement-reference W; (ii) the employing
of (increasing number of) Ai-standards should cause the estimates to be rather
(increasingly) inaccurate and, additionally, Ai(s)-specific; and (iii) the
S/D-DELTA-estimate may, specifically if S happens to be very close to D in
isotopic composition (IC), even misrepresent S; but the corresponding Sr should
be very accurate. However, for S and W to be increasingly closer in IC, the
S/D-DELTA-estimate and also Sr are shown to be increasingly accurate,
irrespective of whether the S/W-DELTA-measurement accuracy could thus be
improved or not. Clearly, improvement in measurement-accuracy should ensure
additional accuracy in results.

  tools to weight values in many cultures","Submitted for publication",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shame has clear biological roots and its precise form of expression affects
social cohesion and cultural characteristics. Here we explore the relative
importance between shame and guilt by using Google Translate to produce
translation for the words shame, guilt, pain, embarrassment and fear to the 64
languages covered. We also explore the meanings of these concepts among the
Yanomami, a horticulturist hunter-gatherer tribe in the Orinoquia. Results show
that societies previously described as 'guilt societies' have more words for
guilt than for shame, but the large majority, including the societies
previously described as 'shame societies', have more words for shame than for
guilt. Results are consistent with evolutionary models of shame which predict a
wide scatter in the relative importance between guilt and shame, suggesting
that cultural evolution of shame has continued the work of biological
evolution, and that neither provides a strong adaptive advantage to either
shame or guilt. We propose that the study of shame will improve our
understanding of the interaction between biological and cultural evolution in
the evolution of cognition and emotions.

varieties of representable diagonal-free cylindric algebras and Halmos'
polyadic algebras (without equality). We apply our hitherto obtained algebraic
results to show that the omitting types theorem fails for finite variable
fragments of first order logic with and without equality, having n variables,
even if we count in severely relativized models as candidates for omitting
single non-principle types. Finally, we show that for many cylindric-like

spatial coordinates satisfy the SU(2) Lie algebra. As the consequence, the
space has a lattice nature and the maximum value of momentum is bounded from
above. The model shows interesting features due to the bound, namely, a
repulsive potential can develop bound-states, or an attractive region may be
forbidden for particles to propagate with higher energies. The exact radial
eigen-functions in momentum space are given by means of the associated
Chebyshev functions. For the radial stepwise potentials the exact energy
condition and the eigen-functions are presented. For a general radial potential
it is shown that the discrete energy spectrum can be obtained in desired
accuracy by means of given forms of continued fractions.
