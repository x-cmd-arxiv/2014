high rates. While this predicts an accumulation of genes, the gene number has
remained remarkably constant through evolution. This paradox has not yet been
resolved. Because orphan genes have been mainly analyzed over long evolutionary
time scales, orphan loss has remained unexplored. Here we study the patterns of
orphan turnover among close relatives in the Drosophila obscura group. We show
that orphans are not only emerging at a high rate, but that they are also
rapidly lost. Interestingly, recently emerged orphans are more likely to be
lost than older ones. Furthermore, highly expressed orphans with a strong
male-bias are more likely to be retained. Since both lost and retained orphans
show similar evolutionary signatures of functional conservation, we propose
that orphan loss is not driven by high rates of sequence evolution, but
reflects lineage specific functional requirements.

many particles in an array of harmonic traps needs investigation and poses a
question of scalability. This work investigates the cooling of a one
dimensional atomic array to the ground state of motion via the interaction with
the single mode field of a high-finesse cavity. The key factor ensuring the
cooling is found to be the mechanical inhomogeneity of the traps. Furthermore
it is shown that the pumped cavity mode does not only mediate the cooling but
also provides the necessary inhomogeneity if its periodicity differs from the
one of the array. This configuration results in the ground state cooling of
several tens of atoms within a few milliseconds, a timescale compatible with
current experimental conditions. Moreover, the cooling rate scaling with the
atom number reveals a drastic change of the dynamics with the size of the
array: atoms are either cooled independently, or via collective modes. In the
latter case the cavity mediated atom interaction destructively slows down the
cooling as well as increases the mean occupation number, quadratically with the
atom number. Finally, an order of magnitude speed up of the cooling is
predicted as an outcome the optimization scheme based on the adjustment of the
array versus the cavity mode periodicity.

(i.e., when communication content remains fixed from some point in time during
any execution), there exists a lower bound of Omega(\log n) bits of memory per
node participating to the leader election (where n denotes the number of nodes
in the system). This lower bound holds even in rings. We present a new
deterministic (non-silent) self-stabilizing protocol for n-node rings that uses
only O(\log\log n) memory bits per node, and stabilizes in O(n\log^2 n) rounds.
Our protocol has several attractive features that make it suitable for
practical purposes. First, the communication model fits with the model used by
existing compilers for real networks. Second, the size of the ring (or any
upper bound on this size) needs not to be known by any node. Third, the node
identifiers can be of various sizes. Finally, no synchrony assumption, besides
a weakly fair scheduler, is assumed. Therefore, our result shows that, perhaps
surprisingly, trading silence for exponential improvement in term of memory
space does not come at a high cost regarding stabilization time or minimal
assumptions.

characteristics of multilayered open coaxial waveguides. The study is motivated
by the need of improved modeling and an increased physical understanding about
the wave propagation phenomena on very long power cables which has a potential
industrial application with fault localization and monitoring. The
electromagnetic model is based on a layer recursive computation of
axial-symmetric fields in connection with a magnetic frill generator excitation
that can be calibrated to the current measured at the input of the cable. The
layer recursive formulation enables a stable and efficient numerical
computation of the related dispersion functions as well as a detailed analysis
regarding the analytic and asymptotic properties of the associated
determinants. Modal contributions as well as the contribution from the
associated branch-cut (non-discrete radiating modes) are defined and analyzed.
Measurements and modeling of pulse propagation on an 82 km long HVDC power
cable are presented as a concrete example. In this example, it is concluded
that the contribution from the second TM mode as well as from the branch-cut is
negligible for all practical purposes. However, it is also shown that for
extremely long power cables the contribution from the branch-cut can in fact
dominate over the quasi-TEM mode for some frequency intervals. The main
contribution of this paper is to provide the necessary analysis tools for a

kinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamical
histories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. The
clustering of low-mass stars around the massive W-R binary gamma^2 Velorum was
one of the first GES targets. Aims: To empirically determine the radial
velocity (RV) precision of GES data, construct a kinematically unbiased sample
of cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. Methods: Targets
were selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolution
spectroscopy used to derive RVs and assess membership from the strength of the
Li6708A line. The RV distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihood
technique that accounts for unresolved binaries. Results: The GES RV precision
is about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-mass
population around gamma^2 Vel. The structure is well fitted by two kinematic
components with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsic
dispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. The second
has a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by
~2km/s. The first population is older by 1-2Myr based on a greater level of Li
depletion seen among its M-stars and is probably more centrally concentrated
around gamma^2 Vel. Conclusions: We consider several formation scenarios,
concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of the
original, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 Vel, and a dispersed population
from the wider Vela OB2 association, of which gamma^2 Vel is the most massive
member. The apparent youth of gamma^2 Vel compared to the older (>=10Myr)
low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binary
formed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of the
low-mass stars.[abridged]

images obtained after deconvolution of the interferometer's point spread
function (PSF). This strategy can be understood (especially for cases of sparse
arrays) as fitting models to models, since the deconvolved images are already
non-unique model representations of the actual data (i.e., the visibilities).
Indeed, the interferometric images may be affected by visibility gridding,
weighting schemes (e.g., natural vs. uniform), and the particulars of the
(non-linear) deconvolution algorithms. Fitting models to the direct
interferometric observables (i.e., the visibilities) is preferable in the cases
of simple (analytical) sky intensity distributions. In this paper, we present
UVMULTIFIT, a versatile library for fitting visibility data, implemented in a
Python-based framework. Our software is currently based on the CASA package,
but can be easily adapted to other analysis packages, provided they have a
Python API. We have tested the software with synthetic data, as well as with
real observations. In some cases (e.g., sources with sizes smaller than the
diffraction limit of the interferometer), the results from the fit to the
visibilities (e.g., spectra of close by sources) are far superior to the output
obtained from the mere analysis of the deconvolved images. UVMULTIFIT is a
powerful improvement of existing tasks to extract the maximum amount of
information from visibility data, especially in cases close to the
sensitivity/resolution limits of interferometric observations.

variety of applications ranging from statistical physics to computational
biology. Traditionally, learning of the network structure has been done under
the assumption of chordality which ensures that efficient scoring methods can
be used. In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants
which renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond
very small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards
the use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of
large-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of
chordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a
tuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset,
which can be optimized for example by cross-validation. Here we introduce a
Bayesian version of pseudo-likelihood scoring of Markov networks, which enables
an automatic regularization through marginalization over the nuisance
parameters in the model. We prove consistency of the resulting MPL estimator
for the network structure via comparison with the pseudo information criterion.
Identification of the MPL-optimal network on a prescanned graph space is
considered with both greedy hill climbing and exact pseudo-Boolean optimization
algorithms. We find that for reasonable sample sizes the hill climbing approach
most often identifies networks that are at a negligible distance from the
restricted global optimum. Using synthetic and existing benchmark networks, the
marginal pseudo-likelihood method is shown to generally perform favorably
against recent popular inference methods for Markov networks.

dwarfs in the total 25 pc sample of 224 white dwarfs. There is also little to
suggest the presence of genuine thick disk subcomponent members within 25
parsecs. It appears that the entire 25 pc sample likely belong to the thin
disk. We also find no significant kinematic differences with respect to
spectroscopic subtypes. The total DA to non-DA ratio of the 25 pc sample is
1.8, a manifestation of deepening envelope convection which transforms DA stars
with sufficiently thin H surface layers into non-DAs. We compare this ratio
with the results of other studies. We find that at least 11% of the white
dwarfs within 25 parsecs of the sun (the DAZ and DZ stars) have photospheric
metals that likely originate from accretion of circumstellar material (debris
disks) around them. If this interpretation is correct, then it suggests the
possibility that a similar percentage have planets, asteroid-like bodies or
debris disks orbiting them. Our volume-limited sample reveals a pileup of DC
white dwarfs at the well-known cutoff in DQ white dwarfs at Tef about 6000K.
Mindful of small number statistics, we speculate on its possible evolutionary
significance. We find that the incidence of magnetic white dwarfs in the 25 pc
sample is at least 8%, in our volume-limited sample, dominated by cool white
dwarfs. We derive approximate formation rates of DB and DQ degenerates and
present a preliminary test of the evolutionary scenario that all cooling DB
stars become DQ white dwarfs via helium convective dredge-up with the diffusion
tail of carbon extending upward from their cores.

particles with a surrounding fluid (interstitial gas phase). First, when the
drag force is the only external action on the state of the system, the
Boltzmann equation admits a Maxwellian solution $f_0(\mathbf{v},t)$ with a
time-dependent temperature. Then, the Boltzmann equation is solved by means of
the Chapman-Enskog expansion around the local version of the distribution $f_0$
to obtain the relevant transport coefficients of the system: the shear
viscosity $\eta$, the thermal conductivity $\kappa$, and a new transport
coefficient $\mu$ (which is also present in granular gases) relating the heat
flux with the density gradient. The results indicate that while $\eta$ is not
affected by the drag force, the impact of this force on the transport
coefficients $\kappa$ and $\mu$ may be significant. Finally, a stability
analysis of the linear hydrodynamic equations with respect to the
time-dependent equilibrium state is performed, showing that the onset of
instability is associated with the transversal shear mode that could be
unstable for wave numbers smaller than a certain critical wave number.

that affects merger fraction studies based on close pairs. We compute the
merger fraction from photometric redshift close pairs with 10h^-1 kpc <= rp <=
50h^-1 kpc and Dv <= 500 km/s, and measure it in the 48 sub-fields of the
ALHAMBRA survey. We study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,
that follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v as
the intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. We develop a maximum
likelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion due
to the observational errors (including the Poisson shot noise term). The cosmic
variance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of the
populations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)
galaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume V_c. We find a
significant dependence on neither the search radius used to define close
companions, the redshift, nor the physical selection (luminosity or stellar
mass) of the samples. We provide a parametrisation of the cosmic variance with
n_1, n_2, and V_c, sigma_v = 0.48 n_1^{-0.54} V_c^{-0.48} (n_2/n_1)^{-0.37}.
Thanks to this prescription, future merger fraction studies based on close
pairs could account properly for the cosmic variance on their results.

of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to
learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any
real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task
environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is
typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too
long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is
impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be
unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that
quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning
as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of
quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active
learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be
particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.

Eta Car's ultra-violet, optical, and X-ray light curves and its
spectrum suggest a physical change in its stellar wind over the last decade. It
was proposed that the mass-loss rate decreased by a factor of about 2 in the
last 15 years. We complement these recent results by investigating the past
evolution and the current state of eta Car in the near-infrared (IR). Methods.
We present JHKL photometry of eta Car obtained at SAAO Sutherland from
2004-2013 with the Mk II photometer at the 0.75-m telescope and JHKs photometry
with SIRIUS at the 1.4-m IRSF telescope from 2012-2013. The near-IR light
curves since 1972 are analyzed. Results. The long-term brightening trends in
eta Car's JHKL light curves were discontinuous around the 1998 periastron
passage. After 1998, the star shows excess emission above the extrapolated
trend from earlier dates, foremost in J and H, and the blueward, cyclical
progression in its near-IR colors is accelerated. The near-IR color evolution
is strongly correlated with the periastron passages. After correcting for the
secular trend we find that the color evolution matches an apparent increase in
blackbody temperature of an optically thick near-IR emitting plasma component
from about 3500 to 6000 K over the last 20 years. Conclusions. We suggest that
the changing near-IR emission may be caused by variability in optically thick
bremsstrahlung emission. Periastron passages play a key role in the observed
excess near-IR emission after 1998 and the long-term color evolution. We thus
propose as a hypothesis that angular momentum transfer (via tidal acceleration)
during periastron passages leads to sudden changes in eta Car's atmosphere
resulting in a long-term decrease in the mass-loss rate.

based on blockwise empirical likelihood [Kitamura (1997)] and nonstandard
expansive empirical likelihood [Nordman et al. (2013)] methods for time series
data are investigated via studying the probability for the violation of the
convex hull constraint. The large sample bounds are derived on the basis of the
pivotal limit of the blockwise empirical log-likelihood ratio obtained under
the fixed-b asymptotics, which has been recently shown to provide a more
accurate approximation to the finite sample distribution than the conventional
chi-square approximation. Our theoretical and numerical findings suggest that
both the finite sample and large sample upper bounds for coverage probabilities
are strictly less than one and the blockwise empirical likelihood confidence
region can exhibit serious undercoverage when (i) the dimension of moment
conditions is moderate or large; (ii) the time series dependence is positively
strong; or (iii) the block size is large relative to sample size. A similar
finite sample coverage problem occurs for the nonstandard expansive empirical
likelihood. To alleviate the coverage bound problem, we propose to penalize
both empirical likelihood methods by relaxing the convex hull constraint.
Numerical simulations and data illustration demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed remedies in terms of delivering confidence sets with more accurate
coverage.

in comparison to a standard \LCDM\ cosmology. For each we use $2\times1024^3$
particles in a $250$\hMpc\ periodic box assuming WMAP7 cosmology. In this work
we focus on the properties of haloes in the cosmic web at $z=0$. The web is
classified into \emph{voids}, \emph{sheets}, \emph{filaments} and \emph{knots}
depending on the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor, which are an
excellent proxy for the underlying overdensity distribution. We find that the
properties of objects classified according to their surrounding environment
shows a substantial dependence on the underlying cosmology; for example, while
$V_{\rm max}$ shows average deviations of $\approx5$ per cent across the
different models when considering the full halo sample, comparing objects
classified according to their environment, the size of the deviation can be as
large as $20$ per cent.
  We also find that halo spin parameters are positively correlated to the
coupling, whereas halo concentrations show the opposite behaviour. Furthermore,
when studying the concentration-mass relation in different environments, we
find that in all cosmologies underdense regions have a larger normalization and
a shallower slope. While this behaviour is found to characterize all the
models, differences in the best-fit relations are enhanced in (coupled) dark
energy, thus providing a clearer prediction for this class of models.

strong magnetic fields ($B>m^2$) the AMM is found from the one-loop fermion
self-energy. In contrast to the weak-field AMM found by Schwinger, in the
strong magnetic field case, the AMM depends on the Landau level (LL) and
decreases with it. The effects of the AMM in the EoS at intermediate-to-large
fields can be found introducing the one-loop, LL-dependent AMM in the effective
Lagrangian that is then used to find the thermodynamic potential of the system.
We compare the plots of the parallel and perpendicular pressures versus the
magnetic field in the strong field region considering the LL-dependent AMM, the
Schwinger AMM, and no AMM at all. The results clearly show a separation between
the physical magnitudes found using the Schwinger AMM and the LL-dependent AMM.
This is an indication of the inconsistency of considering the Schwinger AMM
beyond the weak field region $B< m^2$ where it was originally found. The curves
for the EoS, pressures and magnetization at different fields give rise to the
well-known de Haas van Alphen oscillations, associated to the change in the
number of LL contributing at different fields.

generates a Markov chain $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ that, when $n$ is large we
have $X_n\sim P$. These MCMC methods consist of several simulation strategies
including the \emph{Independent Sampler (IS)}, the \emph{Random Walk of
Metropolis Hastings \small{(RWMH)}}, the \emph{Gibbs sampler}, the
\emph{Adaptive Metropolis (AM)} and \emph{Metropolis Within Gibbs (MWG)}
strategy. Each of these strategies can generate a Markov chain and is
associated with a convergence speed. It is interesting, with a given target
law, to compare several simulation strategies for determining the best.
Chauveau and Vandekerkhove \cite{Chauv2007} have compared IS and RWMH
strategies using the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. In our article we
will compare our five simulation methods already mentioned using generalized
divergence measures. These divergence measures are taken in family of
$\alpha$-divergence measures \cite{Cichocki2010}, with a parameter $\alpha$.
This is the R\'enyi divergence, Tsallis divergence and $D_\alpha$ divergence .

modelling approach taking into account such interplay under general conditions

classes. We describe a spatially structured population with non-homogeneous
mixing and travel behaviour through a multi-host stochastic epidemic
metapopulation model. Different population partitions, mixing patterns and

  We provide a complete mathematical formulation of the model and derive a

emerging infectious disease in the metapopulation system. A rich solution space
is found that depends on the social partition of the population, the pattern of
contacts across groups and their relative social activity, the travel attitude
of each class, and the topological and traffic features of the mobility
network. Reducing the activity of the less social group and reducing the
cross-group mixing are predicted to be the most efficient strategies for
controlling the pandemic potential in the case the less active group
constitutes the majority of travellers. If instead traveling is dominated by
the more social class, our model predicts the existence of an optimal
across-groups mixing that maximises the pandemic potential of the disease,

Brans-Dicke (BD) scalar field on brane has been utilized to investigate the
problem of the quark-hadron phase (QHP) transition in early times of the
Universe evolution. The presence of the BD scalar field comes up with some
modification terms in the Friedmann equation. Since the behavior of phase
transition strongly depends on the basic evolution equations, even a small
change in these relations might come to interesting results about the time of
transition. The phase transition is investigated using two scenarios of the
first-order phase transition and smooth crossover phase transition. For
first-order scenario, which is used for intermediate temperature regime, the
evolution of the physical quantities, such as temperature and scale factor, are
investigated before, during and after the phase transition. The results show
that the transition occurs in about micro-second. In the next part, the
phenomenon is studied by assuming a smooth crossover transition where the
lattice QCD data is utilized to obtain a realistic equation of state for the
matter. The investigation for this part is performed in two regimes of high and
low-temperature. Using trace anomaly in the high-temperature regime specifies a
simple equation of state which states that the quark-gluon behaves like
radiation. However, in the low-temperature regime, the trace anomaly is
affected by discretization effects, and the hadron resonance gas model is
utilized instead. Using this model, a more realistic equation of state could be
found in the low-temperature regime. The crossover phase transition in both
regimes is considered. The results determine that the transition occurs at the
time around a few micro-second. Also, it is realized that the transition in the
low-temperature regime occurs after the transition in the high-temperature
regime.

this setting, the moduli of the elements of one column of the lepton mixing

Perturbation Theory extended by including resonances as active fields. We have
found that the treatment of final state interactions is crucial to provide a
good description of the data. The Breit-Wigner approximation does not resum
them and neglects the real part of the corresponding chiral loop functions,
which violates analyticity and leads to a failure in the confrontation with the
data. On the contrary, its resummation by means of an Omn\`es-like
exponentiation of through a dispersive representation provides a successful
explanation of the measurements. These results illustrate the fact that
Breit-Wigner parametrizations of hadronic data, although simple and easy to
handle, lack a link with the underlying strong interaction theory and should be
avoided.

$\mathbb{R}^n$ or on Hilbert spaces by sup-inf convolutions with squares of
distances can be extended to (finite or infinite dimensional) Riemannian
manifolds $M$ of bounded sectional curvature. More specifically, among other
things we show that if the sectional curvature $K$ of $M$ satisfies $-K_0\leq
K\leq K_0$ on $M$ for some $K_0>0$, and if the injectivity and convexity radii
of $M$ are strictly positive, then every bounded, uniformly continuous function
$f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ can be uniformly approximated by globally $C^{1,1}$
functions defined by $$ (f_{\lambda})^{\mu}=\sup_{z\in M}\inf_{y\in
M}\{f(y)+\frac{1}{2\lambda} d(z,y)^{2}-\frac{1}{2\mu}d(x,z)^2\} $$ as $\lambda,
\mu\to 0^{+}$, with $0<\mu<\lambda/2$. Our definition of (global) $C^{1,1}$
smoothness is intrinsic and natural, and it reduces to the usual one in flat
spaces, but we warn the reader that, in the noncompact case, this definition
differs from other notions of (rather local) $C^{1,1}$ smoothness that have
been recently used, for instance, by A. Fathi and P. Bernard (based on charts).
The importance of this regularization method lies (rather than on the degree of
smoothness obtained) on the fact that the correspondence $f\mapsto
(f_{\lambda})^{\mu}$ is explicit and preserves many significant geometrical
properties that the given functions $f$ may have, such as invariance by a set
of isometries, infima, sets of minimizers, ordering, local or global
Lipschitzness, and (only when one additionally assumes that $K\leq 0$) local or
global convexity. We also give two examples showing that this result completely
fails, even for (nonflat) Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, whenever $f$ or $K$ are
not bounded.

of the companion derived from the SDSS spectrum is M6-7, somewhat later than
expected for the orbital period of IR Com. Its radial velocity amplitude,
K_2=419.6+-3.4 km/s, together with the inclination of 75-90deg implies
0.8Msun<Mwd<1.0Msun. We estimate the white dwarf temperature to be ~15000K, and
the absence of Zeeman splitting in the Balmer lines rules out magnetic fields
in excess of ~5 MG. IR Com still defies an unambiguous classification, in

interactions in metals and semiconductors, and has been extensively studied
theoretically for parabolic band electronic systems in three-, two-, and
one-dimensional systems over the last fifty years. In the current work, we
theoretically study the relevance of Migdal's theorem in graphene and Weyl
semimetals which are examples of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, respectively, with
linear and chiral band dispersion. Our work also applies to 2D and 3D
topological insulator systems. In Fermi liquids, the renormalization of the
electron-phonon vertex scales as the ratio of sound ($v_s$) to Fermi ($v_F$)
velocity, which is typically a small quantity. In two- and three-dimensional
quasirelativistic systems, such as undoped graphene and Weyl semimetals, the
one loop electron-phonon vertex renormalization, which also scales as
$\eta=v_s/v_F$ as $\eta \rightarrow 0$, is, however, enhanced by an ultraviolet
\emph{logarithmic divergent correction}, arising from the linear, chiral Dirac
band dispersion. Such enhancement of the electron-phonon vertex can be
significantly softened due to the logarithmic increment of the Fermi velocity,
arising from the long range Coulomb interaction, and therefore, the
electron-phonon vertex correction does not have a logarithmic divergence at low
energy. Otherwise, the Coulomb interaction does not lead to any additional
renormalization of the electron-phonon vertex. Therefore, electron-phonon
vertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional Dirac fermionic systems scale
as $v_s/v^0_F$, where $v^0_F$ is the bare Fermi velocity, and small when $v_s
\ll v^0_F$. These results, although explicitly derived for the intrinsic
undoped systems, should hold even when the chemical potential is tuned away
from the Dirac points.

the formation of the first low-mass stars. The minimal conditions to activate
dust-induced fragmentation require the gas to be pre-enriched above a critical
dust-to-gas mass ratio Dcr=[2.6--6.3]x10^-9 with the spread reflecting the
dependence on the grain properties. The recently discovered Galactic halo star
SDSS J102915+172927 has a stellar mass of 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of
Z=4.5x10^-5 Zsun and represents an optimal candidate for the dust-induced

supernova progenitors, with 20 Msun and 35 Msun, the critical dust-to-gas mass
ratio can be overcome provided that at least 0.4 Msun of dust condenses in the
ejecta, allowing for moderate destruction by the reverse shock. Here we show
that even if dust formation in the first supernovae is less efficient or strong
dust destruction does occur, grain growth during the collapse of the parent gas
cloud is sufficiently rapid to activate dust cooling and likely fragmentation
into low-mass and long-lived stars. Silicates and magnetite grains can
experience significant grain growth in the density range 10^9 /cc < nH<10^12
/cc by accreting gas-phase species (SiO, SiO2, and Fe) until their gas-phase
abundance drops to zero, reaching condensation efficiencies =1. The
corresponding increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio allows dust-induced
cooling and fragmentation to be activated at 10^12 /cc < nH < 10^14 /cc, before
the collapsing cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation. We show
that for all the initial conditions that apply to the parent cloud of SDSS

of the early evolution of circumstellar disks. Through population syntheses, we
study how correlated uncertainties between the estimated parameters of young

well as observational selection effects, can bias the temporal decay of mass
accretion rates (Mdot t^-eta) inferred from a comparison of measured Mdot with
isochronal ages in young stellar clusters. We find that the presence of
realistic uncertainties reduces the measured value of eta by up to a factor of
3, leading to the inference of shallower decays than the true value. This
suggests a much faster temporal decay of Mdot than generally assumed. When
considering the minimum uncertainties in ages affecting the Orion Nebula
Cluster, the observed value eta~1.4, typical of Galactic star forming regions,
can only be reproduced if the real decay exponent is eta>4. This effect becomes
more severe if one assumes that observational uncertainties are larger, as
required by some fast star formation scenarios. Our analysis shows that while
selection effects due to sample incompleteness do bias eta, they can not alter
this main result and strengthen it in many cases. A remaining uncertainty in
our work is that it applies to the most commonly used and simple relationship

dynamics to vary considerably with ambient density. In the highest ambient
density cases, infalling material drives a strong compression wave into the
cloud. It is the propagation of this wave through the cloud interior that
triggers the subsequent collapse. For lower ambient densities, we find the main
trigger of collapse to be a quasistatic adjustment of the BE sphere to
gravitational settling of the ambient gas. In all cases, we find that the
classic ""outside-in"" collapse mode for super-critical BE spheres is recovered
before a protostar (i.e. sink particle) forms. Our work supports scenarios in
which BE dynamics naturally begins with either a compression-wave or infall
dominated phase, and only later assumes the usual outside-in collapse behavior.

merging group which has passed pericentre and responsible for triggering a cold
front in the cluster core. We define two samples to represent two different
environments within A1664 in accordance with the location of the substructure.
We apply a morphological analysis using CAS, M$_{20}$ and Gini to these samples
to deduce if there has been any significant effect on the cluster galaxies due
to this interaction. We find there are more asymmetric galaxies found in the
inner sample (at the 3.7$\sigma$ level) which is likely due to galaxy-galaxy
interactions as the merging group passed through core passage. No other
differences were found between the inner and outer cluster in our morphological
analysis, which we attribute to the limited resolution of our imagery. The

morphology-density relation suggesting there is no unique environmental effect
in A1664 that has enhanced galaxy transformations. This study favours the star
formation of cluster galaxies being quenched well before it is able to interact

self-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. We find that AGN
feedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.
The similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within
$R_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the
core density. Breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,
morphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction
with the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. Self-regulated
feedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents the
dramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatter
is also limited. The impulsive thermal blast can break the core-included
$L_{\rm x}-T_{\rm x}$ at $T_{500} < 1$ keV, but substantially empties and
overheats the halo, generating a perennial non-cool-core group, as experienced

explosions is at the heart of producing galaxy-scale outflows. We use
hydrodynamical simulations to study the efficiency of multiple SNe in heating
the interstellar medium (ISM) and filling the volume with gas of high
temperatures. We argue that it is important for SNe remnants to have a large
filling factor {\it and} a large heating efficiency. For this, they have to be
clustered in space and time, and keep exploding until the hot gas percolates
through the whole region, in order to compensate for the radiative loss. In the
case of a limited number of SNe, we find that although the filling factor can
be large, the heating efficiency declines after reaching a large value. In the
case of a continuous series of SNe, the hot gas ($T \ge 3 \times 10^6$ K) can
percolate through the whole region after the total volume filling factor
reaches a threshold of $\sim 0.3$. The efficiency of heating the gas to X-ray
temperatures can be $\ge 0.1$ after this percolation epoch, which occurs after
a period of $\approx 10$ Myr for a typical starburst SNe rate density of
$\nu_{\rm SN} \approx 10^{-9}$ pc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ and gas density of $n\approx
10$ cm$^{-3}$ in starburst nuclei regions. This matches the recent observations
of a time delay of similar order between the onset of star formation and
galactic outflows. The efficiency to heat gas up to X-ray temperatures ($\ge
10^{6.5}$ K) roughly scales as $\nu_{\rm SN}^{0.2} n^{-0.6}$. For a typical SNe
rate density and gas density in starburst nuclei, the heating efficiency is
$\sim 0.15$, also consistent with previous interpretations from X-ray
observations. We discuss the implications of our results with regard to
observational diagnostics of ionic ratios and emission measures in starburst
nuclei regions.

variability. This lucky event allows us to observe clearly a soft spectral
component undergoing a large-amplitude but slow flux variation. Using combined
spectral and timing analysis we isolate two independent variable continuum
components and characterize their behavior as a function of timescale. Rapid
and coherent variations throughout the 0.2-10 keV band reveal a spectrally hard

dominates the observed variability on timescales greater than 30 ks. Both

degeneracy between models for the soft excess: it is consistent with a
power-law or thermal Comptonized component, but not with a blackbody or an

been estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 kpc in a recent work. By exploiting the Sloan

times more luminous) than the median QSO at comparable redshifts. We describe
the total mass distribution of the lens galaxy with a one-component singular
isothermal sphere model and contrast the values of the observed and
model-predicted magnification factors. For the former, we use conservatively
the photometric data of the 95% of the available distant QSO population. We
estimate that the values of the lens effective velocity dispersion and
two-dimensional total mass, projected within a cylinder with radius equal to
the impact parameter, are included between 60 and 170 km/s and 2.1 x 10^9 and

of a quasar light curve directly measures the color of the flux difference

First, we confirm that the observed quasar spectrum becomes bluer when the

$f_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha_{\nu}}$), which is significantly bluer than that of

the continuum variability cannot be explained by the accretion disk models with
varying mass accretion rate. Second, we examine the effects of broad emission
line variability on the color-redshift space. The variability of the ""Small

when averaging over large scales. However, values of star formation rates and
gas surface densities lie close in the plot for any averaging size. This
suggests an intrinsic relation between stars and gas at cell-size scales, which
dominates over the global dynamical evolution. To investigate this effect, we
develop a method to simulate the creation of stars based on the density field
from the snapshots, without running the code again. We also investigate how the
star formation law is affected by the characteristic star formation timescale,
the density threshold and the efficiency considered in the recipe. We find that
the slope of the law might vary from ~1.4 for a free-fall timescale, to ~1.0
for a constant depletion timescale. We further demonstrate that a power-law is
recovered just by assuming that the mass of the new stars is a fraction of the
mass of the cell $m_\star=\epsilon\rho_{\rm gas}\Delta x^3$, with no other
physical criteria required. We show that both efficiency and density threshold
do not affect the slope, but the right combination of them can adjust the
normalization of the relation, which in turn could explain a possible
bi-modality in the law.

derived, maximum entropy, one shape parameter model for isotropic collisionless

Specifically, it fits the energy distribution, N(E), and the density profiles,
including the central cusp. Here, we extend DARKexp N(E) to include the
distribution in angular momentum, L^2, for spherically symmetric systems.
First, we argue, based on theoretical, semi-analytical, and simulation results,
that while dark-matter halos are relaxed in energy, they are not nearly as
relaxed in angular momentum, which precludes using maximum entropy to uniquely
derive N(E,L^2). Instead, we require that when integrating N(E,L^2) over
squared angular momenta one retrieves the DARKexp N(E). Starting with a general
expression for N(E,L^2) we show how the distribution of particles in L^2 is
related to the shape of the velocity distribution function, VDF, and velocity
anisotropy profile, \beta(r). We then demonstrate that astrophysically
realistic halos, as judged by the VDF shape and \beta(r), must have linear or
convex distributions in L^2, for each separate energy bin. The distribution in
energy of the most bound particles must be nearly flat, and become more tilted
in favor of radial orbits for less bound particles. These results are
consistent with numerical simulations and represent an important step towards
deriving the full distribution function for spherically symmetric dark-matter
halos.

systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a
constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective
light cone. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems
with long-range interactions, since the best long-range bound is too loose to
give the correct light-cone shape for any known spin model and since analytic
solutions rarely exist. In this work, we experimentally determine the spatial
and time-dependent correlations of a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body
system evolving under a long-range Ising- or XY-model Hamiltonian. For several
different interaction ranges, we extract the shape of the light cone and
measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. In

of water - TIP4P/2005, TIP4P/2005f and TTM3F. Dipole spatial correlation is
measured using the distance dependent Kirkwood function along with one
dimensional and two dimensional dipole correlation functions. We find that the
introduction of flexibility alone does not significantly affect dipole
correlation and only affects $\varepsilon(\omega)$ at high frequencies. By
contrast the introduction of polarizability increases dipole correlation and
yields a more accurate $\varepsilon(\omega)$. Additionally the introduction of
polarizability creates temperature dependence in the dipole moment even at
fixed density, yielding a more accurate value for $d \varepsilon / d T$
compared to non-polarizable models. To better understand the physical origin of
the dielectric properties of water we make analogies to the physics of polar
nanoregions in relaxor ferroelectric materials. We show that
$\varepsilon(\omega,T)$ and $\tau_D(T)$ for water have striking similarities
with relaxor ferroelectrics, a class of materials characterized by large
frequency dispersion in $\varepsilon(\omega,T)$, Vogel-Fulcher-Tamann behaviour
in $\tau_D(T)$, and the existence of polar nanoregions.

the welfare of the overall system over greedily maximizing their own utility.
When downloading a file broken up into multiple pieces, peers are often asked
to pass on some possible download opportunities of common pieces in order to
favor rare pieces. This is to avoid the missing piece syndrome, which throttles
the download rate of the peer-to-peer system to that of downloading the file
straight from the server. In other situations, peers are asked to stay in the

  We propose a mechanism which allows peers to act greedily and yet stabilizes
the peer-to-peer content sharing system. Our mechanism combines a fountain code
at the server to generate innovative new pieces, and a prioritization for the
server to deliver pieces only to new peers. While by itself, neither the

fixed time division between eNB-RN and RN-UE transmissions (typical relay
capacity or throughput research models balance them optimally, which is
unrealistic nowadays); $ii$) There is a trade-off between the time-division

engines of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), are characterized by extreme
physical conditions not encountered elsewhere in the Universe. In particular,
they possess magnetic fields that exceed the critical quantum field of 44
teragauss. Figuring out how these complex ultra-magnetized systems work
requires understanding various plasma processes, both small-scale kinetic and
large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). However, an ultra-strong magnetic field
modifies the underlying physics to such an extent that many relevant
plasma-physical problems call for building QED-based relativistic quantum
plasma physics. In this review, after describing the extreme astrophysical
systems of interest and identifying the key relevant plasma-physical problems,
we survey the recent progress in the development of such a theory. We discuss
how a super-critical field modifies the properties of vacuum and matter and
outline the basic theoretical framework for describing both non-relativistic
and relativistic quantum plasmas. We then turn to astrophysical applications of
relativistic QED plasma physics relevant to magnetar magnetospheres and central
engines of supernovae and long GRBs. Specifically, we discuss propagation of
light through a magnetar magnetosphere; large-scale MHD processes driving
magnetar activity and GRB jet launching and propagation; energy-transport
processes governing the thermodynamics of extreme plasma environments;
micro-scale kinetic plasma processes important in the interaction of intense
magnetospheric electric currents with a magnetar's surface; and magnetic
reconnection of ultra-strong magnetic fields. Finally, we point out that future
progress will require the development of numerical modeling capabilities.

3 x 10^19 cm^-2 K^-1 km^-1 s and find a factor of ~3 variations in X_CO between
the five sub-regions in Perseus. Within the individual regions, X_CO varies by
a factor of ~100, suggesting that X_CO strongly depends on local conditions in
the interstellar medium. We find that X_CO sharply decreases at Av < 3 mag but
gradually increases at Av > 3 mag, with the transition occurring at Av where
I_CO becomes optically thick. We compare the N(HI), N(H2), I_CO, and X_CO
distributions with two models of the formation of molecular gas, a
one-dimensional photodissociation region (PDR) model and a three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model tracking both the dynamical and chemical
evolution of gas. The PDR model based on the steady state and equilibrium
chemistry reproduces our data very well but requires a diffuse halo to match
the observed N(HI) and I_CO distributions. The MHD model generally matches our
data well, suggesting that time-dependent effects on H2 and CO formation are
insignificant for an evolved molecular cloud like Perseus. However, we find
interesting discrepancies, including a broader range of N(HI), likely
underestimated I_CO, and a large scatter of I_CO at small Av. These

however, the orbital and physical data we possess are not enough, and they need
to be complemented with information on the composition of the exoplanets.
Ground-based and space-based observations provided the first data on the
atmospheric composition of a few extrasolar planets, but a larger and more
detailed sample is required before we can fully take advantage of it. The
primary goal of the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO) is to fill
this gap, expanding the limited data we possess by performing a systematic
survey of hundreds of extrasolar planets. The full exploitation of the data
that EChO and other space-based and ground-based facilities will provide in the

of the past history of the Solar System provides several indications on the
effects of processes like migration, late accretion and secular impacts, and on
the time they occur in the life of planetary systems. In this work we will
review what is already known about the factors influencing the composition of

disk under an equivalence relation that, loosely speaking, ""pinches"" the disk

in particular in the fact that this quotient is planar and therefore can be
easily visualized. The conjecture that the Mandelbrot set is actually
homeomorphic to this model is equivalent to the celebrated MLC conjecture
stating that the Mandelbrot set is locally connected.
  For parameter spaces of higher degree polynomials no combinatorial model is
known. One possible reason may be that the higher degree analog of the MLC
conjecture is known to be false. We investigate to which extent a geodesic
lamination is determined by the location of its critical sets and when
different choices of critical sets lead to essentially the same lamination.

classical simulation. Focusing on two qubit states, we show that exceptionality
is more stringent than violation of Bell inequality, and involves an intricate
interplay of coherence and entanglement. The new criterion is shown to provide
a natural description of entangled states which respect Bell inequality, and
also a way of enumerating the classical resources that are required to simulate

(Holevo) capacity of classical communication over a lossy and noisy optical
channel, but requires a receiver that jointly detects long modulated codewords
with highly nonlinear quantum operations, which are near-impossible to realize
using current technology. We analyze the capacity of the lossy-noisy optical
channel when the transmitter uses coherent state modulation but the receiver is
restricted to a general quantum-limited Gaussian receiver, i.e., one that may
involve arbitrary combinations of Gaussian operations (passive linear optics:
beamsplitters and phase-shifters, second order nonlinear optics (or active
linear optics): squeezers, along with homodyne or heterodyne detection
measurements) and any amount of classical feedforward within the receiver.
Under these assumptions, we show that the Gaussian receiver that attains the
maximum mutual information is either homodyne detection, heterodyne detection,
or time sharing between the two, depending upon the received power level. In
other words, our result shows that to exceed the theoretical limit of
conventional coherent optical communications, one has to incorporate
non-Gaussian, i.e., third or higher-order nonlinear operations in the receiver.
Finally we compare our Gaussian receiver limit with experimentally feasible
non-Gaussian receivers and show that in the regime of low received photon flux,
it is possible to overcome the Gaussian receiver limit by relatively simple
non-Gaussian receivers based on photon counting.

able to observe SN 2012ht at very early phase, when it was still rising and was
about three magnitudes fainter than at the peak. The rise time to the $B$-band

MJD $56277.98 \pm 0.13$. SN 2012ht is the first transitional SN Ia whose rise

Ia overall. This rise time is consistent with those of the other four SNe

function, and shows no sign of a shock-heating component due to the interaction

Therefore some intelligence-based search algorithms have to be used to generate

algorithm to generate test data based on the set of basis paths. This paper
combines the characteristics of genetic algorithm with test data, making use of

in harmonic analysis, PDE's and quasiconformal mappings. In 1974 Coifman and
Fefferman showed that a weight belongs to a Muckenhoupt class $A_p$ for some
$1<p<\infty$ if and only if it belongs to a Reverse H\""{o}lder class $RH_q$ for

given a dyadically doubling weight in $RH_p^d$ on a given dyadic interval $I$,
we find an upper estimate on the average of the function $w^{q}$ over the
interval $I$. From the bound on this average we can conclude, for example, that
$w$ belongs to the corresponding $A_{s_1}^d$ class or that $w^p$ is in
$A_{s_2}^d$ for some values of $s_i$. We obtain our results using the method of

encoded at multiple levels of constant bitrate representations, and a client
makes its representation selections according to the measured network
bandwidth. While greatly simplifying adaptation to the varying network
conditions, this strategy is not the best for optimizing the video quality
experienced by end users. Quality fluctuation can be reduced if the natural
variability of video content is taken into consideration. In this work, we
study the design of a client rate adaptation algorithm to yield consistent
video quality. We assume that clients have visibility into incoming video
within a finite horizon. We also take advantage of the client-side video
buffer, by using it as a breathing room for not only network bandwidth
variability, but also video bitrate variability. The challenge, however, lies
in how to balance these two variabilities to yield consistent video quality
without risking a buffer underrun. We propose an optimization solution that
uses an online algorithm to adapt the video bitrate step-by-step, while
applying dynamic programming at each step. We incorporate our solution into
PANDA -- a practical rate adaptation algorithm designed for HAS deployment at

associations, at arcsecond precision, of the class I maser emission with
outflows, expanding HII regions, dark clouds, shocks traced by the 4.5-micron
emission and 8.0-micron filaments. More than 700 maser component features were

recognisable at both transitions; the morphology of class I emission is much
better revealed by our survey of both transitions, compared with either one

projected linear distance from the associated class II 6.7-GHz methanol maser.
This distribution has a scale of 263+/-15 mpc, irrespective of the transition.
The class I masers associated with OH masers were found to have a tendency to
be more spread out, both spatially and in the velocity domain. This is
consistent with the expectation that such sources are more evolved. Apart from
a small number of high-velocity components (which are largely blue-shifted and
predominantly seen at 36 GHz), the velocity distribution was found to be
Gaussian, peaking near the systemic velocity of the region, which had been
estimated as the middle of the velocity interval of the associated class II
methanol maser at 6.7 GHz. The mean indicated a small, but significant blue
shift asymmetry of -0.57 km/s (uncertainties are 0.06 and 0.07 km/s for the 36-

this work to solve a two-dimensional (2D) heat equation with interfaces. The
ADI scheme is a powerful finite difference method for solving parabolic
equations, due to its unconditional stability and high efficiency. However, it
suffers from a serious accuracy reduction in space for interface problems with
different materials and nonsmooth solutions. If the jumps in a function and its
derivatives are known across the interface, rigorous ADI schemes have been
successfully constructed in the literature based on the immersed interface
method (IIM) so that the spatial accuracy can be restored. Nevertheless, the
development of accurate and stable ADI methods for general parabolic interface
problems with physical interface conditions that describe jumps of a function
and its flux, remains unsolved. To overcome this difficulty, a novel tensor
product decomposition is proposed in this paper to decouple 2D jump conditions
into essentially one-dimensional (1D) ones. These 1D conditions can then be
incorporated into the ADI central difference discretization, using the matched
interface and boundary (MIB) technique. Fast algebraic solvers for perturbed
tridiagonal systems are developed to maintain the computational efficiency.
Stability analysis is conducted through eigenvalue spectrum analysis, which
numerically demonstrates the unconditional stability of the proposed ADI
method. The matched ADI scheme achieves the first order of accuracy in time and
second order of accuracy in space in all tested parabolic interface problems
with complex geometries and spatial-temporal dependent jump conditions.

association study (GWAS) databases has been a major concern of researchers
following the publication of ""an attack"" on GWAS data by Homer et al. (2008)
Traditional statistical methods for confidentiality and privacy protection of
statistical databases do not scale well to deal with GWAS data, especially in
terms of guarantees regarding protection from linkage to external information.
The more recent concept of differential privacy, introduced by the
cryptographic community, is an approach that provides a rigorous definition of
privacy with meaningful privacy guarantees in the presence of arbitrary
external information, although the guarantees may come at a serious price in
terms of data utility. Building on such notions, Uhler et al. (2013) proposed
new methods to release aggregate GWAS data without compromising an individual's
privacy. We extend the methods developed in Uhler et al. (2013) for releasing
differentially-private $\chi^2$-statistics by allowing for arbitrary number of
cases and controls, and for releasing differentially-private allelic test
statistics. We also provide a new interpretation by assuming the controls' data
are known, which is a realistic assumption because some GWAS use publicly
available data as controls. We assess the performance of the proposed methods
through a risk-utility analysis on a real data set consisting of DNA samples
collected by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and compare the methods
with the differentially-private release mechanism proposed by Johnson and
Shmatikov (2013).

specification of a software system from the requirements written in natural
language. Its graphical specification language, Behavior Tree (BT), has been
used with success in industry to systematically translate large, complex, and
often erroneous requirements into an integrated model of the software system.
BE's process, the Behavior Modeling Process (BMP), allows requirements to be
translated into individual requirement BTs one at a time, which are then
integrated to form a holistic view of the system. The integrated BT then goes
through a series of modifications to construct a specification BT, which is
used for validation and verification. The BMP also addresses different types of
defects in the requirements throughout its process. However, BT itself is a
graphical modeling notation, and the types of integration relations, how they
correspond to particular issues, how they should be integrated and how to get
formal specification have not been clearly defined. As a result, the BMP is
informal, and provides guidelines to perform all these tasks on an ad-hoc
basis. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical framework which defines
the graphical form of BTs which we use to define the integration relationships
of BTs and to formalize the integration strategy of the BMP. We then formulate
semi-automated requirements defects detection techniques by utilizing this
underlying mathematical framework, which may be extended to formalize the BMP,
develop change management framework for it, build techniques for round-trip

We
find that when a plane wave of a Dirac fermion is reflected at an edge of

the change of the pseudospin of the Dirac fermion in the reflection. The
geometric phase is the Pancharatnam-Berry phase that equals the half of the

incident wave and also by the orientation angle of the graphene edge. The
geometric phase is finite at zigzag edge in general, while it always vanishes
at armchair edge because of intervalley mixing. To demonstrate its physical
effects, we first connect the geometric phase with the energy band structure of
graphene nanoribbon with zigzag edge. The magnitude of the band gap of the
nanoribbon, that opens in the presence of the staggered sublattice potential
induced by edge magnetization, is related to the geometric phase. Second, we

to develop several models of varying fidelity. Models of different fidelity
levels can enable mathematical analysis of the model, control synthesis, faster

from a model to its implementation on an actual computational platform, then
again two different versions of the same system are being developed. In all
previous cases, it is necessary to define a rigorous notion of conformance

paper argues that conformance should be a measure of distance between systems.
Albeit a range of theoretical distance notions exists, a way to compute such
distances for industrial size systems and models has not been proposed yet.
This paper addresses exactly this problem. A universal notion of conformance as
closeness between systems is rigorously defined, and evidence is presented that
this implies a number of other application-dependent conformance notions. An
algorithm for detecting that two systems are not conformant is then proposed,
which uses existing proven tools. A method is also proposed to measure the
degree of conformance between two systems. The results are demonstrated on a

potential consists of two or more sinusoidal potentials that are comparable in

The model is versatile enough to realize both large-field and small-field
inflation. We show that, in a model with two sinusoidal potentials, the
predicted values of the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio lie within
the $1\sigma$ region of the Planck data. In particular, there is no lower bound
on the decay constants in contrast to the original natural inflation. We also
show that, in a certain limit, multi-natural inflation can be approximated by a

by the coadjoint orbit method on the anisotropic and absolute time kinematical
groups. We show that noncommutative symplectic structures can be generated in
the framework of centrally extended anisotropic kinematical groups as well as
in the framework of noncentrally abelian extended absolute time kinematical
groups. However, noncommutative phase spaces realized with noncentral abelian
extensions of the kinematical groups are algebraically more general than those
constructed on their central extensions. As the coadjoint orbit construction
has not been carried through some of these planar kinematical groups before,
physical interpretations of new generators of those extended structures are
given. Furthermore, in all the cases discussed here, the noncommutativity is
measured by naturally introduced fields, each corresponding to a minimal
coupling. This approach allows to not only construct directly a dynamical
system when of course the symmetry group is known but also permits to eliminate
the non minimal couplings in that system. Hence, we show also that the planar
noncommutative phase spaces arise naturally by introducing minimal coupling. We
introduce here new kinds of couplings. A coupling of position with a dual
potential and a mixing model (that is minimal coupling of the momentum with a
magnetic potential and of position with a dual potential). Finally we show that
this group theoretical discussion can be recovered by a linear deformation of
the Poisson bracket. The reason why linear deformation of Poisson bracket is
required here is that the noncommutative parameters (which are fields) are
constant (they are coming from central and noncentral abelian extensions of
kinematical groups).

turbines. Megawatt class wind turbines generally turn at variable speed in wind
farm. Thus turbine operation must be controlled in order to maximize the
conversion efficiency below rated power and reduce loading on the drive-train.
Due to random and non-linear nature of the wind turbulence and the ability of
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) in the modeling and control of this turbulence, in this study,
widespread changes of wind have been perused using MLP and RBF artificial NNs.
In addition in this study, a new genetic fuzzy system has been successfully
applied to identify disturbance wind in turbine input. Thus output power has
been regulated in optimal and nominal range by pitch angle regulation.
Consequently, our proposed approaches have regulated output aerodynamic power

difference between high-loaded static post-eccentric and post-concentric force
production of 9-12% of the total output force. This difference can be directly
attributed to tendon-pulley friction. Exploiting this phenomenon for robotic
and prosthetic applications we can achieve a reduction of actuator size, weight

bio-inspired friction switch. The adaptive pulley is designed to minimize the
influence of frictional forces under low and medium-loading conditions and
maximize it under high-loading conditions. This is achieved with a

K. The observed magnetic properties are well described by a model of isolated
antiferromagnetic spin dimers. Possible ferromagnetic interactions between the

calculations have been employed to locate the magnetic dimers in the crystal

that magnetic and structural dimers are the same. For the intradimer coupling,
however, the computational results confirmed a coupling strength close to zero

AGN by using HST/STIS spectra. We consider a sample of 24 nearby galaxies in
which the presence of a BLR has been reported from their Palomar ground-based
spectra. Following a widely used strategy, we used the [SII] doublet to
subtract the contribution of the narrow emission lines to the H-alpha+[NII]
complex and to isolate the BLR emission. Significant residuals that suggest a
BLR, are present. However, the results change substantially when the [OI]
doublet is used. Furthermore, the spectra are also reproduced well by just
including a wing in the narrow H-alpha and [NII] lines, thus not requiring the
presence of a BLR. We conclude that complex structure of the narrow line region
(NLR) is not captured with this approach and that it does not lead to general
robust constraints on the properties of the BLR in these low luminosity AGN.
Nonetheless, the existence of a BLR is firmly established in 5 Seyferts, and 5
LINERs. However, the measured BLR fluxes and widths in the 5 LINERs differ
substantially with respect to the ground-based data. The BLR sizes in LINERs,
which are estimated by using the virial formula from the line widths and the
black hole mass, are about 1 order of magnitude greater than the extrapolation
to low luminosities of the relation between the BLR radius and AGN luminosity
observed in more powerful active nuclei. We ascribe the larger BLR radius to
the lower accretion rate in LINERs when compared to the Seyfert, which causes
the formation of an inner region dominated by an advection-dominated accretion
flow (ADAF). The estimated BLR sizes in LINERs are comparable to the radius
where the transition between the ADAF and the standard thin disk occurs due to
disk evaporation.

including the recent burst in genome scans for selection and statistical
inference of past demographic events in many prokaryote, animal and plant

adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random
processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide
variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the
Kingman coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However,
these theoretical models rely on biological and life-history assumptions which
may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent
theoretical developments of the so called multiple merger coalescent models are
reviewed here ({\Lambda}-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Snitzman,
{\Xi}-coalescent). We explicit how these new models take into account various
pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or
life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as 1) the skew
in offspring production typical of marine species, 2) fast adapting
microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in
population sizes during epidemics, 3) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and
bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles, and 4) the high rates of
extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations. We finally
discuss the relevance of multiple merger models for the detection of SNPs under
selection in these species, for population genomics of very large sample size

the data are neither consistent with a smooth distribution of different field
strengths, nor with one average field strength covering the full star. We find
evidence of a subtle difference in the field distribution of GJ 285 compared to
the other three targets. GJ 285 also has the highest average field of 3.5kG and
the strongest maximum field component of 7-7.5kG. The maximum local field
strengths in our sample seem to be correlated with rotation rate. While the
average field strength is saturated, the maximum local field strengths in our

distributions of partially and fully convective stars. The one star with
evidence for a field distribution different to the other three is the most
active star (i.e. with largest x-ray luminosity and mean surface magnetic

completed by us. Consequently, we introduce a convenient gauge fixing and adopt
reduced canonical variables adapted to that hybrid quantum description.
Besides, we keep backreaction contributions on the background coming from terms
quadratic in the perturbations in the action of the system. We carry out a
numerical analysis assuming that the inhomogeneities were in a massless vacuum
state at distant past (where the initial data are set). At distant future, we
observe a statistical amplification of the modes amplitude in the infrared

phenomena. A description of the perturbations in terms of the Mukhanov-Sasaki
gauge invariants provides the same qualitative results. Finally, we analyze
some consequences of the backreaction in our effective description.

experimentally the formation of a glass. Physically, it quantifies the
multiplicity of metastable states in which an amorphous material can be found
at a given temperature, and its temperature dependence provides a major
thermodynamic signature of the glass transition, which is experimentally
accessible. Measurements of the configurational entropy require, however, some
approximations which have often led to ambiguities and contradictory results.
Here we implement a novel numerical scheme to measure the configurational
entropy Sigma(T) in supercooled liquids, using a direct determination of the
free energy cost to localize the system within a single metastable state at
temperature T. For two prototypical glass-forming liquids, we find that
Sigma(T) disappears discontinuously above a temperature T_c, which is slightly
lower than the usual estimate of the onset temperature for glassy dynamics.
This observation is in good agreement with theoretical expectations, but
contrasts sharply with alternative numerical methods. While the temperature
dependence of Sigma(T) correlates with the glass fragility, we show that the
validity of the Adam-Gibbs relation (relating configurational entropy to
structural relaxation time) established in earlier numerical studies is smaller
than previously thought, potentially resolving an important conflict between
experiments and simulations.

these processes with a new nonlinear phenomenon---an intricate threshold where
a forced system fails to adiabatically follow a changing stable state. In
systems with multiple time-scales such thresholds are generic, but non-obvious,
meaning they cannot be captured by traditional stability theory. Rather, the
phenomenon can be analysed using concepts from modern singular perturbation
theory: folded singularities and canard trajectories, including composite
canards. Thus, non-obvious thresholds should explain the failure to adapt to a
changing environment in a wide range of multi-scale systems including: tipping
points in the climate system, regime shifts in ecosystems, excitability in
nerve cells, adaptation failure in regulatory genes, and adiabatic switching in
technology.

microkinetic modeling in heterogeneous catalysis and other materials
applications. Systems, where site-specificity of all elementary reactions
allows a mapping onto a lattice of discrete active sites, can be addressed
within the particularly efficient lattice kMC approach. To this end we describe
the versatile kmos software package, which offers a most user-friendly
implementation, execution, and evaluation of lattice kMC models of arbitrary
complexity in one- to three-dimensional lattice systems, involving multiple
active sites in periodic or aperiodic arrangements, as well as site-resolved
pairwise and higher-order lateral interactions. Conceptually, kmos achieves a
maximum runtime performance which is essentially independent of lattice size by
generating code for the efficiency-determining local update of available events
that is optimized for a defined kMC model. For this model definition and the
control of all runtime and evaluation aspects kmos offers a high-level
application programming interface. Usage proceeds interactively, via scripts,
or a graphical user interface, which visualizes the model geometry, the lattice
occupations and rates of selected elementary reactions, while allowing
on-the-fly changes of simulation parameters. We demonstrate the performance and
scaling of kmos with the application to kMC models for surface catalytic
processes, where for given operation conditions (temperature and partial
pressures of all reactants) central simulation outcomes are catalytic activity
and selectivities, surface composition, and mechanistic insight into the
occurrence of individual elementary processes in the reaction network.

high-redshift building blocks of more massive galaxies according to the current
paradigm of the hierarchical galaxy formation. They are low-mass objects, and
therefore their rotation speed is very low. Several galaxies are observed to
show quite strong magnetic fields. These cases of strong ordered magnetic
fields seem to correlate with a high, but not extremely high, star formation
rate. We investigate whether these magnetic fields could be generated by the
cosmic-ray-driven dynamo. The environment of a dwarf galaxy is unfavourable for
the large-scale dynamo action because of the very slow rotation that is
required to create the regular component of the magnetic field. We built a 3D
global model of a dwarf galaxy that consists of two gravitational components:
the stars and the dark-matter halo described by the purely phenomenological
profile proposed previously. We solved a system of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
equations that include an additional cosmic-ray component described by the
fluid approximation. We found that the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo can amplify the
magnetic field with an exponential growth rate. The $e$-folding time is
correlated with the initial rotation speed. The final mean value of the
azimuthal flux for our models is of the order of few $\mu$G and the system
reaches its equipartition level. The results indicate that the
cosmic-ray-driven dynamo is a process that can explain the magnetic fields in
dwarf galaxies.

adherence to coding standards especially by managing identifier naming, is
attracting a pressing concern from both computer science educators and software
managers. Software developers mainly use identifier names to represent the
knowledge recorded in source code. However, the popularity and adoption
consistency of identifier naming conventions have not been revealed yet in this
field. Taking forty-eight popular open source projects written in three
top-ranking programming languages Java, C and C++ as examples, an identifier
extraction tool based on regular expression matching is developed. In the
subsequent investigation, some interesting findings are obtained. For the
identifier naming popularity, it is found that Camel and Pascal naming
conventions are leading the road while Hungarian notation is vanishing. For the
identifier naming consistency, we have found that the projects written in Java
have a much better performance than those written in C and C++. Finally,
academia and software industry are urged to adopt the most popular naming
conventions consistently in their practices so as to lead the identifier naming
to a standard, unified and high-quality road.

arbitrary quivers, possibly carrying loops. We answer a conjecture raised by
Lusztig asking if the more ""simple"" Lusztig perverse sheaves are enough to span
the whole Grothendieck group usually built with these sheaves. Our proof is
based on induction, with the help of restriction and induction functors, but
with non trivial first steps, consisting in the study of quivers with one
vertex but possible loops. We also need to consider regularity conditions on
the support of our perverse sheaves to perform efficient restrictions at
imaginary vertices. From our proof emerges a new combinatorial structure on our
generalized canonical basis, which is more general than the usual crystals, in
that there are now more operators associated to a vertex with loops. In a
second part, we construct and study a Hopf algebra which generalizes the usual
quantum groups. The geometric study previously made leads to a natural
definition, which includes countably infinite sets of generators at imaginary
roots, with higher order Serre relations and commutativity conditions imposed
by the Jordan quiver case. We finally prove that the positive part of this
algebra is isomorphic to our Grothendieck group, thanks to the study of a
nondegenerate Hopf pairing.

error probability of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes over additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channels. To resolve the difficulty caused by the dependence of the
Euclidean distance spectrum on the way of signal mapping, we propose to use
random mapping, resulting in an ensemble of RS-coded modulation (RS-CM)
systems. For this ensemble of RS-CM systems, analytic bounds are derived, which
can be evaluated from the known (symbol-level) Hamming distance spectrum. Also
presented in this paper are simulation-based bounds, which are applicable to
any specific RS-CM system and can be evaluated by the aid of a list decoding
(in the Euclidean space) algorithm. The simulation-based bounds do not need
distance spectrum and are numerically tight for short RS codes in the regime
where the word error rate (WER) is not too low. Numerical comparison results
are relevant in at least three aspects. First, in the short code length regime,
RS-CM using BPSK modulation with random mapping has a better performance than
binary random linear codes. Second, RS-CM with random mapping (time varying)
can have a better performance than with specific mapping. Third, numerical
results show that the recently proposed Chase-type decoding algorithm is
essentially the ML decoding algorithm for short RS codes.

Gaussian operator to reduce the impact of differences in illumination and then
computes the DCP feature at both the holistic and component levels. DCP is a
novel face image descriptor inspired by the unique textural structure of human
faces. It is computationally efficient and only doubles the cost of computing
local binary patterns, yet is extremely robust to pose and expression
variations. MDML-DCPs comprehensively yet efficiently encodes the invariant
characteristics of a face image from multiple levels into patterns that are
highly discriminative of inter-personal differences but robust to
intra-personal variations. Experimental results on the FERET, CAS-PERL-R1, FRGC
2.0, and LFW databases indicate that DCP outperforms the state-of-the-art local
descriptors (e.g. LBP, LTP, LPQ, POEM, tLBP, and LGXP) for both face

performance is achieved on the challenging LFW and FRGC 2.0 databases by
deploying MDML-DCPs in a simple recognition scheme.

factor of two with the dynamical age of the expanding X-ray emitting shells.
The spectral age varies only little across the lobes, requiring an effective
mixing process of the CRe such as a convective backflow of magnetized plasma.
The jet termination points have a slightly younger CRe spectral age, hinting at
in-situ CRe re-acceleration. Our findings support the scenario where the

planets as determined by the two parameters polar obliquity and orbital
eccentricity using a general circulation model of intermediate complexity. In
the first part of the paper we examine the consequences of different values of
obliquity and eccentricity for the spatio-temporal patterns of radiation and
surface temperatures as well as for the main characteristics of the atmospheric
circulations. In the second part we analyse the associated implications for the
habitability of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone (HZ).
This part of the paper focuses in particular on the multistability property of
climate, i.e. the parallel existence of both an ice-free and an ice-covered
climate state. Our results show that seasonal variability affects both the
existence of and transitions between the two climate states. Moreover, our
experiments reveal that planets with Earth-like atmospheres and high seasonal
variability can have ice-free areas at much larger distance from the host star
than planets without seasonal variability, which leads to a substantial
expansion of the outer edge of the HZ. Sensitivity experiments exploring the
role of azimuthal obliquity and surface heat capacity test the robustness of
our results. On circular orbits, our findings obtained with a general
circulation model agree well with previous studies based on one dimensional
energy balance models, whereas significant differences are found on eccentric
orbits.

previous results about the distribution of baryons, we also find that the main

rotational-model Schrodinger equation into a form suitable for describing
oscillations-coupled-to-intrinsic motion in spherical nuclei. The resulting
equation is decomposed into two coupled cranking-type equations, one for the
oscillation and another for the intrinsic motion, using a product wavefunction
and a constrained variational method. The energy and cranking parameters in the
coupled equations are self-consistently determined as functions of the system
parameters by the solutions of the equations themselves. This self-consistency
makes the two equations time-reversal invariant, unlike the conventional
phenomenological cranking models. The self-consistency and time-reversal
invariance accept only real solutions to the equations. For the harmonic
oscillator mean-field potential, we explicitly determine these solutions and
the corresponding eigenvalues, and derive the set of equations that determine
self-consistently the parameters. To explore the relative importance of the
various model features and approximations, we perform a preliminary scoping
calculation of the excitation energy of the first excited states in the light
nuclei using a sum rule to determine the oscillation frequency. The preliminary
results indicate that, except in the lightest nuclei, the excitation energies
are significantly overpredicted in the light nuclei due to the neglect, among
other factors, of the deformation degree of freedom. The model derivation
presented here serves as guide for eventually developing a corresponding model
for the vibrational-rotational motion in deformed nuclei.

the alternative concept of {\em domain views} which only delegate domain

to produce a hybrid model capable of handling mixed data types. Further, a
mixture of the hybrid models is considered to provide clustering capabilities
within the context of mixed binary, ordinal and nominal response data. The
proposed model is termed a mixture of factor analyzers for mixed data (MFA-MD).
The MFA-MD model is applied to the survey data to cluster the Agincourt

hy- drodynamics, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, Bose-Einstein
condensates,...) and a mathematically very challenging class of partial
differential equations, especially in the time dependent case. An important
point with respect to applications is the stability of exact solutions like
solitons. Whereas the linear or spectral stability can be addressed
analytically in some situations, the proof of full nonlinear (in-)stability
remains mostly an open question. In this paper, we numerically investi- gate
the transverse (in-)stability of the solitonic solution to the one-dimensional
cubic NLS equation, the well known isolated soliton, under the time evolution
of several higher dimensional models, being admissible as a tranverse
perturbation of the 1d cubic NLS. One of the recent work in this context [42]
allowed to prove the instability of the soliton, under the flow of the
classical (elliptic) 2d cubic NLS equation, for both localized or periodic
perturbations. The characteristics of this instability stay however unknown. Is
there a blow-up, dispersion..? We first illustrate how this instability occurs
for the elliptic 2d cubic NLS equation and then show that the elliptic-elliptic
Davey Stewartson system (a (2+1)-dimensional generalization of the cubic NLS
equation) behaves as the former in this context. Then we investigate hyperbolic
variants of the above models, for which no theory in this context is available.
Namely we consider the hyperbolic 2d cubic NLS equation and the
Davey-Stewartson II equations. For localized perturbations, the isolated
soliton appears to be unstable for the former case, but seems to be orbitally
stable for the latter. For periodic perturbations the soliton is found to be
unstable for all transversally perturbed models considered.

velocities for 15 stars, with r.m.s. precision down to 2.5 m/s over a week long
time scale are achieved using Thorium-Argon reference spectra. We are sensitive
to planets with m_psin(i) >= 1.5 MEarth (3 MEarth at 2-sigma) in the classical

  Since the mean rotation velocity is of order 8 km/s for an M6V star and 15
km/s by M9V, we avoid observing only slow rotators that would introduce a bias
towards low axial inclination i << 90 deg systems, which are unfavourable for
planet detection. Our targets with the highest vsini values exhibit radial
velocities significantly above the photon-noise limited precision, even after
accounting for vsini. We therefore monitored stellar activity via chromospheric
emission from the Halpha and Ca II infrared triplet lines. A clear trend of
log_10(Halpha/Lbol) with radial velocity r.m.s. is seen, implying that
significant starspot activity is responsible for the observed radial velocity
precision floor. The implication that most late M dwarfs are significantly
spotted, and hence exhibit time varying line distortions, indicates that
observations to detect orbiting planets need strategies to reliably mitigate

arguments for the restricted class of programs called linear lasso programs. A
termination argument consists of a ranking function as well as a set of
supporting invariants.
  We extend existing methods in several ways. First, we use Motzkin's
Transposition Theorem instead of Farkas' Lemma. This allows us to consider
linear lasso programs that can additionally contain strict inequalities.
Existing methods are restricted to non-strict inequalities and equalities.
  Second, we consider several kinds of ranking functions: affine-linear,
piecewise and lexicographic ranking functions. Moreover, we present a novel
kind of ranking function called multiphase ranking function which proceeds
through a fixed number of phases such that for each phase, there is an
affine-linear ranking function. As an abstraction to the synthesis of specific
ranking functions, we introduce the notion ranking function template. This
enables us to handle all ranking functions in a unified way.
  Our method relies on non-linear algebraic constraint solving as a subroutine
which is known to scale poorly to large problems. As a mitigation we formalize
an assessment of the difficulty of our constraints and present an argument why
they are of an easier kind than general non-linear constraints.
  We prove our method to be complete: if there is a termination argument of the
form specified by the given ranking function template with a fixed number of
affine-linear supporting invariants, then our method will find a termination
argument.
  To our knowledge, the approach we propose is the most powerful technique of
synthesis-based discovery of termination arguments for linear lasso programs
and encompasses and enhances several methods having been proposed thus far.

hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, together with confocal Raman
measurements and a targeted theoretical analysis, to identify the dominant
source of disorder in this system. Low-temperature transport measurements on
many devices reveal a clear correlation between the carrier mobility $\mu$ and
the width $n^*$ of the resistance peak around charge neutrality, demonstrating
that charge scattering and density inhomogeneities originate from the same
microscopic mechanism. The study of weak-localization unambiguously shows that
this mechanism is associated to a long-ranged disorder potential, and provides
clear indications that random pseudo-magnetic fields due to strain are the
dominant scattering source. Spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements
confirm the role of local strain fluctuations, since the line-width of the
Raman 2D-peak --containing information of local strain fluctuations present in
graphene-- correlates with the value of maximum observed mobility. The
importance of strain is corroborated by a theoretical analysis of the relation
between $\mu$ and $n^*$ that shows how local strain fluctuations reproduce the
experimental data at a quantitative level, with $n^*$ being determined by the
scalar deformation potential and $\mu$ by the random pseudo-magnetic field
(consistently with the conclusion drawn from the analysis of
weak-localization). Throughout our study, we compare the behavior of devices on
hBN substrates to that of devices on SiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$, and find that all
conclusions drawn for the case of hBN are compatible with the observations made
on these other materials. These observations suggest that random strain
fluctuations are the dominant source of disorder for high-quality graphene on
many different substrates, and not only on hexagonal boron nitride.

(ATPM) to fit three published sets of mid-infrared observations of 1996 FG3
\citep{Wolters2011,Walsh2012}, so as to evaluate its surface properties.
Assuming the primary and the secondary bear identical shape, albedo, thermal
inertia and surface roughness, the best-fit parameters are obtained from the
observations. The geometric albedo and effective diameter of the asteroid are
reckoned to be $p_{\rm v}=0.045\pm0.002$, $D_{\rm eff}=1.69^{+0.05}_{-0.02}$

of $80\pm40\rm Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ with a roughness fraction $f_{\rm R}$ of
$0.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$. This indicates that the primary possibly has a regolith
layer on its surface, which is likely to be covered by a mixture of dust,
fragmentary rocky debris and sand. The minimum regolith depth is estimated to
be $5\sim20\rm mm$ from the simulations of subsurface temperature distribution,

equations arising in applied mathematics, we often need to study the solution
of system of partial differential equations satisfied by hypergeometric
functions and find explicit linearly independent solutions for the system. Here
we choose the Exton function $K_{2}$ among his 21 functions to show how to find
the linearly independent solutions of partial differential equations satisfied
by this function $K_{2}$. Based upon the classical derivative and integral
operators we introduce a new operational images for hypergeometric function
$K_{2}$. By means of these operational images a number of finite series and
decomposition formulas are then fund.

dealing with uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the concepts of soft

constructing a special soft topological space, show that some classical results
in general topology are not true about soft topological spaces, for instance

This protocol is based on Entanglement and Super-Dense coding. In this paper we
present some basic definitions of entanglement in quantum mechanics, present
how to use the maximally entangled states known as Bell States, and super dense
coding technique to achieve secure direct message communication. Finally, we
will apply some error models that could affect the transmission of the quantum
data on the quantum channels, and how to treat these errors and acquire a safe
transmission of the data.

proposed theoretical approach cannot fit planetary perihelion precession data.
As presented, the theory doesn't fit gravitational light deflection by the sun
either, but a straightforward theoretical change does remedy that; however a
proper fit to planetary perihelion precession data is not thus obtained. The
author's stated philosophical objections to the Einstein equation can be dealt
with in a markedly different way -- a new paper entitled ""Unique Einstein
Gravity from Feynman's Lorentz Condition"" has been submitted. Einstein's
equivalence principle implies that the acceleration of a particle in a
""specified"" gravitational field is independent of its mass. While this is
certainly true to great accuracy for bodies we observe in the Earth's
gravitational field, a hypothetical body of mass comparable to the Earth's
would perceptibly cause the Earth to fall toward it, which would feed back into
the strength as a function of time of the Earth's gravitational field affecting
that body. In short, Einstein's equivalence principle isn't exact, but is an
approximation that ignores recoil of the ""specified"" gravitational field, which
sheds light on why general relativity has no clearly delineated native
embodiment of conserved four-momentum. Einstein's 1905 relativity of course
doesn't have the inexactitudes he unwittingly built into GR, so it is natural
to explore a Lorentz-covariant gravitational theory patterned directly on
electromagnetism, wherein a system's zero-divergence overall stress-energy,
including all gravitational feedback contributions, is the source of its
gravitational tensor potential. Remarkably, that alone completely determines
Lorentz-covariant gravity's interaction with any conservative system of locally
interacting classical fields; no additional ""principles"" of any kind are
required. The highly intricate equation for the gravitational interaction
contribution to such a system's Lagrangian density is only amenable to solution
by successively refined approximation, however.
