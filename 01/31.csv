estimating the entropy density, in which successive approximations builds on
step-wise extensions of blocks of symbols, we show that one can take larger
steps when collecting the statistics necessary to calculate the entropy density
of the system. In one dimension this means that, instead of a single sweep over
the system in which states are read sequentially, one take several sweeps with
larger steps so that eventually the whole lattice is covered. This means that
the information in correlations is captured in a different way, and in some
situations this will lead to a considerably much faster convergence of the
entropy density estimate as a function of the size of the configurations used
in the estimate. The formalism is exemplified with both an example of a free
energy minimisation scheme for the two-dimensional Ising model, and an example
of increasingly complex spatial correlations generated by the time evolution of
elementary cellular automaton rule 60.

effect displayed by commodity futures contracts, we add expiry-dependent
exponential damping factors to their volatility coefficients. The pricing of
single underlying European options on futures contracts is straightforward and
can incorporate the volatility smile or skew observed in the market. We
calculate the joint characteristic function of two futures contracts in the
model in analytic form and use the one-dimensional Fourier inversion method of
Caldana and Fusai (JBF 2013) to price calendar spread options. The model leads
to stochastic correlation between the returns of two futures contracts. We
illustrate the distribution of this correlation in an example. We then propose
analytical expressions to obtain the copula and copula density directly from
the joint characteristic function of a pair of futures. These expressions are
convenient to analyze the term-structure of dependence between the two futures
produced by the model. In an empirical application we calibrate the proposed
model to volatility surfaces of vanilla options on WTI. In this application we
provide evidence that the model is able to produce the desired stylized facts

the propagation of gravitational waves and their detection in pulsar timing
arrays (PTA). If $\Lambda\neq 0$ it turns out that waves are anharmonic in
cosmological Friedmann-Robertson- Walker coordinates and although the amount of
anharmonicity is very small it leads to potentially measurable effects. The
timing residuals induced by gravitational waves in PTA would show a peculiar
angular dependence with a marked enhancement around a particular value of the
angle subtended by the source and the pulsars. This angle depends mainly on the
actual value of the cosmological constant and the distance to the source.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the enhancement can be rather notorious for
supermassive black hole mergers and in fact it could facilitate the first
direct detection of gravitational waves while at the same time representing a
`local' measurement of $\Lambda$.

more challenging. However, the next frontier of even earlier galaxy formation
(t~200 Myr) is emerging as a promising observational target. This is made
possible by a recently noticed effect of a significant relative velocity
between the baryons and dark matter at early times. The velocity difference
significantly suppresses star formation. The spatial variation of this
suppression enhances large-scale clustering and produces a prominent cosmic web
on 100 comoving Mpc scales in the 21-cm intensity distribution. This structure
makes it much more feasible for radio astronomers to detect these early stars,

Universe models and has been probed by the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies. In this paper, we examine tensor-mode CMB fluctuations generated
from anisotropic gravitational waves, parametrised by $P_h({\bf k}) =
P_h^{(0)}(k) [ 1 + \sum_{LM} f_L(k) g_{LM} Y_{LM} (\hat{\bf k}) ]$, where
$P_h^{(0)}(k)$ is the usual scale-invariant power spectrum. Such anisotropic
tensor fluctuations may arise from an inflationary model with noncommutativity
of fields. It is verified that in this model, an isotropic component and a
quadrupole asymmetry with $f_0(k) = f_2(k) \propto k^{-2}$ are created and
hence highly red-tilted off-diagonal components arise in the CMB power spectra,
namely $\ell_2 = \ell_1 \pm 2$ in $TT$, $TE$, $EE$ and $BB$, and $\ell_2 =
\ell_1 \pm 1$ in $TB$ and $EB$. We find that B-mode polarisation is more
sensitive to such signals than temperature and E-mode polarisation due to the
smallness of large-scale cosmic variance and we can potentially measure $g_{00}
= 30$ and $g_{2M} = 58$ at 68% CL in a cosmic-variance-limited experiment. Such
a level of signal may be measured in a PRISM like experiment, while the
instrumental noise contaminates it in the $Planck$ experiment. These results
imply that it is impossible to measure the noncommutative parameter if it is
small enough for the perturbative treatment to be valid. Our formalism and
methodology for dealing with the CMB tensor statistical anisotropy are general
and straightforwardly applicable to other early Universe models.

with partially observed states. Belief filtering in DBNs is the task of
inferring the belief state (i.e. the probability distribution over process
states) based on incomplete and noisy observations. This can be a hard problem
in complex processes with large state spaces. In this article, we explore the
idea of accelerating the filtering task by automatically exploiting causality
in the process. We consider a specific type of causal relation, called
passivity, which pertains to how state variables cause changes in other
variables. We present the Passivity-based Selective Belief Filtering (PSBF)
method, which maintains a factored belief representation and exploits passivity
to perform selective updates over the belief factors. PSBF produces exact
belief states under certain assumptions and approximate belief states
otherwise, where the approximation error is bounded by the degree of
uncertainty in the process. We show empirically, in synthetic processes with
varying sizes and degrees of passivity, that PSBF is faster than several
alternative methods while achieving competitive accuracy. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how passivity occurs naturally in a complex system such as a
multi-robot warehouse, and how PSBF can exploit this to accelerate the
filtering task.

region where the Beii resonance doublet and the NH bands are located. We could
not detect the Beii lines and derive an upper limit of log (Be/H)< -12.2, that
is consistent with the Be observed in other stars of the cluster. We could
detect a weak G-band, which implies a mild carbon enhancement
[C/Fe]$+0.4\pm0.2$. We could not detect the UV NH band, and we derive an upper
limit [N/Fe]$< 0.0$. For oxygen we could notdetect any of the near UV OH lines,
which implies that oxygen cannot be strongly enhanced in this star. This is
consistent with the detection of the Oi triplet at 777nm, which is consistent
with [O/Fe]~0.5. Combining the UVES and Mike data, we could not detect any
variation in the radial velocity greater than 0.95 kms$^{-1}$ over 8 years. The
chemical composition of the star strongly resembles that of `first generation'
NGC6397 stars, with the huge Li as the only deviating abundance. Not detecting
Be rules out two possible explanations of the Li overabundance: capture of a
substellar body and spallation caused by a nearby type II SNe. Discrepancies
are also found with respect to other accretion scenarios,except for
contamination by the ejecta of a star that has undergone the RGB Li-flash.

new charged-current interactions that break lepton-flavor universality. These
decays have been studied only at e+e- colliders, where the low-background
environment and well-known initial state make it possible to observe small
signals with undetectable neutrinos. In particular, the large data samples of
the B factories and recent advances in techniques for full-event reconstruction
have led to evidence for the decay B --> tau nu and unambiguous observation of
the decays B --> D(*)tau nu. These results have led to exclusion of large
regions of the parameter space for a variety of new-physics models.
Furthermore, the branching fraction for B --> D(*)tau nu has been measured to
be higher than the standard-model expectation by at least 3.4 standard
deviations, making this an interesting topic for further research. This letter
reviews the theoterical and experimental status of this topic, summarizing the
results at this time and outlining the path for further improvements.

find a discrepancy between the model temperature and the measured colors of

the nearest known SN Ia since at least SN 1986G. Although SN 2014J was not
discovered until ~7 days after first light, both the Katzman Automatic Imaging
Telescope at Lick Observatory and K. Itagaki obtained several prediscovery
observations of SN 2014J. With these data, we are able to constrain the
object's time of first light to be Jan. 14.75 UT, only 0.82+/-0.21 d before our
first detection. Interestingly, we find that the light curve is well described
by a varying power law, much like SN 2013dy, which makes SN 2014J the second
example of a changing power law in early-time SN Ia light curves. A
low-resolution spectrum taken on Jan. 23.388 UT, ~8.70 after first light, shows
that SN 2014J is a heavily reddened but otherwise spectroscopically normal SN
Ia.

influence in a network. This work extends in a natural way the well-studied
model by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a
(small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this
influence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor
influence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes.
Despite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this
model limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to
apply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings
precisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very
relevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new
product by distributing five ""20% off"" coupons instead of giving away one free
product.
  While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than
integral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions
have essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two
versions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of
fractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main
theoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results
from the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch
(2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we
introduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain
matching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case.
In practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better
than the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network
data.

laboratory environment, but their presence has received little attention in the
context of high throughput sequencing. This issue is highlighted by recent
works that have rested controversial claims upon sequencing data that appear to
support the presence of unexpected exogenous species.
  Results: I used reads that preferentially aligned to alternate genomes to
infer the distribution of potential contaminant species in a set of independent
sequencing experiments. I confirmed that dilute samples are more exposed to
contaminating DNA, and, focusing on four single-cell sequencing experiments,
found that these contaminants appear to originate from a wide diversity of
clades. Although negative control libraries prepared from ""blank"" samples
recovered the highest-frequency contaminants, low-frequency contaminants, which
appeared to make heterogeneous contributions to samples prepared in parallel
within a single experiment, were not well controlled for. I used these results
to show that, despite heavy replication and plausible controls, contamination
can explain all of the observations used to support a recent claim that
complete genes pass from food to human blood.
  Conclusions: Contamination must be considered a potential source of signals
of exogenous species in sequencing data, even if these signals are replicated
in independent experiments, vary across conditions, or indicate a species which
seems a priori unlikely to contaminate. Negative control libraries processed in
parallel are essential to control for contaminant DNAs, but their limited
ability to recover low-frequency contaminants must be recognized.

was a multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that
surveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 HST orbits spread across 5
fields over 3 years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae
(SN) of all types, out to z~2.5. We classify ~24 of these as Type Ia SN (SN Ia)
based on host-galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism
spectroscopy of 6 SN). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia
rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 and
putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin
includes detections of SN that exploded when the universe was only ~3 Gyr old
and near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. This gives the CANDELS
high-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SN Ia that
explode promptly after formation (<500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with
all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this
prompt SN Ia fraction is fP=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),
consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} power
law for all times t>40 Myr. However, a mild tension is apparent between
ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and
the sister HST program CLASH, we find a low rate of SN Ia at z>1. This could be
a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only
~20% of all SN Ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples will
be needed to examine that suggestion.

the consideration of complex saddle points of the action or effective action.
The global symmetry $\mathcal{CK}$ of the finite-density action, where
$\mathcal{C}$ is charge conjugation and $\mathcal{K}$ is complex conjugation,
constrains the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop operator $P$ at a saddle point
in such a way that the action is real at a saddle point, and net color charge
is zero. The values of $Tr_{F}P$ and $Tr_{F}P^{\dagger}$ at the saddle point,
are real but not identical, indicating the different free energy cost
associated with inserting a heavy quark versus an antiquark into the system. At
such complex saddle points, the mass matrix associated with Polyakov loops may
have complex eigenvalues, reflecting oscillatory behavior in color-charge
densities. We illustrate these properties with a simple model which includes
the one-loop contribution of gluons and massless quarks moving in a constant
Polyakov loop background. Confinement-deconfinement effects are modeled
phenomenologically via an added potential term depending on the Polyakov loop
eigenvalues. For sufficiently large $T$ and $\mu$, the results obtained reduce
to those of perturbation theory at the complex saddle point. These results may
be experimentally relevant for the CBM experiment at FAIR.

Combining this finding with constraints on galaxies' dark matter halo potential
wells gives strong limits on the natal kick velocity distribution for sGRB
progenitors. For the best-fitting velocity distribution, one in five sGRB
progenitors receives a natal kick above 150 km/s, consistent with merging
neutron star models but not with merging white dwarf binary models. This
progenitor model constraint is robust to a wide variety of systematic
uncertainties, including the sGRB progenitor time-delay model, the Swift
redshift sensitivity, and the shape of the natal kick velocity distribution. We
also use constraints on the galaxy-halo connection to determine the host halo
and host galaxy demographics for sGRBs, which match extremely well with
available data. Most sGRBs are expected to occur in halos near 10^12 Msun and
in galaxies near 5x10^10 Msun (L_*); unobserved faint and high-redshift host
galaxies contribute a small minority of the observed hostless sGRB fraction. We
find that sGRB redshift distributions and host galaxy stellar masses weakly
constrain the progenitor time-delay model; the active vs. passive fraction of
sGRB host galaxies may offer a stronger constraint. Finally, we discuss how
searches for gravitational wave optical counterparts in the local Universe can
reduce followup times using these findings.

spontaneously breaks R-parity and is consistent with the bounds on proton
stability and lepton number violation. This minimal B-L MSSM can have a
colored/charged LSP, of which a stop LSP is the most amenable to observation at
the LHC. We study the R-parity violating decays of a stop LSP into a bottom
quark and charged leptons--the dominant modes for a generic ""admixture"" stop. A
numerical analysis of the relative branching ratios of these decay channels is
given using a wide scan over the parameter space. The fact that R-parity is
violated in this theory by a vacuum expectation value of a sneutrino links
these branching ratios directly to the neutrino mass hierarchy. It is shown how
a discovery of bottom-charged lepton events at the LHC can potentially
determine whether the neutrino masses are in a normal or inverted hierarchy, as
well as determining the theta_23 neutrino mixing angle. Finally, present LHC
bounds on these leptoquark signatures are used to put lower bounds on the stop
mass.

a lens and its shape. \Glass{} uses an under-constrained adaptive grid of mass
pixels to model the lens, searching through thousands of models to marginalise
over model uncertainties. Our key findings are as follows: (i) for pure lens
data, multiple sources with wide redshift separation give the strongest
constraints as this breaks the well-known mass-sheet or steepness degeneracy;
(ii) a single quad with time delays also performs well, giving a good recovery
of both the mass profile and its shape; (iii) stellar masses -- for lenses
where the stars dominate the central potential -- can also break the steepness
degeneracy, giving a recovery for doubles almost as good as having a quad with
time delay data, or multiple source redshifts; (iv) stellar kinematics provide
a robust measure of the mass at the half light radius of the stars $r_{1/2}$
that can also break the steepness degeneracy if the Einstein radius $r_E \neq
r_{1/2}$; and (v) if $r_E \sim r_{1/2}$, then stellar kinematic data can be
used to probe the stellar velocity anisotropy $\beta$ -- an interesting
quantity in its own right. Where information on the mass distribution from
lensing and/or other probes becomes redundant, this opens up the possibility of
using strong lensing to constrain cosmological models.

the earliest excursion set models of two decades ago. In particular, these
models assume that the random walks have uncorrelated steps and that haloes can
form at arbitrary locations in the initial density field. We extend these
calculations by incorporating recent technical developments that allow us to
(a) include the effect of correlations in the steps of the walks induced by a
realistic smoothing filter and (b) more importantly, account for the fact that
dark matter haloes preferentially form near peaks in the initial density. A
comparison with previous calculations shows that including these features,
particularly the peaks constraint on halo locations, has large effects on the
size distribution of the HII bubbles surrounding these haloes. For example,
when comparing models at the same value of the globally averaged ionized volume
fraction, the typical bubble sizes predicted by our model are more than a
factor 2 larger than earlier calculations. Our results can potentially have a
significant impact on estimates of the observable HI power spectrum.

the foundations of quantum theory. Is it an epistemic state (state of

theory, the epistemic view asserts that nonorthogonal quantum states correspond
to overlapping probability measures over the true ontic states. This naturally
accounts for a large number of otherwise puzzling quantum phenomena. For
example, the indistinguishability of nonorthogonal states is explained by the
fact that the ontic state sometimes lies in the overlap region, in which case
there is nothing in reality that could distinguish the two states. For this to
work, the amount of overlap of the probability measures should be comparable to
the indistinguishability of the quantum states. In this letter, I exhibit a
family of states for which the ratio of these two quantities must be $\leq
2de^{-cd}$ in Hilbert spaces of dimension $d$ that are divisible by $4$. This
implies that, for large Hilbert space dimension, the epistemic explanation of

a system interacting with an environment will evolve towards a local thermal
state. Here, we show that a more general and relevant question is ""when does a
system thermalize relative to a particular reference?"" By relative
thermalization we mean that, as well as being in a local thermal state, the
system is uncorrelated with the reference. We argue that this is necessary in
order to apply standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction
between a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition for
relative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an arbitrary
environment. This condition has two components: the first is state-independent,
reflecting the structure of invariant subspaces, like energy shells, and the
relative sizes of system and environment; the second depends on the initial
correlations between reference, system and environment, measured in terms of
conditional entropies. Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large
environment is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if,
initially, the reference was not highly correlated with the system and
environment. Our statement makes this intuition precise, and we show that in
many natural settings this thermalization condition is approximately tight.
Established results on thermalization, which usually ignore the reference,
follow as special cases of our statements.

Prandtl number, Pm, from 1 to 4 and the Mach number, M}, from 0.3 to 2.4. For
all subsonic flows, we find that the velocity power spectrum has a k^-5/3 slope
in the early, kinematic phase, but steepens due to magnetic back reactions as
the field saturates. The scalar power spectrum, on the other hand, flattens
compared to k^-5/3 at late times, consistent with the Obukohov-Corrsin picture
of mixing as a cascade process. At higher Mach numbers, the velocity power
spectrum also steepens due to the presence of shocks, and the scalar power
spectrum again flattens accordingly. Scalar structures are more intermittent
than velocity structures in subsonic turbulence while for supersonic
turbulence, velocity structures appear more intermittent than the scalars only
in the kinematic phase. Independent of the Mach number of the flow, scalar
structures are arranged in sheets in both the kinematic and saturated phases of
the magnetic field evolution. For subsonic turbulence, scalar dissipation is
hindered in the strong magnetic field regions, probably due to Lorentz forces
suppressing the buildup of scalar gradients, while for supersonic turbulence,
scalar dissipation increases monotonically with increasing magnetic field
strength. At all Mach numbers, mixing is significantly slowed by the presence
of dynamically-important small-scale magnetic fields, implying that mixing in
the interstellar medium and in galaxy clusters is less efficient than modeled

motion near the trapped positions. The investigation focuses on the long-time
correlated Brownian motion. The mobility tensor altered by the polymer
depletion effect is computed by the boundary integral method, and the
corresponding random displacement is determined by the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. From our computations it follows that the presence of depletion layers
around the hard spheres has a significant effect on the hydrodynamic

gas distribution in the hot Galactic halo. We first consider models in which
the halo density and temperature decrease exponentially with height above the
disk. These halo models were created to account for the fact that, on some
sight lines, the halo's X-ray emission lines and absorption lines yield
different temperatures, implying that the halo is non-isothermal. We show that
the hot gas in these exponential models is convectively unstable if
$\gamma<3/2$, where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the temperature and density scale
heights. Using published measurements of $\gamma$ and its uncertainty, we use
Bayes' Theorem to infer posterior probability distributions for $\gamma$, and
hence the probability that the halo is convectively unstable for different
sight lines. We find that, if these exponential models are good descriptions of
the hot halo gas, at least in the first few kiloparsecs from the plane, the hot
halo is reasonably likely to be convectively unstable on two of the three sight
lines for which scale height information is available. We also consider more
extended models of the halo. While isothermal halo models are convectively
stable if the density decreases with distance from the Galaxy, a model of an
extended adiabatic halo in hydrostatic equilibrium with the Galaxy's dark
matter is on the boundary between stability and instability. However, we find
that radiative cooling may perturb this model in the direction of convective
instability. If the Galactic halo is indeed convectively unstable, this would
argue in favor of supernova activity in the Galactic disk contributing to the
heating the hot halo gas.

shear flow. Particle aggregation is driven by a temperature-tunable attractive
potential which controls the growth of clusters under isothermal conditions. A
series of frequency resolved time sweeps is used to systematically reconstruct
the frequency dependent dynamic moduli as a function of time and temperature or
attraction strength. The data display typical hallmarks of gelation with an
abrupt transition from a fluid state into a dynamically arrested gel state
after a characteristic gelation time $t_g$ that varies exponentially with
temperature and serves to collapse the evolution of the system onto a universal
curve. We observe the viscoelastic properties of the critical gel where we find
that $G'(\omega)\approxeq G''(\omega)\sim \omega^{n_c}$ where $n_c=0.5$ in a
narrow time window across all attraction strengths. We measure a dynamic
critical exponent of $\kappa=0.25$ which is similar to that observed in
crosslinked polymer gels. The approach to the critical gel is therefore
governed by $\eta_0\sim-\epsilon^{-s}$ and $G_e\sim\epsilon^z$ with $s=z=2$
where $\epsilon=p/p_c-1$ is the distance to the gel point. Remarkably, the
relaxation moduli of the near-critical gels are identical across the
temperatures considered, with $G(t)\approx0.33t^{-0.5}$. This suggests an
underlying strong similarity in gel structure in the regime of attraction
strengths considered, despite the differences in aggregation kinetics. We
contrast these findings with the behavior of a colloidal glass undergoing
dynamical arrest where no critical state is observed and where the arrest time
of the system displays a marked frequency dependence. These findings highlight
the underlying structural differences between colloidal gels and glasses which
are manifest in their dynamic properties in the vicinity of the liquid-to-solid
transition.

fraction of the system ceases to function, and collapses. It has recently
become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where
nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity
of assets (loans), liabilities, and other obligations, such as derivatives. We
demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual
liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use
empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal
contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor
of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional
to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not
increase SR it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (CRISIS macro-financial
model) we demonstrate that the proposed ""Systemic Risk Tax"" (SRT) leads to a
self-organised restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of
SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising
from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement
with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit

mechanisms of the impulsive excitation and their relationship to the flare

investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed mechanism and prove that
it is truthful, i.e. the buyers do not have an incentive to lie about their

  (2015)","10.1137/140959602",,"cs.CE math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a model-reduction methodology that preserves Lagrangian
structure (equivalently Hamiltonian structure) and achieves computational
efficiency in the presence of high-order nonlinearities and arbitrary parameter
dependence. As such, the resulting reduced-order model retains key properties
such as energy conservation and symplectic time-evolution maps. We focus on
parameterized simple mechanical systems subjected to Rayleigh damping and
external forces, and consider an application to nonlinear structural dynamics.
To preserve structure, the method first approximates the system's `Lagrangian
ingredients'---the Riemannian metric, the potential-energy function, the
dissipation function, and the external force---and subsequently derives
reduced-order equations of motion by applying the (forced) Euler--Lagrange
equation with these quantities. From the algebraic perspective, key
contributions include two efficient techniques for approximating parameterized
reduced matrices while preserving symmetry and positive definiteness: matrix
gappy POD and reduced-basis sparsification (RBS). Results for a parameterized
truss-structure problem demonstrate the importance of preserving Lagrangian
structure and illustrate the proposed method's merits: it reduces computation
time while maintaining high accuracy and stability, in contrast to existing
nonlinear model-reduction techniques that do not preserve structure.

In the skin of two molecular layers thick, molecular undercoordination shortens
the H-O bond by ~16% and lengthens the OH nonbond by ~25% through repulsion
between electron pairs on adjacent O atoms, which depresses the density from
0.92 for bulk ice to 0.75 gcm-3. The O:H-O cooperative relaxation stiffens the
H-O stretching phonon from 3200/3150 cm-1 to the same value of 3450 cm-1 and
raises the melting temperature of both skins by up to ~310 K. Numerical
derivatives on the viscosity and charge accumulation suggests that the elastic,
polarized, and thermally stable supersolid phase makes the ice frictionless and
water skin hydrophobic and ice like at room temperature.

Peter Bergmann on unified theories of electromagnetism and gravitation in five
dimensions. In their paper of 1938, Einstein and Bergmann were among the first
to introduce the modern viewpoint in which a four-dimensional theory that
coincides with Einstein-Maxwell theory at long distances is derived from a
five-dimensional theory with complete symmetry among all five dimensions. But
then they drew back, modifying the theory in a way that spoiled the
five-dimensional symmetry and looks contrived to modern readers. Why? According
to correspondence of Peter Bergmann with the author, the reason was that the
more symmetric version of the theory predicts the existence of a new long range
field (a massless scalar field). In 1938, Einstein and Bergmann did not wish to
make this prediction. (Based on a lecture at the Einstein Centennial

computer vision. This paper addresses the problem of robustly matching such
subspaces (computing the similarity between them) when they are used to
describe the scope of variations within sets of images of different (possibly
greatly so) scales. A naive solution of projecting the low-scale subspace into
the high-scale image space is described first and subsequently shown to be
inadequate, especially at large scale discrepancies. A successful approach is
proposed instead. It consists of (i) an interpolated projection of the
low-scale subspace into the high-scale space, which is followed by (ii) a
rotation of this initial estimate within the bounds of the imposed
``downsampling constraint''. The optimal rotation is found in the closed-form
which best aligns the high-scale reconstruction of the low-scale subspace with
the reference it is compared to. The method is evaluated on the problem of
matching sets of (i) face appearances under varying illumination and (ii)
object appearances under varying viewpoint, using two large data sets. In
comparison to the naive matching, the proposed algorithm is shown to greatly
increase the separation of between-class and within-class similarities, as well
as produce far more meaningful modes of common appearance on which the match
score is based.

constitutive functions and radial curvatures. A geodesic spherical cavity forms
at the center of a geodesic ball in tension by means of given surface tractions

trivial solution. In the incompressible case the bifurcation depends on the
local properties of the radial curvature near the geodesic ball center but the
bifurcation in compressible case is determined by the global properties of the
radial curvatures.
  A cavity forms at the center of a membrane shell of isotropic material placed
in tension by means of given boundary tractions or displacements when the

reviewed. The theory is based on an exact Chapman-Kolmogorov equation in phase
space. It can handle discrete time dynamics and ""exotic"" multi-particle
interactions. A nonlocal mean-field theory for the one-particle distribution
function is obtained by assuming molecular chaos. The Boltzmann approach of
Bertin et al., Phys. Rev. E 74, 022101 (2006) and J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42,
445001 (2009), is critically assessed and compared to the current approach. In
Boltzmann theory, a collision starts when two particles enter each others
action spheres and is finished when their distance exceeds the interaction
radius. The average duration of such a collision, $\tau_0$, is measured for the
Vicsek model with continuous time-evolution. If the noise is chosen to be close
to the flocking threshold, the average time between collisions is found to be
roughly equal to $\tau_0$ at low densities. Thus, the continuous-time
Vicsek-model near the flocking threshold cannot be accurately described by a
Boltzmann equation, even at very small density because collisions take so long
that typically other particles join in, rendering Boltzmann's binary collision
assumption invalid. Hydrodynamic equations for the phase space approach are
derived by means of a Chapman-Enskog expansion. The equations are compared to
the Toner-Tu theory of polar active matter. New terms, absent in the Toner-Tu
theory, are highlighted. Convergence problems of Chapman-Enskog and similar
gradient expansions are discussed.

growing privacy concerns. To address this problem, we propose a suit of
priority-aware private matching schemes to privately match the similarity with
potential friends in the vicinity. Unlike most existing work, our proposed
priority-aware matching scheme (P-match) achieves the privacy goal by combining
the commutative encryption function and the Tanimoto similarity coefficient
which considers both the number of common attributes between users as well as
the corresponding priorities on each common attribute. Further, based on the
newly constructed similarity function which takes the ratio of attributes
matched over all the input set into consideration, we design an enhanced
version to deal with some potential attacks such as unlimitedly inputting the
attribute set on either the initiator side or the responder side, etc. Finally,
our proposed E-match avoids the heavy cryptographic operations and improves the
system performance significantly by employing a novel use of the Bloom filter.
The security and communication/computation overhead of our schemes are
thoroughly analyzed and evaluated via detailed simulations and implementation.

equations are formulated for differential rotation of arbitrary shape and then
solved numerically for rotation non-uniform in radius. As the differential
rotation increases, r- and g-modes of initially stable global oscillations
transform smoothly into growing modes of baroclinic instability. The
instability can therefore be interpreted as stability loss to r- and g-modes
excitation. Regions of stellar parameters where r- or g-modes are
preferentially excited are defined. Baroclinic instability onsets at a very
small differential rotation of below 1%. The characteristic time of instability
growth is about one thousand rotation periods. Growing disturbances possess

rings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict
protein exchange between nuclear lobes. Our spatial stochastic model is based
on several lines of experimental evidence and predicts that, while a

late anaphase would be entirely sufficient. Additionally, we explore the

to record, nearly simultaneously, the full velocity and magnetic-field vectors

ultimate aim is to elaborate observational criteria to distinguish between the
manifestations of two mechanisms of sunspot-group formation --- the rising of
an Omega-shaped flux tube of a strong magnetic field and the in situ
amplification and structuring of magnetic field by convection (the convective
mechanism is briefly described). Observations of a young bipolar subregion
developing within AR 11313 were carried out on 9--10 October 2011. Based on the
series of filtergrams, the trajectories of corks are computed, using a
technique similar to but more reliable than local correlation tracking (LCT),
and compared with the magnetic maps. At this stage of the investigation, only
the vertical magnetic field and the horizontal flows are used for a qualitative
analysis. According to our preliminary findings, the velocity pattern in the
growing active region has nothing to do with a spreading flow on the scale of
the entire bipolar region, which could be expected if a tube of strong magnetic
field emerged. No violent spreading flows on the scale of the entire growing
magnetic region can be identified. Instead, normal mesogranular and
supergranular flows are preserved. The observed scenario of evolution seems to
agree with Bumba's inference that the development of an active region does not
entail the destruction of the existing convective-velocity field. The
convective mechanism appears to be better compatible with observations than the
rising-tube mechanism.

guide through the potential energy landscape and as a generator for pairs of
minima that can be used as input structures for methods capable of finding
transition states between two minima. For Lennard-Jones benchmark systems we
compared this Minima Hopping guided path search method to a known approach for
the exploration of potential energy landscapes that is based on deterministic

reliably allows to follow distinct directions when escaping from a local
minimum, we observed that Minima Hopping guided path search is far superior in
finding lowest-barrier reaction pathways. We therefore suggest that Minima
Hopping guided path search can be used as a simple and efficient way to
identify energetically low-lying chemical reaction pathways. Finally we applied
the Minima Hopping guided path search approach to 75-atom and 102-atom Lennard
Jones systems. For the 75-atom system we found pathways whose highest energies
are significantly lower than the highest energy along the previously published
lowest-barrier pathway. Furthermore, many of these pathways contain a smaller
number of intermediate transition states than the previously publish
lowest-barrier pathway. In case of the 102-atom system Minima Hopping guided
path search found a previously unknown and energetically low-lying funnel.

discontinuities at interfaces, of the type that the CFM can handle. Hence we
use the CFM to solve them (to high order of accuracy) with finite differences

ongoing bursts is a strong function of stellar mass, declining from 0.85 at a
stellar mass of 10**8 Msol to 0.25 for galaxies with M* = 10**10 Msol. Low mass
galaxies are not all young. The distribution of half mass formation times for
galaxies with stellar masses less than 10**9 Msol is broad, spanning the range
1-10 Gyr. The peak-to-trough variation in star formation rate among the
bursting population ranges lies in the range 10-25. In low mass galaxies, the
average duration of the burst is comparable to the dynamical time of the
galaxy. Galaxy structure is correlated with estimated burst mass fraction, but
in different ways in low and in high mass galaxies. High mass galaxies with
large burst mass fractions are more centrally concentrated, indicating that
bulge formation is at work. In low mass galaxies, stellar surface mass
densities decrease as a function of F_{burst}. These results are in good

by neutral hydrogen and Thompson scattering by free electrons. Often a
continuum depolarization results, but the Doppler redistribution produced by
the continuum scatterers, which are light (hence, fast), induces more complex
interactions between the polarization in spectral lines and in the continuum.
Here we formulate and solve the radiative transfer problem of scattering line
polarization with non coherent continumm scattering consistently. The problem
is formulated within the spherical tensor representation of atomic and light
polarization. The numerical method of solution is a generalization of the
Accelerated Lambda Iteration that is applied to both, the atomic system and the
radiation field. We show that the redistribution of the spectral line radiation
due to the non coherence of the continuum scattering may modify significantly
the shape of the emergent fractional linear polarization patterns, even
yielding polarization signals above the continuum level in intrinsically
unpolarizable lines.

scaling variables we use M*, the stellar surface density mu*, the specific star

molecular gas masses determined using a constant or a luminosity dependent
conversion factor, we estimate the robustness of these scaling relations on the
very uncertain assumptions used to transform CO line intensities into molecular
gas masses. The molecular gas distribution of a K-band-selected sample is
different from that of a far-infrared-selected sample since it includes a
significantly smaller number of objects with M(H2) < 6 10^9 Mo. In spiral
galaxies the molecular gas phase is only 25-30% of the atomic gas. The analysis
also indicates that the slope of the main scaling relations depends on the
adopted conversion factor. Among the sampled relations, all those concerning
M(gas)/M* are statistically significant and show little variation with X_CO. We
observe a significant correlation between M(H2)/M* and SSFR, M(H2)/M(HI) and

leaves strong hints of dynamical interactions, which are important for the

such as changes in the conditional shape (skewness, kurtosis),
time-irreversibility, or dependence in the extremes that their traditional

of those cross-periodograms, indexed by couples of quantile levels, converge
weakly, as stochastic processes, to Gaussian processes. A first application of
those results is the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals for copula

distributions (under serially dependent observations) for a new class of
rank-based spectral methods involving the Fourier transforms of rank-based

relations for finite products of structures from Fra\""iss\'e classes of finite

Free Amalgamation Property. This is essential to proving Ramsey-classification
theorems for equivalence relations on fronts, generalizing the Pudl\'ak-R\""odl

  To each topological Ramsey space in this framework corresponds an associated
ultrafilter satisfying some weak partition property. By using the correct
Fra\""iss\'e classes, we construct topological Ramsey spaces which are dense in
the partial orders of Baumgartner and Taylor in \cite{Baumgartner/Taylor78}
generating p-points which are $k$-arrow but not $k+1$-arrow, and in a partial
order of Blass in \cite{Blass73} producing a diamond shape in the Rudin-Keisler
structure of p-points. Any space in our framework in which blocks are products
of $n$ many structures produces ultrafilters with initial Tukey structure
exactly the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(n)$. If the number of Fra\""iss\'e
classes on each block grows without bound, then the Tukey types of the p-points
below the space's associated ultrafilter have the structure exactly
$[\omega]^{<\omega}$. In contrast, the set of isomorphism types of any product
of finitely many Fra\""iss\'e classes of finite relational structures satisfying
the Ramsey property and the OPFAP, partially ordered by embedding, is realized
as the initial Rudin-Keisler structure of some p-point generated by a space

fluctuations. These latter, compared to charge and pair fluctuations, are
assumed to be preeminent in the region of model-parameter space - small doping,
low temperature and large on-site Coulomb repulsion - where one expects strong
electronic correlations to dominate the physics of the system. This assumption
and the consequent choice for the basic field, as well as the whole analytical
approximation framework, have been validated through a comprehensive comparison
with data for local and single-particle properties obtained by different
numerical methods on varying all model parameters. The results systematically
agree, both quantitatively and qualitatively, up to coincide in many cases.

between weak and intermediate-strong correlations as well as the shape of the
occupied portion of the dispersion. A comprehensive comparison with other

event-triggered feedback on the statistics of interevent intervals. Events are
associated with the entering of a new cycle. The feedback is modeled by an
instantaneous increase (positive feedback) or decrease (negative feedback) of
the oscillators frequency, whenever an event occurs followed by an exponential
decay on a slow timescale. In contrast to previous works, we also consider
positive feedback that leads to various novel effects. For instance, besides
the known excitable and oscillatory regime, that are separated by a saddle-node
on invariant circle bifurcation, positive feedback can lead to bistable
dynamics and a change of the system's excitability. The feedback has also a
strong effect on noise-induced phenomena like coherence resonance or
anti-coherence resonance. Both positive and negative feedback can lead to more
regular output for particular noise strengths. Finally, we investigate serial
correlation in the sequence of interevent intervals that occur due to the
additional slow dynamics. We derive approximations for the serial correlation
coefficient and show that positive feedback results in extended positive
interval correlations whereas negative feedback yields short-ranging negative
correlations. Investigating the interplay of feedback and the nonlinear phase
dynamics close to the bifurcation, we find that correlations are most
pronounced for an optimal feedback strengths.

us to extend two sparse coding schemes to Grassmann manifolds. Furthermore, we
propose closed-form solutions for learning a Grassmann dictionary, atom by

sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms through embedding into Hilbert

possibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated

the floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or
cars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per
time step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but
we model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some
turns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired
walking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain
an average speed close to this threshold. In the paper we formally describe the
model and we show the results of its application in benchmark scenarios.
Finally, we also show how this approach can also support the definition of
slopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians
climbing them in a simulated scenario.

construction in Spain, there are not many wood structure buildings left to be
refurbished except for some palaces or cathedrals. However, if we go for a walk
and have a look at the old part of any city, we will realize that still most of
the buildings have a wood structure. In spite of the fact that the majority of
urban regulations forbid their demolition, other bad practices such as casting
and overloading the wood structure are very common. Considering that we want to
reach a standard of sustainable construction, the economical and environmental
costs, which are implied by the deficient refurbishment makes it well worth a
previous study of the structure, which in most cases represents less than a 1%
of the total budget. The main goal of this paper is to present most relevant
parts of the whole process of diagnosis of a wood structure building by means
of Non-Destructive Testing Techniques. Among the ones to be considered, we
could mention the analysis of the building and its surroundings, on-site
inspection of the building, structural diagnosis, definition of the corrective
actions to be taken, definition of treatments, quality control and a
maintenance plan. For the on-site inspection of the building, in the paper we
will highlight the use of Non-Destructive methods such as resistograph
drilling, X-ray imaging, ultrasound-based testing or moisture measurement. We
will provide practical examples of all this. The aim of this paper is to give
the audience an overall idea on how a pre-assessment work can enhance the
refurbishment of a wood structure building while reducing costs and

convection, which should be taken into account in analyses of the dynamics of
magnetic fields. Therefore, it is important to investigate the factors
responsible for the observed multiscale structure of solar convection. In this
study, an attempt is made to understand how the scales of convective motions
are affected by the particularities of the static temperature stratification of
a fluid layer. To this end, simple models are considered. The equations of
two-dimensional thermal convection are solved numerically for a plane
horizontal fluid layer heated from below, in an extended Boussinesq
approximation that admits thermal-diffusivity variations. These variations
specify the stratification of the layer. The static temperature gradient in a
thin sublayer near the upper surface of the layer is assumed to be many times
larger than in the remainder of the layer. In some cases, distributed heat
sinks are assumed to produce a stably stratified region overlying the
convective layer. Manifestations of the scale-splitting effect are noted, which
depend on the boundary conditions and stratification; {it becomes more
pronounced with the increase of the Rayleigh number.} Small-scale convection
cells are advected by larger-scale flows. In particular, the phase trajectories
of fluid particles indicate the presence of complex attractors, which reflect
the multiscale structure of the flow. The effect of the stably stratified upper
sublayer on the flow scales is also considered.

silicates and iron condense into atmospheric 'dust', which disappears at still

in the CMS experiment and is nowadays used by most of the analyses. It aims at
identifying and reconstructing individually each particle arising from the LHC
proton-proton collision, by combining the information from all the
subdetectors. The resulting particle-flow event reconstruction leads to an
improved performance for the reconstruction of jets and MET, and for the
identification of electrons, muons, and taus. The algorithm and its performance
will be described. The commissioning phase, during which it was demonstrated
that the algorithm was performing as expected from the simulation up to a high

knowledge of basic notions in differential geometry. Full proofs of many
results are provided. The Marsden-Weinstein reduction procedure and the
Euler-Poincar\'e equation are discussed. Symplectic cocycles involved when a
momentum map is equivariant with respect to an affine action whose linear part
is the coadjoint action are presented. The Hamiltonian actions of a Lie group
on its cotangent bundle obtained by lifting the actions of the group on itself
by translations on the left and on the right are fully discussed. We prove that
there exists a two-parameter family of deformations of these actions into a
pair of mutually symplectically orthogonal Hamiltonian actions whose momentum

group symplectic cocycle. In the last section three classical examples are
considered: the spherical pendulum, the motion of a rigid body around a fixed
point and the Kepler problem. For each example the Euler-Poincar\'e equation is
derived, the first integrals linked to symmetries are given. In this Section,
the classical concepts of vector calculus on an Euclidean three-dimensional
vector space (scalar, vector and mixed products) are used and their

determination of M_dyn is not straight-forward if spatially resolved
measurements are not available. This situation occurs in single-dish HI
observations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift
observations. M_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly
obtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the
molecular medium. Even though the CO linewidth can in most cases be determined
with reasonable accuracy, a measurement of the size of the emitting region is
typically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated
spectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial
distribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We
demonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the
shape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~50 kms-1)
velocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like
(non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift
observations. We determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches the
rotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for each
tracer this happens at a well-defined radius: HI velocity widths typically
originate at ~5 optical scale lengths, while CO velocity widths trace the
rotation velocity at ~2 scale lengths. We additionally explore other
distributions to take into account that CO distributions at high redshift
likely differ from those at low redshift. Our models, while not trying to
reproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used in
conjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamical
masses consistent with the assumed gas distribution.

unusually high HI content from the Bluedisk sample, along with a similar-sized
sample of ""normal"" galaxies. We propose an empirical model to fit the radial
profile of the HI surface density, an exponential function with a depression
near the center. The radial HI surface density profiles are very homogeneous in
the outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of the
profile has a scale-length of $\sim 0.18$ R1, where R1 is the radius where the
column density of the HI is 1 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. This holds for all
galaxies, independent of their stellar or HI mass. The homogenous outer
profiles, combined with the limited range in HI surface density in the
non-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between HI
size and HI mass. By comparing the radial profiles of the HI-rich galaxies with
those of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, most
of the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially declining
outer regions of the HI disk. In the other half, the excess is more centrally
peaked. We compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamical
simulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a $\Lambda$
Cold Dark Matter universe. Both the hydro simulations and the semi-analytic
models reproduce the HI surface density profiles and the HI size-mass relation
without further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. In the semi-analytic
models, the universal shape of the outer HI radial profiles is a consequence of
the {\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.
The conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of HI
surface densities in the inner disk. These two factors produce the tight HI
mass-size relation.

on either their response to external perturbations or on their dynamical
properties. In addition to small-world and scale-free properties, clustering is
the most common topological characteristic observed in many real networked
systems. In this paper, we report an extensive numerical study on the effects
of clustering on the structural properties of complex networks. Strong
clustering in heterogeneous networks induces the emergence of a core-periphery
organization that has a critical effect on the percolation properties of the
networks. We observe a novel double phase transition with an intermediate phase
in which only the core of the network is percolated and a final phase in which
the periphery percolates regardless of the core. This result implies breaking
of the same symmetry at two different values of the control parameter, in stark
contrast to the modern theory of continuous phase transitions. Inspired by this
core-periphery organization, we introduce a simple model that allows us to
analytically prove that such an anomalous phase transition is in fact possible.

on a wide range of scales, to gain insight into a number of interesting
processes in nonlinear structure formation, such as cluster assembly, merging
and clustering. The approach treats the curve defined by the height of the
overdensity fluctuation field when changing the smoothing scale as a random
walk. The steps of the walks are often assumed to be uncorrelated, so that the
walk heights are a Markov process, even though this assumption is known to be
inaccurate for physically relevant filters. We develop a model in which the
walk steps, rather than heights, are a Markov process, and correlations between
steps arise because of nearest neighbour interactions. This model is a
particular case of a general class, which we call Markov Velocity models. We
show how these can approximate the walks generated by arbitrary power spectra
and filters, and, unlike walks with Markov heights, provide a very good
approximation to physically relevant models. We define a Markov Velocity Monte
Carlo algorithm to generate walks whose first crossing distribution is very
similar to that of TopHat-smoothed LCDM walks. Finally, we demonstrate that
Markov Velocity walks generically exhibit a simple but realistic form of
assembly bias, so we expect them to be useful in the construction of more
realistic merger history trees.

pipeline. SERPent is written in the Parseltongue language enabling interaction
with the Astronomical Image Processing Software (AIPS) program. Moreover,
SERPent is a simple ""out of the box"" Python script, which is easy to set up and
is free of compilers. In addition to the flagging of RFI affected visibilities,
the script also flags antenna zero-amplitude dropouts and Lovell telescope
phase calibrator stationary scans inherent to the e-MERLIN system. Both the
flagging and computational performances of SERPent are presented here, for
e-MERLIN commissioning datasets for both L-band (1.3 - 1.8 GHz) and C-band (4 -
8 GHz) observations. RFI typically amounts to < 20 - 25% for the more
problematic L-band observations and < 5% for the generally RFI quieter C-band.
The level of RFI detection and flagging is more accurate and delicate than
visual manual flagging, with the output immediately ready for AIPS calibration.
SERPent is fully parallelised and has been tested on a range of computing
systems. The current flagging rate is at 110 GB/day on a ""high-end"" computer
(16 CPUs, 100 GB memory) which amounts to ~ 6.9 GB/CPU/day, with an expected
increase in performance when e-MERLIN has completed its commissioning. The
refining of automated reduction and calibration procedures is essential for the
e-MERLIN legacy projects and future interferometers such as the SKA and the
associated pathfinders (MeerKAT and ASKAP), where the vast data sizes (> TB)

for intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), but invoked with limited
segmentation -- to efficiently produce high quality 3D conformal treatment
(3D-CRT) plans.
  Methods: Ten patients previously planned with 3D-CRT were replanned with a
low-segment inverse multicriteria optimized technique. The MCO-3D plans used
the same number of beams, beam geometry and machine parameters of the
corresponding 3D plans, but were limited to an energy of 6 MV. The MCO-3D plans
were optimized using a fluence-based MCO IMRT algorithm and then, after MCO
navigation, segmented with a low number of segments. The 3D and MCO-3D plans
were compared by evaluating mean doses to individual organs at risk (OARs),
mean doses to combined OARs, homogeneity indexes (HI), monitor units (MUs),
physician preference, and qualitative assessments of planning time and plan
customizability.
  Results: The MCO-3D plans significantly reduced the OAR mean doses and
monitor units while maintaining good coverage and homogeneity of target
volumes. MCO allows for more streamlined plan customization. All MCO-3D plans
were preferred by physicians over their corresponding 3D plans.
  Conclusion: High quality 3D plans can be produced using IMRT optimization
technology, resulting in automated field-in-field type plans with good monitor
unit efficiency. Adopting this technology in a clinic could streamline

correlations. Such a framework is based on the notion of local quantum
measurements, but, in order to account for beyond-quantum correlations, global
pseudo-states that are not positive semidefinite are allowed. After a short
review of the formalism, we consider its use in the quantification of both
general non-local and beyond-quantum correlations. We argue that the unified
framework for correlations provides a simple approach to such a quantification,
in particular when the quantification is meant to be operational and meaningful
in a resource-theory scenario, i.e., when considering the processing of
resources by means of non-resources. We relate different notions of robustness
of correlations, both at the level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability
distributions, with particular focus on the beyond-quantum robustness of
correlations and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue that, within
the unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that of operators
and that of probability distributions---is very strict. We point out how the
consideration of robustness at the two levels leads to a natural framework for
the quantification of entanglement in a device-independent way. Finally, we
show that the beyond-quantum robustness of the non-positive operators needed to
achieve beyond-quantum correlations coincides with their negativity and their
distance from the set of quantum states. As an example, we calculate the
beyond-quantum robustness for the case of a noisy Popescu-Rohrlich box.

suggested effective description of the Mott phase in various triangular organic
compounds. Employing the variational cluster approximation and the ladder
dual-fermion approach as complementary methods to adequately treat the
zero-temperature and the finite-temperature domains, we obtain a consistent
picture of the phase diagram as a function of anisotropy and interaction
strength. The metal-insulator transition substantially depends on the
anisotropy, and so does the nature of magnetism and the emergence of a
nonmagnetic insulating phase. We further find that geometric anisotropy
significantly influences the thermodynamics of the system. For increased
frustration induced by anisotropy, the entropy of the system increases with
interaction strength, opening the possibility of adiabatically cooling a
frustrated system by an enhancement of electronic correlations.

scalings which present themselves in the form of a power-law dependence with
population of various socio-economical and structural indicators. We propose
here a dynamical, stochastic theory of urban growth which accounts for some of
the observed scalings and we confirm these results on US and OECD empirical
data. In particular, we show that the dependence with population size of the
total number of miles driven daily, the total length of the road network, the
total traffic delay, the total consumption of gasoline, the quantity of $CO_2$
emitted and the relation between area and population of cities, are all
governed by a single parameter which characterizes the sensitivity to
congestion. Finally, our results suggest that diseconomies associated with
congestion scale superlinearly with population size, implying that, despite
polycentrism, cities whose transportation infrastructure rely heavily on
traffic sensitive modes are unsustainable.

exhibits not only the pulses emanating from itself, but also displays
modulations near the pulse period of the other. Freire et al. (2009, MNRAS,
396, 1764) have put forward a technique using the modulation of B by A to
determine the sense of rotation of pulsar A relative to its orbital motion,
among other quantities. In this paper, we present another technique with the
same purpose. While the Freire et al. approach analyzes pulse arrival times,
ours instead uses periods or frequencies (their inverses), which can be
experimentally determined via power spectral analysis similar to that used in
pulsar searches. Our technique is based on the apparent change in spin period
of a body when it is measured from an orbiting platform (the other pulsar), and
is shown to be entirely analogous to the difference between the sidereal and
solar spin period of the Earth (i.e., the sidereal and solar day). Two benefits
of this approach are its conceptual and computational simplicity. The direct
detection of spin with this technique will observationally validate the
rotating lighthouse model of pulsar emission, while the detection of the
relative directions of spin and orbital angular momenta has important
evolutionary implications. Our technique can be used on other binary systems
exhibiting mutually induced phenomena.

for first order operators, and the canonical second order self-adjoint lifting.
Secondly we study pencil liftings equivariant with respect to volume preserving
transformations. This helps to understand the role of self-adjointness for the
canonical pencils. Then we introduce the Duval-Lecomte-Ovsienko (DLO)-pencil
lifting which is derived from the full symbol calculus of projective
quantisation. We use the DLO-pencil lifting to describe all regular
proj-equivariant pencil liftings. In particular the comparison of these pencils
with the canonical pencil for second order operators leads to objects related
to the Schwarzian. Within this paper the question of whether the pencil lifting
factors through a full symbol map naturally arises.
