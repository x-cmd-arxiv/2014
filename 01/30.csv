range of a high contrast imaging system. These aberrations are either imposed
by a turbulent medium such as the atmosphere, by static or thermal aberrations
in the optical path, or by imperfectly phased subapertures in a segmented
mirror. Active and adaptive optics (AO), consisting of a wavefront sensor and a
deformable mirror, are employed to address this problem. Nevertheless, the
non-common-path between the wavefront sensor and the science camera leads to
persistent quasi-static speckles that are difficult to calibrate and which
impose a floor on the image contrast. In this paper we present the first
experimental demonstration of a novel wavefront sensor requiring only a minor
asymmetric obscuration of the pupil, using the science camera itself to detect
high order wavefront errors from the speckle pattern produced. We apply this to
correct errors imposed on a deformable microelectromechanical (MEMS) segmented
mirror in a closed loop, restoring a high quality point spread function (PSF)
and residual wavefront errors of order $\sim 10$ nm using 1600 nm light, from a
starting point of $\sim 300$ nm in piston and $\sim 0.3$ mrad in tip-tilt. We
recommend this as a method for measuring the non-common-path error in
AO-equipped ground based telescopes, as well as as an approach to phasing
difficult segmented mirrors such as on the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope}
primary and as a future direction for extreme adaptive optics.

significantly affects any characterisation of the solar radiances. We present
the limb-brightening function for the main lines and find that it does not

radiance histogram of the cooler lines have a well defined, log-normal

Both the analysis of the centre-to-limb variation and of the radiance

Lines formed above 1 MK are dramatically affected by the presence of active
regions, and indeed, no ""quiet Sun"" region can be defined during periods of
maximum activity. Much of the irradiance variability in lines formed below 1.5
MK is due to a change in the emitting area. For hotter lines, the emitting area
saturates to almost 100% of full solar disk at the maximum of activity, while
simultaneously the emission due to active regions increases by more than an
order of magnitude. We show that structures around active regions, sometimes
referred to as dark halos or dark canopies, are common and discuss their
similarities and differences with coronal holes. In particular, we show how

equation for atmospheres and quantum harmonic oscillators are identical, even
when forcing (stellar irradiation), sources of friction (molecular viscosity,
Rayleigh drag and magnetic drag) and magnetic tension are included. The global
atmospheric structure is largely controlled by a single, key parameter that
involves the Rossby and Prandtl numbers. This near-universality breaks down
when either molecular viscosity or magnetic drag acts non-uniformly across
latitude or a poloidal magnetic field is present, suggesting that these effects
will introduce qualitative changes to the familiar chevron-shaped feature
witnessed in simulations of atmospheric circulation. We also find that
hydrodynamic and magnetic sources of friction have dissimilar phase signatures
and affect the flow in fundamentally different ways, implying that using
Rayleigh drag to mimic magnetic drag is inaccurate. We exhaustively lay down
the theoretical formalism (dispersion relations, governing equations and
time-dependent wave solutions) for a broad suite of models. In all situations,
we derive the steady state of an atmosphere, which is relevant to interpreting
infrared phase and eclipse maps of exoplanetary atmospheres. We elucidate a

processes on large random networks highlight that inference by our algorithm

polymorphisms shared between species and the absence of fixed differences, the
effects remain poorly characterized. We focus on the case of a single site
under long-lived balancing selection and derive approximations for summaries of
the data that are sensitive to a trans-species polymorphism: the length of the
segment that carries most of the signals, the expected number of shared neutral
SNPs within the segment and the patterns of allelic associations among them.
Coalescent simulations of ancient balancing selection confirm the accuracy of
our approximations. We further show that for humans and chimpanzees, and more
generally for pairs of species with low genetic diversity levels, the patterns
of genetic variation on which we focus are highly unlikely to be generated by
neutral recurrent mutations, so these statistics are specific as well as
sensitive. We discuss the implications of our results for the design and
interpretation of genome scans for ancient balancing selection in apes and
other taxa.

molecular features mainly due to water and methane while the third is
consistent with a weak molecular detection at the 2.2$\sigma$ level. We

the seismic wavefield constitutes the helioseismic inverse problem. Deviations
in seismic measurements (such as wave travel times) from their fiducial values
estimated for a given model of the solar interior imply that the model is
inaccurate. Contemporary inversions in local helioseismology assume that
properties of the solar interior are linearly related to measured travel-time
deviations. It is widely known, however, that this assumption is invalid for
sunspots and active regions, and likely for supergranular flows as well. Here,
we introduce nonlinear optimization, executed iteratively, as a means of
inverting for the sub-surface structure of large-amplitude perturbations.
Defining the penalty functional as the $L_2$ norm of wave travel-time
deviations, we compute the the total misfit gradient of this functional with
respect to the relevant model parameters %(only sound speed in this case) at
each iteration around the corresponding model. The model is successively
improved using either steepest descent, conjugate gradient, or quasi-Newton
limited-memory BFGS. Performing nonlinear iterations requires privileging
pixels (such as those in the near-field of the scatterer), a practice not
compliant with the standard assumption of translational invariance.
Measurements for these inversions, although similar in principle to those used
in time-distance helioseismology, require some retooling. For the sake of
simplicity in illustrating the method, we consider a 2-D inverse problem with
only a sound-speed perturbation.

is random, i.e., it depends on the realization. We characterize the final
charging profile---a charging profile can be a realization of the final
charging profile if and only if it is a Nash equilibrium of the game in which
each EV seeks to minimize the inner product of its own charging profile and the
aggregate electricity demand. Furthermore, we provide a uniform suboptimality
upper bound, that scales O(1/n) in the number n of EVs, for all realizations of

Post-Newtonian approximation. However, with the increasing precision of ongoing
space missions as Gaia, GAME, BepiColombo, JUNO or JUICE, we know that some
corrections up to the second order have to be taken into account for future
experiments. We present a procedure to compute the relativistic coordinate time
delay, Doppler and astrometric observables avoiding the integration of the null

a powerful tool providing key quantities such as the time of flight of a light
signal between two point-events and the tangent vector to its null-geodesic.

is widespread, but the number of iterations required to approximate optimal
arguments can be prohibitive in high dimensional problems. Application of
second order methods, on the other hand, is impracticable because computation
of objective function Hessian inverses incurs excessive computational cost.
BFGS modifies gradient descent by introducing a Hessian approximation matrix
computed from finite gradient differences. RES utilizes stochastic gradients in
lieu of deterministic gradients for both, the determination of descent
directions and the approximation of the objective function's curvature. Since
stochastic gradients can be computed at manageable computational cost RES is
realizable and retains the convergence rate advantages of its deterministic
counterparts. Convergence results show that lower and upper bounds on the
Hessian egeinvalues of the sample functions are sufficient to guarantee
convergence to optimal arguments. Numerical experiments showcase reductions in
convergence time relative to stochastic gradient descent algorithms and
non-regularized stochastic versions of BFGS. An application of RES to the

on the differential form of Schr\""odinger's equation. This paper, in contrast,
investigates the integral form of Schr\""odinger's equation. While both forms
are known to be equivalent for smooth potentials, this is not true for
distributional potentials. Here, we assume that the potential is given by a
distribution defined on the space of discontinuous test functions.
  First, by using Schr\""odinger's integral equation, we confirm a seminal
result by Kurasov, which was originally obtained in the context of
Schr\""odinger's differential equation. This hints at a possible deeper
connection between both forms of the equation. We also sketch a generalisation
of Kurasov's result to hypersurfaces.
  Second, we derive a new closed-form solution to Schr\""odinger's integral
equation with a delta prime potential. This potential has attracted
considerable attention, including some controversy. Interestingly, the derived
propagator satisfies boundary conditions that were previously derived using
Schr\""odinger's differential equation.
  Third, we derive boundary conditions for `super-singular' potentials given by
higher-order derivatives of the delta potential. These boundary conditions
cannot be incorporated into the normal framework of self-adjoint extensions. We
show that the boundary conditions depend on the energy of the solution, and
that probability is conserved.
  This paper thereby confirms several seminal results and derives some new
ones. In sum, it shows that Schr\""odinger's integral equation is viable tool
for studying singular interactions in quantum mechanics.

approximate controllability of infinite dimensional linear systems of type
$y'=A y+Bu$. We precise the result proved by H. O. Fattorini in
\cite{Fattorini1966} for bounded input $B$, in the case where $B$ can be
unbounded or in the case of finite-dimensional controls. More precisely, we
prove that if Fattorini's criterion is satisfied and if the set of geometric
multiplicities of $A$ is bounded then approximate controllability can be
achieved with finite dimensional controls. An important consequence of this
result consists in using the Fattorini's criterion to obtain the feedback
stabilizability of linear and nonlinear parabolic systems with feedback
controls in a finite dimensional space. In particular, for systems described by
partial differential equations, such a criterion reduces to a unique
continuation theorem for a stationary system. We illustrate such a method by
tackling some coupled Navier-Stokes type equations (MHD system and micropolar
fluid system) and we sketch a systematic procedure relying on Fattorini's
criterion for checking stabilizability of such nonlinear systems. In that case,
the unique continuation theorems rely on local Carleman inequalities for
stationary Stokes type systems.

the Kepler space telescope. In a few systems the planets reside close to the
dynamical stability limit. Due to the difficulty of forming planets in such
close orbits, it is believed that they have formed further out in the disk and
migrated to their present locations. Our goal is to construct more realistic
models of planet migration in circumbinary disks, and to determine the final
position of these planets. In our work, we focus on the system Kepler-38. The
evolution of the circumbinary disk is studied using two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations. We study locally isothermal disks as well as more
realistic models with viscous heating, radiative cooling from the disk
surfaces, and radiative diffusion in the disk mid plane. After the disk has
been brought into equilibrium, a 115 Earth-mass planet is embedded and its
evolution is followed. In all cases the planets stop inward migration near the
inner edge of the disk. In isothermal disks with a typical disk scale height of
H/r = 0.05, the final outcome agrees very well with the observed location of
planet Kepler-38b. For the radiative models, the disk thickness and location of
the inner edge is determined by the mass in the system. For surface densities
in the order of 3000 g/cm^2 at 1 AU, the inner gap lies close to the binary and
planets stop in the region between the 5:1 and 4:1 mean-motion resonances with
the binary. A model with a disk with approximately a quarter of the mass yields
a final position very close to the observed one. For planets migrating in
circumbinary disks, the final position is dictated by the structure of the
disk. Knowing the observed orbits of circumbinary planets, radiative disk
simulations with embedded planets can provide important information on the
physical state of the system during the final stages of its evolution.

analytical model for intracluster non-thermal pressure in the virial region of
relaxed clusters. We write down and solve a first-order differential equation
describing the evolution of non-thermal velocity dispersion. This equation is
based on insights gained from observations, numerical simulations, and theory
of turbulence. The non-thermal energy is sourced, in a self-similar fashion, by
the mass growth of clusters via mergers and accretion, and dissipates with a
time-scale determined by the turnover time of the largest turbulence eddies.
Our model predicts a radial profile of non-thermal pressure for relaxed
clusters. The non-thermal fraction increases with radius, redshift, and cluster
mass, in agreement with numerical simulations. The radial dependence is due to
a rapid increase of the dissipation time-scale with radii, and the mass and
redshift dependence comes from the mass growth history. Combing our model for
the non-thermal fraction with the Komatsu-Seljak model for the total pressure,

state discrimination between r given states \sigma_1,...,\sigma_r. By splitting
up the overall test into multiple binary tests in various ways we obtain a
number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability in terms of the binary
error probabilities. These upper bounds allow us to deduce various bounds on
the asymptotic error rate, for which it has been hypothesised that it is given
by the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound (or Chernoff divergence)
C(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_r), as recently introduced by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a in
analogy with Salikhov's classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This
quantity is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences
min_{j<k}C(\sigma_j,\sigma_k). It was known already that the optimal asymptotic
rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain classes of sets of states
the bound is actually achieved. It was known to be achieved, in particular,
when the state pair that is closest together in Chernoff divergence is more
than 6 times closer than the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in
two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between
C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved when
the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the next closest pair.
We also show that the Chernoff bound is achieved when at least $r-2$ of the
states are pure, improving on a previous result by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a.
Finally, we indicate a number of potential pathways along which a proof (or
disproof) may eventually be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff
bound is always achieved.

enigmatic. Our optical and near-infrared spectra show strong evidence of

[O I], H$\alpha$, Ca II, [Fe II], Pa$\beta$, and H$_2$. The molecular hydrogen
emission is spatially resolved as a single lobe that stretches $\approx$0.1""
(15 AU). Although the extended emission is not kinematically resolved in our
data, its morphology resembles shock-excited H$_2$ jets primarily seen in young
Class 0 and Class I sources. The near-infrared continuum of FW Tau b is mostly
flat and lacks the deep absorption features expected for a cool, late-type
object. This may be a result of accretion-induced veiling, especially in light
of its strong and sustained H$\alpha$ emission ($EW$(H$\alpha$)$\gtrsim$290

low-mass star or brown dwarf (0.03-0.15 $M_{\odot}$) with an edge-on disk.

intrinsic changes in the dust properties or in the star formation history

measurements on light stops in natural SUSY scenarios beyond the MSSM, which
works directly in the plane of stop mass eigenvalues (with no need to make
assumptions about mixing angles). For given stop mass eigenvalues, the smallest
value of $X_t$ that can bring the correction to the $h \to gg$ and $h\to
\gamma\gamma$ couplings into agreement with data is computed. Requiring that
this $X_t$ is consistent--i.e. that the chosen mass eigenvalues can be the
outcome of diagonalizing a matrix with a given off-diagonal term--rules out the
possibility that both stops have a mass below $\approx$ 400 GeV. Requiring that
$X_t$ is not fine-tuned for agreement with the data shows that neither stop can
be lighter than $\approx$ 100 GeV. These constraints are interesting because,
unlike direct searches, they apply no matter how stops decay, and suggest a
minimum electroweak fine-tuning of between a factor of 5 and 10. We show that a
multi-parameter fit can slightly weaken this conclusion by allowing a large
Higgs coupling to $b$-quarks, but only if a second Higgs boson is within reach
of experiment. Certain models, like $R$-symmetric models with Dirac gauginos,
are much more strongly constrained because they predict negligible $X_t$. We
illustrate how the constraints will evolve given precise measurements at future

In our
model the star formation inside a galaxy is regulated by the feedback from
supernova (SNe) driven outflows. We derive a closed analytical form for star
formation rate in a single galaxy taking account of the SNe feedback in a
self-consistent manner. We show that our model can explain the observed
correlation between the stellar mass and the circular velocity of galaxies from
dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies of $10^{12} M_\odot$. For small mass dwarf
galaxies additional feedback other than supernova feedback is needed to explain
the spread in the observational data. Our models reproduce the observed 3-D
fundamental correlation between the stellar mass, gas phase metallicity and
star formation rate in galaxies establishing that the SNe feedback plays a
major role in building this relation. Further, the observed UV luminosity
functions of Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) are well explained by our feedback
induced star formation model for a vast redshift range of $1.5 \le z \le 8$. In
particular, the flattening of the luminosity functions at the low luminosity
end naturally arises due to our explicit SNe feedback treatment.

explain with plausible models for reionization. We demonstrate that the
observed reduction in Lya flux from galaxies at z > 6 can be explained by
evolution in the escape fraction of ionizing photons, f_esc. We find that the
median observed drop in the fraction of galaxies showing strong Lya emission,
as well as the observed evolution of the Lya luminosity function both follow
from a small increase in f_esc of Delta f_esc ~ 0.1 from f_esc ~ 0.6 at z ~ 6.
This high escape fraction may be at odds with current constraints on the
ionising photon escape fraction, which favor smaller values of f_esc < 20%.
However, models that invoke a redshift evolution of f_ esc that is consistent
with these constraints can suppress the z~7 Lya flux to the observed level, if
they also include a small evolution in global neutral fraction of Delta x_HI ~
0.2. Thus, an evolving escape fraction of ionising photons can be a plausible
part of the explanation for evolution in the Lya emission of high redshift
galaxies. More generally, our analysis also shows that the drop in the Lya
fraction is quantitatively consistent with the observed evolution in the Lya
luminosity functions of Lya Emitters.

magnetic turbulence due to the streaming of particles that are
self-consistently accelerated at non-relativistic shocks. When acceleration is
efficient, we find that the upstream magnetic field is significantly amplified.
The total amplification factor is larger than 10 for shocks with Alfv\'enic
Mach number $M=100$, and scales with the square root of $M$. The spectral
energy density of excited magnetic turbulence is determined by the energy
distribution of accelerated particles, and for moderately-strong shocks
($M\lesssim30$) agrees well with the prediction of resonant streaming
instability, in the framework of quasilinear theory of diffusive shock
acceleration. For $M\gtrsim30$, instead, Bell's non-resonant hybrid (NRH)
instability is predicted and found to grow faster than resonant instability.
NRH modes are excited far upstream by escaping particles, and initially grow
without disrupting the current, their typical wavelengths being much shorter
than the current ions' gyroradii. Then, in the nonlinear stage, most unstable
modes migrate to larger and larger wavelengths, eventually becoming resonant in
wavelength with the driving ions, which start diffuse. Ahead of strong shocks
we distinguish two regions, separated by the free-escape boundary: the far
upstream, where field amplification is provided by the current of escaping ions
via NRH instability, and the shock precursor, where energetic particles are
effectively magnetized, and field amplification is provided by the current in
diffusing ions. The presented scalings of magnetic field amplification enable
the inclusion of self-consistent microphysics into phenomenological models of
ion acceleration at non-relativistic shocks.

under the influence of momentum-driven AGN feedback using three-dimensional
high-resolution (60 pc) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations. The
momentum-driven AGN feedback is modeled with a pair of (small-angle) precessing
jets, and the jet power is calculated based on the accretion rate of the cold
gas in the vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH). The ICM first cools
into clumps along the propagation direction of the AGN jets. As the jet power
increases, gas condensation occurs isotropically, forming spatially extended
(up to a few tens kpc) structures that resemble the observed $\rm H\alpha$
filaments in Perseus and many other cool-core cluster. Jet heating elevates the
gas entropy and cooling time, halting clump formation. The cold gas that is not
accreted onto the SMBH settles into a rotating disk of $\sim 10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$. The hot gas cools directly onto the cold disk while the SMBH
accretes from the innermost region of the disk, powering the AGN that maintains
a thermally balanced steady state for a few Gyr. The mass cooling rate averaged
over 7 Gyr is $\sim 30$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, an order of magnitude lower than the
classic cooling flow value (which we obtain in runs without the AGN). Medium
resolution simulations produce similar results, but when the resolution is
lower than 0.5 kpc, the cluster experiences cycles of gas condensation and AGN
outbursts. Owing to its self-regulating mechanism, AGN feedback can
successfully balance cooling with a wide range of model parameters. Besides
suppressing cooling, our model produces cold structures in early stages (up to
$\sim 2$ Gyr) that are in good agreement with the observations. However, the
long-lived massive cold disk is unrealistic, suggesting that additional
physical processes are still needed.

invariants such as the circulation of (canonical) momentum or, equivalently,
the flux of the vorticity or magnetic fields. In the Hamiltonian formalism,
topological invariants restrict the orbits to submanifolds of the phase space.
While the coadjoint orbits have a natural symplectic structure, the global
geometry of the degenerate (constrained) Poisson manifold can be very complex.
Some invariants are represented by the center of the Poisson algebra (i.e., the
Casimir elements such as the helicities), and then, the global structure of
phase space is delineated by Casimir leaves. However, a general constraint is
not necessarily integrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate
Casimir element; the circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this
work, we formulate a systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an
extended phase space; we introduce mock fields and extend the Poisson algebra
so that the mock fields are Lie-dragged by the flow vector. A mock field
defines a new Casimir element, a cross helicity, which represents topological
constraints including the circulation. Unearthing a Casimir element brings
about immense advantage in the study of dynamics and equilibria -- the
so-called energy-Casimir method becomes ready available. Yet, a mock field does
not a priori have a physical meaning. Here we proffer an interpretation of a
Casimir element obtained, e.g., by such a construction as an adiabatic
invariant associated with a hidden ""microscopic"" angle variable, and in this
way give the mock field a physical meaning. We proceed further and consider a
perturbation of the Hamiltonian by a canonical pair, composed of the Casimir
element and the angle, that causes the topological constraint to be unfrozen.
The theory is applied to the tearing modes of MHD.

measurements of fundamental physical properties, including tests of the

trajectories characterizing the motion of the wave packets for the two branches
of the interferometer do not close in phase space, an effect which increases
significantly with the interferometer time. The relative displacement between
the interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe
pattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the
oscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase
shift. Paying particular attention to gravity gradients, we present a simple
mitigation strategy involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses
which is very easy to implement. A useful representation-free description of
the state evolution in an atom interferometer is introduced and employed to
analyze the loss of contrast and mitigation strategy in the general case. (As a
by-product, a remarkably compact derivation of the phase-shift in a general
light-pulse atom interferometer is provided.) Furthermore, exact results are
obtained for (pure and mixed) Gaussian states which allow a simple
interpretation in terms of the alignment of Wigner functions in phase-space.
Analytical results are also obtained for expanding Bose-Einstein condensates
within the time-dependent Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally, a combined
strategy for rotations and nonaligned gravity gradients is considered as well.

the detection of a subset of entities whose connectivity is anomalous with
respect to the rest of the data. While the detection of such anomalous
subgraphs has received a substantial amount of attention, no
application-agnostic framework exists for analysis of signal detectability in
graph-based data. In this paper, we describe a framework that enables such
analysis using the principal eigenspace of a graph's residuals matrix, commonly
called the modularity matrix in community detection. Leveraging this analytical
tool, we show that the framework has a natural power metric in the spectral
norm of the anomalous subgraph's adjacency matrix (signal power) and of the
background graph's residuals matrix (noise power). We propose several
algorithms based on spectral properties of the residuals matrix, with more
computationally expensive techniques providing greater detection power.
Detection and identification performance are presented for a number of signal
and noise models, including clusters and bipartite foregrounds embedded into
simple random backgrounds as well as graphs with community structure and
realistic degree distributions. The trends observed verify intuition gleaned
from other signal processing areas, such as greater detection power when the
signal is embedded within a less active portion of the background. We
demonstrate the utility of the proposed techniques in detecting small, highly

importantly, by adopting new distribution functions and/or parameter estimation
methods, our framework can readily produce a spectrum of novel merging
criteria. Three of them are specifically focused in this work. In the first
criterion, we adopt the multinomial distribution with Bayesian method; In the
second criterion, we integrate Gaussian distribution with maximum likelihood
parameter estimation. In the third criterion, which shows the best merging
performance, we propose a max-margin-based parameter estimation method and
apply it with multinomial distribution. Extensive experimental study is
conducted to systematically analyse the performance of the above three criteria
and compare them with existing ones. As demonstrated, the best criterion
obtained in our framework achieves the overall best merging performance among
the comparable merging criteria developed in the literature.

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer catalog, finding that all Planck
clusters within the redMaPPer mask and within the redshift range probed by
redMaPPer are contained in the redMaPPer cluster catalog. These common clusters
define a tight scaling relation in the richness-SZ mass ($\lambda$--$M_{SZ}$)
plane, with an intrinsic scatter in richness of $\sigma_{\lambda|M_{SZ}} =
0.266 \pm 0.017$. The corresponding intrinsic scatter in true cluster halo mass
at fixed richness is $\approx 21\%$. The regularity of this scaling relation is
used to identify failures in both the redMaPPer and Planck cluster catalogs. Of
the 245 galaxy clusters in common, we identify three failures in redMaPPer and
36 failures in the PSZ1. Of these, at least 12 are due to clusters whose
optical counterpart was correctly identified in the PSZ1, but where the quoted
redshift for the optical counterpart in the external data base used in the PSZ1
was incorrect. The failure rates for redMaPPer and the PSZ1 are $1.2\%$ and
$14.7\%$ respectively, or 9.8% in the PSZ1 after subtracting the external data
base errors. We have further identified 5 PSZ1 sources that suffer from
projection effects (multiple rich systems along the line-of-sight of the SZ
detection) and 17 new high redshift ($z\gtrsim 0.6$) cluster candidates of
varying degrees of confidence. Should all of the high-redshift cluster
candidates identified here be confirmed, we will have tripled the number of
high redshift Planck clusters in the SDSS region. Our results highlight the
power of multi-wavelength observations to identify and characterize systematic
errors in galaxy cluster data sets, and clearly establish photometric data both

involve a discretization changing dynamics generated by evolution moves. Local
evolution moves in variational discrete systems (1) are a generalization of the
Pachner evolution moves of simplicial gravity models, (2) update only a small
subset of the dynamical data, (3) change the number of kinematical and physical
degrees of freedom, and (4) generate a dynamical coarse graining or refining of
the underlying discretization. To systematically explore such local moves and
their implications in the quantum theory, this article suitably expands the
quantum formalism for global evolution moves, constructed in a companion paper,
by employing that global moves can be decomposed into sequences of local moves.
This formalism is spelled out for systems with Euclidean configuration spaces.
Various types of local moves, the different kinds of constraints generated by
them, the constraint preservation and possible divergences in resulting state
sums are discussed. It is shown that non-trivial local coarse graining moves
entail a non-unitary projection of (physical) Hilbert spaces and `fine grained'
Dirac observables defined on them. Identities for undoing a local evolution
move with its (time reversed) inverse are derived. Finally, the implications of
these results for a Pachner move generated dynamics in simplicial quantum
gravity models are commented on.

cores of the giant planets are formed by accretion of planetesimals. As
planetary embryos grow the planetesimal velocity dispersion increases due to
gravitational excitations produced by embryos. The increase of planetesimal
relative velocities causes the fragmentation of them due to mutual collisions.
  We study the role of planetesimal fragmentation on giant planet formation. We
analyze how planetesimal fragmentation modifies the growth of giant planet's
cores for a wide range of planetesimal sizes and disk masses.
  We incorporate a model of planetesimal fragmentation into our model of in
situ giant planet formation. We calculate the evolution of the solid surface
density (planetesimals plus fragments) due to the accretion by the planet,
migration and fragmentation.
  The incorporation of planetesimal fragmentation significantly modifies the
process of planetary formation. If most of the mass loss in planetesimal
collisions is distributed in the smaller fragments, planetesimal fragmentation
inhibits the growth of the embryo for initial planetesimals of radii lower than
10 km. Only for initial planetesimals of 100 km of radius, and disks greater
than 0.06 Msun, embryos achieve masses greater than the mass of the Earth.
However, even for such big planetesimals and massive disks, planetesimal
fragmentation induces the quickly formation of massive cores only if most of
the mass loss in planetesimal collisions is distributed in the bigger
fragments.
  Planetesimal fragmentation seems to play an important role in giant planet
formation. The way in which the mass loss in planetesimal collisions is
distributed leads to different results, inhibiting or favoring the formation of
massive cores.

to extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge
detection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact
that these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object
foreground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be
combined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively
select threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature
selection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote
sensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three
characteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection
and reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics
analysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction
accuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding
an image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of
classification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of
thresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of
remote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive
thresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our
solution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.
Additionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective
algorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for
preprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable
tool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the

interacting among them and also with other polarizable matter in proximity has
been approximated by independent emission from the emitters. This is primarily
due to our inability to evaluate the self-energy matrices and the collective
eigenstates of emitters in heterogeneous ensembles. A method to evaluate the
self-energy matrices that is not limited by the geometry and the material
composition is presented here to understand and exploit such collective
excitations. Numerical evaluations using this method are used to highlight the
significant differences between independent and the collective modes of
emission in heterostructures. A set of n emitters driving each other and m
other polarizable entities, where N=m+n, is used to represent the coupled
system of a generalized geometry in a volume integral approach. Closed form
relations between the Green tensors of entity pairs in free space and their
correspondents in a heterostructure are derived concisely. This is made
possible for general geometries because the global matrices consisting of all
free-space Green dyads are subject to conservation laws. The self-energy matrix
of the emitters can then be assembled using the evaluated Green tensors of the
heterostructure, but a decomposition of its components into their radiative and
non-radiative decay contributions is non-trivial. This is accomplished using
matrix decomposition identities applied to the global matrices containing all
free-space dyads. The relations to compute the observables of the eigenstates
(such as quantum efficiency, power/energy of emission, radiative and
non-radiative decay rates) are presented. We conclude with a note on extension
of this method to collective excitations that also include strong interactions

Ph.D. Dissertation (2013)",,,,"math.CT math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most natural notion of a simplicial nerve for a (weak) bicategory was
given by Duskin, who showed that a simplicial set is isomorphic to the nerve of
a $(2,1)$-category (i.e. a bicategory with invertible $2$-morphisms) if and
only if it is a quasicategory which has unique fillers for inner horns of
dimension $3$ and greater. Using Duskin's technique, we show how his nerve
applies to $(2,1)$-category functors, making it a fully faithful inclusion of
$(2,1)$-categories into simplicial sets. Then we consider analogues of this
extension of Duskin's result for several different two-dimensional categorical
structures, defining and analysing nerves valued in presheaf categories based
on $\Delta^2$, on Segal's category $\Gamma$, and Joyal's category $\Theta_2$.
In each case, our nerves yield exactly those presheaves meeting a certain
""horn-filling"" condition, with unique fillers for high-dimensional horns.
Generalizing our definitions to higher dimensions and relaxing this uniqueness
condition, we get proposed models for several different kinds
higher-categorical structures, with each of these models closely analogous to
quasicategories. Of particular interest, we conjecture that our ""inner-Kan

persistent challenge, critically impacting their technological acceptance. This
paper reports the experimental, numerical and analytical investigation of
interactions in arrays of Co nanoellipses using the first-order reversal curve
(FORC) technique. A mean-field analysis has revealed the physical mechanisms
giving rise to all of the observed features: a shift of the non-interacting
FORC-ridge at the low-H$_c$ end off the local coercivity H$_c$ axis; a stretch
of the FORC-ridge at the high-H$_c$ end without shifting it off the H$_c$ axis;
and a formation of a tilted edge connected to the ridge at the low-H$_c$ end.
Changing from flat to Gaussian coercivity distribution produces a negative
feature, bends the ridge, and broadens the edge. Finally, nearest neighbor
interactions segment the FORC-ridge. These results demonstrate that the FORC
approach provides a comprehensive framework to qualitatively and quantitatively
decode interactions in nanomagnet arrays.

with nonlocal degrees of freedom. On a strip of width N, the evolution operator
is the double-row transfer tangle D(u), an element of the TL algebra TL_N(beta)
with loop fugacity beta=2cos(lambda). Similarly on a cylinder, the single-row
transfer tangle T(u) is an element of the enlarged periodic TL algebra. The
logarithmic minimal models LM(p,p') comprise a subfamily of the TL loop models
for which the crossing parameter lambda=(p'-p)pi/p' is parameterised by coprime
integers 0<p<p'. For these special values, additional symmetries allow for
particular degeneracies in the spectra that account for the logarithmic nature
of these theories. For critical dense polymers LM(1,2), D(u) and T(u) are known
to satisfy inversion identities that allow us to obtain exact eigenvalues in
any representation and for all system sizes N. The generalisation for p'>2
takes the form of functional relations for D(u) and T(u) of polynomial degree
p'. These derive from fusion hierarchies of commuting transfer tangles
D^{m,n}(u) and T^{m,n}(u) where D(u)=D^{1,1}(u) and T(u)=T^{1,1}(u). The fused
transfer tangles are constructed from (m,n)-fused face operators involving
Wenzl-Jones projectors P_k on k=m or k=n nodes. Some projectors P_k are
singular for k>p'-1, but we argue that D^{m,n}(u) and T^{m,n}(u) are well
defined for all m,n. For generic lambda, we derive the fusion hierarchies and
the associated T- and Y-systems. For the logarithmic theories, the closure of
the fusion hierarchies at n=p' translates into functional relations of
polynomial degree p' for D^{m,1}(u) and T^{m,1}(u). We also derive the closure
of the Y-systems for the logarithmic theories. The T- and Y-systems are the key
to exact integrability and we observe that the underlying structure of these
functional equations relate to Dynkin diagrams of affine Lie algebras.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/784/1/56",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vital importance of composition-dependent low-temperature opacity in
low-mass (M < 3Msun) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar models of
metallicity Z > 0.001 has recently been demonstrated (e.g. Marigo 2002; Ventura
& Marigo 2010). Its significance to more metal-poor, intermediate mass (M >
2.5Msun) models has yet to be investigated. We show that its inclusion in
lower-metallicity models ([Fe/H] < -2) is essential, and that there exists no
threshold metallicity below which composition-dependent molecular opacity may
be neglected. We find it to be crucial in all intermediate-mass models
investigated ([Fe/H] < -2 and 2.5 < M/Msun < 5), because of the evolution of
the surface chemistry, including the orders of magnitude increase in the
abundance of molecule-forming species. Its effect on these models mirrors that
previously reported for higher-metallicity models - increase in radius,
decrease in Teff, faster mass loss, shorter thermally pulsing AGB lifetime,
reduced enrichment in third dredge-up products (by a factor of three to ten),
and an increase in the mass limit for hot bottom burning. We show that the
evolution of low-metallicity models with composition-dependent low-temperature
opacity is relatively independent of initial metal abundance because its
contribution to the opacity is far outweighed by changes due to dredge-up. Our
results imply a significant reduction in the expected number of
nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars, which may help explain their observed
paucity. We note that these findings are partially a product of the
macrophysics adopted in our models, in particular the Vassiliadis & Wood (1993)
mass loss rate which is strongly dependent on radius.

adequately detailed modelling, as carried out here, can conclusively establish
that the entire signal arises from non-circular beam effect. This is important
since cosmic SI violation signals are expected to be subtle and dismissing a
large SI violation signal as observational artefact based on simplistic

question remains if there are further opportunities to improve test focusing.
One idea is to identify other types of information that may indicate the
location of defect-prone software parts. Data from software inspections, in
particular, appear to be promising. This kind of data might already lead to
software parts that have inherent difficulties or programming challenges, and
in consequence might be defect-prone. This article first explains how
inspection and product metrics can be used to focus testing activities. Second,
we compare selected product and inspection metrics commonly used to predict
defect-prone parts (e.g., size and complexity metrics, inspection defect
content metrics, and defect density metrics). Based on initial experience from
two case studies performed in different environments, the suitability of
different metrics for predicting defect-prone parts is illustrated. The studies
revealed that inspection defect data seems to be a suitable predictor, and a
combination of certain inspection and product metrics led to the best
prioritizations in our contexts. In addition, qualitative experience is
presented, which substantiates the expected benefit of using inspection results
to optimize testing.

dynamical quark-mass generation in QCD in the SD approach as a typical
fermion-mass generation via spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking. Second, using
the SD formalism for scalar QCD, we investigate the scalar diquark, a
bound-state-like object of two quarks, and its mass generation, which is
clearly non-chiral-origin. Here, the scalar diquark is treated as an extended
colored scalar field, like a meson in effective hadron models, and its
effective size $R$ is introduced as a form factor. As a diagrammatical
difference, the SD equation for the scalar diquark has an additional 4-point
interaction term, in comparison with the single quark case. The diquark size
$R$ is taken to be smaller than a hadron, $R\sim 1$ fm, and larger than a
constituent quark, $R\sim 0.3$ fm. We find that the compact diquark with
$R\simeq 0.3$ fm has a large effective mass of about 900 MeV, and therefore
such a compact diquark is not acceptable in effective models for hadrons. We
also consider the artificial removal of 3- and 4-point interaction,
respectively, to see the role of each term, and find that the 4-point
interaction plays the dominant role of the diquark self-energy. From the above
two different cases, quarks and diquarks, we guess that the mass generation of
colored particles is a general result of non-perturbative gluonic dressing
effect.

1.0$). The morphological classification was provided by the Advanced Camera for
Surveys General Catalogue (ACS-GC), which used publicly available data obtained
with the ACS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. Rest-frame photometric
quantities were derived using kcorrect. We analyse the properties of the sample
and the evolution of pure-disc systems with redshift. Very massive [$\log
(M_\star/M_{\odot}) > 10.5$] bulgeless galaxies contribute to ~30% of the total
galaxy population number density at $z \geq 0.7$, but their number density
drops substantially with decreasing redshift. We show that only a negligible
fraction of pure discs appear to be quiescent systems, and red sequence
bulgeless galaxies show indications of dust-obscured star formation. X-ray
catalogues were used to search for X-ray emission within our sample. After
visual inspection and detailed parametric morphological fitting we identify 30
AGN that reside in galaxies without a classical bulge. The finding of such
peculiar objects at intermediate redshift shows that while AGN growth in
merger-free systems is a rare event (0.2% AGN hosts in this sample of bulgeless
galaxies), it can indeed happen relatively early in the Universe history.

that this is indeed possible via a novel technique that can offer diversity
gain for a single SU using a single antenna. The technique is based on the
usage of a reconfigurable antenna that changes its propagation characteristics

Conceptual challenges such as spectroscopy in the dual approach, as well as
algorithmic developments are discussed and related ideas for systems with

address the strategy of a partial dualization in certain limits, e.g., for
strong coupling and large mass.

Aalen-Johansen estimator. Since the corresponding limit process lacks
independent increments, it is typically applied together with Lin's (1997)
resampling technique involving standard normal multipliers. Recently, it has
been seen that this approach can be interpreted as a wild bootstrap technique
and that other multipliers, as e.g. centered Poissons, may lead to better
finite sample performances, see Beyersmann et al. (2013). Since the latter is
closely related to Efron's classical bootstrap, the question arises whether
this or more general weighted bootstrap versions of Aalen-Johansen processes
lead to valid results. Here we analyze their asymptotic behaviour and it turns
out that such weighted bootstrap versions in general possess the wrong
covariance structure in the limit. However, we explain that the weighted
bootstrap can nevertheless be applied for specific null hypotheses of interest
and also discuss its limitations for statistical inference. To this end, we
introduce different consistent weighted bootstrap tests for the null hypothesis
of stochastically ordered cumulative incidence functions and compare their
finite sample performance in a simulation study.

has been focussed on the discovery of simple physical effects which would
provide a relevant selective advantage to protocells competing with each other
for a limited supply of lipid. In particular, data coming from Szostak's lab
suggest that the transition from simple prebiotically plausible lipid membranes
to more complex and heterogeneous ones, closer to real biomembranes, may have
been driven by changes in the fluidity of the membrane and its affinity for the
available amphiphilic compound, which in turn would involve changes in vesicle
growth dynamics. Earlier work from the same group reported osmotically-driven
competition effects, whereby swelled vesicles grow at the expense of isotonic
ones. In this paper, we try to expand on these experimental studies by
providing a simple mathematical model of a population of competing vesicles,
studied at the level of lipid kinetics. In silico simulations of the model are
able to reproduce qualitatively and often quantitatively the experimentally
reported competition effects in both scenarios. We also develop a method for
numerically solving the equilibrium of a population of competing model
vesicles, which is quite general and applicable to different vesicle kinetics
schemes.

contributions of i) interactions beyond the Standard Model (SM) and of ii) the
left-handed polarisation state of antineutrinos. For this aim we calculate the
branching ratio, probabilities and angular distributions of probabilities of
hydrogen in the hyperfine states and of the proton-electron pair in different
spinorial states, induced by left-handed and right-handed hadronic and leptonic
currents. The branching ratio of the bound-state beta-decay is calculated by
taking into account radiative corrections. We show that the probabilities of
the bound-state beta-decay can be good observables for experimental
investigations of contributions of interactions beyond the SM, whereas the
angular distributions of probabilities are good observables for experimental
searches of contributions of the left-handed polarisation state of
antineutrinos.

colors and sizes similar to those of the compact quiescent galaxies at $z>2$.
By exploring structural parameters and stellar populations, we found that most
of these galaxies actually formed most of their stars at $z<2$ and are
generally less compact than those found at $z > 2$. Several of these young
objects are disk-like or possibly prolate. This lines up with several previous
studies which found that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshifts often
have disk-like morphologies. If these galaxies were to be confirmed to be
disk-like, their formation mechanism must be able to account for both
compactness and disks. On the other hand, if these galaxies were to be
confirmed to be prolate, the fact that prolate galaxies do not exist in the
local universe would indicate that galaxy formation mechanisms have evolved
over cosmic time. We also found five galaxies forming over 80% of their stellar
masses at $z>2$. Three of these galaxies appear to have been modified to have
spheroid-like morphologies, in agreement with the scenario of ""inside-out""
buildup of massive galaxies. The remaining galaxies, SDSS\,J014355.21+133451.4
and SDSS\,J115836.93+021535.1, have truly old stellar populations and disk-like

order to obtain the dynamics of the statistical mean turbulent state. When S3T
is implemented as a coupled set of equations for the streamwise mean and
perturbation states, nonlinearity in the dynamics is restricted to interaction
between the mean and perturbations. The S3T statistical mean state dynamics can
be approximately implemented by similarly restricting the dynamics used in a
direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the full Navier-Stokes equations (referred
to as the NS system). Although this restricted nonlinear system (referred to as
the RNL system) is greatly simplified in its dynamics in comparison to the
associated NS, it nevertheless self-sustains a turbulent state in wall-bounded
shear flow with structures and dynamics comparable to that in observed
turbulence. Moreover, RNL turbulence can be analyzed effectively using
theoretical methods developed to study the closely related S3T system. In order
to better understand RNL turbulence and its relation to NS turbulence, an
extensive comparison is made of diagnostics of structure and dynamics in these
systems. Although quantitative differences are found, the results show that
turbulence in the RNL system closely parallels that in NS and suggest that the
S3T/RNL system provides a promising reduced complexity model for studying
turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows.

$SU(5)\times U(1)^n$ and $E_6$ models are presented as examples. To each
genus-one fibration one can associate a $\tau$-function on the base as well as
an $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ representation which together define the IIB axio-dilaton
and 7-brane content of the theory. The set of genus-one fibrations with the
same $\tau$-function and $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ representation, known as the
Tate-Shafarevich group, supplies an important degree of freedom in the
corresponding F-theory model which has not been studied carefully until now.
  Six-dimensional anomaly cancellation as well as Witten's zero-mode count on
wrapped branes both imply corrections to the usual F-theory dictionary for some
of these models. In particular, neutral hypermultiplets which are localized at
codimension-two fibers can arise. (All previous known examples of localized
hypermultiplets were charged under the gauge group of the theory.) Finally, in
the absence of a section some novel monodromies of Kodaira fibers are allowed

  Laboratory Experiments""",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dust in protoplanetary disks is recognized as the building blocks of planets.
In the core accretion scenario, the abundance of dust in disks (or metallicity)
is crucial for forming cores of gas giants. We present our recent progress on
the relationship between the metallicity and planet formation, wherein planet
formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the critical mass of planetary cores
($M_{c,crit}$) that can initiate gas accretion are statistically examined. We
focus on three different planetary populations that are prominent for observed
exoplanets in the mass-semimajor axis diagram: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters that
are densely populated around 1 AU, and low-mass planets in tight orbits. We
show that the resultant PFFs for both Jovian planets are correlated positively
with the metallicity whereas low-mass planets form efficiently for a wide range
of metallicities. This is consistent with the observed Planet-Metallicity
correlation. Examining the statistically averaged value of $M_{c,crit}$
(defined as $<M_{c,crit}>$), we find that the correlation originates from the
behavior of $<M_{c,crit}>$ that increases steadily with metallicity for two
kinds of the Jovian planets while the low-mass planets obtain a rather constant
value for $<M_{c,crit}>$. Such a difference in $<M_{c,crit}>$ can define
transition metallicities (TMs) above which the Jovian planets gain a larger
value of $<M_{c,crit}>$ than the low-mass planets, and hence gas giant
formation takes place more efficiently. We find that TMs are sensitive to the
important parameter that involves $M_{c,crit}$. We show, by comparing with the
observations, that a most likely value of $M_{c,crit}$ is $\simeq 5M_{\oplus}$,
which is smaller than the conventional value in the literature ($\simeq
10M_{\oplus}$). Our results suggest that opacities in planetary atmospheres
play an important role for lowering $M_{c,crit}$.

regular two-dimensional lattices G that are of the three-terminal type.
Jacobsen and Scullard have defined a graph polynomial P_B(q,v) that gives
access to the critical manifold for general lattices. It depends on a finite
repeating part of the lattice, called the basis B, and its real roots in the
temperature variable v = e^K - 1 provide increasingly accurate approximations
to the critical manifolds upon increasing the size of B. These authors computed
P_B(q,v) for large bases (up to 243 edges), obtaining determinations of the
ferromagnetic critical point v_c > 0 for the (4,8^2), kagome, and (3,12^2)
lattices to a precision (of the order 10^{-8}) slightly superior to that of the
best available Monte Carlo simulations.
  In this paper we describe a more efficient transfer matrix approach to the
computation of P_B(q,v) that relies on a formulation within the periodic
Temperley-Lieb algebra. This makes possible computations for substantially
larger bases (up to 882 edges), and the precision on v_c is hence taken to the
range 10^{-13}. We further show that a large variety of regular lattices can be
cast in a form suitable for this approach. This includes all Archimedean
lattices, their duals and their medials. For all these lattices we tabulate
high-precision estimates of the bond percolation thresholds p_c and Potts
critical points v_c. We also trace and discuss the full Potts critical manifold
in the (q,v) plane, paying special attention to the antiferromagnetic region v
< 0. Finally, we adapt the technique to site percolation as well, and compute
the polynomials P_B(p) for certain Archimedean and dual lattices (those having
only cubic and quartic vertices), using very large bases (up to 243 vertices).
This produces the site percolation thresholds p_c to a precision of the order
10^{-9}.

afterwards. In that case, it was pointed out recently that realizing chiral
fermions in the model is more difficult than it had been thought from formal
arguments at N=infinity and that introduction of a matrix version of the warp
factor is necessary. Based on this new insight, we show that two generations of
the Standard Model fermions can be realized by considering a rather generic
configuration of fuzzy S^2 and fuzzy S^2 * S^2 in the extra dimensions. We also
show that three generations can be obtained by squashing one of the S^2's that
appear in the configuration. Chiral fermions appear at the intersections of the
fuzzy manifolds with nontrivial Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field, which can
be calculated from the overlap of their wave functions.

the fractional Black-Scholes model, which Sottinen constructed by giving an
analogue of the Donsker's theorem. In a binary market the arbitrage condition
can be expressed as a condition on the nodes of a binary tree. We call
""arbitrage points"" the points in the binary tree which verify such an arbitrage
condition and ""arbitrage paths"" the paths in the binary tree which cross at
least one arbitrage point. Using this terminology, a binary market admits
arbitrage if and only if there is at least one arbitrage point in the binary

lines of Sottinen, who showed that the arbitrage persists in the fractional
binary market, we further prove that starting from any point in the tree, we
can reach an arbitrage point. This implies that, in the limit, there is an
infinite number of arbitrage points. Next, we provide an in-depth analysis of
the asymptotic proportion of arbitrage points at asymptotic levels and of
arbitrage paths in the fractional binary market. All these results are obtained
by studying a rescaled disturbed random walk. We moreover show that, when $H$

varying angular offsets from the centre of their host galaxies. To investigate
the properties of short gamma ray burst offsets, a sample of short gamma ray
bursts with host galaxies has been gathered. Two formation channels proposed to
explain the observed offsets of short gamma ray bursts from their host galaxies
are discussed. The classification of short gamma ray bursts into these
formation channels is demonstrated for short gamma ray bursts with host
galaxies. The possibility of faint dwarf galaxies as host environments for the
observed short gamma ray bursts is also investigated. However, by extrapolating
the distribution of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way to redshifts
corresponding to the short gamma ray bursts, we show that it is unlikely that
dwarf galaxies are the hosts of short gamma ray bursts.

equivalence of simplicial rings induces an equivalence on their algebraic

derived from an appropriate representation of the down-scaling that correlates
the microdisplacement field to the macro-displacement field and the
macro-strain tensors involving unknown perturbation functions. These functions
take into account of the effects of the heterogeneities and are obtained by the
solution of properly defined recursive cell problems. Moreover, the
perturbation functions and therefore the micro-displacement fields result to be
sufficiently regular to guarantee the anti-periodicity of the traction on the
periodic unit cell. A generalization of the macro-homogeneity condition is
obtained through an asymptotic expansion of the mean strain energy at the
micro-scale in terms of the microstructural characteristic size e; the obtained
overall elastic moduli result to be not affected by the choice of periodic
cell. The coupling between the macro- and microstress tensor in the periodic
cell is deduced from an application of the generalised macrohomogeneity
condition applied to a representative portion of the heterogeneous material
(cluster of periodic cell). The correlation between the proposed asymptotic
homogenization approach and the computational second-order homogenization
methods is obtained through an approximation of the macrodisplacement field
based on a second-order Taylor expansion. The form of the overall elastic

using a Skyrme model including the ground state vector mesons introduced from
the hidden local symmetry approach up to the next to leading order. We found
that both the $\rho$ and $\omega$ mesons affect the baryonic matter and medium
modified hadron properties dramatically. The most remarkable observation is
that, the pion decay constant and the nucleon mass have the similar density
dependence which agrees with the large $N_c$ argument. Explicitly, they drop
with increasing density in the Skyrmion phase and stop decreasing at
$n_{1/2}^{}$ at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into half-skyrmions
and remains nearly constants in the half-skyrmion phase. This density
dependence in the half-skyrmion phase indicates that, although $\langle
\bar{q}q\rangle \neq 0$ on average in this phase, chiral symmetry is not
restored since hadrons are still massive and there exist pions. In addition,
the nearly constant nucleon mass means that it could has a non-vanishing
component up to the chiral transition, which might shed light on the origin of
the nucleon mass.

with wave dispersion, giving rise to dispersive shock waves (DSWs). Example
systems considered here include magma migration through the mantle as well as
the buoyant ascent of a low density fluid through a viscously deformable
conduit. These flows are modeled by a third-order, degenerate, dispersive,

cross-sectional area, respectively. Whitham averaging theory for step initial
conditions is used to compute analytical, closed form predictions for the DSW
speeds and the leading edge amplitude in terms of the constitutive parameters

backflow and DSW implosion for initial jumps sufficient to cause gradient
catastrophe in the Whitham modulation equations. Theoretical predictions are
shown to be in excellent agreement with long-time numerical simulations for the
case of small to moderate amplitude DSWs. Verifiable criteria identifying the

the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components since.
Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter
(MMF) technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large
volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms
of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo
populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent
of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis
identifies cluster and filaments as the most prominent components of the web.
In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to
underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes.
At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which,
during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present day web is
dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass
transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into
walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the
cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to
find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than
100Mpc/h. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to
form along approximatively straight lines.

We obtain central dust temperatures, $T_0$, in the range 6-12 K and find that,
in the majority of cases, the radial density falloff at large radial distances
is consistent with the $r^{-2}$ variation expected for Bonnor-Ebert spheres.
Two of our cores exhibit a significantly steeper falloff, however, and since
both appear to be gravitationally unstable, such behaviour may have
implications for collapse models. We find a strong negative correlation between
$T_0$ and peak column density, as expected if the dust is heated predominantly
by the interstellar radiation field. At the temperatures we estimate for the
core centres, carbon-bearing molecules freeze out as ice mantles on dust
grains, and this behaviour is supported here by the lack of correspondence
between our estimated core locations and the previously-published positions of
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ peaks. On this basis, our observations suggest a
sublimation-zone radius typically $\sim 10^4$ AU. Comparison with
previously-published N$_2$H$^+$ data at 8400 AU resolution, however, shows no
evidence for N$_2$H$^+$ depletion at that resolution.

system is modulated, particles can be generated out of the quantum vacuum. This
phenomenon is known as the dynamical Casimir effect, and it was recently
realized experimentally in systems of superconducting circuits, for example by
using modulated resonators made of coplanar waveguides, or arrays of
superconducting quantum intereference devices (SQUIDs) forming a Josephson
metamaterial. In this paper, we consider a simple electrical circuit model for
dynamical Casimir effects, consisting of an LC resonator, with the inductor
modulated externally at 10.8 GHz and with the resonant frequency tunable over a
range of $\pm$ 400 MHz around 5.4 GHz. The circuit is analyzed classically
using a circuit simulator (APLAC). We demonstrate that if an additional source
of classical noise couples to the resonator (on top of the quantum vacuum), for
example via dissipative ""internal modes"", then the resulting spectrum of the
photons in the cavity will present two strongly asymmetric branches. However,
according to the theory of the dynamical Casimir effect, these branches should
be symmetric, a prediction which is confirmed by our experimental data. The
simulation presented here therefore shows that the origin of the photons
generated in our experiment with Josephson metamaterials is the quantum vacuum,
and not a spurious classical noise source.

non-magnetic disorder. In the two-dimensional limit however, the quantum
condensate suffers from the effects produced by disorder and electron
correlations which both tend to destroy superconductivity . The recent
discovery of superconductivity in single atomic layers of Pb, the striped
incommensurate (SIC) and $\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$ Pb/Si(111), opened an unique
opportunity to probe the influence of well-identified structural disorder on
two-dimensional superconductivity at the atomic and mesoscopic scale. In these
two ultimate condensates we reveal how the superconducting spectra loose their
conventional character, by mapping the local tunneling density of states. We
report variations of the spectral properties even at scales significantly
shorter than the coherence length. Furthermore, fine structural differences
between the two monolayers, such as their atomic density, lead to very
different superconducting behaviour. The denser SIC remains globally robust to
disorder, as are thicker Pb films, whereas in the slighly more diluted
$\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$ system superconductivity is strongly fragilized. A
consequence of this weakness is revealed at monoatomic steps of
$\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$, which disrupt superconductivity at the atomic scale.
This effect witnesses that each individual step edge is a Josephson barrier. At
a mesoscopic scale the weakly linked superconducting atomic terraces of
$\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$ form a native network of Josephson junctions. We
anticipate the Pb/Si(111) system to offer the unique opportunity to tune the
superconducting coupling between adjacent terraces, paving a new way of
designing atomic scale quantum devices compatible with silicon technology.

apply the method to galaxies in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey with 0.9<z<1.2,

red-sequence from star-forming galaxies, three unusual populations are
identifiable by their unique colours: very dusty star-forming galaxies with
high metallicity and old mean stellar age; post-starburst galaxies which have
formed greater than around 10% of their mass in a recent unsustained starburst
event; and metal-poor quiescent dwarf galaxies. We find that quiescent galaxies
account for 45% of galaxies with log(M*/Msol)>11, declining steadily to 13% at

  in Online Communities",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the more disruptive reforms associated with the modern Internet is the
emergence of online communities working together on knowledge artefacts such as
Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. Recently it has become clear that these
initiatives are vulnerable because of problems with membership turnover. This
study presents a longitudinal analysis of 891 WikiProjects where we model the
impact of member turnover and social capital losses on project productivity. By
examining social capital losses we attempt to provide a more nuanced analysis
of member turnover. In this context social capital is modelled from a social
network perspective where the loss of more central members has more impact. We
find that only a small proportion of WikiProjects are in a relatively healthy
state with low levels of membership turnover and social capital losses. The
results show that the relationship between social capital losses and project
performance is U-shaped, and that member withdrawal has significant negative
effect on project outcomes. The results also support the mediation of turnover
rate and network density on the curvilinear relationship.

existence of a significant drag force acting on the blobs and calculate two

making the drag force only a factor of 0.45-0.75 smaller than the gravitational
force. To obtain a correct determination of electron densities in the blobs, we
also demonstrate how, by combining measurements of total and polarized
brightness, the H$\alpha$ contribution to the white-light emission observed by
the COR1 telescopes can be estimated. This component is significant for
chromospheric plasma, being between 95 and 98 % of the total white-light
emission. Moreover, we demonstrate that the COR1 data can be employed even to
estimate the H$\alpha$ polarized component, which turns out to be in the order
of a few percent of H$\alpha$ total emission from the blobs. If the drag forces
acting on small-scale blobs reported here are similar to those that play a role
during the CME propagation, our results suggest that the magnetic drag should

by as much as $\Delta kT = 0.1 \epsilon$ for clusters with size $i = 100$. We
find that the clusters deviate remarkably from spherical - with ellipsoidal

$a/c = 0.5 \pm 0.05$. We examine cluster spin angular momentum, and find that
it plays a negligible role in the cluster dynamics. The interfaces of large,
stable clusters are thiner than planar equilibrium interfaces by $10-30\%$. At
the critical cluster size, the cluster central densities are between $5-30\%$
lower than the bulk liquid expectations. These lower densities imply
larger-than-expected surface areas, which increase the energy cost to form a

enable targeted genome modifications, there remains a need for new technologies

a new tool for genetic engineering, the pseudocomplementary peptide nucleic
acid nucleases (pcPNANs), which are composed of a pseudocomplementary PNA
(pcPNA) specific for a DNA target sequence, a FokI nuclease cleavage domain and
a nuclear localization signal. pcPNANs may induce targeted DNA double-strand
breaks that activate DNA damage response pathways and enable custom
alterations. Their cleavage-site is determined by simple Watson-Crick rule, and
thus pcPNANs for aimed cleavage of genomes can be straightforwardly designed
and synthesized without any selection procedure. Accordingly, the cleavage-site
and site-specificity are freely chosen by changing the sequences and the
lengths of pcPNA strands. We believe that the potentiality of pcPNAN as a new
tool for genetic engineering will be confirmed in the future.

and the azimuthal version of the magnetorotational instability, as well as of
current-driven kink-type instabilities. Considering the viscous and resistive
setup, our main focus is on the case of small magnetic Prandtl numbers which
applies, e.g., to liquid metal experiments but also to the colder parts of
accretion disks. We show that the inductionless versions of MRI that were
previously thought to be restricted to comparably steep rotation profiles
extend well to the Keplerian case if only the azimuthal field slightly deviates
from its current-free (in the fluid) profile. We find an explicit criterion
separating the pure azimuthal inductionless magnetorotational instability from
the regime where this instability is mixed with the Tayler instability. We
further demonstrate that for particular parameter configurations the azimuthal
MRI originates as a result of a dissipation-induced instability of the
Chandrasekhar's equipartition solution of ideal magnetohydrodynamics.

experiment should have had enough sensitivity to measure it, as predicted by
the Lorentz transformations. However, using the Lorentz transformations to
analyze the results of experiments involving circular motion, while commonly
done, is inappropriate because such an analysis involves non-inertial frames,
which are outside the range of validity of special relativity. In this paper,
we re-analyze Thim's experiment using exact rotational space-time

evolution to reach the remarkable conclusion that large-scale modification,
exchange, and rearrangement of the genome are common and should be viewed as
fundamental features of life. In other words, the genome should be viewed not
as mostly read-only with a few rare mutations, but rather as a fully-fledged
read-write library of genetic functions under continuous revision. Revision of
the genome occurs during cellular replication, during multicellular
development, and during evolution of a population of individuals. DNA
formatting controls the timing and location of genetic rearrangements, gene
expression, and genetic repair. Each of these events is under the control of
precise cellular circuits. Shapiro reviews the toolbox of natural genetic
engineering that provides the functionalities necessary for efficient long-term
genome restructuring.

functional material in a variety of areas like chip cooling, 3D printing or
printed electronics etc. With diverse capabilities in electrical, thermal and
flowing behaviors, such fluid owns many intriguing properties that had never
been anticipated before. Here, we show a group of unconventional phenomena
occurring on the liquid metal objects. Through applying electrical field on the
liquid metals immersed in water, a series of complex transformation behaviors
such as self-assembling of a sheet of liquid metal film into a single sphere,
quick mergences of separate metal droplets, controlled self-rotation and planar
locomotion of liquid metal objects can be realized. Meanwhile, it was also
found that two accompanying water vortexes were induced and reliably swirled
near the rotating liquid metal sphere. Further, effects of the shape, size,
voltage, orientation and geometries of the electrodes to control the liquid
metal transformers were clarified. Such events are hard to achieve otherwise on
rigid metal or conventional liquid spheres. This finding has both fundamental
and practical significances which suggest a generalized way of making smart
soft machine, collecting discrete metal fluids, as well as flexibly
manipulating liquid metal objects including accompanying devices.

was consolidated on the 19th century, the emergence of the special and the
general relativity theories on the 20th century opened possibilities of further
developments, with the search for the unification of the gravitation and the
electromagnetism on a single unified theory. Some attempts to the
geometrization of the electromagnetism emerged in this context, where these
first models resided strictly on a classical basis. Posteriorly, they were
followed by more complete and embracing quantum field theories. The present
work reconsiders the classical viewpoint, with the purpose of showing that at
first order of approximation the electromagnetism constitutes a geometric
structure aside other phenomena as gravitation, and that magnetic monopoles do
not exist at least up to this order of approximation. Even though being
limited, the model is consistent and offers the possibility of an experimental
test of validity.

connection between these recent approaches, that at first sight seemed to have
few or no points in common, using the Mach's principle as the background. In
this way we have used Tsallis formalism to calculate the main parameters of the
Machian Universe including the Hubble parameter and the age of the Universe.
After that, we have also obtained a new value for the Tsallis parameter via
Mach's principle. Using Verlinde's entropic gravity we have obtained new forms
for MOND's well established ingredients. Finally, based on the relations
between particles and bits obtained here, we have discussed the idea of bits
entanglement in the holographic screen.

Alaa","Band-Sweeping M-ary PSK (BS-M-PSK) Modulation and Transceiver Design","To appear in IEEE Potentials Magazine",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Channel Estimation is a major problem encountered by receiver designers for
wireless communications systems. The fading channels encountered by the system
are usually time variant for a mobile receiver. Besides, the frequency response
of the channel is frequency selective for urban environments where the delay
spread is quite large compared to the symbol duration. Estimating the channel
is essential for equalizing the received data and removing the Inter-Symbol
Interference (ISI) resulting from the dispersive channel. Hence, conventional
transceivers insert pilot symbols of known values and detect the changes in it
in order to deduce the channel response. Because these pilots carry no
information, the throughput of the system is reduced. A Novel modulation scheme
is presented in this work. The technique depends on using a carrier signal that
has no fixed frequency, the carrier tone sweeps the band dedicated for
transmission and detects the transfer function gain within the band. A carrier
signal that is Frequency Modulated (FM) by a periodic ramp signal becomes
Amplitude Modulated (AM) by the channel transfer function, and thus, the
receiver obtains an estimate for the channel response without using pilots that
decrease the systems throughput or data rate. The carrier signal itself acts as
a dynamic frequency domain pilot. The technique only works for constant energy
systems, and thus it is applied to PSK transceivers. Mathematical formulation,
transceiver design and performance analysis of the proposed modulation
technique are presented.
