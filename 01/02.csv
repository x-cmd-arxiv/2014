  ""Taxes and the Economy: Government Policies, Macroeconomic Factors and
  Impacts on Consumption and the Environment"" (NOVA Science Publishers)",,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A global agreement on how to reduce and cap human footprint, especially their
GHG emissions, is very unlikely in near future. At the same time, bilateral
agreements would be inefficient because of their neural and balanced nature.
Therefore, unilateral actions would have attracted attention as a practical
option. However, any unilateral action would most likely fail if it is not fair
and also if it is not consistent with the world trade organization's (WTO's)
rules, considering highly heterogeneity of the global economy. The modified GHG
intensity (MGHGINT) indicator, hereafter called Inequality-adjusted
Production-based GHGINT (IPGHGINT), was put forward to address this need in the
form of a universal indicator applicable to every region regardless of its
economic and social status. Nonetheless, the original MGHGINT indicator ignores
hidden consumption-related emissions, and therefore it could be unfair to some
production-oriented regions in the current bipolar production/consumption
world. Here, we propose two generalizations, called Inequality-adjusted
Consumption-based GHGINT (ICGHGINT) and Inequality-adjusted
Production/Consumption-Insensitive GHGINT (IIGHGINT), to the IPGHGINT in order
to combine both production and consumption emissions in a unified and balanced
manner. The impact of this generalizations on the associated border carbon tax
rates is evaluated in order to validate their practicality.

measurement system of space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Arm locking as a proposed frequency
stabilization technique, transfers the stability of the long arm lengths to the
laser frequency. The arm locking sensor synthesizes an adequately filtered
linear combination of the inter-spacecraft phase measurements to estimate the
laser frequency noise, which can be used to control the laser frequency. At the
University of Florida we developed the hardware-based University of Florida
LISA Interferometer Simulator (UFLIS) to study and verify laser frequency noise
reduction and suppression techniques under realistic LISA-like conditions.
These conditions include the variable Doppler shifts between the spacecraft,
LISA-like signal travel times, optical transponders, realistic laser frequency
and timing noise. We review the different types of arm locking sensors and
discuss their expected performance in LISA. The presented results are supported
by results obtained during experimental studies of arm locking under relevant
LISA-like conditions. We measured the noise suppression as well as initial
transients and frequency pulling in the presence of Doppler frequency errors.
This work has demonstrated the validity and \ feasibility of arm locking in
LISA.

of statistical ecology, and in recent years it has become popular due to its
frequent appearance in challenging applications arising in genetics,
bioinformatics, linguistics, designs of experiments, machine learning, etc. A
full range of statistical approaches, parametric and nonparametric as well as
frequentist and Bayesian, has been proposed for estimating discovery
probabilities. In this paper we investigate the relationships between the
celebrated Good-Turing approach, which is a frequentist nonparametric approach
developed in the 1940s, and a Bayesian nonparametric approach recently
introduced in the literature. Specifically, under the assumption of a two
parameter Poisson-Dirichlet prior, we show that Bayesian nonparametric
estimators of discovery probabilities are asymptotically equivalent, for a
large sample size, to suitably smoothed Good-Turing estimators. As a by-product
of this result, we introduce and investigate a methodology for deriving exact
and asymptotic credible intervals to be associated with the Bayesian
nonparametric estimators of discovery probabilities. The proposed methodology
is illustrated through a comprehensive simulation study and the analysis of
Expressed Sequence Tags data generated by sequencing a benchmark complementary
DNA library.

electron and nuclear dynamics, via reconstruction of a propagator that
quantifies the time evolution of a system. There is now growing interest in
applying such methods to very low energy excitations, such as lattice
vibrations, but in this limit the cross section is no longer proportional to a
propagator. Significant deviations occur due to the finite temperature Bose
statistics of the excitations. Here we consider this issue in the context of
high-resolution electron energy loss experiments on the copper-oxide
superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$. We find that simple division of a
Bose factor yields an accurate propagator on energy scales greater than the
resolution width. However, at low energy scales, the effects of resolution and
finite temperature conspire to create anomalies in the dynamics at long times.
We compare two practical ways for dealing with such anomalies, and discuss the
range of validity of the technique in light of this comparison.

both thermal absorption and nonthermal emission in the (10,8) and (9,8)

maser is observed to increase in intensity by 40% over six months. Using
interferometric observations with a synthesized beam of 0.25"", we find that the
(10,8) and (9,8) masers originate at the same sky position near IRS1. With
strong evidence that the (10,8) and (9,8) masers arise in the same volume, we
discuss the application of pumping models for the simultaneous excitation of
nonmetastable (J > K) para-ammonia states having the same value of K and
consecutive values of J. We also present detections of thermal absorption in
rotational states ranging in energy from E/k_B ~ 200 K to 2000 K, and several
non-detections in higher-energy states. In particular, we describe the
populations in eight adjacent rotational states with K=6, including two maser
transitions, along with the implications for ortho-ammonia pumping models. An
existing torus model for molecular gas in the environment of IRS1 has been
applied to the masers; a variety of maser species are shown to agree with the
model. Historical and new interferometric observations of 15NH3 (3,3) masers in
the region indicate a precession of the rotating torus at a rate comparable to
continuum-emission-based models of the region. We discuss the general necessity
of interferometric observations for diagnosing the excitation state of the
masers and for determining the geometry of the molecular environment.

aim at resumming the high-energy (next-to-)leading logarithms appearing in QCD
perturbative series. However, the standard derivations of those equations are
performed in a strict high-energy limit, whereas such equations are then
applied to scattering processes at large but finite energies. For that reason,
there is typically a slight mismatch between the leading logs resummed by those
evolution equations without finite-energy corrections and the leading logs
actually present in the perturbative expansion of any observable. That mismatch
is one of the sources of large corrections at NLO and NLL accuracy. In the case
of the BFKL equation in momentum space, that problem is solved by including a
kinematical constraint in the kernel, which is the most important finite-energy
correction. In this paper, such an improvement of kinematics is performed in
mixed-space (transverse positions and $k^+$) and with a factorization scheme in
the light-cone momentum $k^+$ (in a frame in which the projectile is
right-moving and the target left-moving). This is the usual choice of variables
and factorization scheme for the the BK equation. A kinematically improved
version of the BK equation is provided, consistent at finite energies. The
results presented here are also a necessary step towards having the high energy

in one of the geometries permitted by the no-hair theorem. During that

theoretically constructed from the black hole quasinormal frequencies (which
govern its oscillating behavior and its decay) and from the associated
excitation factors (which determine intrinsically its amplitude) by carefully
taking into account the source of the distortion. Here, by considering the
Schwarzschild black hole in the framework of massive gravity, we show that the
excitation factors have an unexpected strong resonant behavior leading to giant
ringings which are, moreover, slowly decaying. Such extraordinary black hole
ringings could be observed by the next generations of gravitational wave
detectors and allow us to test the various massive gravity theories or their
absence could be used to impose strong constraints on the graviton mass.

particular, we study the independently randomized Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy
and the dependently randomized Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, which were first
introduced in the author's joint work with Staffilani \cite{SoSt}. For these
hierarchies, we construct local-in-time low-regularity solutions in spaces
which contain a random component. The constructed density matrices will solve
the full randomized hierarchies, thus extending the results from \cite{SoSt},
where solutions solving arbitrarily long subhierarchies were given.
  Our analysis will be based on the truncation argument which was first used in
the deterministic setting in the work of T. Chen and Pavlovi\'{c} \cite{CP4}.
The presence of randomization in the problem adds additional difficulties, most
notably to estimating the Duhamel expansions that are crucial in the truncation
argument. These difficulties are overcome by a detailed analysis of the Duhamel
expansions. In the independently randomized case, we need to keep track of
which randomization parameters appear in the Duhamel terms, whereas in the
dependently randomized case, we express the Duhamel terms directly in terms of
the initial data. In both cases, we can obtain stronger results with respect to
the time variable if we assume additional regularity on the initial data.

flat space-time condition is imposed with constraints derived from null Killing
vectors. Solutions to a straightforward regularization of these constraints
have diverging length and volume expectation values. Physically acceptable
solutions in the kinematic Hilbert space are obtained from the original
constraint by multiplying with a power of the volume operator and by a similar
modification of the Hamiltonian constraint, which is used in a regularization
of the constraints. The solutions of the modified Killing constraint have
finite expectation values of geometric quantities. Further, the expectation
value of the original Killing constraint vanishes, but its moment is
non-vanishing. As the power of the volume grows the moment of the original
constraint grows, while the moments of volume and length both decrease. Thus,
these states provide possible kinematic states for flat space, with
fluctuations. As a consequence of the regularization of operators the quantum
uncertainty relations between geometric quantities such as length and its
conjugate momentum do not reflect naive expectations from the classical Poisson

galaxy clusters which would be a scientifically important area of research for
an upcoming Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey. The survey would provide a
major contribution in three key areas of the physics of clusters: 1) the active
galactic nucleus population and the impact of feedback on the evolution of the
intra-cluster medium, 2) the origin and evolution of diffuse cluster radio
sources to probe the physics of mergers with implications for cosmology, and 3)
the origin and role of magnetic fields in the ICM and in large scale
structures. Considering all three areas, a survey must have sufficient spatial
resolution to study the tailed galaxies which trace the cluster weather as well
as the radio lobes driving energy into the cluster from the central AGN. The
survey must also have sensitivity to low surface brightness emission and large
angular scales to probe radio halos and relics as well as the WHIM residing in
the large scale structure filaments. Finally, we note that full polarization
information would be a highly valuable tool to probe a number of
cluster-related issues. Due to the general steep spectral index of the emission
we consider the survey is best suited to this science when conducted in P, L,
or S bands. We conclude that the choices of S Band + D Configuration, L Band +
C Configuration, and P Band + B Configuration offer optimal resolutions for
constraining galactic interactions and feedback in cluster environments, while
still probing large scale structure and the bulk cluster environment itself.
While the push to probe higher redshifts and lower mass limits strongly favors
a narrow and deep (or even targeted) survey strategy, we note that a wide
survey covering roughly 1/4-2/3 of the sky will have significant scientific
return, discovery potential, and archival value.

Updated figure from last version",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slu030",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The double-detonation explosion scenario of Type Ia supernovae has gained
increased support from the SN Ia community as a viable progenitor model, making
it a promising candidate alongside the well-known single degenerate and double
degenerate scenarios. We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which
a sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically
from a helium-rich companion. One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN
rates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich
matter. Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of
accretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. In addition, we test
how the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a
detonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case
(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion
prescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<
0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations. If more massive (0.1
Msun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time
distribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe
with prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced. Since theoretical arguments
favour low-mass He shells for normal double-detonation SNe, we conclude that
the rates from double-detonations are likely to be high, and should not
critically depend on the adopted prescription for accretion of He.

parallel efficiency, etc. Previous work focuses on coarse-grained scheduling.
This study concerns fine-grained scheduling on MapReduce operations. Each
operation represents one invocation of the Map or Reduce function. Scheduling
MapReduce operations is difficult due to highly screwed operation loads, no
support to collect workload statistics, and high complexity of the scheduling
problem. So current implementations adopt simple strategies, leading to poor
load balance. To address these difficulties, we design an algorithm to schedule
operations based on the key distribution of intermediate pairs. The algorithm
involves a sub-program for selecting operations for task slots, and we name it
the Balanced Subset Sum (BSS) problem. We discuss properties of BSS and design
exact and approximation algorithms for it. To transparently incorporate these
algorithms into MapReduce, we design a communication mechanism to collect
statistics, and a pipeline within Reduce tasks to increase resource
utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on scheduling
MapReduce workload at this fine-grained level. Experiments on PUMA [T+12]
benchmarks show consistent performance improvement. The job duration can be
reduced by up to 37%, compared with standard MapReduce.

kernel satisfies Gaussian upper and lower bounds. Moreover, $S$ is
conservative, i.e.\ $S_t\one=\one$ for all $t>0$. Our aim is to examine
converse statements.
  First we establish that $C$ is strongly elliptic if and only if $h$ is
closable, the semigroup $S$ is conservative and $K$ satisfies Gaussian bounds.
Secondly, we prove that if the coefficients are such that a Tikhonov growth
condition is satisfied then $S$ is conservative. Thus in this case strong
ellipticity of $C$ is equivalent to closability of $h$ together with Gaussian
bounds on $K$. Finally we consider coefficients $c_{ij}\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm
loc}(\Ri^d)$. It follows that $h$ is closable and a growth condition of the
T\""acklind type is sufficient to establish the equivalence of strong
ellipticity of $C$ and Gaussian bounds on $K$.

However, classical GP inference suffers from high computational cost for big
data. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian approach, EigenGP, that learns
both basis dictionary elements--eigenfunctions of a GP prior--and prior
precisions in a sparse finite model. It is well known that, among all
orthogonal basis functions, eigenfunctions can provide the most compact
representation. Unlike other sparse Bayesian finite models where the basis
function has a fixed form, our eigenfunctions live in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space as a finite linear combination of kernel functions. We learn the
dictionary elements--eigenfunctions--and the prior precisions over these
elements as well as all the other hyperparameters from data by maximizing the
model marginal likelihood. We explore computational linear algebra to simplify
the gradient computation significantly. Our experimental results demonstrate
improved predictive performance of EigenGP over alternative sparse GP methods
as well as relevance vector machine.

describe a procedure to quantitatively compare different crowd models or

distributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation
time, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and
(6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise
matrix of statistical distances between the three models. Projecting the three
models onto the first two principal components of the compromise matrix, we
find the lattice gas and RVO2 models are similar in terms of the evacuation
time, passage density, and flow rates, whereas the social force and RVO2 models
are similar in terms of the total distance traveled. Most importantly, we find
that the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from

key test between different models, and also between models and the real world.
Finally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency
evacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force

Grunwald--Wang Theorem, which asserts that given a family of local characters
$\chi^{v}$ of $K_{v}^{*}$ of exponent $m$ where $v \in S$ for a finite set $S$
of primes of $K$, there exists a global character $\chi$ of the idele class
group $C_{K}$ of exponent $m$ (unless some special case occurs, when it is $2
m$) whose component at $v$ is $\chi^{v}$. The effectiveness problem for this
theorem is to bound the norm $N (\chi)$ of the conductor of $\chi$ in terms of
$K$, $m$, $S$ and $N (\chi^{v})$.
  The Kummer case (when $K$ contains $\mu_{m}$) is easy since it is almost an
application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this note, we solve this
problem completely in general case, and give three versions of bound, one is
with \GRH, and the other two are unconditional bounds.
  These effective results have some interesting applications in concrete
situations. To give a simple example, if we fix $p$ and $l$, one gets a good
least upper bound for $N$ such that $p$ is not an $l$--th power mod $N$. One
also gets the least upper bound for $N$ such that $l^{r} \mid \phi (N)$ and $p$
is not an $l$--th power mod $N$.

the central supermassive black hole reaches the mass set by the $M - \sigma$
relation, and may be what makes galaxies become red and dead. Despite their
high velocities, which imply temperatures far above those necessary for
molecule dissociation, the outflows contain large amounts of molecular gas. To
understand this surprising result, we investigate the gas cooling and show that
the outflows cannot stably persist in high--temperature states. Instead the
outflowing gas forms a two--phase medium, with cold dense molecular clumps
mixed with hot tenuous gas, as observed. We also show that efficient cooling
leads to star formation, providing an observable outflow signature. The central
parts of the outflows can be intrinsically luminous gamma--ray sources,
provided that the central black hole is still strongly accreting. We note also
that these outflows can persist for $\sim 10^8$~yr after the central AGN has
turned off, so that many observed outflows (particularly with high speeds)
otherwise assumed to be driven by starbursts might also be of this type.

training and classification. Training mode involves normalization of the face

surrounded by circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion of
mass. The accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed
to power the mass outflows, which may in turn have a significant role in
removing the excess angular momentum from the star-disk system. Although the
process of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of its
mechanisms are still to be fully understood. On the other hand, strong flaring
activity is a common feature of young stellar objects (YSOs). In the Sun, such
events give rise to perturbations of the interplanetary medium. Similar but
more energetic phenomena occur in YSOs and may influence the circumstellar
environment. In fact, a recent study has shown that an intense flaring activity
close to the disk may strongly perturb the stability of circumstellar disks,
thus inducing mass accretion episodes (Orlando et al. 2011). Here we review the
main results obtained in the field and the future perspectives.

W1-W2 = 0.65$\pm$0.05) of ULAS J222711-004547 makes it one of the reddest brown
dwarfs discovered so far. We obtained a moderate resolution spectrum of this
target, and classify it as L7pec, confirming its very red nature. Comparison to
theoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity L dwarf with
a solar or higher than solar metallicity. Nonetheless, the match of such fits
to the spectrum is rather poor and this and other peculiar red L dwarfs pose
new challenges for the modeling of ultracool atmospheres. We determined the
proper motion of ULAS J222711-004547 using the data available in the
literature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any of
the known young associations. We show that applying a simple de-reddening curve
to its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the L7 spectroscopic
standards. Given the negligible interstellar reddening of the field containing
our target, we conclude that the reddening of the spectrum is mostly due to an
excess of dust in the photosphere of the target. De-reddening the spectrum
using extinction curves for different dust species gives surprisingly good
results and suggests a characteristic grain size of $\sim$0.5 $\mu$m. We show
that by increasing the optical depth, the same extinction curves allow the
spectrum of ULAS J222711-004547 to resemble the spectra of unusually blue L
dwarfs and slightly metal-poor L dwarfs. Grains of similar size yield very good
fits when de-reddening other unusually red L dwarfs in the L5 to L7.5 range.
These results suggest that the diversity in near infrared colours and spectra
seen in late-L dwarfs could be due to differences in the optical thickness of
the dust cloud deck.

This involves the notion of robust expansion, a recent concept which has
already been used successfully to settle several longstanding problems. Roughly
speaking, a graph is robustly expanding if it still expands after the deletion
of a small fraction of its vertices and edges. Our main result allows us to
harness the useful consequences of robust expansion even if the graph itself is
not a robust expander. It states that every dense regular graph can be
partitioned into `robust components', each of which is a robust expander or a
bipartite robust expander. We apply our result to obtain (amongst others) the
following. (i) We prove that whenever $\eps >0$, every sufficiently large
3-connected D-regular graph on n vertices with $D \geq (1/4 + \eps)n$ is

zero-forcing detection (ZF), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis for Rician
fading involves the cumbersome noncentral-Wishart distribution (NCWD) of the
transmit sample-correlation (Gramian) matrix. An \textsl{approximation} with a
\textsl{virtual} CWD previously yielded for the ZF SNR an approximate (virtual)
Gamma distribution. However, analytical conditions qualifying the accuracy of
the SNR-distribution approximation were unknown. Therefore, we have been
attempting to exactly characterize ZF SNR for Rician fading. Our previous
attempts succeeded only for the sole Rician-fading stream under
Rician--Rayleigh fading, by writing it as scalar Schur complement (SC) in the
Gramian. Herein, we pursue a more general, matrix-SC-based analysis to
characterize SNRs when several streams may undergo Rician fading. On one hand,
for full-Rician fading, the SC distribution is found to be exactly a CWD if and
only if a channel-mean--correlation \textsl{condition} holds. Interestingly,
this CWD then coincides with the \textsl{virtual} CWD ensuing from the
\textsl{approximation}. Thus, under the \textsl{condition}, the actual and
virtual SNR-distributions coincide. On the other hand, for Rician--Rayleigh
fading, the matrix-SC distribution is characterized in terms of determinant of
matrix with elementary-function entries, which also yields a new
characterization of the ZF SNR. Average error probability results validate our
analysis vs.~simulation.

low complexity scheduling policy that maximizes total throughput of the data
backlogged system using the harvested energy, for all types (uniform,
non-uniform, independent, correlated (i.e. Markovian), etc.) EH processes.
Energy is assumed to be stored losslessly in the nodes batteries, up to a
storage capacity (the infinite capacity case is also considered.) The problem
is treated in finite and infinite problem horizons. A low-complexity policy,
UROP (Uniformizing Random Ordered Policy) is proposed, whose near optimality is
shown. Numerical examples indicate that under a reasonable-sized battery
capacity, UROP uses the arriving energy with almost perfect efficiency. As the

supersymmetric transformations is reviewed. We first revisit in a pedagogical
way the single-channel case, where the supersymmetric approach is shown to
provide a complete solution to the inverse-scattering problem. A special
emphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative
transformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a
non-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative
transformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion
of the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then
summarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress
remaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel
examples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple
as possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the
equal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds,
conservative transformations can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering
matrices. Iterations of such transformations are shown to lead to practical
algorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is
fitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs
of conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D
scattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are
constructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem
to be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a
single non-conservative transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials
starting from the zero potential and is a promising first step towards a full
solution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold differences.

procedure is presented for deciding the unification problem modulo this rewrite
system. The procedure is modular in the following sense: any given problem is
handled by a system of `list-inferences', and the set of equations thus derived
between the element-terms of the problem is then handed over to any
(`black-box') procedure which is complete for solving these element-equations.
An example of application of this unification procedure is given, as attack
detection on a Needham-Schroeder like protocol, employing the CBC encryption

Gradient Navigation Model. The model uses a superposition of gradients of
distance functions to directly change the direction of the velocity vector. The
velocity is then integrated to obtain the location. The approach differs
fundamentally from force based models needing only three equations to derive
the ODE system, as opposed to four in, e.g., the Social Force Model. Also, as a
result, pedestrians are no longer subject to inertia. Several other advantages
ensue: Model induced oscillations are avoided completely since no actual forces
are present. The derivatives in the equations of motion are smooth and
therefore allow the use of fast and accurate high order numerical integrators.
At the same time, existence and uniqueness of the solution to the ODE system
follow almost directly from the smoothness properties. In addition, we
introduce a method to calibrate parameters by theoretical arguments based on
empirically validated assumptions rather than by numerical tests. These
parameters, combined with the accurate integration, yield simulation results
with no collisions of pedestrians. Several empirically observed system
phenomena emerge without the need to recalibrate the parameter set for each
scenario: obstacle avoidance, lane formation, stop-and-go waves and congestion
at bottlenecks. The density evolution in the latter is shown to be
quantitatively close to controlled experiments. Likewise, we observe a
dependence of the crowd velocity on the local density that compares well with
benchmark fundamental diagrams.

a novel distance metric based on local subgraph characteristics and which is
