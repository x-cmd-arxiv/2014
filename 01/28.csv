merely an existence of a density function for the conditional law of the random

unitary representation (minrep) of the conformal group SO(6,2). This minrep
admits a family of deformations labelled by the spin t of an SU(2)_T group,
which is the 6d analog of helicity in four dimensions. These deformations of
the minrep of SO(6,2) describe massless conformal fields that are symmetric
tensors in the spinorial representation of the 6d Lorentz group. The minrep and
its deformations were obtained by quantization of the nonlinear realization of
SO(6,2) as a quasiconformal group in arXiv:1005.3580. We give a novel
reformulation of the generators of SO(6,2) for these representations as
bilinears of deformed twistorial oscillators which transform nonlinearly under
the Lorentz group SO(5,1) and apply them to define higher spin algebras and
superalgebras in AdS_7. The higher spin (HS) algebra of Fradkin-Vasiliev type
in AdS_7 is simply the enveloping algebra of SO(6,2) quotiented by a two-sided
ideal (Joseph ideal) which annihilates the minrep. We show that the Joseph
ideal vanishes identically for the quasiconformal realization of the minrep and
its enveloping algebra leads directly to the HS algebra in AdS_7. Furthermore,
the enveloping algebras of the deformations of the minrep define a discrete
infinite family of HS algebras in AdS_7 for which certain 6d Lorentz covariant
deformations of the Joseph ideal vanish identically. These results extend to

superalgebras as enveloping algebras of the minimal unitary supermultiplet and
its deformations. Our results suggest the existence of a discrete family of
(supersymmetric) HS theories in AdS_7 which are dual to free (super)conformal
field theories (CFTs) or to interacting but integrable (supersymmetric) CFTs in

To help them search efficiently, researchers have proposed novel tools that
apply state-of-the-art information retrieval algorithms to retrieve relevant
code snippets from the local codebase. However, these tools still rely on the
developer to craft an effective query, which requires that the developer is
familiar with the terms contained in the related code snippets. Our empirical
data from a state-of-the-art local code search tool, called Sando, suggests
that developers are sometimes unacquainted with their local codebase. In order
to bridge the gap between developers and their ever-increasing local codebase,
in this paper we demonstrate the recommendation techniques integrated in Sando.

has introduced a manageable notion of subanalytic sets of the unit polydisc.
This class contains the class of affinoid sets and is stable under projection.
We associate to a subanalytic set its counterpart in the Berkovich polydisc.
This allows us to give a new insight to the dimension of subanalytic sets using
the degrees of the completed residual fields. With these methods we obtain new
results, such as the invariance of the dimension under subanalytic bijection in
any characteristic. Then we study more generally subsets $S$ of $K^m\times
\Gamma^n$ and of $K^m\times \Gamma^n \times k^p$ where $\Gamma$ is the value
group and $k$ the residue field. We allow $S$ to be either definable in ACVF,
or definable in the analytic language of L. Lipshitz. We define a dimension for
such sets $S$. In the case when $S \subset K^n$ (resp. $S\subset \Gamma^n$,
$S\subset k^n$), it coincides with the above dimension (resp. the o-minimal
dimension, the Zariski dimension). We prove that this dimension is invariant
under definable bijection and decreases under projection. This allows us to
generalize previous results on tropicalization of Berkovich spaces and to place
them in a general framework.

Nevertheless it is known that protocols such as coherent state merging are
efficiently achievable at optimal rate. We aim to investigate this fact further
in a general one-shot setting, by considering certain classes of decoupling
theorems and give exact rates for these classes. Moreover we compare results of
general decoupling theorems using Haar distributed unitaries with those using
smaller sets of operators, in particular $\epsilon$-approximate 2-designs. We

tool for predicting uncompensated optical coherent transmission system
performance, in realistic scenarios. For this specific use, the GN-model has
enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental. Recently,
however, it has been pointed out that its predictions, when used to obtain a
detailed picture of non-linear interference (NLI) noise accumulation along a
link, may be affected by a substantial NLI overestimation error, especially in
the first spans of the link. In this paper we analyze in detail the GN-model
errors. We discuss recently proposed formulas for correcting such errors and
show that they neglect several contributions to NLI, so that they may
substantially underestimate NLI in specific situations, especially over
low-dispersion fibers. We derive a complete set of formulas accounting for all
single, cross, and multi-channel effects, this set constitutes what we have
called the enhanced GN-model (EGN-model). We extensively validate the EGN model
by comparison with accurate simulations in several different system scenarios.
The overall EGN model accuracy is found to be very good when assessing detailed
span-by-span NLI accumulation and excellent when estimating realistic system
maximum reach. The computational complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs of the
various versions of the GN and EGN models are extensively discussed.

stars. To this purpose, assuming a one spot dominant model for the stellar
photosphere, we develop a mixed observational-theoretical tool to extract the
spot's parameters from the observed optical spectrum. This method relies on a
robust library of spectral M templates, which we derive using the observed
spectra of quiet M dwarfs in the SDSS database. Our procedure allows to correct
the observed spectra for photospheric activity in most of the analyzed cases,
reducing the spectral distortion down to the noise levels. Ongoing refinements

is presented; this work is a companion of the experimental efforts by Sadik et
al. [1]. Both membrane permeabilization and delivery are examined with respect
to six extra-cellular conductivities. The transmembrane potential of the
permeabilized regions exhibits a consistent value, which corresponds to a
bifurcation point in the pore-radius-potential relation. Both the pore area
density and membrane conductance increase with an increasing extra-cellular
conductivity. On the other hand, the inverse correlation between propidium
iodide delivery and extra-cellular conductivity as observed in the experiments
is quantitatively captured by the model. This agreement confirms that this
behavior is primarily mediated by electrophoretic transport during the pulse.
The results suggest that electrophoresis is important even for the delivery of
small molecules such as propidium iodide. The direct comparison between model
prediction and experimental data presented in this work helps validate the
former as a robust predictive tool for the study of electroporation.

into classical information and purely quantum correlations, to be later
reconstructed onto a second system that has never directly interacted with the

information science due to its essential role in several important tasks such
as the long-distance transmission of quantum information using quantum
repeaters. In this context, a challenge of paramount importance is the
distribution of entanglement between remote nodes, and to use this entanglement
as a resource for long-distance light-to-matter quantum teleportation. Here we
demonstrate quantum teleportation of the polarization state of a
telecom-wavelength photon onto the state of a solid-state quantum memory.
Entanglement is established between a rare-earth-ion doped crystal storing a
single photon that is polarization-entangled with a flying telecom-wavelength
photon. The latter is jointly measured with another flying qubit carrying the
polarization state to be teleported, which heralds the teleportation. The
fidelity of the polarization state of the photon retrieved from the memory is
shown to be greater than the maximum fidelity achievable without entanglement,
even when the combined distances travelled by the two flying qubits is 25 km of
standard optical fibre. This light-to-matter teleportation channel paves the
way towards long-distance implementations of quantum networks with solid-state

asymptotic analysis of a Bhattacharya based upper bound on the
misclassification probability for the optimal Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP)
classifier that depends on quantities that are dual to the concepts of
diversity-order and coding gain in multi-antenna communications. The
diversity-order of the measurement system determines the rate at which the
probability of misclassification decays with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the
low-noise regime. The counterpart of coding gain is the measurement gain which
determines the power offset of the probability of misclassification in the
low-noise regime. These two quantities make it possible to quantify differences
in misclassification probability between random measurement and
(diversity-order) optimized measurement. Results are presented for two-class
classification problems first with zero-mean Gaussians then with nonzero-mean
Gaussians, and finally for multiple-class Gaussian classification problems. The
behavior of misclassification probability is revealed to be intimately related
to certain fundamental geometric quantities determined by the measurement
system, the source and their interplay. Numerical results, representative of
compressive classification of a mixture of Gaussians, demonstrate alignment of
the actual misclassification probability with the Bhattacharya based upper
bound. The connection between the misclassification performance and the
alignment between source and measurement geometry may be used to guide the
design of dictionaries for compressive classification.

Previous X-ray studies of its post-outburst rotational evolution yielded
inconsistent measurements of the spin-inferred magnetic field. Here we present
the timing behavior and flux relaxation from over two years of Swift, XTE, and
Chandra observations following the outburst. We find that the ambiguity in
previous timing solutions was due to enhanced spin down that resembles an
exponential recovery following a glitch at the outburst onset. After fitting
out the effects of the recovery, we measure a long-term spin-down rate of
$\dot\nu=(-3.0\pm0.3)\times10^{-8}$ s$^{-2}$ which implies a dipolar magnetic
field of $1.35\times10^{13}$ G, lower than all previous estimates for this
source. We also consider the post-outburst flux evolution, and fit it with both
empirical and crustal cooling models. We discuss the flux relaxation in the

magnetised, Maxwellian, homogeneous and inhomogeneous background plasma. The
electron distribution function was unstable to the beam-plasma instability and
was shown to generate Langmuir waves, while relaxing to plateau formation. In
order to estimate the role of the background density gradient on an unbound

a uniform density background; b) a weak density gradient, n_R/n_L=3; c) a
strong gradient case, n_R/n_L=10, where n_R and n_L denote background electron
densities on the left and right edges of the simulation box respectively. The
strong gradient case produced the largest fraction of electrons beyond 15 v_th.
Further, two cases (uniform and strong gradient background) with spatially
localized beam injections were performed aiming to show drifts of the generated
Langmuir wave wavenumbers, as suggested in previous studies. For the strong

limited-feedback constant-envelope beamforming or noncoherent $M$-ary

fixed-rank positive semidefinite quadratic form over the $M$PSK alphabet. This
form is a special case of the Rayleigh quotient of a matrix and, in general,
its maximization by an $M$PSK sequence is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard. However, if the
rank of the matrix is not a function of its size, then the optimal solution can
be computed with polynomial complexity in the matrix size. In this work, we
develop a new technique to efficiently solve this problem by utilizing
auxiliary continuous-valued angles and partitioning the resulting continuous
space of solutions into a polynomial-size set of regions, each of which
corresponds to a distinct $M$PSK sequence. The sequence that maximizes the
Rayleigh quotient is shown to belong to this polynomial-size set of sequences,
thus efficiently reducing the size of the feasible set from exponential to
polynomial. Based on this analysis, we also develop an algorithm that
constructs this set in polynomial time and show that it is fully
parallelizable, memory efficient, and rank scalable. The proposed algorithm
compares favorably with other solvers for this problem that have appeared

disks with a diameter of 150-180 AU in L1527-IRS and VLA1623A, but it is not
clear if such disks are common in Class 0 protostars. Here we present
high-angular-resolution observations of two methanol lines in NGC1333-IRAS2A.
We argue that these lines probe the inner envelope, and we use them to study
the kinematics of this region. Our observations suggest the presence of a
marginal velocity gradient normal to the direction of the outflow. However, the
position velocity diagrams along the gradient direction appear inconsistent
with a Keplerian disk. Instead, we suggest that the emission originates from
the infalling and perhaps slowly rotating envelope, around a central protostar
of 0.1-0.2 M$_\odot$. If a disk is present, it is smaller than the disk of
L1527-IRS, perhaps suggesting that NGC1333-IRAS2A is younger.

COM emission lines trace an embedded disk, shocks from the protostellar jet, or
the warm inner parts of the protostellar envelope. In the framework of the
CALYPSO (Continuum And Lines in Young ProtoStellar Objects) IRAM Plateau de
Bure survey, we obtained large bandwidth spectra at sub-arcsecond resolution
towards NGC 1333-IRAS2A. We identify the emission lines towards the central
protostar and perform Gaussian fits to constrain the size of the emitting
region for each of these lines, tracing various physical conditions and scales.
The emission of numerous COMs such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and methyl
formate is spatially resolved by our observations. This allows us to measure,
for the first time, the size of the COM emission inside the protostellar
envelope, finding that it originates from a region of radius 40-100 AU,
centered on the NGC 1333-IRAS2A protostellar object. Our analysis shows no
preferential elongation of the COM emission along the jet axis, and therefore
does not support the hypothesis that COM emission arises from shocked envelope
material at the base of the jet. Down to similar sizes, the dust continuum
emission is well reproduced with a single envelope model, and therefore does
not favor the hypothesis that COM emission arises from the thermal sublimation
of grains embedded in a circumstellar disk. Finally, the typical scale $\sim$60
AU observed for COM emission is consistent with the size of the inner envelope
where $T_{\rm{dust}} > 100$ K is expected. Our data therefore strongly suggest
that the COM emission traces the hot corino in IRAS2A, i.e., the warm inner
envelope material where the icy mantles of dust grains evaporate because they
are passively heated by the central protostellar object.

surveillance systems to perform monitoring by acquiring and sending information
on any intrusion in a secured area. Requirement of very little human
intervention is one of the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a
cheaper and safer alternative for securing large areas such as international
borders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among
the sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming
attacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome
this problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be
able to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the
network are known to them. It is also desirable to keep the interactions of the
sensor nodes in the network minimal, as they are low powered devices and need
to conserve their resources. In this paper we propose a light-weight technique
for faster mapping of the jammed regions. We minimize the load on the sensors
by removing the actual responsibility of mapping from the network to the
central base station (BS). After a few nodes report to the BS, it carries out
the task of mapping of the jammed regions in the network. We use our simulation
results to compare our proposed system with the existing techniques and also to
measure the performance of our system. Our results show that the jammed regions

solution for ideal fluid, including the case when the pressure to energy
density ratio $w$ has a jump. Two classes of solutions are explored in detail,
solutions with radiation-like solid ($w = 1/3$) and solutions with stiff solid
($w > 1/3$) appearing in a universe filled with radiation. For radiation-like
solid, an almost flat spectrum of large-scale perturbations is obtained only if
the shear stress to energy density ratio $\xi$ is close to zero, $|\xi|
\lesssim 10^{-5}$. For a solid with stiff equation of state, large-scale
perturbations are enhanced for $\xi$ negative and suppressed for $\xi$
positive. If the solid dominated the dynamics of the universe long enough,
perturbations could end up suppressed as much as by several orders of
magnitude, and in order that the inclination of the large-scale spectrum is
consistent with observations, radiation must have prevailed over the solid long
enough before recombination. In Newtonian gauge, corrections to metric and
energy density are typically much greater than 1 in the first period after the
shear stress appears, but the linearized theory is still applicable because the
corrections stay small when one uses the proper-time comoving gauge.

their natal clouds. These clouds are threaded by magnetic fields with a
strength characterized by the plasma beta---the ratio of thermal and magnetic
pressures. Observations show molecular clouds have beta <= 1, so magnetic
fields can play a significant role in the accretion process. We have carried
out a numerical study of the effect of large-scale magnetic fields on the rate
of accretion onto a uniformly moving point particle from a uniform,
non-self-gravitating, isothermal gas. We consider gas moving with sonic Mach
numbers of up M ~ 45, magnetic fields that are either parallel, perpendicular,
or oriented 45 degrees to the flow, and beta as low as 0.01. Our simulations
utilize AMR to obtain high spatial resolution where needed; this also allows
the simulation boundaries to be far from the accreting object. Additionally, we
show our results are independent of our exact prescription for accreting mass
in the sink particle. We give simple expressions for the steady-state accretion
rate as a function of beta, M, and field orientation. Using typical molecular
clouds values of M ~ 5 and beta ~ 0.04 from the literature, our fits suggest a
0.4 M_Sun star accretes ~ 4*10^{-9} M_Sun/year, almost a factor of two less
than accretion rates predicted by hydrodynamic models. This disparity grows to
orders of magnitude for stronger fields and lower Mach numbers. We discuss the
applicability of these accretion rates versus accretion rates expected from
gravitational collapse, and when a steady state is possible. This reduction in
Mdot increases the time required to form stars in competitive accretion models,
making such models less efficient. In numerical codes, our results should
enable accurate subgrid models of sink particles accreting from magnetized
media.

in monolayer graphene from a continuum effective field-theoretic perspective by
going beyond the standard leading-order perturbative renormalization group (RG)
analysis. Given that the bare fine structure constant in graphene is of order
unity, which is neither small to justify a perturbative expansion nor large
enough for strong-coupling theories to be applicable, the problem is a
difficult one, with some similarity to 2+1-dimensional strong-coupling quantum
electrodynamics (QED). In this work, we take a systematic and comprehensive
analytical approach, working primarily at the Dirac point (intrinsic graphene),
by going up to three loops in the diagrammatic expansion to both ascertain the
validity of perturbation theory and to estimate quantitatively higher-order
renormalization effects. While no direct signatures for non-Fermi liquid
behavior at the Dirac point have yet been observed experimentally, there is
ample evidence for the interaction-induced renormalization of the graphene
velocity as the carrier density approaches zero. We provide a critical
comparison between theory and experiment, using both bare- and
screened-interaction (RPA) calculations. We find that while the one-loop RG
analysis gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data, especially when
screening and finite-density effects are included through the RPA, the two-loop
analysis reveals a strong-coupling critical point in suspended graphene,
signifying either a quantum phase transition or a breakdown of the
weak-coupling RG approach. We show that the latter is more likely by adapting
Dyson's argument for the breakdown of perturbative QED to the case of graphene.
We propose future experiments and theoretical directions to make further
progress on this important and difficult problem.

light on the pre-explosion structures of their progenitors and their mass-loss

detected during the first days after the explosion prominently show two peaks
in the optical bands, including the $R$ and $I$ bands, where the first peak
appears to be powered by the cooling of shocked surface material and the second
peak is clearly powered by radioactive decay. Such light curves have been
explored in detail theoretically for SN 1993J and 2011dh, where it was found
that they may be explained by progenitors with extended, low-mass envelopes.
Here we generalize these results. We explore, first, whether any double-peaked
light curve of this type can be generated by a progenitor with a ""standard""
density profile, such as a red supergiant or a Wolf-Rayet star. We show that a
standard progenitor (1) cannot produce a double-peaked light curve in the $R$

as is seen after the first peak. We then explore the signature of a progenitor
with a compact core surrounded by extended, low-mass material. This may be a
hydrostatic low-mass envelope or material ejected just prior to the explosion.
We show that it naturally produces both of these features. We use this result
to provide simple formulae to estimate (1) the mass of the extended material
from the time of the first peak, (2) the extended material radius from the
luminosity of the first peak, and (3) an upper limit on the core radius from
the luminosity minimum between the two peaks.

recently discovered subclass of supernovae known as Calcium-rich gap

fraction of all supernovae events, we find that their high Calcium yields are
sufficient to reproduce the X-ray measurements found for nearby rich clusters.
We find the $\chi^{2}$ goodness-of-fit metric improves from 84 to 2 by
including this new class. Moreover, Calcium-rich supernovae preferentially
occur in the outskirts of galaxies making it easier for the nucleosynthesis
products of these events to be incorporated in the intracluster medium via
ram-pressure stripping. The discovery of a Calcium-rich gap transients in
clusters and groups far from any individual galaxy suggests supernovae
associated with intracluster stars may play an important role in enriching the
intracluster medium. Calcium-rich gap transients may also help explain
anomalous Calcium abundances in many other astrophysical systems including
individual stars in the Milky Way, the halos of nearby galaxies and the
circumgalactic medium. Our work highlights the importance of considering the

cosmological data. These bounds are made possible because massive relic
neutrinos affect the expansion history of the universe and lead to a
suppression of matter clustering on scales smaller than the associated free
streaming length. However, the resulting effect on cosmological perturbations
is relative to the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations from
inflation, so freedom in the primordial power spectrum affects neutrino mass
constraints. Using measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the galaxy
power spectrum and the Hubble constant, we constrain neutrino mass and number
of species for a model independent primordial power spectrum. Describing the
primordial power spectrum by a 20-node spline, we find that the neutrino mass
upper limit is a factor three weaker than when a power law form is imposed, if
only CMB data are used. The primordial power spectrum itself is constrained to
better than 10 % in the wave vector range $k \approx 0.01 - 0.25$ Mpc$^{-1}$.
Galaxy clustering data and a determination of the Hubble constant play a key
role in reining in the effects of inflationary freedom on neutrino constraints.
The inclusion of both eliminates the inflationary freedom degradation of the
neutrino mass bound, giving for the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu <
0.18$ eV (at 95 % confidence level, Planck+BOSS+$H_0$), approximately
independent of the assumed primordial power spectrum model. When allowing for a
free effective number of species, $N_{eff}$, the joint constraints on $\Sigma

about November 26.7 and was significantly steeper in SOHO's orange and clear
filter images until November 27.9 when it began to flatten out, reaching a peak
about November 28.1 ($r_H{\sim}17 R_\odot$), then fading before brightening
again from November 28.6 ($r_H{\sim}5 R_\odot$) until disappearing behind the
occulting disc. ISON brightened continuously as it approached perihelion while
visible in all other telescopes/filters. The central condensation disappeared
about November 28.5 and the leading edge became progressively more elongated
until perihelion. These photometric and morphological behaviors are reminiscent
of the tens of meter sized Kreutz comets regularly observed by SOHO and STEREO
and strongly suggest that the nucleus of ISON was destroyed prior to
perihelion. This is much too small to support published gas production rates
and implies significant mass loss and/or disruption in the days and weeks
leading up to perihelion. No central condensation was seen post-perihelion. The
post-perihelion lightcurve was nearly identical in all telescopes/filters and
fell slightly steeper than $r_H^{-2}$. This implies that the brightness was

Planetary Nebulae, Be, and Cataclysmic variable stars using a combination of
NIR and MIR color constraints. As proof of concept we applied the color
constraints to a photometric sample in the Galactic plane, located WR star
candidates, and present five new spectrally confirmed and classified WC (1) and
WN (4) stars. Analysis of the 0.8-5.0 micron spectral data for a subset of
known, bright WC and WN stars shows that emission lines (primarily He I) extend
into the 3.0 - 5.0 micron spectral region, although their strength is greatly
diminished compared to the 0.8-2.5 micron region. The WR population stands out
relative to background field stars at NIR and MIR colors due to an excess
continuum contribution, likely caused by free-free scattering in dense winds.
Mean photometric properties of known WRs are presented and imply that reddened
late-type WN and WC sources are easier to detect than earlier-type sources at
larger Galactic radii. WISE W3 and W4 images of 10 Wolf Rayet stars show
evidence of circumstellar shells linked to mass ejections from strong stellar

show that less than $100$ judiciously chosen precessing inspiral waveforms are

test whether the parameters selected from the inspiral regime result in an

The clusters can merge either (i) by the Ostwald ripening process in which
particles diffuse from one cluster to the other whilst the cluster centres
remain stationary, or (ii) by means of a cluster translation mode, in which the
clusters move towards each other and join. To understand in detail the
interplay between these different modes, we study a model system of hard
particles with an additional attraction between them. The particles diffuse
along narrow channels with smooth or periodically corrugated walls, so that the
system may be treated as one-dimensional. When the attraction between the
particles is strong enough, they aggregate to form clusters. The channel
potential influences whether clusters can move easily or not through the system
and can prevent cluster motion. We use Dynamical Density Functional theory to
study the dynamics of the aggregation process, focusing in particular on the
coalescence of two equal size clusters. As long as the particle hard-core
diameter is non-zero, we find that the coalescence process can be halted by a
sufficiently strong corrugation potential. The period of the potential
determines the size of the final stable clusters. For the case of smooth
channel walls, we demonstrate that there is a cross-over in the dominance of
the two different coarsening modes, that depends on the strength of the
attraction between particles, the cluster sizes and the separation distance
between clusters.

for performing spectral analysis of fluid flows. However, it requires data that
satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. In many fluid flow experiments,
such data are impossible to capture. We propose a new approach that combines
ideas from DMD and compressed sensing. Given a vector-valued signal, we take
measurements randomly in time (at a sub-Nyquist rate) and project the data onto
a low-dimensional subspace. We then use compressed sensing to identify the
dominant frequencies in the signal and their corresponding modes. We
demonstrate this method using two examples, analyzing both an artificially
constructed test dataset and particle image velocimetry data collected from the
flow past a cylinder. In each case, our method correctly identifies the
characteristic frequencies and oscillatory modes dominating the signal, proving
the proposed method to be a capable tool for spectral analysis using
sub-Nyquist-rate sampling.

spins arranged in a one-dimensional chain on top of a one- or two-dimensional
electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The interactions between the
spins are mediated by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism
through the electron gas. Recent work predicts that such a system may
intrinsically support topological superconductivity when a helical spin-density
wave is formed in the spins, and superconductivity is induced in the electron
gas. We analyze, using both analytical and numerical techniques, the conditions
under which such a helical spin state is stable in a realistic situation in the
presence of disorder. We show that it becomes unstable towards the formation of
(anti) ferromagnetic domains if the disorder in the impurity spin positions
$\delta R$ becomes comparable with the Fermi wave length. We also examine the
stability of the helical state against Gaussian potential disorder in the
electronic system using a diagrammatic approach. Our results suggest that in
order to stabilize the helical spin state, and thus the emergent topological
superconductivity, a sufficiently strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, giving
rise to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, is required.

its striking similarity to the prediction from the Standard Model, informs and
constrains many models of new physics. The Higgs mass exhausts one out of three
input parameters of the minimal, five-dimensional version of universal extra
dimension models, the other two parameters being the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale
and the cut-off scale of the theory. The presence of KK fermions with large
coupling to the Higgs implies a short-lived electro-weak vacuum, unless the
cut-off scale is at most a few times higher than the KK mass scale, providing
an additional tight constraint to the theory parameter space. Here, we focus on
the lightest KK particle as a dark matter candidate, and investigate the
regions of parameter space where such particle has a thermal relic density in
accord with the cosmological dark matter density. We find the paradoxical
result that, for low enough cutoff scales consistent with vacuum stability,
larger than previously thought KK mass scales become preferred to explain the
dark matter abundance in the universe. We explain this phenomenon by
pinpointing the additional particles which, at such low cutoffs, become close
enough in mass to the dark matter candidate to coannihilate with it. We make
predictions for both collider and direct dark matter searches that might soon
close in on all viable theory parameter space.

significant. This will constitute a powerful probe for studying the structure

be about 15% of the pure CMB lensing-galaxy lensing component and acts to
reduce the magnitude of its measured spectrum. This offset in the spectrum will
strongly impact its use for precision cosmological study if left unmitigated.
We also propose here a method to calibrate this $\phi I$ contamination through
use of a scaling relation that allows one to reduce the impact of $\phi I$ by a
factor of 20 or more in all redshift bins, which would reduce its magnitude
down to detection limits in almost all cases. This will allow the full use of

(L-SR junctions) serve to couple lysosomal activation to regenerative,
ryanodine receptor-mediated cellular calcium (Ca2+) waves. In pulmonary artery
smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NAADP) may trigger increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a
manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent
Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the
SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been
estimated to be <400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy.
This study utilizes transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough
ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. These
junctions are prominent features in these cells and we estimate that the
membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. We
also develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these
measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data.
Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients show that the
magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By
correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated L-SR junctional
Ca2+ transients, we estimate that ""trigger zones"" with a 60-100 junctions are
required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the
130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most
importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50
nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to
breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a
pre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular
function in health and disease.

consequence is that the RJF acts as a thermalization site for the ion bulk flow

reconnection even though the outflow jet is subsonic. This behavior has no

a scaling of dispersion velocities with the fourth root of their masses.
Secondly, an anomaly has been found at the unexpected scales of wide binaries

Keplerian expectations, and settle at a constant value, exactly on crossing the
$a_{0}$ threshold. Finally, the inferred infall velocity of the bullet cluster
is inconsistent with the standard cosmological scenario, where much smaller
limit encounter velocities appear. This stems from the escape velocity limit
present in standard gravity; the ``bullet'' should not hit the ``target'' at

long-term evolution of turbulence created by a relativistic shock propagating
through an inhomogeneous medium. In the postshock region, magnetic field is
strongly amplified by turbulent motions triggered by preshock density
inhomogeneities. Using a long-simulation box we have followed the
magnetic-field amplification until it is fully developed and saturated. The
turbulent velocity is sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic-field
amplification is controled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when
the magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy.
Magnetic-field amplification and saturation depend on the initial strength and
direction of the magnetic field in the preshock medium, and on the shock
strength. If the initial magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal,
the magnetic field is first compressed at the shock and then can be amplified
by turbulent motion in the postshock region. Saturation occurs when the
magnetic energy becomes comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy in the
postshock region. If the initial magnetic field in the preshock medium is
strong, the postshock region becomes turbulent but significant field
amplification does not occur. If the magnetic energy after shock compression is
larger than the turbulent kinetic energy in the postshock region, significant
field amplification does not occur. We discuss possible applications of our
results to gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.

superposition of four plane-waves propagating at slightly different angles to a
common direction, we derive an expression for the angular momentum density of a

analyze the conservation of angular momentum when a plane-wave enters a
dielectric slab from the free space. The angular momentum of the beam is shown
to decrease upon entering the dielectric medium, by virtue of the fact that the
incident beam exerts a torque on the slab surface at the point of entry. When
the beam leaves the slab, it imparts an equal but opposite torque to the exit
facet, thus recovering its initial angular momentum upon re-emerging into the
free-space. Along the way, we derive an expression for the outward-directed

have N derivatives, even only at a finite number of points, no method,
regardless of its degree, can guarantee convergence more than order N. Even if
the integrand fails to have N derivatives at just 3 (for even N, 2) points, no
method can produce order more than N+1 convergence. This is done by an
adversarial proof: we explicitly construct the functions that exhibit such
error; simple splines turn out to suffice.

overall network energy efficiency by inactivating the underutilized BSs.
However, it affects the performance of users in sleeping cells depending on
their BS association criteria, their channel conditions towards the active BSs,
and scheduling criteria and traffic loads at the active BSs. This paper
characterizes the performance of cellular systems with BS sleeping by
developing a systematic framework to derive the spectral efficiency and outage
probability of downlink transmission to the sleeping cell users taking into
account the aforementioned factors. In this context, we develop a user
association scheme in which a typical user in a sleeping cell selects a BS with
\textbf{M}aximum best-case \textbf{M}ean channel \textbf{A}ccess
\textbf{P}robability (MMAP) which is calculated by all active BSs based on
their existing traffic loads. We consider both greedy and round-robin schemes
at active BSs for scheduling users in a channel. Once the association is
performed, the exact access probability for a typical sleeping cell user and
the statistics of its received signal and interference powers are derived to
evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission. For the sleeping
cell users, we also consider the conventional \textbf{M}aximum
\textbf{R}eceived \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{P}ower (MRSP)-based user association
scheme along with greedy and round-robin schemes at the BSs. The impact of
cell-zooming is incorporated in the derivations to analyze its feasibility in
reducing the coverage holes created by BS sleeping. Numerical results show the
trade-offs between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in various network
scenarios. The accuracy of the analysis is verified through Monte-Carlo
simulations.

  One of the goals when developing this instrument is to build in the latest

Red Planet, so they may be available to the Planetary Science community without
cost and with a minimal learning barrier to cross. This will allow the
Astrobiology community to look for targets of interest such as hydrothermal
minerals, sulfate minerals and hydrous minerals and be able to map the extent
of these minerals using the most up-to-date and effective algorithms.
  The application is programmed in Java and will be made available for Windows,
Mac and Linux platforms. Users will be able to embed Groovy scripts into the
program in order to extend its functionality. The first collection of CRISM
data will occur in September of 2006 and this data will be made publicly
available six months later via the Planetary Datasystem (PDS). Potential users
in the community should therefore look forward to a release date mid-2007.
  Although exploration of the CRISM data set is the motivating force for
developing these software tools, the ease of writing additional Groovy scripts
to access other data sets makes the tools useful for mineral exploration, crop

designed by scaling switches from single-mode systems. All modes at a given
wavelength are switched as a unit, which is necessary in systems with
substantial mode coupling, and minimizes the number of ports required to
accommodate a given traffic volume. When a pure mode is present at the input,
modal transmission and coupling coefficients are mode-dependent and may be
computed using a simple mode-clipping model. When multiple modes are present,
interference between modes alters the transmission and coupling coefficients,
shifting the passband center frequency and changing its bandwidth.
Mode-coupling matrices are used to compute mixed modes having the narrowest or
widest bandwidths, or having the largest center-frequency offsets. In a
specific design for graded-index fiber, five mode groups and 50-GHz channel
spacing, the one-sided bandwidth may change up to $\pm$3.6 GHz. In a system
with many cascaded switches and strong mode coupling, the end-to-end response
per switch may be characterized by a mode-averaged transmission coefficient.

triangulated spheres in ${\bf R}^3$. The LG model is in sharp contrast to the
model of Helfrich-Polyakov (HP). The reason for this difference is that the
curvature energy of the LG (HP) Hamiltonian is defined by means of the
tangential (normal) vector of the surface. For this reason the curvature energy
of the LG model includes the in-plane bending or shear energy component, which
is not included in the curvature energy of the HP model. From the simulation
data, we find that the LG model undergoes a first-order collapse transition.
The results of the LG model in the higher dimensional spaces ${\bf R}^d (d>3)$
and on the self-avoiding surfaces in ${\bf R}^3$ are presented and discussed.
We also study the David-Guitter (DG) model, which is a variant of the LG model,
and find that the DG model undergoes a first-order transition. It is also found
that the transition can be observed only on the homogeneous surfaces, which are
composed of almost uniform triangles according to the condition that the
induced metric ${\partial_a {\bf r}}\cdot{\partial_b {\bf r}}$ is close to
$\delta_{ab}$.

contiguous) in colours: Group 1 (49 stars) is metal-poor, N-normal, Na-poor and
O-rich with abundances that match those determined for the primordial group of
RGB stars from previous studies. Group 2 (23 stars) is still metal-poor, but it
is N- and Na-rich, though only very mildly depleted in O. We can identify this
intermediate group as the progeny of the metal-poor RGB stars that occupy an
intermediate location along the Na-O anti-correlation. The third group (20
stars) is metal-rich, Na-rich, and O-rich and likely corresponds to the most
O-rich component of the previously found metal-rich RGB population. We did not
observe any severely O-depleted stars and we think that the progeny of these
stars falls on the hotter part of the HB. The metal-rich population is also
over-abundant in Sr, in agreement with results for corresponding RGB and SGB

the sum of N and O abundances to Fe. There is some evidence of an enhancement
of He content for Groups 2 and 3 stars (Y=0.338\pm 0.014\pm 0.05). Our results

those of A--F supergiants near optical light maximum. However, they do not
follow the supergiant sequence in the color-color diagram, neither the
blackbody nor the main-sequence sequence. Instead, we found that novae evolve
along a new sequence in the pre-maximum and near-maximum phases, which we call
""the nova-giant sequence."" This sequence is parallel to but \Delta (U-B)
\approx -0.2 mag bluer than the supergiant sequence. This is because the mass
of a nova envelope is much (\sim10^{-4} times) less than that of a normal
supergiant. After optical maximum, its color quickly evolves back blueward
along the same nova-giant sequence and reaches the point of free-free emission
(B-V=-0.03, U-B=-0.97), which coincides with the intersection of the blackbody
sequence and the nova-giant sequence, and remains there for a while. Then the
color evolves leftward (blueward in B-V but almost constant in U-B), owing
mainly to the development of strong emission lines. This is the general course
of nova outbursts in the color-color diagram, which was deduced from eight
well-observed novae in various speed classes. For a nova with unknown
extinction, we can determine a reliable value of the color excess by matching
the observed track of the target nova with this general course. This is a new
and convenient method for obtaining the color excesses of classical novae.
Using this method, we redetermined the color excesses of twenty well-observed
novae. The obtained color excesses are in reasonable agreement with the
previous results, which in turn supports the idea of our general track of nova
outbursts.

covariances (equivalently, transmit correlations at the transmitter side) of
users, also referred to as \emph{transmit correlation diversity}, the impact of
transmit correlation on the power gain of MIMO BCs is characterized in several
regimes of system parameters, with a particular interest in the large-scale

account, we provide asymptotic capacity bounds of multiuser MIMO downlink
systems to see how transmit correlation diversity affects the system
multiplexing gain. We make use of the notion of joint spatial division and
multiplexing (JSDM) to derive the capacity bounds. It is advocated in this
paper that transmit correlation diversity may be of use to significantly
increase multiplexing gain as well as power gain in multiuser MIMO systems. In
particular, the new type of diversity in wireless communications is shown to
improve the system multiplexing gain up to by a factor of the number of degrees
of such diversity. Finally, performance limits of conventional large-scale MIMO
systems not exploiting transmit correlation are also characterized.

however, the parent compound is mostly antiferromagnetic metal, raising a
debate on whether an appropriate starting point should go with an itinerant
picture or a localized picture. It has been proposed theoretically that the
parent compound of the iron-based superconductors may be on the verge of a Mott
insulator, but so far no clear experimental evidence of doping-induced Mott
transition has been available. Here we report an electronic evidence of an
insulator-superconductor transition observed in the single-layer FeSe films
grown on the SrTiO3 substrate. By taking angle-resolved photoemission
measurements on the electronic structure and energy gap, we have identified a
clear evolution of an insulator to a superconductor with the increasing doping.
This observation represents the first example of an insulator-superconductor
transition via doping observed in the iron-based superconductors. It indicates
that the parent compound of the iron-based superconductors is in proximity of a
Mott insulator and strong electron correlation should be considered in

various processes: dust formation by SNe II and AGB stars, dust destruction by
SN shocks in the ISM, metal accretion onto the surface of grains (referred to
as grain growth), shattering and coagulation. We find that the extinction curve
is flat in the earliest stage of galaxy evolution. As the galaxy is enriched
with dust, shattering becomes effective to produce a large abundance of small
grains ($a \la 0.01\;\mu$m). Then, grain growth becomes effective at small
grain radii, forming a bump at $a \sim 10^{-3}${--}$10^{-2}\;\mu$m on the grain
size distribution. Consequently, the extinction curve at ultraviolet (UV)
wavelengths becomes steep, and a bump at $1/\lambda \sim 4.5\;\mu{\rm
m}^{-1}\;(\lambda: \mbox{wavelength})$ on the extinction curve becomes
prominent. Once coagulation becomes effective, the extinction curves become
flatter, but the UV extinction remains overproduced when compared with the
Milky Way extinction curve. This discrepancy can be resolved by introducing a
stronger contribution of coagulation. Consequently, an interplay between
shattering and coagulation could be important to reproduce the Milky Way
extinction curve.

leading to sudden qualitative and sometimes irreversible regime shifts. The
development of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge. Recent
progress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is
described by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key
variables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.
Here we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we
frequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism
leading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been
missed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type
mechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a
saddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over
substantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type
transition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological
data. This work thus establishes a connection from critical transitions to
networks and an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition. In
complex models and big data we anticipate that saddle-transitions will be
encountered frequently in the future.

the interplay between exchange symmetry and the electron-electron interaction

spectrum different from those in semiconductors. Due to the involvement of
valley pseudospin, it is found that the low-energy spectrum is nearly
degenerate and consists of states all characterized by having an antisymmetric
(pseudospin) (spin) component in the wave function, with the spin (pseudospin)
part being either singlet (triplet) or triplet (singlet), as opposed to the

always a spin singlet in the case of X- trions. We investigate trions in the
various regimes determined by the competition between quantum confinement and
electron-electron interaction, both analytically and numerically. The numerical
work is performed within a variational method accounting for electron mass
discontinuity across the QD edge. The result for electron-hole correlation in

proportional to the square of the deviation from scale invariance, $\alpha_s
\propto (n_s-1)^2$, and it is therefore currently undetectable. We present a
mechanism able to generate a much larger running within slow roll. The
mechanism is based on a curvaton field with a large mass term, and a time
evolving normalization. This may happen for instance to the angular direction
of a complex field in presence of an evolving radial direction. At the price of
a single tuning between the mass term and the rate of change of the
normalization, the curvaton can be made effectively light at the CMB scales,
giving a spectral tilt in agreement with observations. The lightness is not
preserved at later times, resulting in a detectable running of the spectral
tilt. This mechanism shows that fields with a large mass term do not
necessarily decouple from the inflationary physics, and provides a new tool for
model building in inflation.

error in standard approximations to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional
within density-functional theory (DFT). The pSI leads to delocalization error
in the polaron wave function and energy, as calculated from the Kohn-Sham (KS)
potential in the native charge state of the polaron. This constitutes the
origin of the systematic failure of DFT to describe polaron formation in band
insulators. It is shown that the delocalization error in these systems is,
however, largely absent in the KS potential of the closed-shell neutral charge
state. This leads to a modification of the DFT total-energy functional that
corrects the pSI in the XC functional. The resulting pSIC-DFT method
constitutes an accurate parameter-free {\it ab initio} methodology for
calculating polaron properties in insulators at a computational cost that is
orders of magnitude smaller than hybrid XC functionals. Unlike approaches that
rely on parametrized localized potentials such as DFT+$U$, the pSIC-DFT method
properly captures both site and bond-centered polaron configurations. This is
demonstrated by studying formation and migration of self-trapped holes in
alkali halides (bond-centered) as well as self-trapped electrons in an
elpasolite compound (site-centered). The pSIC-DFT approach consistently
reproduces the results obtained by hybrid XC functionals parametrized by
DFT+$G_0W_0$ calculations. Finally, we generalize the pSIC approach to hybrid
functionals, and show that in stark contrast to conventional hybrid
calculations of polaron energies, the pSIC-hybrid method is insensitive to the
parametrization of the hybrid XC functional. On this basis, we further
rationalize the success of the pSIC-DFT approach.

an ordered magnetic field, and takes into account all light-travel-time and
other relevant geometric effects, while the relevant synchrotron self-Compton

consider several possible mechanisms through which a relativistic shock
propagating through the jet may affect the jet plasma to produce a synchrotron
and high-energy flare. Most plausibly, the shock is expected to lead to a
compression of the magnetic field, increasing the toroidal field component and
thereby changing the direction of the magnetic field in the region affected by
the shock. We find that such a scenario leads to correlated synchrotron + SSC
flaring, associated with substantial variability in the synchrotron
polarization percentage and position angle. Most importantly, this scenario
naturally explains large PA rotations by > 180 deg., as observed in connection
with gamma-ray flares in several blazars, without the need for bent or helical
jet trajectories or other non-axisymmetric jet features.

Crustal heating by means of magnetic field decay and an evolutionary link with

thermal luminosities and magnetic field intensities than standard pulsars of
similar age. The third brightest INS, RX J1605.3+3249, is the only object
amidst the seven still lacking a detected periodicity. We observed the source
with the XMM-Newton Observatory for 60 ks aiming at unveiling the neutron star
rotation rate and investigating its spectrum in detail. A periodic signal at
P=3.387864(16) s, most likely the neutron star spin period, is detected at the
4-sigma confidence level. The coherent combination of the new data with a past
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation of the source constrains the pulsar spin-down
rate at the 2-sigma confidence level, implying a dipolar magnetic field of
B~7.4e13 G. If confirmed, RX J1605.3+3249 would be the neutron star with the

  QED$_{2+1}$","28 pages,RevTex4,4 figures,typos corrected",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the infrared and ultraviolet behavior of the fermion propagator in
(2+1)-dimensional QED based on spectral representation.If we choose soft-photon
exponentiation to include all orders of soft-photon emission by electron,its
spectral function may be written as $e^{F}$,where $F$ is a model independent
spectral function of the lowest order in the coupling constant.We evaluate the
function $F$ in an analytic way and show its short and long distance behavior
with an infrared cut-off $\mu$.At short distance function $F$ has linear and
logarithmic infrared divergence.However in the long distance limit function $F$
vanishes.So that only short distance part of $e^{F}$ is modified from unity.We
may avoid the linear divergence by the choice of the gauge $d=-1$,where $d$ is
a covariant gauge fixing parameter.In this gauge the spectral function vanishes
in the limit of zero bare photon mass $\mu$.We overcome this difficulty by
adding continuous spectrum of massive fermion loop to photon spectral function
$\rho(\mu^{2})$,where $\mu$ has the role of invariant mass for
fermion-antifermion pair and is larger than $2m.$So that unquenched fermion
spectral function survibes.For the application of chiral symmetry breaking we
carefully studied the position space propagator $S_{F}(0)$.At least for weak
coupling these values agree quite well with that obtained in Dyson-Schwinger
equation with proper vertex correction.We also study these parameter as a
function of the flavour number $N$ and t'Hooft coupling $\alpha=e^{2}N/8\pi$
for strong coupling case.

H.E.S.S. as part of its Galactic plane survey. Given its broadband spectral
energy distribution and its spatial coincidence with the young energetic pulsar
PSR J1856+0245, the source has been put forward as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
candidate. MAGIC has performed follow-up observations aimed at mapping the
source down to energies approaching 100 GeV in order to better understand its
complex morphology. HESS J1857+026 was observed by MAGIC in 2010, yielding 29
hours of good quality stereoscopic data that allowed us to map the source
region in two separate ranges of energy. We detected very-high-energy gamma-ray
emission from HESS J1857+026 with a significance of $12 \sigma$ above $150$
GeV. The differential energy spectrum between $100$ GeV and $13$ TeV is well
described by a power law function $dN/dE = N_0(E/1\textrm{TeV})^{-\Gamma}$ with
$N_0 = (5.37 \pm0.44_{stat} \pm1.5_{sys}) \times 10^{-12} (\textrm{TeV}^{-1}
\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ $\textrm{ s}^{-1})$ and $\Gamma = 2.16\pm0.07_{stat}
\pm0.15_{sys}$, which bridges the gap between the GeV emission measured by
Fermi-LAT and the multi-TeV emission measured by H.E.S.S.. In addition, we
present a detailed analysis of the energy-dependent morphology of this region.
We couple these results with archival multi-wavelength data and outline
evidence in favor of a two-source scenario, whereby one source is associated
with a PWN, while the other could be linked with a molecular cloud complex
containing an HII region and a possible gas cavity.

are classified in terms of the invariant subgroups of the symmetry group of the

wave vortices, hybridized-pairing between $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals gives
rise to a relative phase difference in terms of gauge transformed pairing order

caused by a transformation of co-representation of $G^{*}_{5}$ and $G^{*}_{6}$

referred to as Circular Sphere Decoding (CSD) which is applicable to
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with arbitrary two dimensional
(2D) constellations. CSD provides a new constraint test. This constraint test
is carefully designed so that the element-wise dependency is removed in the
metric computation for the test. As a result, the constraint test becomes
simple to perform without restriction on its constellation structure. By
additionally employing this simple test as a prescreening test, CSD reduces the
complexity of the CV-SD search. We show that the complexity reduction is
significant while its maximum-likelihood (ML) performance is not compromised.
We also provide a powerful tool to estimate the pruning capacity of any
particular search tree. Using this tool, we propose the Predict-And-Change

shocks is of broad importance in high energy astrophysics, because these
instabilities build up the shock, control the particle acceleration process and
generate the magnetic fields in which the accelerated particles radiate. Two
crucial parameters control the micro-physics of these shocks: the magnetization
of the ambient medium and the Lorentz factor of the shock front; as of today,
much of this parameter space remains to be explored. In the present paper, we
report on a new instability upstream of electron-positron relativistic shocks
and we argue that this instability shapes the micro-physics at moderate
magnetization levels and/or large Lorentz factors. This instability is seeded
by the electric current carried by the accelerated particles in the shock
precursor as they gyrate around the background magnetic field. The compensation
current induced in the background plasma leads to an unstable configuration,
with the appearance of charge neutral filaments carrying a current of the same
polarity, oriented along the perpendicular current. This ``current-driven
filamentation'' instability grows faster than any other instability studied so
far upstream of relativistic shocks, with a growth rate comparable to the
plasma frequency. Furthermore, the compensation of the current is associated
with a slow-down of the ambient plasma as it penetrates the shock precursor (as
viewed in the shock rest frame). This slow-down of the plasma implies that the
``current driven filamentation'' instability can grow for any value of the
shock Lorentz factor, provided the magnetization \sigma <~ 10^{-2}. We argue
that this instability explains the results of recent particle-in-cell
simulations in the mildly magnetized regime.

phenomena and may be described by the paraxial wave equation. In analogy to
light-waves, governed by the same equation, these electrons share many of the
fundamental traits and dynamics of photons. Today, spatial manipulation of
electron beams is achieved mainly using electrostatic and magnetic fields.
Other demonstrations include simple phase-plates and holographic masks based on
binary diffraction gratings. Altering the spatial profile of the beam may be
proven useful in many fields incorporating phase microscopy, electron
holography, and electron-matter interactions. These methods, however, are
fundamentally limited due to energy distribution to undesired diffraction
orders as well as by their binary construction. Here we present a new method in
electron-optics for arbitrarily shaping of electron beams, by precisely
controlling an engineered pattern of thicknesses on a thin-membrane, thereby
molding the spatial phase of the electron wavefront. Aided by the past decade's
monumental leap in nano-fabrication technology and armed with light-optic's
vast experience and knowledge, one may now spatially manipulate an electron
beam's phase in much the same way light waves are shaped simply by passing them
through glass elements such as refractive and diffractive lenses. We show
examples of binary and continuous phase-plates and demonstrate the ability to
generate arbitrary shapes of the electron wave function using a holographic
phase-mask. This opens exciting new possibilities for microscopic studies of
materials using shaped electron beams and enables electron beam lithography
without the need to move the electron beam or the sample, as well as high
resolution inspection of electronic chips by structured electron illumination.

J. Discrete Math. 12 (1999) 491--499] showed that the independence ratio is
equal to the inverse of the fractional chromatic number, thus relating the
concept to the well studied question of finding the chromatic number of
distance graphs.
  We prove that the independence ratio of a distance graph is achieved by a
periodic set, and we present a framework for discharging arguments to
demonstrate upper bounds on the independence ratio. With these tools, we
determine the exact independence ratio for several infinite families of
distance sets of size three, determine asymptotic values for others, and
present several conjectures.

revealed a prominent arc-like structure at 50"" ($\simeq0.1$ pc) from the
O9.5V/B0.5V system $\sigma$ Ori AB. We attribute this dust structure to the
interaction of radiation pressure from the star with dust carried along by the
IC 434 photo-evaporative flow of ionized gas from the dark cloud L1630. We have
developed a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with
nearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an
appreciable distance (> 0.1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. The
model demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple
from the dust and will keep its original flow lines. We argue that this dust
structure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving
through the interstellar medium. Dust waves (and bow waves) stratify dust
grains according to their radiation pressure opacity, which reflects the size
distribution and composition of the grain material. Comparison of our model
with observations implies that dust-gas coupling through Coulomb interaction is
less important than previously thought, challenging our understanding of grain
dynamics in hot, ionized regions of space. We describe the difference between
dust (and bow) waves and classical bow shocks. We conclude that dust waves and
bow waves should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon and
that these structures are best observed at mid-IR to FIR wavelengths. In
particular, dust waves and bow waves are most efficiently formed around
weak-wind stars moving through a high density medium. Moreover, they provide a
unique opportunity to study the direct interaction between a (massive) star and
its immediate surroundings.

multipath received signals. Through analysis of local and global network

is highly dependent upon whether a stochastic or deterministic connection model
is employed. Specifically we show that the network mean degree is lower
(higher) for stochastic wireless channels than for deterministic ones, if the
path loss exponent is greater (lesser) than the spatial dimension. Similarly,
the probability of forming isolated pairs of nodes in an otherwise dense random
network is much less for stochastic wireless channels than for deterministic
ones. The latter realisation explains why the upper bound of $k$-connectivity
is tighter for stochastic wireless channels. We obtain closed form analytic
results and compare to extensive numerical simulations.

Plates characterized by low length-to-width ratio $L$ are considered here. By

scenarios are identified. For very low aspect ratio $1 \le L \le 2$, the flow
is first destabilized, when increasing the Reynolds number,by a steady global
mode that breaks the top/bottom planar reflectional symmetry. The symmetric
steady flow bifurcates, via a pitchfork bifurcation, towards an asymmetric
steady wakes, similarly to the case of axisymmetric wakes behind sphere and
disks. For long aspect ratio, $2.5 \le L \le 6$, the first unstable mode also
breaks the top/bottom symmetry but is unsteady. A Hopf bifurcation occurs, as
for the wake developing behind a two-dimensional circular cylinder. Finally an
intermediate regime $2 \le L \le 2.5$ is found for which the flow gets first
unstable to an unsteady mode that breaks the left/right planar reflectional

and evolves in a relatively tenuous and uniform environment, though interacting
with an atomic cloud in its northwestern limb. The X-ray image of SN 1006
reveals an indentation in the southwestern part of the shock front and the HI
maps show an isolated cloud (southwestern cloud) having the same velocity as
the northwestern cloud and whose morphology fits perfectly in the indentation.
We performed spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of small regions in
the southwestern nonthermal limb and studied the deep X-ray spectra obtained
within the XMM-Newton SN 1006 Large Program. We also analyzed archive HI data,
obtained combining single dish and interferometric observations. We found that
the best-fit value of the N_H derived from the X-ray spectra significantly
increases in regions corresponding to the southwestern cloud, while the cutoff
energy of the synchrotron emission decreases. The amount of the N_H variations
corresponds perfectly with the HI column density of the southwestern cloud, as
measured from the radio data. The decrease in the cutoff energy at the
indentation clearly reveals that the back side of the cloud is actually
interacting with the remnant. The southwestern limb therefore presents a unique
combination of efficient particle acceleration and high ambient density, thus
being the most promising region for gamma-ray hadronic emission in SN 1006. We
estimate that such emission will be detectable with the Fermi telescope within
a few years.

an adjacent background of super Hubble perturbations. In other words, a
detection of nongaussianity implies a possible portal to the superhorizon. By

the power spectrum's size and running are accidents of super cosmic variance.

Bayesian partitioning of the covariate space incorporating a variable selection

log-linear modelling with interaction terms. We derive theoretical results on

from clustering can potentially reduce the number of covariates considered and,
subsequently, the number of competing log-linear models, making the exploration
of the model space feasible. Variable selection within clustering can inform on
marginal independence in general, thus allowing for a more efficient
exploration of the log-linear model space. However, we show that the clustering
structure is not informative on the existence of interactions in a consistent
manner. This work is of interest to those who utilize log-linear models, as
well as practitioners such as epidemiologists that use clustering models to
reduce the dimensionality in the data and to reveal interesting patterns on how

rigid flat substrates auto-roughens with its dominant wavelength exhibiting
pronounced dependence on the film thickness (H). A linear stability analysis
confirmed that this long wavelength instability (~7H) is due to an
elasto-capillary effect, the implementation of which required direct
measurements of the surface tension and the elasticity of the gel. The surface
tension of the gel was estimated from the fundamental spherical harmonic of a
hemispherical cap of the gel that was excited by an external noise. The shear
modulus of the gel was determined from its resonant shear mode in a confined
geometry. During the course of this study, it was found that a high density
steel ball submerges itself inside the gel by balancing its excess weight with
the accumulated strain induced elastic force that allows another estimation of
its elastic modulus. The large ratio (1.8 mm) of the surface tension to its
elasticity ascertains the role of elasto-capillarity in the adhesion induced
pattern formation with such gels. Experimental results are in accord with a
linear stability analysis that predicts that the rescaled wavelength is linear
with H, which modifies the conventional stress to pull-off a rigid flat object
from a very soft film by a multiplicative factor. The analysis also suggests
some new results related to the role of the finite dilation of a material in
interfacial pattern formation that may have non-trivial consequences in the
adhesive delamination of very thin and/or soft elastic films via self-generated
cracks.

This
is especially true in the case of mobile systems, where multipath propagation
causes the received signal to be seriously degraded. Over the years, many
techniques have been proposed to combat channel effects. Two of the most
popular are linear equalisation (LE) and decision feedback equalisation (DFE).
These methods offer a good compromise between performance and computational
complexity. LE and DFE are implemented using finite impulse response (FIR)
filters whose frequency spectrum approximates the inverse of the channel
spectrum plus noise. In mobile systems, the equaliser is made adaptable in
order to be able to respond to the channel variations. Adaptability is achieved
using adaptive FIR filters whose coefficients are iteratively updated. In
principle, an infinite number of filter coefficients would be needed to achieve
perfect channel inversion. In practice, the number of taps must be finite.
Simulations show that, in realistic scenarios, making the equaliser longer than
a certain (undetermined) number of taps will not yield any benefit. Moreover,
computation and power will be wasted. In battery powered devices, like mobile
terminals, it would be desirable to have the equaliser properly dimensioned.
The equaliser's optimum length strongly depends on the particular scenario, and
as channel conditions vary, this optimum is likely to vary. This thesis
presents novel techniques to perform equaliser length adjustment. Methods for
the LE and the DFE have been developed. Simulations in many different scenarios
show that the proposed schemes optimise the number of taps to be used.
Moreover, these techniques are able to detect changes in the channel and
re-adjust the equaliser length appropriately.

important, the presence of an inner planetary companion to a warm jupiter can
result in tidal evolution of the system. Insight into the process and its
effects comes form classical secular theory of planetary perturbations. The
lifetime of the inner planet may be shorter than the age of the system, because
the warm jupiter maintains its eccentricity and hence promotes tidal migration
into the star. Thus a warm jupiter observed to be alone in its system might
have previously cleared away any interior planets. Before its demise, even if
an inner planet is of terrestrial scale, it may promote damping of the warm
jupiter's eccentricity. Thus any inferences of the initial orbit of an observed
warm jupiter must include the possibility of a greater initial eccentricity
than would be estimated by assuming it had always been alone. Tidal evolution
involving multiple planets also enhances the internal heating of the planets,
which readily exceeds that of stellar radiation for the inner planet, and may
be great enough to affect the internal structure of warm jupiters. Secular
theory gives insight into the tidal processes, providing, among other things, a
way to constrain eccentricities of transiting planets based on estimates of the

type of long range interaction between rigid particles that prevails when they
are suspended in an soft elastic gel. A denser particle submerges itself to a
considerable depth inside the gel and becomes buoyant by balancing its weight
against the elastic force exerted by the surrounding medium. By virtue of a
large elastic-capillary length, the surface of the gel wraps around the
particle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the
free surface of the gel. Substantial amount of tensile strain is thus developed
in the gel network parallel to the free surface that penetrates to a
significant depth inside the gel. The field of this tensile strain is rather
long range owing to a large correlation length and strong enough to pull two
submerged particles into contact. The particles move towards each other with an
effective force following an inverse linear distance law. When more monomers or
dimers of the particles are released inside the gel, they orient rather freely
inside the capsules they are in, and attract each other to form close packed
clusters. Eventually, these clusters themselves interact and coalesce. This is
an emergent phenomenon in which the gravity, the capillarity and the elasticity
work in tandem to create a long range interaction. We also present the results
of a related experiment, in which a particle suspended inside a thickness
graded gel moves accompanied by the continuous folding and the relaxation of
the surface of the gel.

poorly express the reasoning and development of categorical proofs. In order to

These graphical representations provide a topological perspective on
categorical proofs, and silently handle functoriality and naturality conditions

  Our approach is to proceed primarily by example, systematically applying
graphical techniques to many aspects of category theory. We develop string
diagrammatic formulations of many common notions, including adjunctions,
monads, Kan extensions, limits and colimits. We describe representable functors
graphically, and exploit these as a uniform source of graphical calculation
rules for many category theoretic concepts. These graphical tools are then used

two distinctive features: the problems are usually highly anisotropic, with a
dominant vertical flow direction, and the commonly used fully implicit method
requires a simultaneous solution for pressure and saturation or molar
concentration variables. These variables behave quite differently, with the
pressure feeling long-range effects while the saturations vary locally. In this

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiway relay channel (mRC) where $K$
users, each equipped with $M$ antennas, exchange messages in a pairwise manner
via a common $N$-antenna relay node. % A novel and systematic way of joint
beamforming design at the users and at the relay is proposed to align signals
for efficient implementation of physical-layer network coding (PNC). It is
shown that, when the user number $K=3$, the proposed beamforming design can
achieve the DoF capacity of the considered mRC for any $(M,N)$ setups. % For
the scenarios with $K>3$, we show that the proposed signaling scheme can be
improved by disabling a portion of relay antennas so as to align signals more
efficiently. Our analysis reveals that the obtained achievable DoF is always
piecewise linear, and is bounded either by the number of user antennas $M$ or
by the number of relay antennas $N$. Further, we show that the DoF capacity can
be achieved for $\frac{M}{N} \in \left(0,\frac{K-1}{K(K-2)} \right]$ and
$\frac{M}{N} \in \left[\frac{1}{K(K-1)}+\frac{1}{2},\infty \right)$, which
provides a broader range of the DoF capacity than the existing results.
Asymptotic DoF as $K\rightarrow \infty$ is also derived based on the proposed
signaling scheme.

fusion barriers by dynamically modifying the densities of the colliding nuclei.
The effect is expected to be stronger at energies near the barrier top, where
changes in density have longer time to develop than at higher energies.
Quantitatively, modern TDHF calculations are able to predict realistic fusion
thresholds. However, the evolution of the potential barrier with bombarding
energy remains to be confronted with the experimental data. The aim is to find
signatures of the energy dependence of the barrier by comparing fusion
cross-sections calculated from potentials obtained at different bombarding
energies with the experimental data. This comparison is made for the
$^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca and $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb systems. Fusion cross-sections are
computed from potentials calculated with the density-constrained TDHF method.
The couplings decrease the barrier at low-energy in both cases. A deviation
from the Woods-Saxon nuclear potential is also observed at the lowest energies.
In general, fusion cross-sections around a given energy are better reproduced
by the potential calculated at this energy. The coordinate-dependent mass plays
a crucial role for the reproduction of sub-barrier fusion cross-sections.
Effects of the energy dependence of the potential can be found in experimental
barrier distributions only if the variation of the barrier is significant in
the energy-range spanned by the distribution. It appears to be the case for
$^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb but not for $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca. These results show that
the energy dependence of the barrier predicted in TDHF calculations is
realistic. This confirms that the TDHF approach can be used to study the
couplings between relative motion and internal degrees of freedom in heavy-ion
collisions.

conditions informed by observations of the cores in Ophiuchus. Because the
observations are limited to two spatial dimensions plus radial velocity, we
cannot infer initial conditions for the collapse of a particular core. However,
with a minimum of assumptions (isotropic turbulence with a power-law spectrum,
a thermal mix of compressive and solenoidal modes, a critical Bonnor-Ebert
density profile) we can generate initial conditions that match, in a
statistical sense, the distributions of mass, projected size and aspect ratio,
thermal and non-thermal one-dimensional velocity dispersion, observed in
Ophiuchus. The time between core-core collisions in Ophiuchus is sufficiently
long, that we can simulate single cores evolving is isolation, and therefore we
are able to resolve masses well below the opacity limit. We generate an
ensemble of 100 cores, and evolve them with no radiative feedback from the
stars formed, then with continuous radiative feedback, and finally with
episodic radiative feedback. With no feedback the simulations produce too many
brown dwarfs, and with continuous feedback too few. With episodic radiative
feedback, both the peak of the protostellar mass function (at ~ 0.2 M_sun) and
the ratio of H-burning stars to brown dwarfs are consistent with observations.
The mass of a star is not strongly related to the mass of the core in which it
forms. Low-mass cores (M ~ 0.1 M_sun) tend to collapse into single objects,
whereas high-mass cores (1 > M_sun) usually fragment into several objects with
a broad mass range.

the observability of two coupled wave equations in cascade if the observation

consists of creating (minting) the new coins which are later put into
circulation. Miners spend electricity on solving cryptographic puzzles and they
are also gatekeepers which validate bitcoin transactions of other people.
Miners are expected to be honest and have some incentives to behave well.
However. In this paper we look at the miner strategies with particular
attention paid to subversive and dishonest strategies or those which could put
bitcoin and its reputation in danger. We study in details several recent
attacks in which dishonest miners obtain a higher reward than their relative
contribution to the network. In particular we revisit the concept of block
withholding attacks and propose a new concrete and practical block withholding
attack which we show to maximize the advantage gained by rogue miners.
  RECENT EVENTS: it seems that the attack was recently executed, see Section
XI-A.

"1402.5867","Tarek Sayed Ahmed","Tarek Sayed Ahmed","Amalgamation, interpolation and congruence extension properties in
  topological cylindric algebras",,,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological cylindric algebras of dimension \alpha, \alpha any ordinal are
cylindric algebras with dimension \alpha expanded with \alpha S4 modalities.
The S4 modalities in representable algebras are induced by a topology on the
base of the representation of its cylindric reduct, that is not necessarily an
Alexandrov topolgy. For \alpha>2, the class of representable algebras is a
variety that is not axiomatized by a finite schema, and in fact all complexity
results on representations for cylindric algebras, proved by Andreka
(concerning number of variables needed for axiomatizations) Hodkinson (on
Sahlqvist axiomatizations and canonicity) and others, transfer to the
topological addition, by implementing a very simple procedure of `discretely
topologizing a cylindric algebra' Given a cylindric algebra of dimension
\alpha, one adds \alpha many interior identity operations, the latter algebra
is representable as a topological cylindric algebra if and only if the former
is; the representation induced by the discrete topology.
  In this paper we investigate amalgamation properties for various classes of
topological cylindric algebras of all dimensions. We recover, in the
topological context, all of the results proved by Andreka, Comer Madarasz,
Nemeti, Pigozzi, Sain, Sayed Ahmed, Sagi, Shelah, Simon, and others for
cylindric algebras and much more.
