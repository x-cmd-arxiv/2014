the number of universal quantifiers or the arity of inclusion atoms in
formulae. In case of universal quantifiers, the corresponding hierarchy
collapses at the first level. Arity hierarchy is shown to be strict by relating
the question to the study of arity hierarchies in fixed point logics.

ontological commitments as honest and pragmatic working hypotheses that assume
the existence (out there) of certain entities represented by the symbols in our
theory. I argue that this is not naive, in the sense that it does not entail
the belief that the hypotheses could ever be proved to be true (or false), but
it is nevertheless justified by the success and predictive power of the theory
that contains the concepts assumed to exist. I also claim that the ontological
commitments one holds (even if tacitly so) have a great influence on what kind
of science is produced, how it is used, and how it is understood. Not only I
justify this claim, but I also propose a sketch of a possible falsification of
it. As a natural conclusion, I defend the importance of identifying, clarifying
and making explicit one's ontological commitments if fruitful scientific
discussions are to be had. Finally, I compare my point of view with that of
some philosophers and scientists who have put forward similar notions.

has been widely studied as an excellent standard ruler for probing cosmic
distances and expansion history, and hence dark energy. In contrast, the
amplitude of the BAO feature has received relatively little study, mainly due
to limited signal-to-noise, and complications due to galaxy biasing, effects of
non-linear clustering and dependence on several cosmological parameters. As
expected, the amplitude of the BAO feature is sensitive to the cosmic baryon
fraction: for standard radiation content, the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
acoustic peaks constrain this precisely and the BAO amplitude is largely a
redundant cross-check. However, the CMB mainly constrains the redshift of
matter-radiation equality, z_eq, and the baryon/photon ratio: if a non-standard
radiation density N_eff is allowed, increasing N_eff while matching the CMB
peaks leads to a reduced baryon fraction and a lower relative BAO amplitude. We
construct an observable for the relative area of the BAO feature from the
galaxy correlation function (Eq.~8); from linear-theory models, we find that
this is mainly sensitive to N_eff and quite insensitive to other cosmological
parameters. More detailed work from N-body simulations will be needed to
constrain the effects of non-linearity and scale-dependent galaxy bias on this
observable.

response coefficient in harmonic n. Experimental data for $v_2$ and $v_3$
combined with hydrodynamic calculations of $C_n$ thus provide us with the rms

free parameters in the hydro calculation (in particular the shear viscosity),
we obtain an allowed band in the (rms $\varepsilon_2$, rms $\varepsilon_3$)

exclude several of these models. We illustrate that the effect of changing the
granularity of the initial state is similar to changing the medium properties,
making these effects difficult to disentangle.

can be thought of as encoded on its boundary. Holographic principle establishes
equivalence, or duality, between theoretical description of volume physics,
which involves gravity, and the gravity-free field theory, which describes
physics on its surface. While generally accepted as a theoretical framework, so
far there was no known experimental system which would exhibit explicit
holographic duality and be amenable to direct experimental testing. Here we
demonstrate that nonlinear optics of hyperbolic metamaterials admits such a
dual holographic description. Wave equation which describes propagation of
extraordinary light through the volume of metamaterial exhibits 2+1 dimensional
Lorentz symmetry. The role of time in the corresponding effective 3D Minkowski
spacetime is played by the spatial coordinate aligned with the optical axis of
the material. Nonlinear optical Kerr effect bends this spacetime resulting in
effective gravitational interaction between extraordinary photons. On the other
hand, a holographic dual theory may be formulated on the metamaterial surface,
which describes its nonlinear optics via interaction of cylindrical surface
plasmons possessing conserved charges proportional to their angular momenta.
Potential implications of this duality for superconductivity of hyperbolic
metamaterials are discussed.

tracing out the spatial degree of freedom. We analyze the standard case,
without decoherence, and the situation where decoherence appears in the form of
broken links in the lattice. By examining the trace distance for possible pairs
of initial states as a function of time, we conclude that the evolution of the
reduced density matrix is non-Markovian, in the sense defined in [H. P. Breuer,
E. M. Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)]. As the level
of noise increases, the dynamics approaches a Markovian process. The highest
non-Markovianity corresponds to the case without decoherence. The reduced
density matrix tends always to a well-defined limit that we calculate, but only
in the decoherence-free case this limit is non-trivial.

  incompressible fluids","26 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a diffuse interface model describing the evolution of a mixture
of two different viscous incompressible fluids of equal density. The main
novelty of the present contribution consists in the fact that the effects of
temperature on the flow are taken into account. In the mathematical model, the
evolution of the macroscopic velocity is ruled by the Navier-Stokes system with
temperature-dependent viscosity, while the order parameter representing the
concentration of one of the components of the fluid is assumed to satisfy a
convective Cahn-Hilliard equation. The effects of the temperature are
prescribed by a suitable form of the heat equation. However, due to quadratic
forcing terms, this equation is replaced, in the weak formulation, by an
equality representing energy conservation complemented with a differential
inequality describing production of entropy. The main advantage of introducing
this notion of solution is that, while the thermodynamical consistency is
preserved, at the same time the energy-entropy formulation is more tractable
mathematically. Indeed, global-in-time existence for the initial-boundary value
problem associated to the weak formulation of the model is proved by deriving
suitable a-priori estimates and showing weak sequential stability of families
of approximating solutions.

Berry phases of the quantum fluctuations. We use an effective low-energy

at a position angle of $\sim 125 degrees. In contrast, molecular hydrogen
emission becomes prominent at distances > 5"" from the protostar and extends at
a position angle of 160 degrees. The morphological differences suggest that the
atomic emission arises from a companion source, lying in the foreground of the
envelope surrounding the embedded protostar SMM1. In addition the molecular and
atomic Spitzer maps disentangle the large scale CO (3-2) emission observed in
the region into two distinct bipolar outflows, giving further support to a
proto-binary source setup. Analysis at the peaks of the [FeII] jet show that
emission arises from warm and dense gas (T ~1000 K, n(electron) 10^5 - 10^6

as the driving source. All existing evidence converge to the conclusion that
SMM1 is a non-coeval proto-binary source.

cores in giant dark clouds. Eventually, these stars can travel through the
molecular clouds, which are highly inhomogeneous. The powerful winds of massive
runaway stars interact with the medium forming bowshocks. Recent observations
and theoretical modelling suggest that these bowshocks emit non-thermal
radiation. As the massive stars move through the inhomogeneous ambient gas the
physical properties of the bowshocks are modified, producing changes in the
non-thermal emission. We aim to compute the non-thermal radiation produced in
the bowshocks of runaway massive stars when travelling through a molecular
cloud. We calculate the non-thermal emission and absorption for two types of
massive runaway stars, an O9I and an O4I, as they move through a density
gradient. We present the spectral energy distributions for the runaway stars
modelled. Additionally, we obtain light curves at different energy ranges. We
find significant variations in the emission over timescales of $\sim$ 1 yr. We
conclude that bowshocks of massive runaway stars, under some assumptions, might
be variable gamma-ray sources, with variability timescales that depend on the
medium density profile. These objects might constitute a population of galactic
gamma-ray sources turning on and off within years.

discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to
""compute with data"" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as
develop ""data habits of mind"" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and
second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of
reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing
students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and
reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world
scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.

phenomena and devices. Thus, the development of ab initio methods that allow
for an accurate and computationally inexpensive treatment of charge-transfer
excitations is a topic that nowadays attracts a lot of scientific attention. In
this paper we extend an approach recently introduced for the description of
single and double excitations (M. Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, Int. J.
Quantum Chem., (113), 690 (2013), M. Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, J.
Chem. Phys. (138), 124107 (2013)) to allow for the description of
intermolecular charge-transfer excitations. We describe an excitation where an
electron is transferred from a donor system to an acceptor one, keeping the
excited state orthogonal to the ground state and avoiding variational collapse.
These conditions are achieved by decomposing the space spanned by the
Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state orbitals into four subspaces: The subspace
spanned by the occupied orbitals that are localized in the region of the donor
molecule, the corresponding for the acceptor ones and two more subspaces
containing the virtual orbitals that are localized in the neighborhood of the
donor and the acceptor, respectively. Next, we create a Slater determinant with
a hole in the subspace of occupied orbitals of the donor and a particle in the
virtual subspace of the acceptor. Subsequently we optimize both the hole and
the particle by minimizing the HF energy functional in the corresponding
subspaces. Finally, we test our approach by calculating the lowest
charge-transfer excitation energies for a set of tetracyanoethylene-hydrocarbon
complexes, that have been used earlier as a test set for such kind of
excitations.

subsequent increase in the price of electricity in the market or, potentially

adversary gains control of a few meters, and is able to introduce spurious

  Multispectral and Hyperspectral Images",,,"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2296329",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predictive coding is attractive for compression onboard of spacecrafts thanks
to its low computational complexity, modest memory requirements and the ability
to accurately control quality on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Traditionally,
predictive compression focused on the lossless and near-lossless modes of
operation where the maximum error can be bounded but the rate of the compressed
image is variable. Rate control is considered a challenging problem for
predictive encoders due to the dependencies between quantization and prediction
in the feedback loop, and the lack of a signal representation that packs the
signal's energy into few coefficients. In this paper, we show that it is
possible to design a rate control scheme intended for onboard implementation.
In particular, we propose a general framework to select quantizers in each
spatial and spectral region of an image so as to achieve the desired target
rate while minimizing distortion. The rate control algorithm allows to achieve
lossy, near-lossless compression, and any in-between type of compression, e.g.,
lossy compression with a near-lossless constraint. While this framework is
independent of the specific predictor used, in order to show its performance,
in this paper we tailor it to the predictor adopted by the CCSDS-123 lossless
compression standard, obtaining an extension that allows to perform lossless,
near-lossless and lossy compression in a single package. We show that the rate
controller has excellent performance in terms of accuracy in the output rate,
rate-distortion characteristics and is extremely competitive with respect to
state-of-the-art transform coding.

For a sequence $\{w_n\}_{n=n_0}^\infty $ of positive numbers, define
  \[\mathcal H^\textbf{w}=\left\{\sum_{n=n_0}^\infty
a_nn^{-s}:\sum_{n=n_0}^\infty |a_n|^2 w_n<\infty\right\}.\] Hedenmalm,
Lindqvist and Seip considered the case in which $w_n\equiv 1$ and classified
the multiplier algebra of $\mathcal H^\textbf{w}$ for this space in \cite
{HLS}. In \cite{M}, McCarthy classified the multipliers on $\mathcal
H^\textbf{w}$ when the weights are given by
  \[w_n=\int_0^\infty n^{-2\sigma}d\mu(\sigma),\] where $\mu$ is a positive
Radon measure with $\{0\}$ in its support and $n_0$ is the smallest positive
integer for which this integral is finite. Similar results will be derived
assuming the weights are multiplicative, rather than given by a measure. In
particular, upper and lower bounds on the operator norms of the multipliers
will be obtained, in terms of their values on certain half planes, on the
Hilbert spaces resulting from these weights. Finally, some number theoretic
weight sequences will be explored and the multiplier algebras of the
corresponding Hilbert spaces determined up to isometric isomorphism, providing
examples where the conclusion of McCarthy's result holds, but under alternate

even less correlation. Within a cloud, the star formation rate volume and
surface densities increase rapidly with the corresponding gas densities, faster
than predicted by models using the free-fall time defined from the local
density. A model in which the star formation rate depends linearly on the mass
of gas above a visual extinction of 8 mag describes the data on these clouds,

specified as parity objectives. The qualitative-analysis problem given a
partial-observation stochastic game and a parity objective asks whether there
is a strategy to ensure that the objective is satisfied with probability~1
(resp. positive probability). These qualtitative-analysis problems are known to
be undecidable. However in many applications the relevant question is the
existence of finite-memory strategies, and the qualitative-analysis problems
under finite-memory strategies was recently shown to be decidable in 2EXPTIME.
We improve the complexity and show that the qualitative-analysis problems for
partial-observation stochastic parity games under finite-memory strategies are
EXPTIME-complete; and also establish optimal (exponential) memory bounds for
finite-memory strategies required for qualitative analysis.

popular, there has been increasing interest in the development of
capture-recapture models that can accommodate both imperfect detection and
misidentification of individuals (e.g., due to genotyping error). However,
current methods do not allow for individual variation in parameters, such as
detection or survival probability. Here we develop misidentification models for
capture-recapture data that can simultaneously account for temporal variation,
behavioral effects and individual heterogeneity in parameters. To facilitate
Bayesian inference using our approach, we extend standard probit regression
techniques to latent multinomial models where the dimension and zeros of the
response cannot be observed. We also present a novel Metropolis-Hastings within
Gibbs algorithm for fitting these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Using
closed population abundance models for illustration, we re-visit a DNA
capture-recapture population study of black bears in Michigan, USA and find
evidence of misidentification due to genotyping error, as well as temporal,
behavioral and individual variation in detection probability. We also estimate
a salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating
the effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish.
Our model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and
provided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability
that is attributable to variable mark quality. Our approach is more
computationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the
flexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while
properly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and
imperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit
formulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian
analysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data.

behavior in videos. Our approach is to learn the normative multiframe pixel
joint distribution and detect deviations from it using a likelihood based
approach. Due to the extreme lack of available training samples relative to the
dimension of the distribution, we use a mean and covariance approach and
consider methods of learning the spatio-temporal covariance in the low-sample
regime. Our approach is to estimate the covariance using parameter reduction
and sparse models. The first method considered is the representation of the
covariance as a sum of Kronecker products as in (Greenewald et al 2013), which
is found to be an accurate approximation in this setting. We propose learning
algorithms relevant to our problem. We then consider the sparse multiresolution
model of (Choi et al 2010) and apply the Kronecker product methods to it for
further parameter reduction, as well as introducing modifications for enhanced
efficiency and greater applicability to spatio-temporal covariance matrices. We
apply our methods to the detection of crowd behavior anomalies in the
University of Minnesota crowd anomaly dataset, and achieve competitive results.

Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT) with a non-trivial measure term in the
path integral. We are motivated to revisit this older formulation of dynamical
triangulations by hints from renormalization group approaches that gravity may
be asymptotically safe and by the emergence of a semiclassical phase in causal
dynamical triangulations (CDT). We study the phase diagram of this model and
identify the two phases that are well known from previous work: the branched
polymer phase and the collapsed phase. We verify that the order of the phase
transition dividing the branched polymer phase from the collapsed phase is
almost certainly first-order. The nontrivial measure term enlarges the phase
diagram, allowing us to explore a region of the phase diagram that has been
dubbed the crinkled region. Although the collapsed and branched polymer phases
have been studied extensively in the literature, the crinkled region has not
received the same scrutiny. We find that the crinkled region is likely a part
of the collapsed phase with particularly large finite-size effects.
Intriguingly, the behavior of the spectral dimension in the crinkled region at
small volumes is similar to that of CDT, as first reported in arXiv:1104.5505,
but for sufficiently large volumes the crinkled region does not appear to have
4-dimensional semiclassical features. Thus, we find that the crinkled region of
the EDT formulation does not share the good features of the extended phase of
CDT, as we first suggested in arXiv:1104.5505. This agrees with the recent
results of arXiv:1307.2270, in which the authors used a somewhat different
discretization of EDT from the one presented here.

  Govern the Static Magnetoelectric Effect in Multiferroic Materials",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive a sum rule to demonstrate that the static magnetoelectric (ME)
effect is governed by optical transitions that are simultaneously excited via
the electric and magnetic components of light. By a systematic analysis of
magnetic point groups, we show that the ME sum rule is applicable to a broad
variety of non-centrosymmetric magnets including ME multiferroic compounds. Due
to the dynamical ME effect, the optical excitations in these materials can
exhibit directional dichroism, i.e. the absorption coefficient can be different
for counter-propagating light beams. According to the ME sum rule, the
magnitude of the linear ME effect of a material is mainly determined by the
directional dichroism of its low-energy optical excitations. Application of the
sum rule to the multiferroic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, Sr$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ and
Ca$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ shows that in these compounds the static ME effect is
mostly governed by the directional dichroism of the spin-wave excitations in
the GHz-THz spectral range. On this basis, we argue that the studies of
directional dichroism and the application of ME sum rule can promote the
synthesis of new materials with large static ME effect.

  Experimental Results",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NIST SP800-22 (2010) proposes the state of art testing suite for (pseudo)
random generators to detect deviations of a binary sequence from randomness. On
the one hand, as a counter example to NIST SP800-22 test suite, it is easy to
construct functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by NIST
SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions are easily
distinguishable from the uniform distribution. Thus these functions are not
pseudorandom generators by definition. On the other hand, NIST SP800-22 does
not cover some of the important laws for randomness. Two fundamental limit
theorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law
of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Several frequency related tests in NIST
SP800-22 cover the central limit theorem while no NIST SP800-22 test covers
LIL.
  This paper proposes techniques to address the above challenges that NIST
SP800-22 testing suite faces. Firstly, we propose statistical distance based
testing techniques for (pseudo) random generators to reduce the above mentioned
Type II errors in NIST SP800-22 test suite. Secondly, we propose LIL based
statistical testing techniques, calculate the probabilities, and carry out
experimental tests on widely used pseudorandom generators by generating around
30TB of pseudorandom sequences. The experimental results show that for a sample
size of 1000 sequences (2TB), the statistical distance between the generated
sequences and the uniform distribution is around 0.07 (with $0$ for
statistically indistinguishable and $1$ for completely distinguishable) and the
root-mean-square deviation is around 0.005.

unknown interaction potential $V$ from external scattering data. Although we
seek a local (diagonally-dominated) $V$ as the solution to the posed problem,
we allow $V$ to be nonlocal at the intermediate stages of iterations. This
allows us to utilize the one-to-one correspondence between $V$ and the T-matrix
of the problem, $T$. Here it is important to realize that not every $T$
corresponds to a diagonal $V$ and we, therefore, relax the usual condition of
strict diagonality (locality) of $V$. An iterative algorithm is proposed in
which we seek $T$ that is (i) compatible with the measured scattering data and
(ii) corresponds to an interaction potential $V$ that is as
diagonally-dominated as possible. We refer to this algorithm as to the
data-compatible T-matrix completion (DCTMC). This paper is Part I in a two-part

Previous transmission spectra of very hot Jupiters have shown a lack of TiO and
VO, but only in planets that also appear to lack temperature inversions. We
measure the transmission spectrum of CoRoT-1b, a hot Jupiter that was predicted
to have a temperature inversion potentially due to significant TiO and VO in
its atmosphere. We employ the multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) method using the
SpeX and MORIS instruments on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and the
Gaussian Process method to model red noise. By using a simultaneous reference
star on the slit for calibration and a wide slit to minimize slit losses, we
achieve transit depth precision of 0.03% to 0.09%, comparable to the
atmospheric scale height but detect no statistically significant molecular
features. We combine our IRTF data with optical CoRoT transmission measurements
to search for differences in the optical and near infrared absorption that
would arise from TiO/VO. Our IRTF spectrum and the CoRoT photometry disfavor a
TiO/VO-rich spectrum for CoRoT-1b, suggesting that the atmosphere has another
absorber that could create a temperature inversion or that the blackbody-like
emission from the planet is due to a spectroscopically flat cloud, dust or haze
layer that smoothes out molecular features in both CoRoT-1b's emission and

Dark Energy (DE) modeling on galaxy formation via hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations. Dark MaGICC includes four dynamical Dark Energy scenarios with
time varying equations of state, one with a self-interacting Ratra-Peebles
model. In each scenario we simulate three galaxies with high resolution using
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The baryonic physics model is the same
used in the Making Galaxies in a Cosmological Context (MaGICC) project, and we
varied only the background cosmology. We find that the Dark Energy
parameterization has a surprisingly important impact on galaxy evolution and on
structural properties of galaxies at z=0, in striking contrast with predictions
from pure Nbody simulations. The different background evolutions can (depending
on the behavior of the DE equation of state) either enhance or quench star
formation with respect to a LCDM model, at a level similar to the variation of
the stellar feedback parameterization, with strong effects on the final galaxy
rotation curves. While overall stellar feedback is still the driving force in
shaping galaxies, we show that the effect of the Dark Energy parameterization
plays a larger role than previously thought, especially at lower redshifts. For
this reason, the influence of Dark Energy parametrization on galaxy formation
must be taken into account, especially in the era of precision cosmology.

brightness at L' rises sharply on both sides of the disk, which was also

mas per coordinate for a well-exposed star in a single image with a systematic
error less than 0.1 mas. We constructed calibrated astro-photometric catalogs

NGC 6388, NGC 104, and the James Webb Space Telescope calibration field in the
Large Magellanic Cloud. We make these catalogs and images electronically

our approach, we combined archival material taken with the optical wide-field

to achieve an excellent separation between cluster members and field objects

HST and HAWK-I data, we also study the radial distribution of the SGB

Relaxing the data coverage requirement the Hubble residual step with host mass
is $0.045\pm 0.026$ mag for the larger sample; a calculation using the modes of
the distributions, less sensitive to outliers, yields a step of 0.019 mag. The
analysis of this article uses K13 inferred luminosities, as distinguished from
previous works that use magnitude corrections as a function of SALT2 color and
stretch parameters: Steps at $>2\sigma $ significance are found in SALT2 Hubble
residuals in samples split by the values of their K13 $x(1)$ and $x(2)$
light-curve parameters. $x(1)$ affects the light-curve width and color around
peak (similar to the $\Delta m_{15}$ and stretch parameters), and $x(2)$
affects colors, the near-UV light-curve width, and the light-curve decline 20

parameter set, and magnitude corrections of K13 may be capturing features of

resolution and significance of the mass reconstruction compared to a previous
study based on Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images. We take care in
removing instrumental effects such as the trailing of charge due to radiation
damage of the ACS detector and the position-dependent point spread function
(PSF). This new ACS analysis confirms the previous claims that a substantial
amount of dark mass is present between two luminous subclusters. We examine the
distribution of cluster galaxies and observe very little light at this
location. We find that the centroid of the dark peak in the current ACS
analysis is offset to the southwest by ~1 arcmin with respect to the centroid
from the WFPC2 analysis. Interestingly, this new centroid is in better spatial
agreement with the location where the X-ray emission is strongest, and the
mass-to-light ratio estimated with this centroid is much higher 813+-78
M_sun/L_Rsun than the previous value; the aperture mass based on the WFPC2
centroid provides a slightly lower, but consistent mass. Although we cannot
provide a definite explanation for the presence of the dark peak, we discuss a
revised scenario, wherein dark matter with a more conventional range
sigma_DM/m_DM < 1 cm^2/g of self-interacting cross-section can lead to the
detection of this dark substructure. If supported by detailed numerical

without the need for every molecular or cellular interaction to be taken into
account has been challenging for many decades. Two competing approaches have
been the clonal selection theory and the idiotypic-network theory, each
stemming from a relatively separate set of principles. One recent perspective
holding the promise of unification is that of immunity as computation, that is,
of immunity as the process of computing the state of the body so that
protection can be effected, as well as boosted through learning. Here we
investigate the use of cellular automata (CA) as the core abstraction
supporting this new perspective. Our choice of CA for this role is based on the
potential variety of basins in a CA attractor field. Associating each basin
with a consistent set of body states, and moreover providing for the noisy
evolution of the CA in time so that jumping between basins is possible, have
provided the necessary backdrop. Given a CA rule to be followed by all cells
synchronously, our model is based on a probability with which each cell, at
each time step, independently updates its own state differently than the rule
mandates. Setting up and solving the corresponding Markov chain for its
stationary probabilities have revealed that already in the context of
elementary CA there exist rules that, while allowing transitions between
basins, display remarkable resiliency in terms of basin occupation. For these
rules, the long-run probability that the CA is found in a given basin is
practically the same as in the deterministic case when the initial CA state is
chosen uniformly at random. We argue that, consequently, our single-parameter
CA model may be a suitable abstraction of immunity as computation.

large three-dimensional systems. The local structure of the polymer matrix in
the vicinity of the nanoparticles is found to be different in many ways from
that of the corresponding bulk, both at the segment and the chain level. The
local polymer density profile near to the particle displays a maximum and the
bonds develop considerable orientation parallel to the nanoparticle surface.
The depletion layer thickness is also analyzed. The chains orient with their
longest dimension parallel to the surface of the particles. Their intrinsic

be a strong function of position relative to the interface. The dispersion of
many nanoparticles in the polymeric matrix leads to extension of the chains

on flow quantities such as the core trajectory and vorticity, and the shed
circulation. Vorticity contours, streaklines and streamlines are presented for
a range of Reynolds numbers $Re \in [250, 2000]$ and a range of times $t \in[0.

paper proposes a definition for the shed circulation at early as well as late

circulation shedding rate is found to be significant, but, interestingly, to
depend only slightly on the value of the Reynolds number. The shed circulation
and the vortex core trajectories follow scaling laws for inviscid self-similar
flow over several decades in time. Scaling laws describing the core vorticity,

significant interest in the star formation community. It is now viewed as a
common, though still poorly understood, phenomenon in low-mass star formation.
The FU Orionis objects (FUors) are long-studied examples of this phenomenon.
FUors are believed to undergo accretion outbursts during which the accretion
rate rapidly increases from typically $10^{-7}$ to a few $10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, and remains elevated over several decades or more. EXors, a loosely
defined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive
outbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the
two classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence
evolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct
classes, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur
in the same evolutionary phases? Over the past couple of decades, many
theoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin of
FUor and EXor outbursts. In parallel, such accretion bursts have been detected
at an increasing rate, and as observing techniques improve each individual
outburst is studied in increasing detail. We summarize key observations of
pre-main sequence star outbursts, and review the latest thinking on outburst
triggering mechanisms, the propagation of outbursts from star/disk to disk/jet
systems, the relation between classical EXors and FUors, and newly discovered
outbursting sources -- all of which shed new light on episodic accretion. We
finally highlight some of the most promising directions for this field in the

modules: 84 microPET R4 block detectors with 2.2 mm crystals to provide a large
detecting area; and 32 Inveon block detectors with 1.5 mm crystals to provide
higher spatial resolution. Outputs of the four microPET block detectors in a
modular housing are concatenated by a custom printed circuit board to match the
output characteristics of an Inveon detector. All the detectors are read out by
QuickSilver electronics. The detector modules are configured to full rings with
a 15 cm diameter trans-axial field of view (FOV) for dynamic tomographic
imaging of small plants. Potentially, the Inveon detectors can be reconfigured
to quarter-rings to get a 25 cm FOV using step-and-shoot motion. The imager
contains 2 linear stages to position detectors at different heights for
multi-bed scanning, and 2 rotation stages to collect coincidence events from
all angles. The PET system has been built and integrated into the PGC. The
system has a typical energy resolution of 15% for Inveon blocks and 24% for R4
blocks; timing resolution of 1.8 ns; and sensitivity of 1.3%,1.4%,3.0% measured
at center of FOV, 5 cm off to R4 half-ring and 5 cm off to Inveon half-ring,
respectively(with a 350-650 KeV energy and 3.1 ns timing window). System
spatial resolution is similar to that of commercial microPET sytems, with 1.25
mm rod sources in the micro-Derenzo phantom resolved using ML-EM algorithm.
Preliminary imaging experiments using different plants labeled with 11C-CO2

each transmitter is connected to the receiver having the same index as well as

When the backhaul load is constrained to an integer level B, the asymptotic per

cooperation constraint and that the optimal coding scheme relies only on

widely applied to real-world optimization problems in different fields. In this
study, a novel population-based across neighbourhood search (ANS) is proposed
for numerical optimization. ANS is motivated by two straightforward assumptions
and three important issues raised in improving and designing efficient PBSAs.
In ANS, a group of individuals collaboratively search the solution space for an
optimal solution of the optimization problem considered. A collection of
superior solutions found by individuals so far is maintained and updated
dynamically. At each generation, an individual directly searches across the
neighbourhoods of multiple superior solutions with the guidance of a Gaussian
distribution. This search manner is referred to as across neighbourhood search.
The characteristics of ANS are discussed and the concept comparisons with other
PBSAs are given. The principle behind ANS is simple. Moreover, ANS is easy for
implementation and application with three parameters being required to tune.
Extensive experiments on 18 benchmark optimization functions of different types
show that ANS has well balanced exploration and exploitation capabilities and
performs competitively compared with many efficient PBSAs (Related Matlab codes
used in the experiments are available from

quantum communication. Atoms or ions as well as color centers in crystals offer
suitable two-level systems for absorbing incoming photons. To obtain a reliable
transfer of coherence, strong enough light-matter interaction is required,
which may enforce use of ensembles of absorbers, but has the disadvantage of
unavoidable inhomogeneities leading to fast dephasing. This obstacle can be
overcome by echo techniques that allow recovery of the information as long as
the coherence is preserved. Albeit semiconductor quantum structures appear
appealing for information storage due to the large oscillator strength of
optical transitions, inhomogeneity typically is even more pronounced for them
and most importantly the optical coherence is limited to nanoseconds or
shorter. Here we show that by transferring the information to electron spins
the storage times for the optical coherence can be extended by orders of
magnitude up to the spin relaxation time. From the spin reservoir it can be
retrieved on purpose by inducing a stimulated photon echo. We demonstrate this
for an n-doped CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well for which the storage time thereby
could be increased by more than three orders of magnitude from the

enhances the energy gap between bulk and Dirac surface states and preserves the

for many practical prediction and decision-making tasks. There are two main
categories of methods for building calibrated classifiers. One approach is to
develop methods for learning probabilistic models that are well-calibrated, ab
initio. The other approach is to use some post-processing methods for
transforming the output of a classifier to be well calibrated, as for example
histogram binning, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression. One advantage of the
post-processing approach is that it can be applied to any existing
probabilistic classification model that was constructed using any
machine-learning method.
  In this paper, we first introduce two measures for evaluating how well a
classifier is calibrated. We prove three theorems showing that using a simple
histogram binning post-processing method, it is possible to make a classifier
be well calibrated while retaining its discrimination capability. Also, by
casting the histogram binning method as a density-based non-parametric binary
classifier, we can extend it using two simple non-parametric density estimation
methods. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed calibration methods on
synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed
methods either outperform or are comparable to existing calibration methods.

multi-Josephson-junction loops and the ultracold gases in periodic potentials.
Employing a close analogy between the above-mentioned setups and the simplest

considerable importance also in treating the strongly-nonequilibrium phase
transitions of Higgs fields in the early Universe. Particularly, they should
substantially reduce the number of topological defects (e.g., domain walls)
expected due to independent establishment of the new phases in the remote
spatial regions. This gives us a hint for resolving a long-standing problem of
the excessive concentration of topological defects, inconsistent with
observational constraints. The same effect may be also relevant to the recent
problem of the anomalous behavior of cosmic microwave background fluctuations

not increase monotonically with the increasing strength of SOC. These

with respect to a pseudo-metric tensor associated to random fluctuations
affecting increments of only a sub-set of the degrees of freedom. Systems in
this class are often encountered in applications as elementary models of
Hamiltonian dynamics in an heat bath eventually relaxing to a Boltzmann steady
state.
  Entropy production control in Langevin-Kramers models differs from the now
well-understood case of Langevin-Smoluchowski dynamics for two reasons. First,
the definition of entropy production stemming from fluctuation theorems
specifies a cost functional which does not act coercively on all degrees of
freedom of control protocols. Second, the presence of a symplectic structure
imposes a non-local constraint on the class of admissible controls. Using
Pontryagin control theory and restricting the attention to additive noise, we
show that smooth protocols attaining extremal values of the entropy production
appear generically in continuous parametric families as a consequence of a
trade-off between smoothness of the admissible protocols and non-coercivity of
the cost functional. Uniqueness is, however, always recovered in the
over-damped limit as extremal equations reduce at leading order to the
Monge-Amp\`ere-Kantorovich optimal mass transport equations.

characterized by broadband spectrum and strong non- linear energy transfers
during the development of intermittent events with finite-lifetime. To
understand the energy transfers that occur during the development of an extreme
event we perform a spatially localized analysis of the energy distribution

analysis of the Gabor coefficients reveals i) the low-dimensionality of the
intermittent structures, ii) the interplay between non-Gaussian statis- tical

critical scales (or critical Gabor coefficients) where a critical amount of

character of these special localized modes directly through the system equation

nonlinearity, the wave dispersion, and the wave dissipation which mimics wave
breaking. These localized instabilities are triggered by random localizations
of energy in space, created by the dispersive propagation of low-amplitude

function (IMF) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function of
galaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom heavy IMFs. These bottom
heavy IMFs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,
and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and black
holes. In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of
black holes and neutron stars based on the power-law IMF variation required to
reproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then
test whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray
binary populations (LMXBs) of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, a
neutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their
number is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes and
neutron stars present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band
light is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore
demonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to
those now dominating the K-band light, and are consistent with an invariant
IMF. Our results are inconsistent with an IMF which varies from a
Kroupa/Chabrier like IMF for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law IMF (with
slope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. We discuss how these observations
constrain the possible forms of the IMF variations and how future Chandra
observations can enable sharper tests of the IMF.

for transmitting information in nanonetworks. In this work, we focus on a
diffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an
absorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is
removed from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first
passage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.
In 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time
distribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end
simulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive
symbols.
  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol
duration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main
challenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in
the following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.
End-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol
interference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI
cancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the
effect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are
considered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints
on transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a
carrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this
purpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the
symbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved
more than frequency-based modulations.

delocalized and the AFM order disappears at a small doping level $y = 0.05$. In
both electron- and hole-doped systems, the suppression of $T_\mathrm{N}$ is
well correlated with the increase of the Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma$ in

that the superior thermal conductivity of graphene is contributed not only by
large ballistic thermal conductance but also by very long phonon mean free path
(MFP). The long phonon MFP, explained by the low-dimensional nature and high
sample purity of graphene, results in important isotope effects and size
effects on thermal conduction. In terms of various scattering mechanisms in
graphene, several approaches are suggested to control thermal conductivity.
Among them, introducing rough boundaries and weakly-coupled interfaces are
promising ways to suppress thermal conduction effectively. We also discuss the

that imposes consistency to an underdetermined system of linear equations finds
use in a large number of practical applications, including vector quantization,
approximate nearest neighbor search, peak-to-average power ratio (or ""crest
factor"") reduction in communication systems, and peak force minimization in
robotics and control. This paper analyzes the fundamental properties of signal
representations obtained by solving such a convex optimization problem. We
develop bounds on the maximum magnitude of such representations using the
uncertainty principle (UP) introduced by Lyubarskii and Vershynin, and study
the efficacy of $\ell_{\infty}$-norm-based dynamic range reduction. Our
analysis shows that matrices satisfying the UP, such as randomly subsampled
Fourier or i.i.d. Gaussian matrices, enable the computation of what we call
democratic representations, whose entries all have small and similar magnitude,
as well as low dynamic range. To compute democratic representations at low
computational complexity, we present two new, efficient convex optimization
algorithms. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of democratic representations
for dynamic range reduction in a DVB-T2-based broadcast system.

structure, and that may be reasonably implemented. In addressing update, we
first provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base.
While this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark Katsuno-Mendelzon
update postulates, not all of the postulates are satisfied. Other
Katsuno-Mendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the
syntactic form of the sentence for update, as we show. In restricting the
syntactic form of the sentence for update, we also obtain a hierarchy of update
operators with Winsletts standard semantics as the most basic interesting
approach captured. We subsequently give an algorithm which captures this
approach; in the general case the algorithm is exponential, but with some
not-unreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size
of the knowledge base. Hence the resulting approach has much better complexity
characteristics than other operators in some situations. We also explore other
compositional belief change operators: erasure is developed as a dual operator
to update; we show that a forget operator is definable in terms of update; and

(ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art
beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining
the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model
is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood
and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization)
are proposed to learn the model parameters.
  Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first,
to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for
general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency
between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle
filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed
full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based
approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing

domain structures that underly tractability (e.g., conditional independence)
fail there (e.g., world features become correlated). Our work departs from
traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models. In

accumulated information on bounds of all values and on processing concurrently
a queue of candidate goals for the next move back. The AFB-BJ algorithm is

distinguished. That is what is done, for example, in Cumulative Prospect
Theory. However, contraryto the latter framework that presupposes genuine
numerical assessments, human agents often decide on the basis of an ordinal
ranking of the pros and the cons, and by focusing on the most salient
arguments. In other terms, the decision process is qualitative as well as
bipolar. In this article, based on a bipolar extension of possibility theory,
we define and axiomatically characterize several decision rules tailored for
the joint handling of positive and negative arguments in an ordinal setting.
The simplest rules can be viewed as extensions of the maximin and maximax
criteria to the bipolar case, and consequently suffer from poor decisive power.
More decisive rules that refine the former are also proposed. These refinements
agree both with principles of efficiency and with the spirit of
order-of-magnitude reasoning, that prevails in qualitative decision theory. The
most refined decision rule uses leximin rankings of the pros and the cons, and
the ideas of counting arguments of equal strength and cancelling pros by cons.

subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a
stochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into

were conducted to compare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree
learners. The results show that for the majority of domains ACT produces
significantly less costly trees. ACT also exhibits good anytime behavior with

agents. Each agent ranks all the possible alternatives, and based on this, an
aggregate ranking of the alternatives (or at least a winning alternative) is
produced. However, when there are many alternatives, it is impractical to
simply ask agents to report their complete preferences. Rather, the agents
preferences, or at least the relevant parts thereof, need to be elicited. This
is done by asking the agents a (hopefully small) number of simple queries about
their preferences, such as comparison queries, which ask an agent to compare
two of the alternatives. Prior work on preference elicitation in voting has
focused on the case of unrestricted preferences. It has been shown that in this
setting, it is sometimes necessary to ask each agent (almost) as many queries
as would be required to determine an arbitrary ranking of the alternatives. In
contrast, in this paper, we focus on single-peaked preferences. We show that
such preferences can be elicited using only a linear number of comparison
queries, if either the order with respect to which preferences are
single-peaked is known, or at least one other agents complete preferences are
known. We show that using a sublinear number of queries does not suffice. We
also consider the case of cardinally single-peaked preferences. For this case,
we show that if the alternatives cardinal positions are known, then an agents
preferences can be elicited using only a logarithmic number of queries;
however, we also show that if the cardinal positions are not known, then a
sublinear number of queries does not suffice. We present experimental results
for all elicitation algorithms. We also consider the problem of only eliciting
enough information to determine the aggregate ranking, and show that even for
this more modest objective, a sublinear number of queries per agent does not
suffice for known ordinal or unknown cardinal positions. Finally, we discuss
whether and how these techniques can be applied when preferences are almost

  We introduce a new MARL algorithm called the Weighted Policy Learner (WPL),
which allows agents to reach a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in benchmark
2-player-2-action games with minimum knowledge. Using WPL, the only feedback an
agent needs is its own local reward (the agent does not observe other agents

outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in a more realistic setting of 100

  An important aspect of understanding the behavior of a MARL algorithm is
analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm: how the policies of multiple learning
agents evolve over time as agents interact with one another. Such an analysis
not only verifies whether agents using a given MARL algorithm will eventually
converge, but also reveals the behavior of the MARL algorithm prior to
convergence. We analyze our algorithm in two-player-two-action games and show
that symbolically proving WPLs convergence is difficult, because of the
non-linear nature of WPLs dynamics, unlike previous MARL algorithms that had
either linear or piece-wise-linear dynamics. Instead, we numerically solve WPLs

representative of the underlying semantic properties; however, unlike expert
annotations, they are noisy: lay authors may use different labels to denote the
same property, and some labels may be missing. To learn using such noisy

keyphrases. The paraphrase structure is linked with a latent topic model of the
review texts, enabling the system to predict the properties of unannotated

framework for such problems, we use the decentralized partially observable
Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP). Though much work has been done on optimal
dynamic programming algorithms for the single-agent version of the problem,
optimal algorithms for the multiagent case have been elusive. The main
contribution of this paper is an optimal policy iteration algorithm for solving
DEC-POMDPs. The algorithm uses stochastic finite-state controllers to represent
policies. The solution can include a correlation device, which allows agents to
correlate their actions without communicating. This approach alternates between
expanding the controller and performing value-preserving transformations, which
modify the controller without sacrificing value. We present two efficient
value-preserving transformations: one can reduce the size of the controller and
the other can improve its value while keeping the size fixed. Empirical results
demonstrate the usefulness of value-preserving transformations in increasing
value while keeping controller size to a minimum. To broaden the applicability
of the approach, we also present a heuristic version of the policy iteration
algorithm, which sacrifices convergence to optimality. This algorithm further
reduces the size of the controllers at each step by assuming that probability
distributions over the other agents actions are known. While this assumption
may not hold in general, it helps produce higher quality solutions in our test
problems.

quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual

the principles of classical game theory, may lead to sub-optimal solutions in a
class of problems named social dilemmas. In contrast, humans generally do not
have much difficulty with social dilemmas, as they are able to balance personal
benefit and group benefit. As agents in multi-agent systems are regularly
confronted with social dilemmas, for instance in tasks such as resource
allocation, these agents may benefit from the inclusion of mechanisms thought
to facilitate human fairness. Although many of such mechanisms have already
been implemented in a multi-agent systems context, their application is usually
limited to rather abstract social dilemmas with a discrete set of available
strategies (usually two). Given that many real-world examples of social
dilemmas are actually continuous in nature, we extend this previous work to
more general dilemmas, in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space.
The social dilemma under study here is the well-known Ultimatum Game, in which
an optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy. We
investigate whether a scale-free interaction network facilitates agents to
reach agreement, especially in the presence of fixed-strategy agents that
represent a desired (e.g. human) outcome. Moreover, we study the influence of
rewiring in the interaction network. The agents are equipped with
continuous-action learning automata and play a large number of random pairwise
games in order to establish a common strategy. From our experiments, we may
conclude that results obtained in discrete-strategy games can be generalized to
continuous-strategy games to a certain extent: a scale-free interaction network
structure allows agents to achieve agreement on a common strategy, and rewiring
in the interaction network greatly enhances the agents ability to reach
agreement. However, it also becomes clear that some alternative mechanisms,
such as reputation and volunteering, have many subtleties involved and do not

creation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to
efficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective
coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.
Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many
possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually
requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the
coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it
was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a
combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one
coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.
However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging
due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows
exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many
algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques
ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search
all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution
quality, and memory requirements.
  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition
structure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel
representation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible
solutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower
bounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are
then used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the
optimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches
through the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound
technique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).
In this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition
structures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions
automatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop
a new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable
benchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.
Given this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able
to find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the
fastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if
interrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a
solution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.
Moreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are
significantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art
algorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case
distribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient
solution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.

that the complexity of the complete translation is exponential in a parameter

for several applications. Figuring prominently among these is automated Web
Service Composition (WSC) at the ""capability"" level, where services are
described in terms of preconditions and effects over ontological concepts. A
key issue in addressing WSC as planning is that ontologies are not only formal
vocabularies; they also axiomatize the possible relationships between concepts.
Such axioms correspond to what has been termed ""integrity constraints"" in the
actions and change literature, and applying a web service is essentially a
belief update operation. The reasoning required for belief update is known to
be harder than reasoning in the ontology itself. The support for belief update
is severely limited in current planning tools.
  Our first contribution consists in identifying an interesting special case of
WSC which is both significant and more tractable. The special case, which we
term ""forward effects"", is characterized by the fact that every ramification of
a web service application involves at least one new constant generated as
output by the web service. We show that, in this setting, the reasoning
required for belief update simplifies to standard reasoning in the ontology
itself. This relates to, and extends, current notions of ""message-based"" WSC,
where the need for belief update is removed by a strong (often implicit or
informal) assumption of ""locality"" of the individual messages. We clarify the
computational properties of the forward effects case, and point out a strong
relation to standard notions of planning under uncertainty, suggesting that
effective tools for the latter can be successfully adapted to address the
former.
  Furthermore, we identify a significant sub-case, named ""strictly forward
effects"", where an actual compilation into planning under uncertainty exists.
This enables us to exploit off-the-shelf planning tools to solve message-based
WSC in a general form that involves powerful ontologies, and requires reasoning
about partial matches between concepts. We provide empirical evidence that this
approach may be quite effective, using Conformant-FF as the underlying planner.

imprecision, to derive the rule to update beliefs under incompleteness that
logically follows from our assumptions, and that we call conservative inference
rule. This rule has some remarkable properties: it is an abstract rule to
update beliefs that can be applied in any situation or domain; it gives us the
opportunity to be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about the
incompleteness process, which is a necessary condition to draw reliable while
strong enough conclusions; and it is a coherent rule, in the sense that it

unrealistic in many real-world applications, where agents can, and often do,

default logic and autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we consider
circumscription as an interesting alternative approach to nonmonotonic DLs
that, in particular, supports defeasible inheritance in a natural way. We study
DLs extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and
under different constraints on the sets of minimized, fixed, and varying
predicates, and pinpoint the exact computational complexity of reasoning for
DLs ranging from ALC to ALCIO and ALCQO. When the minimized and fixed
predicates include only concept names but no role names, then reasoning is
complete for NExpTime^NP. It becomes complete for NP^NExpTime when the number
of minimized and fixed predicates is bounded by a constant. If roles can be
minimized or fixed, then complexity ranges from NExpTime^NP to undecidability.

satisfaction problem in which preferences among solutions can be expressed.
Bucket elimination is a complete technique commonly used to solve this kind of
constraint satisfaction problem. When the memory required to apply bucket
elimination is too high, a heuristic method based on it (denominated
mini-buckets) can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal solution.
Nevertheless, the curse of dimensionality makes these techniques impractical on
large scale problems. In response to this situation, we present a memetic
algorithm for WCSPs in which bucket elimination is used as a mechanism for
recombining solutions, providing the best possible child from the parental set.
Subsequently, a multi-level model in which this exact/metaheuristic hybrid is
further hybridized with branch-and-bound techniques and mini-buckets is
studied. As a case study, we have applied these algorithms to the resolution of
the maximum density still life problem, a hard constraint optimization problem
based on Conways game of life. The resulting algorithm consistently finds
optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current
approaches. Moreover, it is shown that this proposal provides new best known
solutions for very large instances.

proved to be NP-hard for Markov networks due to the difficulty of estimating
the parameters of the network, needed for the computation of the data
likelihood. The independence-based approach does not require the computation of
the likelihood, and thus both GSMN* and GSIMN can compute the structure
efficiently (as shown in our experiments). GSMN* is an adaptation of the
Grow-Shrink algorithm of Margaritis and Thrun for learning the structure of
Bayesian networks. GSIMN extends GSMN* by additionally exploiting Pearls
well-known properties of the conditional independence relation to infer novel
independences from known ones, thus avoiding the performance of statistical
tests to estimate them. To accomplish this efficiently GSIMN uses the Triangle
theorem, also introduced in this work, which is a simplified version of the set
of Markov axioms. Experimental comparisons on artificial and real-world data
sets show GSIMN can yield significant savings with respect to GSMN*, while
generating a Markov network with comparable or in some cases improved quality.
We also compare GSIMN to a forward-chaining implementation, called GSIMN-FCH,
that produces all possible conditional independences resulting from repeatedly
applying Pearls theorems on the known conditional independence tests. The
results of this comparison show that GSIMN, by the sole use of the Triangle
theorem, is nearly optimal in terms of the set of independences tests that it

stability against coalitional deviations, in that the benefits from a joint
deviation are bounded. In this sense, NE approximates strong equilibrium.
  Coalition formation is a key issue in multiagent systems. We provide a
framework for quantifying the stability and the performance of various
assignment policies and solution concepts in the face of coalitional
deviations. Within this framework we evaluate a given configuration according
to three measures: (i) IR_min: the maximal number alpha, such that there exists
a coalition in which the minimal improvement ratio among the coalition members
is alpha, (ii) IR_max: the maximal number alpha, such that there exists a
coalition in which the maximal improvement ratio among the coalition members is

of revenue. Such cooperation can improve the capacity of the WRN, and thus
throughput for terminal devices (TDs). However, this cooperation can be
realized only if fair allocation of aggregated utility, which is the sum of the
utility of all the cooperative SPs, can be achieved. In this paper, we
investigate the WRN consisting of SPs at the upper layer and TDs at the lower
layer and present a game theoretic framework to address the cooperation
decision making problem in the WRN. Specifically, the cooperation of SPs is
modeled as an overlapping coalition formation game, in which SPs should form a
stable coalitional structure and obtain a fair share of the aggregated utility.
We also study the problem of allocating aggregated utility based on the concept
of Shapley value, which stabilizes the cooperation of SPs in the WRN. The
cooperation of TDs is modeled as a network formation game, in which TDs
establish links among each other to form a stable network structure. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithm obtains the

momentum components of a light beam is to flatten the spiral phase front of a
mode, in order to couple it to a single-mode optical fiber. This method,
however, suffers from an efficiency that depends on the orbital angular
momentum of the initial mode and on the presence of higher order radial modes.
The reason is that once the phase has been flattened, the field retains its
ringed intensity pattern and is therefore a nontrivial superposition of purely
radial modes, of which only the fundamental one couples to a single mode
optical fiber. In this paper, we study the efficiency of this technique both
theoretically and experimentally. We find that even for low values of the OAM,
a large amount of light can fall outside the fundamental mode of the fiber, and
we quantify the losses as functions of the waist of the coupling beam of the
orbital angular momentum and radial indices. Our results can be used as a tool
to remove the efficiency bias where fair-sampling loopholes are not a concern.
However, we hope that our study will encourage the development of better
detection methods of the orbital angular momentum content of a beam of light.

of massive black holes (MBH) and coevolution with their host spheroids. We
estimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both
assuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent
numerical simulations. The angular momentum of gas joining the accretion disk
determines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a MBH can
reach. The latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and in
galaxies with low-angular momentum gas the MBH can get to a higher mass. When
the host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishing
and circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscured
accretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to an
Eddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude. Our model predicts that
the ratio of MBH accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e2 or higher,
leading, at early epochs, to a ratio of MBH to stellar mass higher than the
""canonical"" value of ~1e-3, in agreement with current observations. Our model
makes specific predictions that long-lived super-critical accretion occurs only

described by the Hubbard model with an external confining potential. We discuss
the universal behaviors of systems in different regimes: from few particles,
i.e. in dilute regime, to the trap thermodynamic limit.
  The asymptotic trap-size (TS) dependence in the dilute regime (increasing the
trap size l keeping the particle number N fixed) is described by a universal TS
scaling controlled by the dilute fixed point associated with the
metal-to-vacuum quantum transition. This scaling behavior is numerically
checked by DMRG simulations of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model. In
particular, the particle density and its correlations show crossovers among
different regimes: for strongly repulsive interactions they approach those of a
spinless Fermi gas, for weak interactions those of a free Fermi gas, and for
strongly attractive interactions they match those of a gas of hard-core bosonic
molecules.
  The large-N behavior of systems at fixed N/l corresponds to a 1D trap
thermodynamic limit. We address issues related to the accuracy of the local
density approximation (LDA). We show that the particle density approaches its
LDA in the large-l limit. When the trapped system is in the metallic phase,
corrections at finite l are O(l^{-1}) and oscillating around the center of the
trap. They become significantly larger at the boundary of the fermion cloud,
where they get suppressed as O(l^{-1/3}) only. This anomalous behavior arises
from the nontrivial scaling at the metal-to-vacuum transition occurring at the
boundaries of the fermion cloud.

missions selected by the European Space Agency for an initial assessment phase
in the Cosmic Vision programme. It is proposed for the M3 launch slot and has
broad scientific goals related to fast timing of astrophysical X-ray sources.
LOFT will carry the Large Area Detector (LAD), as one of the two core science
instruments, necessary to achieve the challenging objectives of the project.
LAD is a collimated detector working in the energy range 2-50 keV with an
effective area of approximately 10 m^2 at 8 keV.
  The instrument comprises an array of modules located on deployable panels.
Lead-glass microchannel plate (MCP) collimators are located in front of the
large-area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) to reduce the background contamination
from off-axis resolved point sources and from the diffuse X-ray background. The
inner walls of the microchannel plate pores reflect grazing incidence X-ray
photons with a probability that depends on energy. In this paper, we present a
study performed with an ad-hoc simulator of the effects of this capillary
reflectivity on the overall instrument performance. The reflectivity is derived
from a limited set of laboratory measurements, used to constrain the model. The
measurements were taken using a prototype collimator whose thickness is similar
to that adopted in the current baseline design proposed for the LAD.
  We find that the experimentally measured level of reflectivity of the pore
inner walls enhances the off-axis transmission at low energies, producing an
almost flat-top response. The resulting background increase due to the diffuse
cosmic X-ray emission and sources within the field of view does not degrade the
instrument sensitivity.

percolation from explosive (Achlioptas) percolation, under noise. A statistical
model of percolation is constructed allowing for the birth and death of edges
as well as the presence of noise in the observations. This graph-valued
stochastic process is composed of a latent and an observed non-stationary
process, where the observed graph process is corrupted by Type I and Type II
errors. This produces a hidden Markov graph model. We show that for certain
choices of parameters controlling the noise, the classical (ER) percolation is
visually indistinguishable from the explosive (Achlioptas) percolation model.
In this setting, we compare two different criteria for discriminating between
these two percolation models, based on a quantile difference (QD) of the first
component's size and on the maximal size of the second largest component. We
show through data simulations that this second criterion outperforms the QD of
the first component's size, in terms of discriminatory power. The maximal size
of the second component therefore provides a useful statistic for
distinguishing between the ER and Achlioptas models of percolation, under
physically motivated conditions for the birth and death of edges, and under
noise. The potential application of the proposed criteria for percolation
detection in clinical neuroscience is also discussed.

exchange information only via a relay node, i.e., a direct link between both
users is not present. We assume that channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) is not available and/or only one coding and modulation
scheme is used at the transmitters due to complexity constraints. Thus, the
nodes transmit with a fixed predefined rate regardless of the channel state
information (CSI). In general, the nodes in the network can assume one of three
possible states in each time slot, namely the transmit, receive, and silent
state. Most of the existing protocols assume a fixed schedule for the sequence
of the states of the nodes. In this paper, we abandon the restriction of having
a fixed and predefined schedule and propose a new protocol which, based on the
CSI at the receiver (CSIR), selects the optimal states of the nodes in each
time slot such that the sum throughput is maximized. To this end, the relay has
to be equipped with two buffers for storage of the information received from
the two users. Numerical results show that the proposed protocol significantly
outperforms the existing protocols.

residual self-interference stemming from phase noise in two alternative cases
of having either independent oscillators or the same oscillator at the
transmitter and receiver chains of the full-duplex transceiver. The results
show that phase noise has a severe effect on self-interference cancellation in
both of the considered cases, and that by using the common oscillator in
upconversion and downconversion results in clearly lower residual
self-interference levels. The results also show that it is in general vital to
use high quality oscillators in full-duplex transceivers, or have some means
for phase noise estimation and mitigation in order to suppress its effects. One
of the main findings is that in practical scenarios the subcarrier-wise
phase-noise spread of the multipath components of the self-interference channel
causes most of the residual phase-noise effect when high amounts of
self-interference cancellation is desired.

after sunset it is also an occasion for family and social gatherings.
Therefore, according to the Bertillon-Durkheim conception of suicide (that is
based on the strength of social ties), one would expect a fall in suicide rates
during Ramadan. Is this conjecture confirmed by observation? That is the
question addressed in the present paper. Surprisingly, the most tricky part of
the investigation was to find reliable monthly suicide data. In the Islamic
world Turkey seems to be the only country whose statistical institute publishes
such observations. The data reveal indeed a fall of about $15\%$ in suicide
numbers during the month of Ramadan (with respect to same-non-Ramadan months).
As the standard deviation is only $4.7\%$ this effect has a high degree of
significance. This observation, along with the fact that other occasions of
social gathering such as Thanksgiving or Christmas are also marked by a drop in
suicides, adds further credence to the B-D thesis.

including high ionization coronal lines from the narrow line region (NLR)
illuminated by the ionizing continuum, and hot dust features from grains, as
well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) features from star formation in
the host galaxy. Few features are detected in most spectra because of typically
low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) data. By generating spectral composites in
three different luminosity bins from over 180 Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph
(IRS) observations, we boost the S/N and reveal important features in the
complex spectra. We detect high-ionization, forbidden emission lines in all
templates, PAH features in all but the most luminous objects, and broad
silicate and graphite features in emission whose strength increases relative to
the continuum with luminosity. We find that the intrinsic quasar spectrum for
all luminosity templates is consistent, and the differences in the spectra can
be explained by host galaxy contamination in the lower luminosity templates. We
also posit that star formation may be active in most quasar host galaxies, but
the spectral features of star formation are only detectable if the quasar is
faint.

nonidealities of full-duplex devices. In this paper, the effect of nonlinear
distortion occurring in the transmitter power amplifier (PA) and the receiver
chain is analyzed, alongside with the dynamic range requirements of
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This is done with detailed system
calculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics
components to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including
self-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic
range for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the
analog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide
comprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The
analytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations. We
observe that the nonlinear distortion produced by the transmitter PA is a
significant issue in a full-duplex transceiver and, when using cheaper and less
linear components, also the receiver chain nonlinearities become considerable.
It is also shown that, with digitally-intensive self-interference cancellation,
the quantization noise of the ADCs is another significant problem.

theory, with fermion parity playing the role of the gauged global symmetry.
Quantum phase slips lift the ground state degeneracy associated with unpaired
Majorana edge modes at the ends of the chain, a change that can be understood
as a transition between the confined and the Higgs-mechanism regimes of the
gauge theory. We identify the quantization of thermal conductance at the
transition as a robust experimental feature separating the two regimes. We
explain this result by establishing a relation between thermal conductance and
the Fredenhagen-Marcu string order-parameter for confinement in gauge theories.

Fields (EMF) and on optimization methods to reduce it. Within the FP7 LEXNET

components that impact exposure to EMF. The EI includes, among other, downlink
(DL) exposure induced by the base stations (BSs) and access points, the uplink
(UL) exposure induced by the devices in communication, and the corresponding
exposure time. Motivated by the EI definition, this paper develops stochastic
approximation based self-optimizing algorithm that dynamically adapts the
network to reduce the EI in a heterogeneous network with macro- and small
cells. It is argued that the increase of the small cells' coverage can, to a
certain extent, reduce the EI, but above a certain limit, will deteriorate DL
QoS. A load balancing algorithm is formulated that adapts the small cell'
coverage based on UL loads and a DL QoS indicator. The proof of convergence of
the algorithm is provided and its performance in terms of EI reduction is

have an impact on the solar tachocline and therefore on solar activity. We
checked the procedure and results of A12, namely the algorithm of planetary
tidal torque calculation and the wavelet coherence between torque and
heliospheric modulation potential. We found that the claimed peaks in
long-period range of the torque spectrum are artefacts caused by the
calculation algorithm. Also the statistical significance of the results of the
wavelet coherence is found to be overestimated by an incorrect choice of the
background assumption of red noise. Using a more conservative non-parametric
random phase method, we found that the long-period coherence between planetary
torque and heliospheric modulation potential becomes insignificant. Thus we
conclude that the considered hypothesis of planetary tidal influence on solar

of the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) from VISTA
Z-band observations. Generally, pulsation on the Sgr dSph giant branches
appears to be excited by the internal kappa mechanism. Pulsation amplitudes
appear identical between red and asymptotic (RGB/AGB) giant stars, and between
unreddened carbon and oxygen-rich stars at the same luminosity. The lack of
correlation between infrared excess and variability among oxygen-rich stars
indicates pulsations do not contribute significantly to wind driving in
oxygen-rich stars in the Sgr dSph, though the low amplitudes of these stars
mean this may not apply elsewhere. The dust-enshrouded carbon stars have the
highest amplitudes of the stars we observe. Only in these stars does an
external kappa-mechanism-driven pulsation seem likely, caused by variations in
their more-opaque carbon-rich molecules or dust. This may allow pulsation
driving of winds to be effective in carbon stars. Variability can be simplified
to a power law (amplitude proportional to L/T^2), as in other systems. In
total, we identify 3026 variable stars (with r.m.s. variability of delta Z >~
0.015 magnitudes), of which 176 are long-period variables associable with the
upper giant branches of the Sgr dSph. We also identify 324 candidate RR Lyrae
variables in the the Sgr dSph and 340 in the outer Galactic Bulge.

to be produced via inverse Compton scattering by hot and compact coronae near
the super massive black hole. However the origin and physical properties of the
coronae, including geometry, kinematics and dynamics, yet remain poorly known.
In this work, taking [OIV] 25.89um emission line as an isotropic indicator of
AGN's intrinsic luminosity, we compare the intrinsic corona X-ray emission
between Seyfert 1 and Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies, which are viewed at
different inclinations according to the unification scheme. We compile a sample
of 130 Compton-thin Seyfert galaxies with both [OIV] 25.89um line luminosities
measured with Spitzer-IRS and X-ray spectra observed by XMM-Newton, Chandra,
Suzaku or Swift. Known radio-loud sources are excluded. We fit the X-ray
spectra to obtain the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV continuum luminosities. We
find that Seyfert 1 galaxies are intrinsically brighter in intrinsic 2-10 keV
emission by a factor of 2.8+0.5-0.4 (2.2+0.9-0.3 in Swift-BAT 14-195 keV
emission), comparing with Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies. The Seyfert 1 and
Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies follow a statistically identical correlation
between the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and the 14-195 keV
luminosity, indicating that our absorption correction to the 2-10 keV flux is
sufficient. The difference in X-ray emission between the two populations is
thus unlikely due to X-ray absorption, and instead implies an intrinsic
anisotropy in the corona X-ray emission. This striking anisotropy of X-ray
emission can be explained by a bipolar outflowing corona with a bulk velocity
of ~0.3-0.5c. This would provide a natural link between the so-called coronae
and weak jets in these systems. Other consequences of outflowing coronae are
also discussed.

light curve of IGR$~$J17544$-$2619, no bright outbursts were observed, the
source spending the majority of the exposure at intermediate luminosities of
the order of several 10$^{33}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$ (0.5$\,-\,$10$\,$keV) and

a good description of the behaviour of IGR$~$J17544$-$2619, and suggest an
additional mechanism for generating outbursts based upon the mass accumulation
rate in the hot shell (atmosphere) that forms around the NS under the

reach our goal. Data are automatically analyzed at every orbital downlink by an
alert pipeline operating on different timescales. As proper flux thresholds are
exceeded, alerts are automatically generated and sent as SMS messages to
cellular telephones, e-mails, and push notifications of an application for
smartphones and tablets. These alerts are crosschecked with the results of two
pipelines, and a manual analysis is performed. Being a small scientific-class
mission, AGILE is characterized by optimization of both scientific analysis and
ground-segment resources. The system is capable of generating alerts within two

operators and their generalizations are important tools in establishing the
isotonicity of the metric projection onto some closed convex sets. The results
of this kind are motivated by metods for proving the existence of solutions of
variational inequalities and methods for finding these solutions in a recursive

are exactly the sets which are invariant with respect to these lattice-like
operations, called lattice-like sets. In this paper it is shown that the Jordan
subalgebras are lattice-like sets, but the converse in general is not true. In
the case of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras of rank at least three the
lattice-like property is rather restrictive, e.g., there are no lattice-like
proper closed convex sets with interior points.

the doping-temperature phase diagram. The highest critical temperature (Tc) is
obtained for the so-called ""optimum doping"". The doping mechanism is usually
chemical; it can be done by cationic substitution. This is the case, for
example, in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ where La3+ is replaced by Sr2+ thus adding
a hole to the CuO$_2$ planes. A similar effect is achieved by adding oxygen as
in the case of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ where $\delta$ represents the excess
oxygen in the sample. In this paper we report on a different mechanism, one
that enables the addition or removal of carriers from the surface of the HTSC.
This method utilizes a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of polar molecules
adsorbed on the cuprate surface. In the case of optically active molecules, the
polarity of the SAM can be modulated by shining light on the coated surface.
This results in a light-induced modulation of the superconducting phase

dynamics of a self-propelled swimmer heading towards the vortex center, and we
observe the subsequent capturing and scattering dynamics. We distinguish
between two major types of swimmers, those that tend to elongate
perpendicularly to the propulsion direction and those that pursue a parallel
elongation. While the first ones can get caught by the swirl, the second ones
were always observed to be scattered, which proposes a promising escape
strategy. This offers a route to design artificial microswimmers that show the
desired behavior in complicated flow fields. It should be straightforward to
verify our results in a corresponding quasi-two-dimensional experiment using

cross-layer optimization strategies or sensors-related applications. The
approach is based on what we refer to as ""reflective and refractive variables"".
Both types of variables are associated with external entities, e.g. sensors or
actuators. A reflective variable is a volatile variable, that is, a variable
that might be concurrently modified by multiple threads. A library of threads
is made available, each of which interfaces a set of sensors and continuously
update the value of a corresponding set of sensors. One such thread is ""cpu"",
which exports the current level of usage of the local CPU as an integer between
0 and 100. This integer is reflected into the integer reflective variable cpu.
A refractive variable is a reflective variable that can be modified. Each
modification is caught and interpreted as a request to change the value of an
actuator. For instance, setting variable ""tcp_sendrate"" would request a
cross-layer adjustment to the thread interfacing the local TCP layer entity.
This allows express in an easy way complex operations in the application layer
of any programming language, e.g. plain old C. We describe our translator and
the work we are carrying out within PATS to build simple and powerful libraries
of scripts based on reflective and refractive variables, including robotics
applications and RFID tags processing.

transform the problem to a concave maximization problem which maximizes the sum
secrecy rate of scalar wiretap channels subject to linear constraints on the

the case of Gaussian input, when used in the MIMO wiretap channel with

We then propose a power allocation scheme with an additional power constraint
which alleviates this secrecy rate loss problem, and gives non-zero secrecy
rates at high transmit powers.

systems require what Boulding called ""gestalts,"" namely concepts able to
""directing research towards the gaps which they reveal"". In this paper we
elaborate on this and show how such gestalts can pave the way towards novel
reformulations of traditional services able to reach a better and more sensible
management of the available resources and cope with their scarcity. Our vision

the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing has been proven via the

Such a list still does not exist. The theory also seems to ignore the undesired
free evolution of the quantum computer caused by the energy differences of
quantum states entering any given superposition. Another important point is
that the hypothetical quantum computer will be a system of at least a thousand

properties of the integral equation that determines the momentum evolution of
the effective gluon mass. A detailed, all-order analysis of the complete kernel
appearing in this particular equation reveals that the renormalization
procedure may be accomplished through the sole use of ingredients known from
the standard perturbative treatment of the theory, with no additional
assumptions. However, the subtle interplay of terms operating at the level of
the exact equation gets distorted by the approximations usually employed when
evaluating the aforementioned kernel. This fact is reflected in the form of the
obtained solutions, whose deviations from the correct behavior are best
quantified by resorting to appropriately defined renormalization-group
invariant quantities. This analysis, in turn, provides a solid guiding
principle for improving the form of the kernel, and furnishes a well-defined
criterion for discriminating between various possibilities. Certain
renormalization-group inspired Ans\""atze for the kernel are then proposed, and
their numerical implications are explored in detail. One of the solutions
obtained fulfills the theoretical expectations to a high degree of accuracy,
yielding a gluon mass that is positive-definite throughout the entire range of
physical momenta, and displays in the ultraviolet the so-called ""power-law""
running, in agreement with standard arguments based on the operator product
expansion. Some of the technical difficulties thwarting a more rigorous
determination of the kernel are discussed, and possible future directions are
briefly mentioned.

explain the observed distance-redshift relation without the need for dark

plane symmetric, and for which exact solutions are known in the fluid limit.
However, if perturbations are large, shell-crossing occurs and the fluid
approximation breaks down. This prevents the study of the most interesting
cases. Here we use a general-relativistic N-body simulation that does not
suffer from this problem and which allows us to go beyond previous works. We
show that even for very large plane-symmetric perturbations we are not able to
mimic the observed distance-redshift relation. We also discuss how the
synchronous comoving gauge breaks down when shell-crossing occurs, while metric
perturbations in the longitudinal gauge remain small. For this reason the
longitudinal (Newtonian) gauge appears superior for relativistic N-body

finite value at low frequency, in contrast to approaching zero as in the bulk

""problem of long longitudinal waves"" [1], which states that the thermal
conductivity of a material increases as its length is increased due to the
vanishing scattering for long-wavelength phonons. We show that this thermal
transport improvement also appears in nanowires as their diameter is decreased
below D=5nm (not only as the length increases) originating from the increase in
the density of the long wavevector modes. The observation is present under
ballistic transport conditions, and further enhanced with the introduction of
phonon-phonon scattering. Because of this, in such ultra-narrow nanowires, as
the diameter is reduced, phonon transport is dominated more and more by lower
energy phonons with longer mean-free paths. We show that ~80% of the heat is
carried by phonons with energies less than 5meV, most with mean-free paths of

improve F1 by 5%. An extension to the basic Resolver system allows it to handle
polysemous names with 97% precision and 95% recall on a data set from the TREC
corpus.

amounts of common sense and domain-specific world knowledge. Prior work in the
field was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of
background knowledge, on limited lexicographic knowledge bases such as WordNet,
or on huge manual efforts such as the CYC project. Here we propose a novel
method, called Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), for fine-grained semantic
interpretation of unrestricted natural language texts. Our method represents
meaning in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia, the
largest encyclopedia in existence. We explicitly represent the meaning of any
text in terms of Wikipedia-based concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
method on text categorization and on computing the degree of semantic
relatedness between fragments of natural language text. Using ESA results in
significant improvements over the previous state of the art in both tasks.
Importantly, due to the use of natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to
explain to human users.

identified using a series of queries against the web, and the cleft cases are
identified using a simple set of syntactic rules. The system is evaluated with
four sets of news articles containing 679 extrapositional cases as well as 78
cleft constructs. The identification results are comparable to those obtained

manner requires taking into account a wide range of factors pertaining to the
meaning the two fragments convey, and the pairwise relations between their
words. Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take
into account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such
a measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many
tasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we
present a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words
based on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word
thesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on
this approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness
between texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness
measure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We
gradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the
semantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word
similarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we
proceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text
semantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and
paraphrase recognition. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method
outperforms every lexicon-based method of semantic relatedness in the selected
tasks and the used data sets, and competes well against corpus-based and hybrid
approaches.

transfer rules to be used in a shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) system
from small parallel corpora. The structural transfer rules are based on
alignment templates, like those used in statistical MT. Alignment templates are
extracted from sentence-aligned parallel corpora and extended with a set of
restrictions which are derived from the bilingual dictionary of the MT system
and control their application as transfer rules. The experiments conducted
using three different language pairs in the free/open-source MT platform
Apertium show that translation quality is improved as compared to word-for-word
translation (when no transfer rules are used), and that the resulting
translation quality is close to that obtained using hand-coded transfer rules.
The method we present is entirely unsupervised and benefits from information in
the rest of modules of the MT system in which the inferred rules are applied.

within a nano-size cage formed by the ionic crystal lattice. Optical spectra
are measured of manganese doped beryl single crystal Mn:Be3Al2Si6O18, that
contains water molecules individually isolated in 0.51 nm diameter voids within
the crystal lattice. Two types of orientation are distinguished: water-I
molecules have their dipole moments aligned perpendicular to the c axis, and
dipole moments of water-II molecules are parallel to the c-axis. The optical
conductivity and permittivity spectra are recorded in terahertz and infrared
ranges, at frequencies from several wavenumbers up to 7000cm-1, at temperatures
from 5K to 300K and for two polarizations, when the electric vector E of the
radiation is parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis. Comparative experiments
on as-grown and on dehydrated samples allow to identify the conductivity and
permittivity spectra caused exclusively by water molecules. In the infrared
range well-known internal modes nu1, nu2 and nu3 of the H2O molecule are
observed for both polarizations, indicating the presence of water-I and
water-II molecules in the crystal. Spectra recorded below 1000cm-1 reveal a
rich set of highly anisotropic features in the low-energy response of H2O
molecule in a crystalline nanocage. While for E parallel to c only two
absorption peaks are detected, at 90cm-1 and 160cm-1, several absorption bands
are discovered for E perpendicular to c, each consisting of narrower
resonances. The bands are assigned to librational and translational vibrations
of water-I molecule that is weakly, via hydrogen bonds, coupled to the nanocage
walls. A model is presented that explains the fine structure of the bands by
splitting of the energy levels due to quantum tunneling between the minima in a
six-well potential relief felt by a molecule within the cage.

scarce satellite resources. Task clustering has been demonstrated to realize an
effective strategy to improve the efficiency of satellite scheduling. However,
the previous task clustering strategy is static. That is, it is integrated into
the scheduling in a two-phase manner rather than in a dynamic fashion, without
expressing its full potential in improving the satellite scheduling
performance. In this study, we present an adaptive Simulated Annealing based
scheduling algorithm aggregated with a dynamic task clustering strategy (or
ASA-DTC for short) for satellite observation scheduling problems (SOSPs).
First, we develop a formal model for the scheduling of Earth observing
satellites. Second, we analyze the related constraints involved in the
observation task clustering process. Thirdly, we detail an implementation of
the dynamic task clustering strategy and the adaptive Simulated Annealing
algorithm. The adaptive Simulated Annealing algorithm is efficient, with the
endowment of some sophisticated mechanisms, i.e. adaptive temperature control,
tabu-list based revisiting avoidance mechanism, and intelligent combination of
neighborhood structures. Finally, we report on experimental simulation studies
to demonstrate the competitive performance of ASA-DTC. Moreover, we show that
ASA-DTC is especially effective when SOSPs contain a large number of targets or
these targets are densely distributed in a certain area.

problem has no non-trivial ordinal solution with the traditional game-theoretic
bargaining model. Although the result is no longer true for bargaining problems
with more than two agents, none of the well known bargaining solutions are
ordinal. Searching for meaningful ordinal solutions, especially for the
bilateral bargaining problem, has been a challenging issue in bargaining theory
for more than three decades. This paper proposes a logic-based ordinal solution
to the bilateral bargaining problem. We argue that if a bargaining problem is
modeled in terms of the logical relation of players physical negotiation items,
a meaningful bargaining solution can be constructed based on the ordinal
structure of bargainers preferences. We represent bargainers demands in
propositional logic and bargainers preferences over their demands in total
preorder. We show that the solution satisfies most desirable logical
properties, such as individual rationality (logical version), consistency,
collective rationality as well as a few typical game-theoretic properties, such
as weak Pareto optimality and contraction invariance. In addition, if all
players demand sets are logically closed, the solution satisfies a fixed-point
condition, which says that the outcome of a negotiation is the result of mutual
belief revision. Finally, we define various decision problems in relation to
our bargaining model and study their computational complexity.
