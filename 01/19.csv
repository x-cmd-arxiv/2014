states, we investigate the coupled spin and orbital dynamics of a spin 1/2
particle in a harmonic potential subject to ultrastrong spin-orbit interaction
and external magnetic field. The advantage of these systems is the clear
visualization of the strong spin-orbit coupling in the orbital dynamics. We
also investigate the effect of a time-dependent coupling: Its nonadiabatic
change causes an interesting interplay of spin and orbital motion which is
related to the direction and magnitude of the applied magnetic field. This
result suggests that orbital state manipulation can be realized through
ultrastrong spin-orbit interactions, becoming a useful tool for handling
entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom to produce, for example, spin
desirable polarizations in time interesting for spintronics implementations.

multi-player games, it provides the necessary user grouping functionalities.
XTribe also provides communication facilities to easily achieve both

of a periodic array of dislocations, or quasi-periodic nanoripples originated
from the metal substrate. The extended line defects are described by the
long-range Lorentzian-type scattering potential. The dc conductivity is
calculated numerically for different cases of distribution of line defects.
This includes a random (uncorrelated) and a correlated distribution with a
prevailing direction in the orientation of lines. The anisotropy of the
conductivity along and across the line defects is revealed, which agrees with
experimental measurements for epitaxial graphene grown on SiC. We performed a
detailed study of the conductivity for different defect correlations,
introducing the correlation angle alpha_max (i.e. the maximum possible angle
between any two lines). We find that for a given electron density, the relative
enhancement of the conductivity for the case of fully correlated line defects
in comparison to the case of uncorrelated ones is larger for a higher defect
density. Finally, we study the conductivity of realistic samples where both

are used simultaneously to provide different views of cancer samples. To our

This paper introduces the Unanimous Improvement Ratio (UIR), a measure that
complements standard metric combination criteria (such as van Rijsbergen's
F-measure) and indicates how robust the measured differences are to changes in
the relative weights of the individual metrics. UIR is meant to elucidate
whether a perceived difference between two systems is an artifact of how
individual metrics are weighted.
  Besides discussing the theoretical foundations of UIR, this paper presents
empirical results that confirm the validity and usefulness of the metric for
the Text Clustering problem, where there is a tradeoff between precision and
recall based metrics and results are particularly sensitive to the weighting
scheme used to combine them. Remarkably, our experiments show that UIR can be
used as a predictor of how well differences between systems measured on a given

partially observable stochastic games. First, we apply two state-of-the-art
search techniques that use Monte-Carlo sampling to the task of approximating a
Nash-Equilibrium (NE) in such games, namely Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR). MCTS has been proven to
approximate a NE in perfect-information games. We show that the algorithm
quickly finds a reasonably strong strategy (but not a NE) in a complex
imperfect information game, i.e. Poker. MCCFR on the other hand has theoretical
NE convergence guarantees in such a game. We apply MCCFR for the first time in
Poker. Based on our experiments, we may conclude that MCTS is a valid approach
if one wants to learn reasonably strong strategies fast, whereas MCCFR is the
better choice if the quality of the strategy is most important. Our second
contribution relates to the observation that a NE is not a best response
against players that are not playing a NE. We present Monte-Carlo Restricted
Nash Response (MCRNR), a sample-based algorithm for the computation of
restricted Nash strategies. These are robust best-response strategies that (1)
exploit non-NE opponents more than playing a NE and (2) are not (overly)
exploitable by other strategies. We combine the advantages of two

  Our new technique exploits the intuitive strategy of selectively ignoring
various dimensions in different parts of the state space. The resulting
non-uniformity has strong implications, since the approximation is no longer
Markovian, requiring the use of a modified planner. We also use a spatial and

distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain
using Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that
jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such
as a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposed
by the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the
rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound

multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the
activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future
behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded
it. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent

our unified model, which takes into account not only relationships among

present a new notion of unfounded set for LPAma programs, which is a sound
generalization of the original definition for standard (aggregate-free) LP. On
this basis, we define a well-founded operator for LPAma programs, the fixpoint
of which is called well-founded model (or well-founded semantics) for LPAma
programs. The most important properties of unfounded sets and the well-founded
semantics for standard LP are retained by this generalization, notably
existence and uniqueness of the well-founded model, together with a strong
relationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one
of the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for
a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the
well-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss
some complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable
computation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that
for general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither
monotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with
respect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a
well-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable
computation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma
programs. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports
the well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only

significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent

I-DIDs are graphical models and may be used to compute the policy of an agent
given its belief over the physical state and others models, which changes as
the agent acts and observes in the multiagent setting.
  As we may expect, solving I-DIDs is computationally hard. This is
predominantly due to the large space of candidate models ascribed to the other
agents and its exponential growth over time. We present two methods for
reducing the size of the model space and stemming its exponential growth. Both
these methods involve aggregating individual models into equivalence classes.
Our first method groups together behaviorally equivalent models and selects
only those models for updating which will result in predictive behaviors that
are distinct from others in the updated model space. The second method further
compacts the model space by focusing on portions of the behavioral predictions.
Specifically, we cluster actionally equivalent models that prescribe identical
actions at a single time step. Exactly identifying the equivalences would
require us to solve all models in the initial set. We avoid this by selectively
solving some of the models, thereby introducing an approximation. We discuss
the error introduced by the approximation, and empirically demonstrate the
improved efficiency in solving I-DIDs due to the equivalences.

constraint agree with that decision. Whereas most generic search heuristics in
constraint programming rely on local information at the level of the individual
variable, our search heuristics are based on more global information at the

heuristic maxSD as a robust candidate among our proposals.eWe then evaluate the

such as health care and defence, where missing answers can adversely affect the
applications functionality. Furthermore, even if an application can tolerate
some level of incompleteness, it is often advantageous to estimate how many and
what kind of answers are being lost.

check whether a reasoner is complete for a given query Q and ontology T---that
is, whether the reasoner is guaranteed to compute all answers to Q w.r.t. T and
an arbitrary data set A. Since ontologies and typical queries are often fixed
at application design time, our approach allows application developers to check
whether a reasoner known to be incomplete in general is actually complete for
the kinds of input relevant for the application.
  We also present a technique that, given a query Q, an ontology T, and
reasoners R_1 and R_2 that satisfy certain assumptions, can be used to
determine whether, for each data set A, reasoner R_1 computes more answers to Q
w.r.t. T and A than reasoner R_2. This allows application developers to select
the reasoner that provides the highest degree of completeness for Q and T that
is compatible with the applications scalability requirements.

which is to find solutions with the minimum cost. Weighted constraint
satisfaction is a framework for modeling such problems, which consists of a set
of cost functions to measure the degree of violation or preferences of
different combinations of variable assignments. Typical solution methods for
weighted constraint satisfaction problems (WCSPs) are based on branch-and-bound
search, which are made practical through the use of powerful consistency
techniques such as AC*, FDAC*, EDAC* to deduce hidden cost information and
value pruning during search. These techniques, however, are designed to be
efficient only on binary and ternary cost functions which are represented in
table form. In tackling many real-life problems, high arity (or global) cost
functions are required. We investigate efficient representation scheme and
algorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high
arity cost functions, which are often derived from hard global constraints from
classical constraint satisfaction. The literature suggests some global cost
functions can be represented as flow networks, and the minimum cost flow
algorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in
polynomial time. We show that naive adoption of this flow-based algorithmic
method for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of null-inverse
consistency. We further show how the method can be modified to handle cost
projections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of AC* and FDAC*
for cost functions with more than two variables. Similar generalization for the
stronger EDAC* is less straightforward. We reveal the oscillation problem when
enforcing EDAC* on cost functions sharing more than one variable. To avoid
oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak
EDGAC* for non-binary cost functions. Using various benchmarks involving the
soft variants of hard global constraints ALLDIFFERENT, GCC, SAME, and REGULAR,

distinguished by its focus on properties fundamental to temporal problems, and,
more generally, weighted graph algorithms. In particular, the maintenance
system focuses on maintaining a minimal representation of non-dominated
constraints. We benchmark Drakes performance on random structured problems, and

generating large effective slip, which is important for a variety of

discuss how the dissipation in the gas phase of textures modifies their
friction properties. We propose an operator method, which allows us the mapping
of the flow in the gas subphase to a local slip boundary condition at the
liquid/gas interface. The determined uniquely local slip length depends on the
viscosity contrast and underlying topography, and can be immediately used to
evaluate an effective slip of the texture. Besides superlubricating Cassie
surfaces our approach is valid for rough surfaces impregnated by a
low-viscosity 'lubricant', and even for Wenzel textures, where a liquid follows
the surface relief. These results provide a framework for the rational design
of textured surfaces for numerous applications.

multifarious, real-world environments. Often, the tasks require a certain
semantic understanding of the workspace. Consider, for example, spoken
instructions from a human collaborator referring to objects of interest; the
robot must be able to accurately detect these objects to correctly understand
the instructions. However, existing object detection, while competent, is not
perfect. In particular, the performance of detection algorithms is commonly
sensitive to the position of the sensor relative to the objects in the scene.
This paper presents an online planning algorithm which learns an explicit model
of the spatial dependence of object detection and generates plans which
maximize the expected performance of the detection, and by extension the
overall plan performance. Crucially, the learned sensor model incorporates
spatial correlations between measurements, capturing the fact that successive
measurements taken at the same or nearby locations are not independent. We show
how this sensor model can be incorporated into an efficient forward search
algorithm in the information space of detected objects, allowing the robot to
generate motion plans efficiently. We investigate the performance of our
approach by addressing the tasks of door and text detection in indoor
environments and demonstrate significant improvement in detection performance
during task execution over alternative methods in simulated and real robot

mean-field theory predicts that a first order transition occurs near van Hove

Griffiths wing, referring to his original work of He3-He4 mixtures. When
crossing the wing, the anisotropy of the electronic system exhibits a
discontinuous change, leading to a meta-nematic transition, i.e., the analog to
a meta-magnetic transition in a magnetic system. The upper edge of the wing
corresponds to a critical end line, which shows a non-monotonic temperature
dependence as a function of the external anisotropy and vanishes at a quantum
critical end point for a strong anisotropy. The mean-field phase diagram is,
however, very sensitive to fluctuations of the nematic order parameter,
yielding a topologically different phase diagram. The Griffiths wing is broken
into two pieces. A tiny wing appears close to zero anisotropy and the other is
realized for a strong anisotropy. Consequently three quantum critical end

circuit-switch sub-networks for high-throughput data delivery. This network
will scale for use in thousand core chip systems. At the physical level,
SoI-based adiabatic coupler has been designed to provide low-loss and compact
optical power splitting. Based on the adiabatic coupler, a topology based on
2-ary folded butterfly is designed to provide linear power division in a
thousand core layout with minimal cross-overs. To address the network agility
and provide for efficient use of optical bandwidth, a flow control and routing
mechanism is introduced to dynamically allocate bandwidth and provide fairness
usage of network resources. At the system level, bloom filter-based filtering
for localization of communication are designed for reducing global traffic. In
addition, a novel greedy-based data and workload migration are leveraged to
increase the locality of communication in a NUCA (non-uniform cache access)

observed in a similar, luminous state. Both sources have a high absorbing
column in excess of the Galactic value. Neither source has a spectrum
consistent with a black hole binary in low/hard state, and both ULXs exhibit
strong curvature in their broadband X-ray spectra. This curvature rules out
models that invoke a simple reflection-dominated spectrum with a broadened iron
line and no cutoff in the illuminating power-law continuum. X-ray spectrum of

challenging. The broadband spectrum of IC 342 X-2 can be fit by either a hot

soft excess emission unlikely to be associated with the binary system, combined
with the high absorption column, it is more plausible that the broadband X-ray

identification of the origin of the spectral components in these sources will

multiple merging events with less massive galaxies. In addition, the Magorrian
relation indicates that almost all galaxies are occupied by a central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $10^{-3}$ of its spheroidal component.
Consequently, SMBHs are expected to wander in the halos of their host galaxies
following a galaxy collision, although evidence of this activity is currently
lacking. We investigate a current plausible location of an SMBH wandering in
the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). According to theoretical studies of
$N$-body simulations, some of the many substructures in the M31 halo are
remnants of a minor merger occurring about 1 Gyr ago. First, to evaluate the
possible parameter space of the infalling orbit of the progenitor, we perform
numerous parameter studies using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cluster. To
reduce uncertainties in the predicted position of the expected SMBH, we then
calculate the time evolution of the SMBH in the progenitor dwarf galaxy from
$N$-body simulations using the plausible parameter sets. Our results show that
the SMBH lies within the halo ($\sim$20--50 kpc from the M31 center), closer to
the Milky Way than the M31 disk. Furthermore, the predicted current positions
of the SMBH were restricted to an observational field of $0\degr.6 \times
0\degr.7$ in the northeast region of the M31 halo. We also discuss the origin

of $S_{th}$ which maximizes the normalized average rate is given by the

that FFR gives a higher rate than FR$1$ and a better coverage probability than

features, that is typical of networks based on decision-making. In this paper,
we investigate the hierarchical structure of citation networks consisting of
papers in the same field. We find that the majority of the networks follow a
universal trend towards a highly hierarchical state, and i) the various fields
display differences only concerning their phase in life (distance from the

approaching the stationary state. We also show by a simple argument that the

applications. In the technological realm, the accumulated experience with the
construction of such surfaces is not sufficient. Nature provides many examples
of dynamic surfaces worthy of study and adoption, at least as a concept, within
human engineering. In this work, we probe load-bearing features of the ventral
skin of snake surfaces. We examine the structure of two snake species that
mainly move by rectilinear locomotion. These are Python regius (pythonidae) and
Bittis gabonica (Vipridae). To this end, we focus on the load bearing
characteristics of the ventral skin surface (i.e. the Rk family of parameters).
Therefore, we draw detailed comparison between the reptilian surfaces and two
sets of technological data. The first set pertains to an actual commercial
cylinder liner, whereas, the second set is a summary of recommended surface
finish metrological values for several commercial cylinder liner manufacturers.
The results highlight several similarities between the two types of surfaces.
In particular, we show that there is a striking correspondence between the
sense of texture engineering within both surfaces (although that their
construction evolved along entirely different paths). We also show that
reptilian surfaces manifest a high degree of specialization with respect to
habitat constraints on wear resistance and adhesive effects.

inside such stellar groups. We trace back the NS and the centres of possible
birth associations and clusters to find close encounters. The kinematic age is
then given by the time since the encounter. We use Monte Carlo simulations to
account for observational uncertainties and the unknown radial velocity of the
NS. We evaluate the outcome statistically. In order to find further indication
for our findings, we also search for a runaway star that could be the former
companion if it exists. We find that PSR J0826+2637 was probably born in the
small young cluster Stock 7 ~3 Myr ago. This result is supported by the
identification of the former companion candidate HIP 13962 (runaway star with
spectral type G0Ia). The scenario predicts a near-zero radial velocity of the
pulsar implying an inclination angle of its motion to the line-of-sight of
87+/-11 deg. We also present the chemical abundances of HIP 13962. We do not
find enhanced alpha element abundances in the highly evolved star. However, the
binary supernova scenario may be supported by the overabundance of r-process
elements that could have been ejected during the supernova and accreted by the
runaway star. Also, a high rotational velocity of v sin i ~29 km/s of HIP 13962
is consistent with evolution in a pre-SN binary system.

action selection policy for the game, guiding it towards promising regions of
the action space. We encode our model for text analysis and game playing in a
multi-layer neural network, representing linguistic decisions via latent
variables in the hidden layers, and game action quality via the output layer.
Operating within the Monte-Carlo Search framework, we estimate model parameters
using feedback from simulated games. We apply our approach to the complex

therefore introduce a generalization of biwords which can describe multi-word
