Here, we extend our former proposal to two hyperfine states of 85Rb instead of
two different atomic species, thus simplifying possible experimental
realisations. A calculation of the $s$-wave scattering lengths for the
hyperfine states $(f,m_f)=(2,+2)$ and $(3,+2)$ identifies parameter regimes
suitable for the creation of Bell states with an advantageously broad Feshbach

is strongly coupled to the exciton center-of-mass motion through electron-hole
exchange. This coupling realizes a massless Dirac cone with chirality index I=2
for excitons inside the light cone, i.e. bright excitons. Under moderate
strain, the I=2 Dirac cone splits into two degenerate I=1 Dirac cones, and
saddle points with a linear Dirac spectrum emerge in the bright exciton
dispersion. Interestingly, after binding an extra electron, the charged exciton
becomes a massive Dirac particle associated with a large valley Hall effect
protected from intervalley scattering. Our results point to unique
opportunities to study Dirac physics, with exciton's optical addressability at
specifiable momentum, energy and pseudospin. The strain-tunable valley-orbit

framework with action-angle coordinates; they contain a quasi-integrable
conservative part and friction terms, assumed to be linear and isotropic with
respect to the action variables. In such a context, we transfer two methods
determining quasi-periodic solutions, which were originally designed to analyze
purely Hamiltonian quasi-integrable problems.
  First, we show how the frequency map analysis can be adapted to this kind of
dissipative models. Our approach is based on a key remark: the method can work
as usual, by studying the behavior of the angular velocities of the motions as
a function of the so called ""external frequencies"", instead of the actions.
Moreover, we explicitly implement the Kolmogorov's normalization algorithm for
the dissipative systems considered here. In a previous article, we proved a
theoretical result: such a constructing procedure is convergent under the
hypotheses usually assumed in KAM theory. In the present work, we show that it
can be translated to a code making algebraic manipulations on a computer, so to
calculate effectively quasi-periodic solutions on invariant tori. Both the
methods are carefully tested, by checking that their predictions are in
agreement, in the case of the so called ""dissipative forced pendulum"".
Furthermore, the results obtained by applying our adaptation of the frequency
analysis method to the dissipative standard map are compared with some existing

This provides a clean dictionary, using a single coordinate system, between the

toric and invariant-theoretic techniques. In particular, the Cox ring is an
invariant subring of a Pic(X)-graded polynomial ring and it is an intersection
of two explicit finitely generated rings. When all linear subspaces are points,
this recovers a theorem of Mukai while also giving it a geometric proof and

finite generation and compute an explicit presentation. We consider in detail

challenging issue due to the bandwidth-limited communication medium, energy
constraints and real-time data delivery requirements. This paper introduces a
new information extraction method for WSN-based control applications, which
reduces the number of required data transmissions to save energy and avoid data
congestion. According to the proposed approach, control applications recognize
when new data readings have to be collected and determine sensor nodes that
have to be activated on the basis of uncertainty analysis. Processing of the
selectively collected input data is based on definition of information granules
that describe state of the controlled system as well as performance of
particular control decisions. This method was implemented for object tracking
in WSNs. The task is to control movement of a mobile sink, which has to reach a
target in the shortest possible time. Extensive simulation experiments were
performed to compare performance of the proposed approach against
state-of-the-art methods. Results of the experiments show that the presented
information extraction method allows for substantial reduction in the amount of
transmitted data with no significant negative effect on tracking performance.

address scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments, the inclusion of

impurities is significantly modified by surface effects. For the neutral
acceptor state $[{\rm Fe}^{2+}, h]^0$, the magnetic-anisotropy dependence on
the impurity sublayer resembles the case of $[{\rm Mn}^{2+}, h]^0$. In
contrast, for $[{\rm Fe}^{3+}]^{0}$ electronic configuration the magnetic
anisotropy behaves differently and it is considerably smaller. For this state

  Theorem",,,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.PR stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entropy rate of sequential data-streams naturally quantifies the complexity
of the generative process. Thus entropy rate fluctuations could be used as a
tool to recognize dynamical perturbations in signal sources, and could
potentially be carried out without explicit background noise characterization.
However, state of the art algorithms to estimate the entropy rate have markedly
slow convergence; making such entropic approaches non-viable in practice. We
present here a fundamentally new approach to estimate entropy rates, which is
demonstrated to converge significantly faster in terms of input data lengths,
and is shown to be effective in diverse applications ranging from the
estimation of the entropy rate of English texts to the estimation of complexity
of chaotic dynamical systems. Additionally, the convergence rate of entropy
estimates do not follow from any standard limit theorem, and reported
algorithms fail to provide any confidence bounds on the computed values.

convergence rate of $O(\log \vert s \vert/\sqrt[3]{\vert s \vert})$ as a
function of the input length $\vert s \vert$, which then yields explicit

${\bf Q}=Q_x =(2Q,0)$ and ${\bf Q}=Q_y =(0,2Q)$, if the magnetic correlation
length $\xi$ exceeds some critical value. We argue that $\Delta_k^Q$ and
$\Delta_{-k}^Q$ are not equivalent, and their symmetric and antisymmetric
combinations describe density modulations and bond current. We derive GL
functional for four-component $U(1)$ order parameters $\Delta^Q_{\pm k}$ with
${\bf Q} = Q_x$ or $Q_y$. Within mean-field we find two types of CDW states, I
and II, depending on system parameters. In state I density and current
modulations emerge with the same ${\bf Q} = Q_x$ or $Q_y$, breaking $Z_2$
lattice rotational symmetry, and differ in phase by $\pm\pi/2$. The selection
of $\pi/2$ or $-\pi/2$ additionally breaks $Z_2$ time-reversal symmetry, such
that the total order parameter manifold is $U(1) \times Z_2 \times Z_2$. In
state II density and current modulations emerge with different $\bf Q$ and the
order parameter manifold is $U(1) \times U (1) \times Z_2$. We go beyond
mean-field and show that discrete symmetries get broken before long-range
charge order sets in. For state I, the system first breaks $Z_2$ lattice
rotational symmetry ($C_4 \to C_2$) at $T= T_n$ and develops a nematic order,
then breaks $Z_2$ time-reversal symmetry at $T_t < T_n$, and finally breaks
$U(1)$ symmetry of a common phase of even and odd components of $\Delta^Q_{k}$
at $T= T_{\rm cdw} < T_t < T_n$ and develops a true charge order. We argue that
the preemptive orders lift $T_{\rm cdw}$ and reduces $T_{\rm sc}$ such that at
large $\xi$ charge order may develop prior to superconductivity. We obtain the
phase diagram and present quantitative comparison with ARPES data for
hole-doped cuprates.

hosted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, VA (2013
May 6--8). The focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and sky
surveys. For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength
observations are required to understand several classes of transients was
stressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible
wavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.
From the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1
million alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification
and identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can
warrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a
deep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion
objects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a
comparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part
of the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these
objects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust
obscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation
and from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,
on which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST ""Deep
Drilling Fields,"" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of
filtering and exploiting the LSST data stream. There were also topics for which
there was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus was
reached, which included the procedures for following up on LSST observations
and the nature for future support of researchers desiring to use LSST data
products.

strongly favor a non-zero summed neutrino mass at more than 3$\sigma$

between X-ray cluster and {\it Planck} data in some cosmological parameters.
For the matter power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$, X-ray cluster data favor a
lower value compared with {\it Planck}. Because of the strong $\sigma_8-\sum
m_{\nu}$ degeneracy, this tension could beyond 2$\sigma$ confidence level when
the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$ is allowed to vary. For the CMB lensing
amplitude $A_L$, the addition of X-ray cluster data results in a 3$\sigma$
deviation from the vanilla model. Furthermore, {\it Planck}+X-ray data prefer a
large Hubble constant and phantom-like dark energy equation of state, which are
in $2\sigma$ tension with those from WMAP7+X-ray data. Finally, we find that
these tensions/descrepencies could be relaxed in some sense by adding a $9\%$
systematic shift in the cluster mass functions.

oceans, implying that most super-Earths should be entirely covered in water,
so-called waterworlds. This is important because waterworlds lack a silicate
weathering thermostat so their climate is predicted to be less stable than that
of planets with exposed continents. In other words, the continuously habitable
zone for waterworlds is much narrower than for Earth-like planets. A planet's
water is partitioned, however, between a surface reservoir, the ocean, and an
interior reservoir, the mantle. Plate tectonics transports water between these
reservoirs on geological timescales. Degassing of melt at mid-ocean ridges and
serpentinization of oceanic crust depend negatively and positively on seafloor
pressure, respectively, providing a stabilizing feedback on long-term ocean
volume. Motivated by Earth's approximately steady-state deep water cycle, we
develop a two-box model of the hydrosphere and derive steady-state solutions to
the water partitioning on terrestrial planets. Critically, hydrostatic seafloor
pressure is proportional to surface gravity, so super-Earths with a deep water
cycle will tend to store more water in the mantle. We conclude that a
tectonically active terrestrial planet of any mass can maintain exposed
continents if its water mass fraction is less than ~0.2%, dramatically
increasing the odds that super-Earths are habitable. The greatest source of
uncertainty in our study is Earth's current mantle water inventory: the greater
its value, the more robust planets are to inundation. Lastly, we discuss how
future missions can test our hypothesis by mapping the oceans and continents of
massive terrestrial planets.

clusters. The observed density profiles are a good realistic starting point and
the distribution functions derived from them are realistic. We do not make any

kind, though all results are consistent with Warm DM. With these methods we
find: (i) Cored density profiles behaving quadratically for small distances
rho(r) r -> 0 = rho(0) - K r^2 produce distribution functions which are finite
and positive at the halo center while cusped density profiles always produce
divergent distribution functions at the center. (ii) Cored density profiles
produce approximate thermal Boltzmann distribution functions for r < 3 r_h
where r_h is the halo radius. (iii) Analytic expressions for the dispersion
velocity and the pressure are derived yielding an ideal DM gas equation of
state with local temperature T(r) = m v^2(r)/3. T(r) turns to be constant in
the same region where the distribution function is thermal and exhibits the
same temperature within the percent. The self-gravitating DM gas can thermalize
despite being collisionless because it is an ergodic system. (iv) The DM halo
can be consistently considered at local thermal equilibrium with: (a) a
constant temperature T(r) = T_0 for r < 3 \; r_h, (b) a space dependent

charge neutral bilayer graphene (BLG) has attracted a lot of interest.
Theoretical studies predict various ordered states as the candidates for the
ground state of BLG in the absence of external fields. Several experiments have
been performed by different groups to identify the nature of the collective
ground state in BLG. However, so far, there is no consensus: some experiments
show evidence that suggests the establishment of a nematic gapless state, while
others present results that are more consistent with the establishment of a
fully gapped state. Moreover, even among the experiments that appear to see a
bulk gap, some of the samples are found to be conducting (suggesting existence
of gapless edge states), while others are insulating. Here we explore the
hypothesis that disorder might explain the discrepancy between experiments. We
find that the pair breaking effect due to non-magnetic short-range disorder
varies among the candidate ground states, giving rise to different amounts of
suppression of their mean-field transition temperatures. Our results indicate
that BLG can undergo a transition between different ordered states as a
function of the disorder strength providing a possible scenario to resolve the
discrepancy between experimental observations.

features that were found in Spitzer Space Telescope spectra of carbon-rich
post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud

spectral observing programme of 24 stars including post-AGB candidates. The
latter half of this paper presents the analysis of PAH features in 20
carbon-rich post-AGB stars in the LMC, assembled from the Spitzer archive as
well as from our own programme. We found that five post-AGB stars showed a
broad feature with a peak at 7.7 micron, that had not been classified before.
Further, the 10--13 micron PAH spectra were classified into four classes, one
of which has three broad peaks at 11.3, 12.3 and 13.3 micron rather than two
distinct sharp peaks at 11.3 and 12.7 micron, as commonly found in HII regions.
Our studies suggest that PAHs are gradually processed while the central stars
evolve from post-AGB phase to PNe, changing their composition before PAHs are
incorporated into the interstellar medium. Although some metallicity dependence
of PAH spectra exists, the evolutionary state of an object is more significant
than its metallicity in determining the spectral characteristics of PAHs for
LMC and Galactic post-AGB stars.

having similar stellar masses, the hosts of low-redshift SN Ic-BL and z<1.2
LGRBs have high stellar-mass and star-formation-rate densities. Core-collapse
SN having typical ejecta velocities, in contrast, show no preference for such

Ib/Ic and SN II, exhibit high gas velocity dispersions for their stellar
masses. The patterns likely reflect variations among star-forming environments,
and suggest that LGRBs can be used as probes of conditions in high-redshift
galaxies. They may be caused by efficient formation of massive binary
progenitors systems in densely star-forming regions, or, less probably, a
higher fraction of stars created with the initial masses required for a SN

nanocomposite found in nature, is a rich photonic nanomaterial allowing the
experimental realization of collective excitation and light amplification via
coupled states. Localized modes in three-dimensional complex media are
typically isolated in frequency and space. However, multiple local resonances
can be hybridized in multilayered nanostructures of nacre so that the effective
cavity size for efficient disordered resonators is scaled up. Localized modes
in hybridized states in nacre are overlapped in frequency with similar shapes
in space, thus being collectively excited and synergistically amplified. These
hybridized states boost light amplification, leading to stable and regular
multimode lasing at low excitation energy. The simplicity of ameliorating
disordered resonators by mimicking nacre can further serve as platforms for
developing cost-effective photonic systems and provide materials for
fundamental research on complex media

sparse parities. Given an input of $k$ symbols, our codes produce an unbounded
number of output symbols, generating each parity independently by linearly
combining a logarithmic number of randomly selected input symbols. The
construction guarantees that for any $\epsilon>0$ accessing a random subset of
$(1+\epsilon)k$ encoded symbols, asymptotically suffices to recover the $k$
input symbols with high probability.
  Our codes have the additional benefit of logarithmic locality: a single lost
symbol can be repaired by accessing a subset of $O(\log k)$ of the remaining
encoded symbols. This is a desired property for distributed storage systems
where symbols are spread over a network of storage nodes. Beyond recovery upon
loss, local reconstruction provides an efficient alternative for reading
symbols that cannot be accessed directly. In our code, a logarithmic number of
disjoint local groups is associated with each systematic symbol, allowing
multiple parallel reads.
  Our main mathematical contribution involves analyzing the rank of sparse
random matrices with specific structure over finite fields. We rely on
establishing that a new family of sparse random bipartite graphs have perfect
matchings with high probability.

or lower corona into the higher corona and is a common phenomenon. Usually, a
jet is triggered by a brightening or a flare, which provides the first driving
force to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection is thought
to be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, nonthermal, and
kinetic energies. However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and
end much later than the end of its associated flare. This fact implies that
there is another way to continuously transfer magnetic energy into kinetic
energy even after the reconnection. The picture described above is well known
in the community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through a
way other than reconnection is still unclear. By studying a prominence-like jet
observed by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI, we find that the continuous relaxation
of the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an important process for a
jet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnection. The kinetic
energy of the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times that gained from
the reconnection. The resultant energy flux is hundreds of times larger than
the flux required for the local coronal heating, suggesting that such jets are
a possible source to keep the corona hot. Furthermore, rotational motions
appear all the time during the jet. Our analysis suggests that torsional
Alfv\'en waves induced during reconnection could not be the only mechanism to
release magnetic energy and drive jets.

halo mass scale that can accrete unshocked intergalactic gas, which has been
explained with ad hoc criteria tuned to reproduce the results of a few
simulations. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive explanation for how this
mass scale depends on the reionization redshift, the amplitude of the ionizing
background, and the redshift. We show that accretion is inhibited onto more
massive halos than had been thought because previous studies had focused on the
gas fraction of halos rather than the instantaneous mass that can accrete gas.
A halo as massive as 10^11 Msun cannot accrete intergalactic gas at z=0, even

requires a quantifiable notion of similarity - when do two observed data sets

heuristics designed by experts, $e.g.$, distinct shapes of ""folded"" lightcurves
may be used as ""features"" to classify variable stars, while determination of
pathological brain states might require a Fourier analysis of brainwave
activity. Finding good features is non-trivial. Here, we propose a universal
solution to this problem: we delineate a principle for quantifying similarity
between sources of arbitrary data streams, without a priori knowledge, features
or training. We uncover an algebraic structure on a space of symbolic models
for quantized data, and show that such stochastic generators may be added and
uniquely inverted; and that a model and its inverse always sum to the generator
of flat white noise. Therefore, every data stream has an anti-stream: data
generated by the inverse model. Similarity between two streams, then, is the
degree to which one, when summed to the other's anti-stream, mutually
annihilates all statistical structure to noise. We call this data smashing. We
present diverse applications, including disambiguation of brainwaves pertaining
to epileptic seizures, detection of anomalous cardiac rhythms, and
classification of astronomical objects from raw photometry. In our examples,
the data smashing principle, without access to any domain knowledge, meets or
exceeds the performance of specialized algorithms tuned by domain experts.

failures propagate and to identify key links and key components that are
crucial for cascading failure propagation. By utilizing these interactions a
high-level probabilistic model called interaction model is proposed to study
the influence of interactions on cascading failure risk and to support online
decision-making. It is much more time efficient to first quantify the
interactions between component failures with fewer original cascades from a
more detailed cascading failure model and then perform the interaction model
simulation than it is to directly simulate a large number of cascades with a
more detailed model. Interaction-based mitigation measures are suggested to
mitigate cascading failure risk by weakening key links, which can be achieved
in real systems by wide area protection such as blocking of some specific

surprises. We focus in this paper on the plateau phase whose origin remains
highly debated. We confront several newly discovered correlations between
prompt and afterglow quantities (isotropic emitted energy in gamma-rays,
luminosity and duration of the plateau) to several models proposed for the
origin of plateaus in order to check if they can account for these observed
correlations. We first show that the scenario of plateau formation by energy
injection into the forward shock leads to an efficiency crisis for the prompt
phase and therefore study two possible alternatives: the first one still takes
place within the framework of the standard forward shock model but allows for a
variation of the microphysics parameters to reduce the radiative efficiency at
early times; in the second scenario the early afterglow results from a
long-lived reverse shock. Its shape then depends on the distribution of energy
as a function of Lorentz factor in the ejecta. In both cases, we first present
simple analytical estimates of the plateau luminosity and duration and then
compute detailed light curves. In the two considered scenarios we find that
plateaus following the observed correlations can be obtained under the
condition that specific additional ingredients are included. In the forward
shock scenario, the preferred model supposes a wind external medium and a
microphysics parameter epsilon_e that first varies as n^{-\nu} (n being the
external density), with \nu~1 to get a flat plateau, before staying constant
below a critical density n_0. To produce a plateau in the reverse shock
scenario the ejecta must contain a tail of low Lorentz factor with a peak of
energy deposition at \Gamma >~ 10.

We prove that finitely generated left cancellative monoids whose right Cayley

functions, and hence word problems in NP. Under the additional assumption of
right cancellativity (or in some cases the weaker condition of bounded
indegree), they also admit algorithms for more fundamentally
semigroup-theoretic decision problems such as Green's relations L, R, J, D and
the corresponding pre-orders.
  In contrast, we exhibit a right cancellative (but not left cancellative)
finitely generated monoid (in fact, an infinite class of them) whose Cayley
graph is a essentially a tree (hence hyperbolic in our sense and probably any
reasonable sense), but which is not even recursively presentable. This seems to
be strong evidence that no geometric notion of hyperbolicity will be strong
enough to yield much information about finitely generated monoids in absolute
generality.

the latter, which is the source of the equilibrium entropy, when the fluid goes
from a local equilibrium state and to an equilibrium state. This implies a
transmutation of the local equilibrium current's organization into the

to a local equilibrium state, its entropy transmutes into the organization of

Astronomical Unit (AU). The turbulence is assumed to be static, composite, and
quasi-three-dimensional with a varying energy distribution between a
one-dimensional Alfv\'enic (slab) and a structured two-dimensional component.
The spatial fluctuations of the turbulent magnetic field are modeled either as
homogeneous with a Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF), or as
intermittent on large and small scales with a q-Gaussian PDF. Simulations
showed that energetic particle diffusion coefficients both parallel and
perpendicular to the background magnetic field are significantly affected by
intermittency in the turbulence. This effect is especially strong for parallel
transport where for large-scale intermittency results show an extended phase of
subdiffusive parallel transport during which cross-field transport diffusion
dominates. The effects of intermittency are found to depend on particle
rigidity and the fraction of slab energy in the turbulence, yielding a
perpendicular to parallel mean free path ratio close to 1 for large-scale
intermittency. Investigation of higher order transport moments (kurtosis)
indicates that non-Gaussian statistical properties of the intermittent
turbulent magnetic field are present in the parallel transport, especially for
low rigidity particles at all times.

imputation is complicated by the structure of the data. Since occupational wage
data is collected in the form of counts of employees in predefined wage ranges

adequately adjust the estimates for certain domains of estimation. To preserve
the current data structure, we propose a method to impute each missing
establishment's wage interval count data as an ordered multinomial random
variable using a separate survival model for each occupation. Each model
incorporates known auxiliary information for each establishment associated with
the distribution of the occupational wage data, including geographic and
industry characteristics. This flexible model allows the baseline hazard to
vary by occupation while allowing predictors to adjust the probabilities of an
employee's salary falling within the specified ranges. An empirical study and
simulation results suggest that the method imputes missing OES wages that are
associated with the average wage of the establishment in a way that more
closely resembles the observed association.

this paper, we propose a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure (CAHSM),

construct three types of hypergraph---the pairwise hypergraph, the
k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) hypergraph, and the high-order over-clustering
hypergraph. The pairwise hypergraph captures the pairwise similarity of data
points; the kNN hypergraph captures the neighborhood of each point; and the
clustering hypergraph encodes high-order contexts within the dataset. By
combining the affinity information from these three hypergraphs, the CAHSM
algorithm is able to explore the intrinsic topological information of the
dataset. Therefore, data clustering using CAHSM tends to be more robust.
Considering the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separability of
vertices, we further design a discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion
(DHPC). Using both CAHSM and DHPC, a robust spectral clustering algorithm is
developed. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

constructed a phenomenological model of the evolution of surface magnetic
fields of pulsars, which contains a long-term decay modulated by short-term
oscillations; a pulsar's spin is thus modified by its magnetic field evolution.
The predictions of this model agree with the precisely measured spin evolutions
of several individual pulsars; the derived parameters suggest that the Hall
drift and Hall waves in the NS crusts are probably responsible for the
long-term change and short-term quasi-periodical oscillations, respectively.
Many statistical properties of the timing noise of pulsars can be well
re-produced with this model, including correlations and the distributions of

the emitted ultraviolet is well known only for actively star-forming objects
and combines effects of the grain properties, fine structure in the dust
distribution, and relative distributions of stars and dust. We use GALEX, XMM
Optical Monitor, and HST data to explore the UV attenuation in the outer parts
of spiral disks which are backlit by other UV-bright galaxies, starting with
candidates provided by Galaxy Zoo participants. Our analysis incorporates
galaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each galaxy to derive error
estimates on the attenuation measurements. The entire sample has an attenuation
law close to the Calzetti et al. (1994) form; the UV slope for the overall
sample is substantially shallower than found by Wild et al. (2011), a
reasonable match to the more distant galaxies in our sample but not to the
weighted combination including NGC 2207. The nearby, bright spiral NGC 2207
alone gives accuracy almost equal to the rest of our sample, and its outer arms
have a very low level of foreground starlight. This ""grey"" law can be produced
from the distribution of dust alone, without a necessary contribution from
differential escape of stars from dense clouds. The extrapolation needed to
compare attenution between backlit galaxies at moderate redshifts, and local
systems from SDSS data, is mild enough to allow use of galaxy overlaps to trace
the cosmic history of dust. For NGC 2207, the covering factor of clouds with
small optical attenuation becomes a dominant factor farther into the
ultraviolet, which opens the possibility that widespread diffuse dust dominates
over dust in star-forming regions deep into the ultraviolet. Comparison with
published radiative-transfer models indicates that the role of dust clumping
dominates over differences in grain populations, at this spatial resolution.

from a combination of the uncertainty relation, the gravitational redshift and

Large-scale Wireless LANs (WLANs) can provide such a service, but they are

efficient deployment algorithms for minimizing the cost for ensuring a required

operators; if one of these groups is eliminated through use of a Dirac Bracket

class. (This is what also happens with the superparticle action.) These primary
Fermionic first class constraints can be used to find the generator of a local

made simpler than it is in $2 + 1$, $3 + 1$ and $9 + 1$ dimensions. With a $3 +

coupling to gravity was limited to the canonical energy-momentum-stress tensor.
Here we strengthen the result by removing both of those limitations. We
consider, as a toy model, massless scalar fields interacting with
semitransparent ($\delta$-function) potentials defining parallel plates, which
become Dirichlet plates for strong coupling. We insert space and time
point-split regulation parameters, and obtain well-defined contributions to the
self- energy of each plate, and the interaction energy between the plates.
(This self-energy does not vanish even in the conformally-coupled,
strong-coupled limit.) We also compute the local energy density, which requires
regularization near the plates. In general, the energy density includes a
surface energy that resides precisely on the boundaries. This energy is also
regulated. The gravitational interaction of this well-defined system is then
investigated, and it is verified that the equivalence principle is satisfied.

The thermodynamics is further explored with some more extensions and details
than the former literature. A detailed analysis of the limit case
$\beta\rightarrow\infty$ is performed for the seven-dimensional black holes. It
is shown that for the spherical topology, $P-V$ criticality exists for both the
uncharged and charged cases. Our results demonstrate again that the charge is
not the indispensable condition of $P-V$ criticality. It may be attributed to
the effect of higher derivative terms of curvature because similar phenomenon
was also found for Gauss-Bonnet black holes. For $k=0$, there would be no $P-V$
criticality. Interesting findings occur in the case $k=-1$, in which positive
solutions of critical points are found for both the uncharged and charged
cases. However, the $P-v$ diagram is quite strange. To check whether these
findings are physical, we give the analysis on the non-negative definiteness
condition of entropy. It is shown that for any nontrivial value of $\alpha$,
the entropy is always positive for any specific volume $v$. Since no $P-V$
criticality exists for $k=-1$ in Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we
can relate our findings with the peculiar property of third order Lovelock
gravity. The entropy in third order Lovelock gravity consists of extra terms
which is absent in the Gauss-Bonnet black holes, which makes the critical
points satisfy the constraint of non-negative definiteness condition of
entropy. We also check the Gibbs free energy graph and the ""swallow tail""

all the shear modes. It provides a direct evidence that how the band structures

to the settling velocity of the particles (or the Rouse number), sediment
transport takes place in a thin layer localized at the surface of the sediment

depending on the sedimentation Reynolds number, the bedload layer is embedded
in the viscous sublayer or is larger. We propose here a two-phase flow model

described as resulting from normal stresses, but is limited by turbulent mixing

different observables are needed to be measured precisely at the LHC for

state lepton polarization asymmetries, namely, single lepton polarization
asymmetries ($P_i$) and double lepton polarization asymmetries ($P_{ij}$) in
the SM for radiative semileptonic Higgs decay $H\to\gamma\tau^+\tau^-$. In the
phenomenological analysis of these lepton polarization asymmetries both tree
and loop level diagrams are considered and it is found that these diagrams give
important contributions in the evaluation of said asymmetries. Interestingly,
it is found that in $P_{ij}$ the tree level diagrams contribute separately,
which however, are missing in the calculations of $P_i$ and the lepton
forward-backward asymmetries ($A_{FB}$). Similar to the other observables such
as the decay rate and the lepton forward-backward asymmetries, the
$\tau$-lepton polarization asymmetries would be interesting observables. The
experimental study of these observables will provide a fertile ground to
explore the intrinsic properties of the SM Higgs boson and its dynamics as well

physics of various astrophysical objects, like O-star winds, molecular clouds,

show that the bulk flows leave a clear imprint on the collision zone, its mean
properties and the turbulence it naturally develops. Our model setup consists
of 3D head-on colliding isothermal hydrodynamical flows with Mach numbers
between 2 and 43. Simulation results are in line with expectations from
self-similarity: root mean square Mach numbers (Mrms) scale linearly with
upstream Mach numbers, mean densities remain limited to a few times the
upstream density. The density PDF is not log-normal. The turbulence is
inhomogeneous: weaker in the zone center than close to the confining shocks. It
is anisotropic: while Mrms is generally supersonic, Mrms transverse to the
upstream flow is always subsonic. We argue that uniform, isothermal, head-on
colliding flows generally disfavor isotropic, supersonic turbulence. The
anisotropy carries over to other quantities like the density variance - Mach
number relation. Structure functions differ depending on whether they are
computed along a line-of-sight perpendicular or parallel to the upstream flow.
We suggest that such line-of-sight effects should be kept in mind when
interpreting turbulence characteristics derived from observations.

find that the Newtonian limiting mass of $1.4562M_\odot$ is modified to

accounted for by considering Salpeter's EoS along with the TOV equations
yielding slightly lower values for the critical masses, namely
$1.4081M_{\odot}$ for $^4_2$He, $1.3916M_{\odot}$ for $^{12}_{\ 6}$C and
$1.1565M_{\odot}$ for $^{56}_{26}$Fe white dwarfs. We also compare the critical

densities to find that $^4_2$He and $^{12}_{\ 6}$C white dwarf stars are stable
against neutronization with the critical values of $1.4081M_\odot$ and
$1.3916M_{\odot}$, respectively. However the critical masses for $^{16}_{\

AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondences for $d\geq 2$. The Vasiliev theories in
AdS$_{d+1}$, which contain each integer spin once, are related to the $U(N)$
singlet sector of the $d$-dimensional CFT of $N$ free complex scalar fields;
the minimal theories containing each even spin once -- to the $O(N)$ singlet
sector of the CFT of $N$ free real scalar fields. Using analytic continuation
of higher spin zeta functions, which naturally regulate the spin sums, we
calculate one loop vacuum energies in Euclidean AdS$_{d+1}$. In even $d$ we
compare the result with the $O(N^0)$ correction to the $a$-coefficient of the
Weyl anomaly; in odd $d$ -- with the $O(N^0)$ correction to the free energy $F$
on the $d$-dimensional sphere. For the theories of integer spins, the
correction vanishes in agreement with the CFT of $N$ free complex scalars. For
the minimal theories, the correction always equals the contribution of one real
conformal scalar field in $d$ dimensions. As explained in arXiv:1308.2337, this
result may agree with the $O(N)$ singlet sector of the theory of $N$ real
scalar fields, provided the coupling constant in the higher spin theory is
identified as $G_N\sim 1/(N-1)$. Our calculations in even $d$ are closely
related to finding the regularized $a$-anomalies of conformal higher spin
theories. In each even $d$ we identify two such theories with vanishing
$a$-anomaly: a theory of all integer spins, and a theory of all even spins
coupled to a complex conformal scalar. We also discuss an interacting UV fixed
point in $d=5$ obtained from the free scalar theory via an irrelevant
double-trace quartic interaction. This interacting large $N$ theory is dual to
the Vasiliev theory in AdS$_6$ where the bulk scalar is quantized with the
alternate boundary condition.

Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN) was established to monitor in
detail the conditions of light pollution in Hong Kong. Monitoring stations were
set up throughout the city covering a wide range of urban and rural settings to
continuously measure the variations of the NSB. Over 4.6 million night sky
measurements were collected from 18 distinct locations between May 2010 and
March 2013. This huge dataset, over two thousand times larger than our previous
survey, forms the backbone for studies of the temporal and geographical
variations of this environmental parameter and its correlation with various
natural and artificial factors. The concepts and methodology of the NSN were
presented here, together with an analysis of the overall night sky conditions
in Hong Kong. The average NSB in Hong Kong, excluding data affected by the
Moon, was 16.8 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, or 82 times brighter than the dark site
standard established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The urban
night sky was on average 15 times brighter than that in a rural location,

parabolic. We show that the classification of isometries of symmetric cosets
can be extended to non symmetric Sigma.s if these manifolds satisfy additional
mathematical restrictions. The classification criteria established in the
mathematical literature are coherent with simple criteria formulated in terms
of the asymptotic behavior of the Kahler potential K(C) = 2 J(C) where the real

show that phenomenologically admissible potentials for the description of
inflation and in particular alpha-attractors are mostly obtained from the
gauging of a parabolic isometry, this being, in particular the case of the
Starobinsky model. Yet at least one exception exists of an elliptic
alpha-attractor, so that neither type of isometry can be a priori excluded. The
requirement of regularity of the manifold Sigma poses instead strong
constraints on the alpha-attractors and reduces their space considerably.
Curiously there is a unique integrable alpha-attractor corresponding to a
particular value of this parameter.
