superposition of a uniaxial and of a fourfold symmetry term for CFA grown on
MgO substrates. This fourfold anisotropy, which disappears completely for
samples grown on Si, is in accord with the crystal structure of the samples.
The fourfold anisotropy field decreases when increasing Ta while the uniaxial
anisotropy field is nearly unaffected by Ta within the investigated range. The
MS-FMR data also allow for concluding that the gyromagnetic factor remains
constant and that the exchange stiffness constant increases with $T_{a}$.
Finally, the FMR linewidth decreases when increasing Ta, due to the enhancement
of the chemical order. We derive a very low intrinsic damping parameter

Different reaction mechanisms contribute to their production; the relative

  None of the available models are able to accurately predict emission of LF
from arbitrary reactions. However, the ability to describe production of LF
(especially at energies $\gtrsim 30$ MeV) from many reactions is important for
different applications, such as cosmic-ray-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs),
radiation protection, and cancer therapy with proton and heavy-ion beams, to
name just a few. The Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM) version 03.03 and the Los
Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model (LAQGSM) version 03.03 event
generators in Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code version 6 (MCNP6) describe
quite well the spectra of fragments with sizes up to $^{4}$He across a broad
range of target masses and incident energies (up to $\sim 5$ GeV for CEM and up
to $\sim 1$ TeV/A for LAQGSM). However, they do not predict the high-energy
tails of LF spectra heavier than $^4$He well. Most LF with energies above
several tens of MeV are emitted during the precompound stage of a reaction. The
current versions of the CEM and LAQGSM event generators do not account for
precompound emission of LF larger than $^{4}$He.
  The aim of our work is to extend the precompound model in them to include
such processes, leading to an increase of predictive power of LF-production in
MCNP6. Extending our models to include emission of fragments heavier than
$^4$He at the precompound stage has already provided preliminary results that
have much better agreement with experimental data.

incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach
leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the
graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form
solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are
determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the
efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the

models with main sequence masses of 2.5 and 5 Mo, and initial rotational

in order to reproduce the rotation rates observed for white dwarfs. During the
asymptotic giant branch phase and beyond, the magnetic braking of the core has
a practically null effect in increasing the rotational velocity of the envelope
since the stellar angular momentum is removed efficiently by the wind. We have,
as well, tested best possible case scenarios in rather non-physical contexts to
give enough angular momentum to the envelope. We find that we cannot get the

quantum bits (qubits) in semiconductor quantum dots. While quantum dot spin
qubits have demonstrated long coherence times, their manipulation is often
slower than desired for important future applications, such as factoring.
Further, scalability and manufacturability are enhanced when qubits are as
simple as possible. Previous work has increased the speed of spin qubit
rotations by making use of integrated micromagnets, dynamic pumping of nuclear
spins, or the addition of a third quantum dot. Here we demonstrate a new qubit
that offers both simplicity - it requires no special preparation and lives in a
double quantum dot with no added complexity - and is very fast: we demonstrate
full control on the Bloch sphere with $\pi$-rotation times less than 100 ps in
two orthogonal directions. We report full process tomography, extracting high
fidelities equal to or greater than 85% for X-rotations and 94% for

to determine as the estimator is defined by an optimization problem that in
general can only be solved numerically and many of its components may be
exactly zero. Let $S$ be the subgradient of the $\ell_1$ norm of the
coefficient vector $\beta$ evaluated at $\hat{\beta}$. We find that the joint

importance sampling, to draw samples from the distribution of the augmented

Because of the factor $\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$ in the analytical relation, the
contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop is negligibly small

essential for chiral symmetry breaking. Also, in lattice QCD simulations, we
numerically confirm the analytical relation, non-zero finiteness of $\langle

FGK stars in the Galactic disk. The results are based upon the analysis of
high-resolution UVES spectra from the Gaia-ESO large stellar survey. We explore
the limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellar
parameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric target
preselection. We find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppress
old metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. This suppression may be as
high as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. The dataset
consists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 Gyr to 13.5 Gyr,
Galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from the
plane 0 < |Z| < 1.5 kpc. On this basis, we find that i) the observed
age-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 Gyr and
8 Gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 Gyr, we see a decrease in [Fe/H] and a clear
absence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selection
functions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [Fe/H] at any age; and iv)
[Mg/Fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [Mg/Fe] at ages > 9 Gyr is
not as small as advocated by some other studies. In agreement with earlier
work, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of vertical
distance from the plane. The [Mg/Fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. In
addition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared to

frame of task parallelism, calculations on a spatial domain can be treated as a
task. If neighbouring domains interact and share results, access to the
specific data needs to be synchronized to avoid race conditions. This is the
case for a variety of applications, like most molecular dynamics and many
computational fluid dynamics codes. Here we present an unexpected problem which
can occur in dependency-driven task parallelization models like StarSs: the
tasks accessing a specific spatial domain are treated as interdependent, as
dependencies are detected automatically via memory addresses. Thus, the order
in which tasks are generated will have a severe impact on the dependency tree.
In the worst case, a complete serialization is reached and no two tasks can be
calculated in parallel. We present the problem in detail based on an example
from molecular dynamics, and introduce a theoretical framework to calculate the
degree of serialization. Furthermore, we present strategies to avoid this
unnecessary problem. We recommend treating these strategies as best practice
when using dependency-driven task parallel programming models like StarSs on
such scenarios.

focused on individual observables, such as mass or thrust, to great success.
Here, we present a first study of double differential jet cross sections
considering two recoil-free angularities measured on a single jet. By analyzing
the phase space defined by the two angularities and using methods from
soft-collinear effective theory, we prove that the double differential cross
section factorizes at the boundaries of the phase space. We also show that the
cross section in the bulk of the phase space cannot be factorized using only
soft and collinear modes, excluding the possibility of a global factorization
theorem in soft-collinear effective theory. Nevertheless, we are able to define
a simple interpolation procedure that smoothly connects the factorization
theorem at one boundary to the other. We present an explicit example of this at
next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and show that the interpolation is unique
up to $\alpha_s^4$ order in the exponent of the cross section, under reasonable
assumptions. This is evidence that the interpolation is sufficiently robust to
account for all logarithms in the bulk of phase space to the accuracy of the
boundary factorization theorem. We compare our analytic calculation of the
double differential cross section to Monte Carlo simulation and find
qualitative agreement. Because our arguments rely on general structures of the
phase space, we expect that much of our analysis would be relevant for the
study of phenomenologically well-motivated observables, such as
$N$-subjettiness, energy correlation functions, and planar flow.

incomplete sampling of SF tracers from the stellar initial mass function and
the spatial drift between gas and stars. We present a simple uncertainty
principle for SF, which can be used to predict and interpret the failure of
galactic SF relations on small spatial scales. This uncertainty principle
explains how the scatter of SF relations depends on the spatial scale and
predicts a scale-dependent bias of the gas depletion time-scale when centering
an aperture on gas or SF tracer peaks. We show how the scatter and bias are
sensitive to the physical size and time-scales involved in the SF process (such
as its duration or the molecular cloud lifetime), and illustrate how our
formalism provides a powerful tool to constrain these largely unknown

applied to other astrophysical systems, e.g. addressing the time-evolution of

using the newly available dataset with accurate kinematics (Strader et
al.2011). We find evidence for three distinct sub-populations of GCs in terms
of colours, kinematics and radial profiles. We show that a decomposition into
three populations (blue, intermediate and red GCs) is statistically preferred
to one with two or four populations, and relate them to the stellar profile. We
exploit the sub-populations to derive dynamical constraints on the mass and
Dark Matter (DM) content of M87 out to $\sim100$ kpc. We use a class of global
mass-estimators (from Paper I), obtaining mass measurements at different
locations. M87's DM fraction changes from $\approx$0.2 at the starlight's
effective radius (6 kpc) to $\approx$0.95 at the distance probed by the most
extended, blue GCs (135 kpc). We supplement this with \textit{virial
decompositions}, exploiting the dynamical model to produce a separation into
multiple components. These yield the luminous mass as $5.5^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\times
10^{11}M_\odot$ and the DM within 135 kpc as $8.0^{+1.0}_{-4.0}\times
10^{12}M_\odot.$ The inner DM density behaves as $\rho \sim r^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma\approx 1.6$. This is steeper than the cosmologically preferred cusp
$\rho \sim r^{-1},$ providing evidence of DM contraction. Finally, we combine
the GC separation into three sub-populations and the Jeans equations, obtaining
information on the orbits of the GC system. The centrally concentrated red GCs
exhibit tangential anisotropy, consistent with radial-orbit depletion by tidal
shredding. The most extended blue GCs have an isotropic velocity dispersion
tensor in the central parts, which becomes more tangential moving outwards,
consistent with adiabatic contraction of the DM halo.

kinematic profiles in a form that is valid for general surface-brightness
profiles and (spherical) total mass profiles, without the need for any explicit
deprojection. We then show that an almost flat rotation curve, combined with
modest velocity anisotropy, is already sufficient to recover the kinematic
profiles of nearby ellipticals. As an application, we provide two different
sets of mass estimators for elliptical galaxies, based on either the velocity
dispersion at a specific location near the effective radius, or the
aperture-averaged velocity dispersion. In the large aperture (virial) limit,
mass estimators are naturally independent of anisotropy. The spherical mass
enclosed within the effective radius $R_{\rm e}$ can be estimated as $2.4
R_{\rm e} \langle \sigma^{2}_{\rm p} \rangle/ G$, where $\langle \sigma^2_{\rm
p} \rangle$ is the average of the squared velocity dispersion over a finite
aperture. This formula does not depend on assumptions such as
mass-follows-light, and is a compromise between the cases of small and large
apertures sizes. Its general agreement with results from other methods in the
literature makes it a reliable means to infer masses in the absence of detailed
kinematic information. If on the other hand the velocity dispersion profile is
available, tight mass estimates can be found that are independent of the
mass-model and anisotropy profile (within $\approx$ 10% accuracy). Explicit
formulae are given for small anisotropy, large radii and/or power-law total
densities. Motivated by recent observational claims, we also discuss the issue
of weak homology of elliptical galaxies, emphasizing the interplay between
morphology and orbital structure.

increases to longer wavelength within the WFC3 bandpass, but without water

of an observable signal generated by small radiating circular hot spots moving
along quasi-elliptic trajectories close to the innermost stable circular orbit
in the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our consideration takes into account the
capabilities of observatories that have been operating in the past two decades
represented by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the proposed future
instruments represented by the Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT). For
these purposes we choose such model parameters that lead to lightcurves
comparable to those observed in Galactic black hole sources, in particular the
microquasar GRS 1915+105. We find that when a weak signal corresponding to the
hot-spot Keplerian frequency is around the limits of the RXTE detectability,
the LOFT observations can clearly reveal its first and second harmonics.
Moreover, in some specific situations the radial epicyclic frequency of the
spot can be detected as well. Finally, we also compare the signal produced by
the spots to the signal produced by axisymmetric epicyclic disc-oscillation
modes and discuss the key differences that could be identified via the proposed
future technology. We conclude that the ability to recognize the harmonic
content of the signal can help to distinguish between the different proposed
physical models.

of the cluster center of mass, but that kinetic energy due to interatomic
vibrations are not significantly affected by coupling to the logarithmic

oscillator is unable to modify the kinetic energy due to vibrations in small

this source exceptionally bright. Absorption lines are detected at rest-frame
energies of ~ 7.7 keV and ~11.0 keV at >97% significance. By interpreting these
lines to arise from highly ionized iron the implied outflow velocities of the
X-ray absorbing gas corresponding to these lines are 0.13c and 0.41c,
respectively. The presence of these relativistic outflows and the absence of
any significant low-energy X-ray absorption suggest that a shielding gas is not
required for the generation of the relativistic X-ray absorbing winds in HS
0810+2554. UV spectroscopic observations with VLT/UVES indicate that the UV
absorbing material is outflowing at v_UV ~0.065c. Our analysis indicates that
the fraction of the total bolometric energy released by HS 0810+2554 into the
IGM in the form of kinetic energy is epsilon_k = 1.0(-0.6,+0.8). An efficiency
of greater than unity implies that magnetic driving is likely a significant
contributor to the acceleration of this X-ray absorbing wind. We also estimate
the mass-outflow rate of the strongest absorption component to be
Mdot_abs=1.1(-0.7,+0.9) M_solar yr^-1. Assuming that the energetic outflow

biometrics-based authentication systems utilizing \emph{cancelable biometric}

generation deals with the trade-off between template security and matching
performance, many state-of-the-art algorithms successful in generating high
quality cancelable biometrics all have random projection as one of their early
processing steps. This paper therefore presents a formal analysis of why random
projections is an essential step in cancelable biometrics. By formally defining
the notion of an \textit{Independent Subspace Structure} for datasets, it can
be shown that random projection preserves the subspace structure of data
vectors generated from a union of independent linear subspaces. The bound on
the minimum number of random vectors required for this to hold is also derived
and is shown to depend logarithmically on the number of data samples, not only
in independent subspaces but in disjoint subspace settings as well. The
theoretical analysis presented is supported in detail with empirical results on
real-world face recognition datasets.

spectrum major flares in the first eight months of 2013. Since, the RATAN
receives one measurement per day, we cannot determine the jet forming time
without more information. Fortunately, this is possible since a distinct X-ray
light curve signature that occurs preceding and during major ejections has been
determined in an earlier study. The X-ray luminosity spikes to very high levels
in the hours before ejection then becomes variable (with a nearly equal X-ray
luminosity when averaged over the duration of the ejection) during a brief 3 to

we can estimate the beginning and end of the ejection episode of the strong

time resolved spectroscopy from the data in the MAXI archives allows us to
deduce that the X-ray absorbing hydrogen column density increases significantly

distributed storage networks. Initially, the analysis of RCs was based on the
assumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish
(among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i.e., the newcomer is
oblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind
repair (BR) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that the newcomer
should choose to access only those ""good"" helpers. In this paper, a new
characterization of the effect of choosing the helper nodes in terms of the
storage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, answers to the following
fundamental questions are given: Under what conditions does proactively
choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff? Can this
improvement be analytically quantified?
  This paper answers the former question by providing a necessary and
sufficient condition under which optimally choosing good helpers strictly
improves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. To answer the latter question, a
low-complexity helper selection solution, termed the family repair (FR) scheme,
is proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is
characterized. For example, consider a distributed storage network with 60
total number of nodes and the network is resilient against 50 node failures. If
the number of helper nodes is 10, then the FR scheme and its variant
demonstrate 27% reduction in the repair-bandwidth when compared to the BR
solution. This paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FR
scheme is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes. An explicit
construction of an exact-repair code is also proposed that can achieve the
minimum-bandwidth-regenerating point of the FR scheme. The new exact-repair
code can be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional repetition
code.

there is no EUV counterparts of the H$\alpha$ counter-streamings in the
filament channel, implying that the ubiquitous H$\alpha$ counter-streamings
found by previous research are mainly due to longitudinal oscillations of
filament threads, which are not in phase between each other. However, there
exist larger-scale patchy counter-streamings in EUV along the filament channel
from one polarity to the other, implying that there is another component of
uni-directional flow (in the range of $\pm$10 km s$^{-1}$) inside each filament
thread in addition to the implied longitudinal oscillation. Our results suggest
that the flow direction of the larger-scale patchy counter-streaming plasma in
the EUV is related to the intensity of the plage or active network, with the
upflows being located at brighter areas of the plage and downflows at the
weaker areas. Besides, we propose a new method to determine the chirality of an
erupting filament based on the skewness of the conjugate filament drainage
sites. It suggests that the right-skewed drainage corresponds to sinistral

diffeomorphism invariance either explicitly or spontaneously. In the case of
explicit breaking it is known that conflicts can arise between the dynamics and
geometrical constraints, while spontaneous breaking evades this problem. It is
for this reason that in the gravity sector of the Standard-Model Extension
(SME) it is assumed that the background fields (SME coefficients) originate
from spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in other examples, such as
Chern-Simons gravity and massive gravity, diffeomorphism invariance is
explicitly broken by the background fields, and the potential conflicts between
the dynamics and geometry can be avoided in most cases. An analysis of how this
occurs is given, and the conditions that are placed on the metric tensor and
gravitational structure as a result of the presence of an explicit-breaking
background are described. The gravity sector of the SME is then considered for
the case of explicit breaking. However, it is found that a useful

spectra of linearly and circularly polarized Alfv\'{e}n waves (LPAWs and CPAWs
hereafter) is studied. The obtained analytic solutions are in good agreement
with the simulation results, indicating that newborn ions are heated by
low-frequency Alfv\'{e}n waves with finite amplitude in low-beta plasmas such
as the solar corona. The analytic solutions also reproduce the preferential
heating of heavy ions in the solar wind. In the presence of parallel
propagating Alfv\'{e}n waves, turbulence-induced particle motion is clearly
observed in the wave (magnetic field) polarized directions. After the waves
diminish, the newborn ions are heated, which is caused by the phase difference
(randomization) between ions due to their different parallel thermal motions.
The heating is dominant in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic
field. The perpendicular heating,
$\eta=(T_{i\perp}^R-T_{i0\perp}^R)/T_{i0\perp}^R$ (where $T_{i0\perp}^R$ and
$T_{i\perp}^R$ are the perpendicular temperature of species $i$ before and
after genuine heating, respectively), in the spectrum of CPAWs is a factor of
two stronger than that of LPAWs. Moreover, we also study the effect of
field-aligned differential flow speed of species $i$ relative to $H^+$, $\delta
v_{ip} = (\mathbf{v_i}-\mathbf{v_p}) \cdot \mathbf{B} / |\mathbf{B}|$ (where

considering additional information, available to the system. This topic has
gained a lot of attention recently. Among others, several factorization methods
were proposed to solve the problem, although most of them assume explicit
feedback which strongly limits their real-world applicability. While these
algorithms apply various loss functions and optimization strategies, the
preference modeling under context is less explored due to the lack of tools
allowing for easy experimentation with various models. As context dimensions
are introduced beyond users and items, the space of possible preference models
and the importance of proper modeling largely increases.
  In this paper we propose a General Factorization Framework (GFF), a single
flexible algorithm that takes the preference model as an input and computes
latent feature matrices for the input dimensions. GFF allows us to easily
experiment with various linear models on any context-aware recommendation task,
be it explicit or implicit feedback based. The scaling properties makes it
usable under real life circumstances as well.
  We demonstrate the framework's potential by exploring various preference
models on a 4-dimensional context-aware problem with contexts that are
available for almost any real life datasets. We show in our experiments --
performed on five real life, implicit feedback datasets -- that proper
preference modelling significantly increases recommendation accuracy, and
previously unused models outperform the traditional ones. Novel models in GFF
also outperform state-of-the-art factorization algorithms.
  We also extend the method to be fully compliant to the Multidimensional
Dataspace Model, one of the most extensive data models of context-enriched
data. Extended GFF allows the seamless incorporation of information into the

characteristics of matter as it changes inertial frame. This explanation is
akin to that favoured by Lorentz, but informed by later insights, due primarily
to de Broglie, regarding the underlying unity of matter and radiation. To show
the nature of these changes, a massive particle is modelled as a standing wave
in three dimensions. As the particle moves, the standing wave becomes a
travelling wave having two factors. One is a carrier wave displaying the
dilated frequency and contracted ellipsoidal form described by the LT, while
the other (identified as the de Broglie wave) is a modulation defining the
dephasing of the carrier wave (and thus the failure of simultaneity) in the
direction of travel. The superluminality of the de Broglie wave is thus
explained, as are several other mysterious features of the optical behaviour of
matter, including the physical meaning of the Schr\""odinger Eqn. and the
relevance to scattering processes of the de Broglie wave number. Consideration

agreement with previous theoretical arguments and measures on employment

the hierarchy of permanent ones, which constitute the ""heart"" of the city, is
very stable whatever the size of the city. The spatial structure of these
hotspots is also of interest and allows us to distinguish different categories
of cities, from monocentric and ""segregated"" where the spatial distribution is
very dependent on land use, to polycentric where the spatial mixing between
land uses is much more important. These results point towards the possibility

merging neutron star binaries also represent a leading scenario to explain the
phenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Recent observations have
revealed a large subclass of SGRBs with roughly constant luminosity in their
X-ray afterglows, lasting $10\!-\!10^4$ s. These features are generally taken
as evidence of a long-lived central engine powered by the magnetic spin-down of
a uniformly rotating, magnetized object. We propose a different scenario in
which the central engine powering the X-ray emission is a differentially
rotating hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that launches a quasi-isotropic and
baryon-loaded wind driven by the magnetic field, which is built-up through
differential rotation. Our model is supported by long-term, three-dimensional,
general-relativistic, and ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations, showing that
this isotropic emission is a very robust feature. For a given HMNS, the
presence of a collimated component depends sensitively on the initial magnetic
field geometry, while the stationary electromagnetic luminosity depends only on
the magnetic energy initially stored in the system. We show that our model is
compatible with the observed timescales and luminosities and express the latter
in terms of a simple scaling relation.

the large-scale surface magnetic fields of stars. These maps in turn are used
to study the structure of the stars' coronae and winds. This method, however,
misses any small-scale magnetic flux whose polarisation signatures cancel out.
Measurements of Zeeman broadening show that a large percentage of the surface
magnetic flux may be neglected in this way. In this paper we assess the impact
of this 'missing flux' on the predicted coronal structure and the possible
rates of spin down due to the stellar wind. To do this we create a model for
the small-scale field and add this to the Zeeman-Doppler maps of the magnetic
fields of a sample of 12 M dwarfs. We extrapolate this combined field and
determine the structure of a hydrostatic, isothermal corona. The addition of
small-scale surface field produces a carpet of low-lying magnetic loops that
covers most of the surface, including the stellar equivalent of solar 'coronal
holes' where the large-scale field is opened up by the stellar wind and hence
would be X-ray dark. We show that the trend of the X-ray emission measure with
rotation rate (the so-called 'activity-rotation relation') is unaffected by the
addition of small-scale field, when scaled with respect to the large-scale
field of each star. The addition of small-scale field increases the surface
flux; however, the large-scale open flux that governs the loss of mass and
angular momentum in the wind remains unaffected. We conclude that spin-down
times and mass loss rates calculated from surface magnetograms are unlikely to
be significantly influenced by the neglect of small-scale field.

operators, which cannot be accurately obtained together at a given time instant
due to the Heisenberg uncertainty ratio. By mapping spin dynamics onto a
spatial walk such a procedure determines measurement-time averages of $\sigma

short-time measurement. The other, qualitatively different, example is the spin
of a one-dimensional particle in a magnetic field. Here the outcome depends on
the angle between the spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields. These results
can be applied to studies of spin-orbit coupled cold atoms and electrons in
