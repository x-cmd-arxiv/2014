can increase the level of security in quantum communication applications. In
this paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to
teleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different
quantum channels. These quantum chan- nels are based on accelerated multi-qubit
states, where each qubit of each of these channels represent a partner. Namely,
these states are the the W state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and
the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting acceler-
ated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated
information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state.
Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that
the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the
measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes
that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is
more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the
other two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized
later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.

In this paper, we demonstrate the acquisition of infrared spectra from single

are generated in a microfluidic flow-focussing device and subsequently
deposited in a square array onto a ZnSe prism using a micro stamp. After
drying, the solutes present in the droplets are illuminated locally by an
infrared laser through the prism, and their thermal expansion upon absorption
of infrared radiation is measured with an atomic force microscopy tip, granting
nanoscale resolution. Using this approach, we resolve structural differences in
the amide bands of the spectra of monomeric and aggregated lysozyme from single
microdroplets with picolitre volume.

problem in many scientific disciplines. A key question for inverse parameter
estimation is how to define the metric that quantifies how well model
predictions fit to the data. This metric can be expressed by general cost or
objective functions, but statistical inversion methods require a particular
metric, the probability of observing the data given the model parameters, known
as the likelihood.
  For technical and computational reasons, likelihoods for process-based
stochastic models are usually based on general assumptions about variability in
the observed data, and not on the stochasticity generated by the model. Only in
recent years have new methods become available that allow the generation of
likelihoods directly from stochastic simulations. Previous applications of
these approximate Bayesian methods have concentrated on relatively simple
models. Here, we report on the application of a simulation-based likelihood
approximation for FORMIND, a parameter-rich individual-based model of tropical
forest dynamics.
  We show that approximate Bayesian inference, based on a parametric likelihood
approximation placed in a conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler,
performs well in retrieving known parameter values from virtual inventory data
generated by the forest model. We analyze the results of the parameter
estimation, examine its sensitivity to the choice and aggregation of model
outputs and observed data (summary statistics), and demonstrate the application
of this method by fitting the FORMIND model to field data from an Ecuadorian
tropical forest. Finally, we discuss how this approach differs from approximate

space; (2) we do not assume that it is bounded below by a Maxwellian at

control theory. We prove two main classes of results. On the one hand, we show
that convergence towards an equilibrium is equivalent to an almost everywhere
geometric control condition. The equilibria (which are not necessarily

in terms of the equivalence classes of an appropriate equivalence relation. On

transitions in biomembranes. This is a consequence of ideal mixing of the
anesthetic drugs in the membrane fluid phase and exclusion from the solid

Meyer-Overton rule. We show here that general anesthetics, barbiturates and
local anesthetics all display the same effect on melting transitions. Their
effect is reversed by hydrostatic pressure. Thus, the thermodynamic behavior of
local anesthetics is very similar to that of general anesthetics. We present a
detailed thermodynamic analysis of heat capacity profiles of membranes in the
presence of anesthetics. This analysis is able to describe experimentally
observed calorimetric profiles and permits prediction of the anesthetic
features of arbitrary molecules. In addition, we discuss the thermodynamic
origin of the cutoff-effect of long-chain alcohols and the additivity of the
effect of general and local anesthetics.

state response to local unitary perturbations. Such response is quantified by
the distance between the unperturbed and perturbed states, minimized with
respect to suitably identified sets of local unitary operations. In order to be
a bona fide measure of quantum correlations, the distance function must be
chosen among those that are contractive under completely positive and trace
preserving maps. The most relevant instances of such physically well behaved
metrics include the trace, the Bures, and the Hellinger distance. To each of
these metrics one can associate the corresponding discord of response, namely
the trace, or Hellinger, or Bures minimum distance from the set of unitarily
perturbed states. All these three discords of response satisfy the basic axioms
for a proper measure of quantum correlations. In the present work we focus in
particular on the Bures distance, which enjoys the unique property of being
both Riemannian and contractive under completely positive and trace preserving
maps, and admits important operational interpretations in terms of state
distinguishability. We compute analytically the Bures discord of response for
two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals and we compare it with the
corresponding Bures geometric discord, namely the geometric measure of quantum
correlations defined as the Bures distance from the set of classically
correlated quantum states. Finally, we investigate and identify the maximally
quantum correlated two-qubit states according to the Bures discord of response.
These states exhibit a remarkable nonlinear dependence on the global state
purity.

electrons arrange themselves in 2D crystalline structure known as Wigner
crystal. In channels, the boundaries interfere the crystalline order and in
case of very narrow channels one observes a quasi-1D Wigner crystal formed by
just a few rows of electrons and, ultimately, one row, i.e., in the ``quantum
wire'' regime. Recently, the ``quantum wire'' regime was accessed
experimentally [D. Rees {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 108}, 176801

the electron conductance. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the
nonlinear transport of electrons in channels with constrictions: single and
multiple symmetric and asymmetric geometrical constrictions with varying width
and length, and saddle-point-type potentials with varying gate voltage. We
analyze the average particle velocity versus driving force or the gate voltage.
We have revealed a significant difference in the dynamics for long and short
constrictions: the oscillations of the average particle velocity for the
systems with short constrictions exhibit a clear correlation with the
transitions between the states with different numbers of rows of particles
while for longer constrictions these oscillations are suppressed. The obtained
results are in agreement with the experimental observations. We proposed a
FET-like structure that consists of a channel with asymmetric constrictions. We
show that applying a transverse bias results either in increase of the average
particle velocity or in its suppression thus allowing a flexible control tool
over the electron transport. Our results bring important insights into the
dynamics of electrons floating on the surface of superfluid $^{4}$He in
channels with constrictions and allow an effective control over the electron

a first crossover to the Rouse regime of $t^{2\nu/{1+2\nu}}$ for $\tau_1 \sim

number of monomers per chain N = 16 - 2048 and persistence length $\ell_p = 1 -

consists of one main clump, named G79A, elongated following the shape of the
IRDC, plus two fainter and smaller cores to the north, which spatially match
the inner infrared shell. We analysed the NH3 spectra at each position with
detected emission and inferred linewidth, rotational temperature, column
density and abundance maps, and find that: i) the linewidth of NH3(1,1) in the
northern cores is 0.5 km/s, slightly larger than in their surroundings; ii) the
NH3 abundance is enhanced by almost one order of magnitude towards the
northwestern side of G79A; iii) there is one `hot slab' at the interface
between the inner infrared shell and the NH3 peak of G79A; iv) the western and
southern edges of G79A present chemical differentiation, with c-C3H2 tracing
more external layers than NH3, similar to what is found in PDRs. Overall, the
kinematics and physical conditions of G79A are consistent with both
shock-induced and UV radiation-induced chemistry driven by the LBV star.
Therefore, the IRDC is not likely associated with the star-forming region DR15,

by two misaligned disks of young, massive stars extending from ~0.04 to 0.4 pc.
The stellar surface density increases as ~ r^-2 towards Sgr A* but is truncated
within 1"" (0.04pc). We explore the origin of this annulus using a model in
which star formation occurs in a disk of gas created through the partial
capture of a gas cloud as it sweeps through the inner few parsecs of the galaxy
and temporarily engulfs Sgr A*. We identify the locations within which star
formation and/or accretion onto Sgr A* take place. Within 0.04 pc the disk is
magnetically active and the associated heating and enhanced pressure prevents
the disk from becoming self gravitating. Instead, it forms a magneto-turbulent
disk that drains onto Sgr A* within 3 Myr. Meanwhile, fragmentation of the gas
beyond the central 0.04 pc hole creates the observed young stellar disk. The
two large scale bubbles of gamma-ray emission extending perpendicular to the
Galactic plane may be created by a burst of accretion of ~10^5 Msun of gas
lying between 0.01 and 0.03 pc. The observed stellar ages imply that this
capture event occurred ~10^6.5 yr ago, thus such events occurring over the life
time of the Galaxy could have significantly contributed to the current mass of
Sgr A* and to the inner few parsec of the nuclear star cluster. We suggest that
these events also occur in extragalactic systems.

  Translocation: A Brownian Dynamics Study","13 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1063/1.4874976",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations are used to study the translocation
dynamics of a coarse-grained polymer through a cylindrical nanopore. We
consider the case of short polymers, with a polymer length, N, in the range
N=21-61. The rate of translocation is controlled by a tunable friction
coefficient, gamma_{0p}, for monomers inside the nanopore. In the case of
unforced translocation, the mean translocation time scales with polymer length
N as <tau_1>~ (N-N_p)^alpha, where N_p is the average number of monomers in the
nanopore. The exponent approaches the value alpha=2 when the pore friction is
sufficiently high, in accord with the prediction for the case of the
quasi-static regime where pore friction dominates. In the case of forced
translocation, the polymer chain is stretched and compressed on the cis and
trans sides, respectively, for low gamma_{0p}. However, the chain approaches
conformational quasi-equilibrium for sufficiently large gamma_{0p}. In this
limit the observed scaling of <tau_1> with driving force and chain length
supports the FP prediction that <tau> is proportional to N/f_d for sufficiently
strong driving force. Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate
translocation free energy functions for the system. The free energies are used
with the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate translocation time distributions.
At sufficiently high gamma_{0p}, the predicted distributions are in excellent
agreement with those calculated from the BD simulations. Thus, the FP equation
provides a valid description of translocation dynamics for sufficiently high
pore friction for the range of polymer lengths considered here. Increasing N
will require a corresponding increase in pore friction to maintain the validity
of the FP approach. Outside the regime of low N and high pore friction, the
polymer is out of equilibrium, and the FP approach is not valid.

as way to make systems more resistant to attacks. These defenses change the
properties of the platforms in order to make attacks more complicated.
Unfortunately, little work has been done on measuring the effectiveness of
these defenses. In this work, we use four different approaches to
quantitatively analyze these defenses; an abstract analysis studies the
algebraic models of a temporal platform diversity system; a set of experiments
on a test bed measures the metrics of interest for the system; a game theoretic
analysis studies the impact of preferential selection of platforms and derives
an optimal strategy; finally, a set of simulations evaluates the metrics of
interest on the models. Our results from these approaches all agree and yet are
counter-intuitive. We show that although platform diversity can mitigate some
attacks, it can be detrimental for others. We also illustrate that the benefit
from these systems heavily depends on their threat model and that the
preferential selection of platforms can achieve better protection.

increased dramatically. Due to the large data volumes generated by these
searches, especially in planned surveys for future radio telescopes, such
searches have to be conducted in real-time. This has led to the development of
a multitude of search techniques and real-time pipeline prototypes. In this
work we investigated the applicability of GPUs. We have designed and
implemented a scalable, flexibile, GPU-based, transient search pipeline
composed of several processing stages, including RFI mitigation, dedispersion,
event detection and classification, as well as data quantisation and
persistence. These stages are encapsulated as a standalone framework. The
optimised GPU implementation of direct dedispersion achieves a speedup of more
than an order of magnitude when compared to an optimised CPU implementation. We
use a density-based clustering algorithm, coupled with a candidate selection
mechanism to group detections caused by the same event together and
automatically classify them as either RFI or of celestial origin. This setup
was deployed at the Medicina BEST-II array where several test observations were
conducted. Finally, we calculate the number of GPUs required to process all the
beams for the SKA1-mid non-imaging pipeline. We have also investigated the
applicability of GPUs for beamforming, where our implementation achieves more
than 50% of the peak theoretical performance. We also demonstrate that for
large arrays, and in observations where the generated beams need to be
processed outside of the GPU, the system will become PCIe bandwidth limited.
This can be alleviated by processing the synthesised beams on the GPU itself,
and we demonstrate this by integrating the beamformer to the transient
detection pipeline.

post-Markovian quantum master equations can be derived without using any
perturbative approximation. A system coupled to an environment characterized by
self-classical configurational fluctuations, the latter obeying a Markovian
dynamics, defines the underlying physical model. Both Shabani-Lidar equation
[A. Shabani and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101(R) (2005)] and its
associated approximated integro-differential kernel master equation are
obtained by tracing out two different bipartite Markovian Lindblad dynamics
where the environment fluctuations are taken into account by an ancilla system.
Furthermore, conditions under which the non-Markovian system dynamics can be
unravelled in terms of an ensemble of measurement trajectories are found. In
addition, a non-Markovian quantum jump approach is formulated. Contrary to
recent analysis [L. Mazzola, E. M. Laine, H. P. Breuer, S. Maniscalco, and J.
Piilo, Phys. Rev. A 81, 062120 (2010)], we also demonstrate that these master
equations, even with exponential memory functions, may lead to non-Markovian
effects such as an environment-to-system backflow of information if the
Hamiltonian system does not commutate with the dissipative dynamics.

in the Hubble and Spitzer imaging data of Abell 2744, as part of the Hubble
Frontier Fields legacy program. We applied the most commonly-used methods to
select exceptionally high-z galaxies by combining non-detection and
color-criteria using seven HST bands. We used GALFIT on IRAC images for fitting
and subtracting contamination of bright nearby sources. The physical properties
have been inferred from SED-fitting using templates with and without nebular
emission. This letter is focussed on the brightest candidate we found
(m$_{F160W}$=26.2) over the 4.9 arcmin$^2$ field of view covered by the WFC3.
It shows a non-detection in the ACS bands and at 3.6{\mu}m whereas it is
clearly detected at 4.5{\mu}m with rather similar depths. This break in the
IRAC data could be explained by strong [OIII]+H{\beta} lines at z~8 which
contribute to the 4.5{\mu}m photometry. The best photo-z is found at
z~8.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$, although solutions at low-redshift (z~1.9) cannot be
completely excluded, but they are strongly disfavoured by the SED-fitting work.
The amplification factor is relatively small at {\mu}=1.49$\pm$0.02. The Star
Formation Rate in this object is ranging from 8 to 60 Mo/yr, the stellar mass
is in the order of M$_{\star}$=(2.5-10) x 10$^{9}$Mo and the size is
r~0.35$\pm$0.15 kpc. This object is one of the first z~8 LBG candidates showing
a clear break between 3.6{\mu}m and 4.5{\mu}m which is consistent with the IRAC
properties of the first spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at a similar
redshift. Due to its brightness, the redshift of this object could potentially
be confirmed by near infrared spectroscopy with current 8-10m telescopes. The
nature of this candidate will be revealed in the coming months with the arrival
of new ACS and Spitzer data, increasing the depth at optical and near-IR
wavelengths.

convex Kantorovich potential for the optimal transport map in the
Monge-Kantorovich transport problem betweeen \mu and g (for a quadratic cost
function). Accordingly, our general setting can be seen as a complex version of
optimal transport theory. Our main complex geometric applications concern the

it was shown to be sum-capacity optimal in the Gaussian interference channel
(IC) with very-weak (noisy) interference. In this paper, the 2-user IC is
altered by introducing an additional transmitter that wants to communicate with
one of the receivers of the IC. The resulting network thus consists of a
point-to-point channel interfering with a multiple access channel (MAC) and is
denoted PIMAC. The sum-capacity of the PIMAC is studied with main focus on the
optimality of TIN. It turns out that TIN in its naive variant, where all
transmitters are active and both receivers use TIN for decoding, is not the
best choice for the PIMAC. In fact, a scheme that combines both time division
multiple access and TIN (TDMA-TIN) strictly outperforms the naive-TIN scheme.
Furthermore, it is shown that in some regimes, TDMA-TIN achieves the
sum-capacity for the deterministic PIMAC and the sum-capacity within a constant
gap for the Gaussian PIMAC. Additionally, it is shown that, even for very-weak
interference, there are some regimes where a combination of interference
alignment with power control and treating interference as noise at the receiver
side outperforms TDMA-TIN. As a consequence, on the one hand treating
interference as noise in a cellular uplink is approximately optimal in certain
regimes. On the other hand those regimes cannot be simply described by the
strength of interference.

These instabilities arise as a consequence of the nodal integration scheme,
which causes rank-deficiency and leads to spurious zero-energy modes. As a

(RLE); that is, identifying whether one word entails another. For example,
""buy"" entails ""own"". Two general strategies for RLE have been proposed: One
strategy is to manually construct an asymmetric similarity measure for context
vectors (directional similarity) and another is to treat RLE as a problem of
learning to recognize semantic relations using supervised machine learning
techniques (relation classification). In this paper, we experiment with two
recent state-of-the-art representatives of the two general strategies. The
first approach is an asymmetric similarity measure (an instance of the
directional similarity strategy), designed to capture the degree to which the
contexts of a word, a, form a subset of the contexts of another word, b. The
second approach (an instance of the relation classification strategy)
represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector that is the concatenation of
the context vectors of a and b, and then applies supervised learning to a
training set of labeled feature vectors. Additionally, we introduce a third
approach that is a new instance of the relation classification strategy. The
third approach represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector in which the
features are the differences in the similarities of a and b to a set of
reference words. All three approaches use vector space models (VSMs) of
semantics, based on word-context matrices. We perform an extensive evaluation
of the three approaches using three different datasets. The proposed new
approach (similarity differences) performs significantly better than the other
two approaches on some datasets and there is no dataset for which it is
significantly worse. Our results suggest it is beneficial to make connections
between the research in lexical entailment and the research in semantic
relation classification.

find that the extent of this expansion can be understood by coupling
electrostatics with shell theory; moreover, the expansion dynamics is well
described by Darcy's law for fluid flow through the microcapsule shell.
Unexpectedly, however, below a threshold NaOH concentration, the microcapsules
begin to disintegrate, and eventually rupture; they then expand non-uniformly,

fascinating range of behaviors exhibited by pH-responsive microcapsules, driven

definedthe main related concepts: torsion, curvature, holonomy groups. He
discussed applications of these concepts in Classical and Relativistic
Mechanics; in particular he explained how parallel transport with respect to a
connection can be related to the principle of inertia in Galilean Mechanics
and, more generally, can be used to model the motion of a particle in a
gravitational field. In subsequent papers, Elie Cartan extended these concepts
for other types of connections on a manifold: Euclidean, Galilean and
Minkowskian connections which can be considered as special types of affine
connections, the group of affine transformations of the affine tangent space
being replaced by a suitable subgroup; and more generally, conformal and
projective connections, associated to a group which is no more a subgroup of
the affine group. Around 1950, Charles Ehresmann introduced connections on a
fibre bundle and, when the bundle has a Lie group as structure group,
connection forms on the associated principal bundle, with values in the Lie
algebra of the structure group. He called Cartan connections the various types
of connections on a manifold previously introduced by E. Cartan, and explained
how they can be considered as special cases of connections on a fibre bundle
with a Lie group G as structure group: the standard fibre of the bundle is then
an homogeneous space G/G' ; its dimension is equal to that of the base
manifold; a Cartan connection determines an isomorphism of the vector bundle
tangent to the the base manifold onto the vector bundle of vertical vectors
tangent to the fibres of the bundle along a global section. These works are
reviewed and some applications of the theory of connections are sketched.

simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic

ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in
fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces
decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and
strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the

extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum
model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent
with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong

physics, where the goal is to estimate the true spectrum of elementary
particles given observations distorted by measurement error due to the limited
resolution of a particle detector. This an important statistical inverse
problem arising in the analysis of data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Mathematically, the problem is formalized as one of estimating the intensity
function of an indirectly observed Poisson point process. Particle physicists
are particularly keen on unfolding methods that feature a principled way of
choosing the regularization strength and allow for the quantification of the
uncertainty inherent in the solution. Though there are many approaches that
have been considered by experimental physicists, it can be argued that few --
if any -- of these deal with these two key issues in a satisfactory manner. In
this paper, we propose to attack the unfolding problem within the framework of
empirical Bayes estimation: we consider Bayes estimators of the coefficients of
a basis expansion of the unknown intensity, using a regularizing prior; and
employ a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm to find the marginal
maximum likelihood estimate of the hyperparameter controlling the strength of
the regularization. Due to the data-driven choice of the hyperparameter,
credible intervals derived using the empirical Bayes posterior lose their
subjective Bayesian interpretation. Since the properties and meaning of such
intervals are poorly understood, we explore instead the use of bootstrap
resampling for constructing purely frequentist confidence bands for the true
intensity. The performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using
both simulations and real data from the Large Hadron Collider.

mixes with additional, heavier CP-even states, causing deviations in the Higgs
couplings from SM values. These deviations are reduced as the heavy states are
decoupled with large soft masses, thereby exacerbating the tuning associated
with the electroweak scale. This new source of tuning is different from that
derived from collider limits on stops, gluinos and Higgsinos. It can be offset
with large tan beta in the MSSM, however this compensating effect is limited in
the NMSSM with a large Higgs-singlet coupling due to restrictions on large tan
beta from electroweak precision tests. We derive a lower bound on this tuning
and show that the level of precision of Higgs coupling measurements at the LHC
will probe naturalness in the NMSSM at the few-percent level. This is
comparable to the tuning derived from superpartner limits in models with a low
messenger scale and split families. Instead the significant improvement in
sensitivity of Higgs coupling measurements at the ILC will allow naturalness in

fit of the radial intensity profiles at 450 and 850 micron (or 1.2 mm in two
cases) and the Spectral Energy Distribution, assuming spherical symmetry and
that the density and temperature of the cores decrease with radius following
power-laws. We find a weak (inverse) trend of fragmentation level and density
power-law index, with steeper density profiles tending to show lower
fragmentation, and vice versa. In addition, we find a trend of fragmentation
increasing with density within a given radius, which arises from a combination
of flat density profile and high central density and is consistent with Jeans
fragmentation. We considered the effects of rotational-to-gravitational energy
ratio, non-thermal velocity dispersion, and turbulence mode on the density
structure of the cores, and found that compressive turbulence seems to yield
higher central densities. Finally, a possible explanation for the origin of
cores with concentrated density profiles, which are the cores showing no

as the basic component of magnetically collimated outflows. The only available
analytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized
by the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD
jet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity
at the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the
non-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to
radial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the
analytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional
equations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We
focus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of
axisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind
crossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the results of
these runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the
flow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady
state and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities, except
for the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly
deviate from axisymmetry. The latter quantities show signs of instabilities,
which, however, are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic
separatrix surface. The forces present in the flow, both of collimating and
accelerating nature, are in good agreement in both the 2.5D and the 3D runs. We
conclude that the analytical solution behaves well also after relaxing the

demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten

required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign
of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk.

a velocity-dependent cross section $\sigma \sim v^{-a}$, the gas again forms a

obtained first in Newtonian theory and then in full general relativity.

synthetic spectral energy distributions generated from three-dimensional

general, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity agrees well with the true
instantaneous SFR of the simulated galaxies. However, for the major mergers in
which a strong starburst is induced, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity
can overestimate the instantaneous SFR during the post-starburst phase by
greater than two orders of magnitude. Even though the instantaneous SFR
decreases rapidly after the starburst, the stars that were formed in the
starburst remain dust-obscured and thus produce significant IR luminosity.
Consequently, use of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator may cause one to
conclude that post-starburst galaxies are still star-forming, whereas in
reality, star formation was recently quenched.

Tight/loose transition states and conventional/roaming reaction pathways are
identified in terms of time-invariant objects in phase space. These are
dividing surfaces associated with normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds
(NHIMs). For systems with two degrees of freedom NHIMS are unstable periodic
orbits which, in conjunction with their stable and unstable manifolds,
unambiguously define the (locally) non-recrossing dividing surfaces assumed in
statistical theories of reaction rates. By constructing periodic orbit
continuation/bifurcation diagrams for two values of the potential function
parameter corresponding to late and early transition states, respectively, and
using the total energy as another parameter, we dynamically assign different
regions of phase space to reactants and products as well as to conventional and
roaming reaction pathways. The classical dynamics of the system are
investigated by uniformly sampling trajectory initial conditions on the
dividing surfaces. Trajectories are classified into four different categories:
direct reactive and non reactive trajectories,which lead to the formation of
molecular and radical products respectively, and roaming reactive and non
reactive orbiting trajectories, which represent alternative pathways to form
molecular and radical products. By analysing gap time distributions at several

unrestricted. The symmetry-projected HF approach results in a hierarchy of wave
functions with increasing quality: the more symmetries that are broken and
restored in a self-consistent manner, the higher the quality of the trial wave
function. This hierarchy is approximately maintained in CPMC calculations: the
accuracy in the energy increases and the statistical variance decreases when
further symmetries are broken and restored. Significant improvement is achieved
in CPMC with the best symmetry-projected trial wave functions over those from
simple HF. We analyze and quantify the behavior using the two-dimensional
repulsive Hubbard model as an example. In the sign-problem-free region, where
CPMC can be made exact but a constraint is deliberately imposed here,
spin-projected wave functions remove the constraint bias. Away from
half-filling, spatial symmetry restoration in addition to that of the spin lead
to highly accurate results from CPMC. Since the computational cost of
symmetry-projected HF trial wave functions in CPMC can be made to scale
algebraically with system size, this provides a potentially general approach
for accurate calculations in many-fermion systems.

These were correlated with PACS 70micron images and PACS point sources. In

  For several regions, the data suggest that the linewidth on the scale of
clumps is dominated by outflows or unresolved velocity gradients. IRDC18454 and
G11.11 show two velocity components along several lines of sight. We find that
all regions with a diameter larger than 1pc show either velocity gradients or
fragment into independent structures with distinct velocities. The velocity
profiles of three regions with a smooth gradient are consistent with gas flows
along the filament, suggesting accretion flows onto the densest regions.

I posit that the Moon came into existence from the same gaseous cloud that the
Earth originated from. The paper concludes that the moons can only form at the
time of planet formation in a parallel and simultaneous process, and the new
moons cannot form in a grown up Solar system. The Earth-Moon system is not a
special exception in nature; rather it evolved following the same laws that
other planets or moons have evolved from. This perspective successfully
elucidates what happened between the disk formation and the accumulation of the

magnetic impurities in graphene with different chemial potentials ($\mu$). The
Kondo effect due to either carbon vacancies or magnetic adatoms in graphene is
described by the single-orbital pseudo-gap asymmetric Anderson impurity model.
We find that although the Anderson impurity model considered here is a mixed
valence system, it can be drived into either the Kondo [$\mu > \mu_c$ (critical
value) $>0$] or mixed valency ($\mu \approx \mu_c$) or empty orbital ($\mu <
\mu_c$) regime by a gate voltage, giving rise to characteristic features in
resistivity and dephasing rate in each regime. Specifically, in the case of
$\mu < \mu_c$, the shapes of the resistivity (dephasing rate) curves for
different $\mu$ are nearly identical. However, as temperature decreases, they
start to increase to their maxima at a lower $T/T_K$ but more rapidly [as
$(T_K/T)^{3/2}$] than in normal metals [here $T$ ($T_K$) denotes the (Kondo)
temperature]. As $T$ further decreases, after reaching the maximum, the
dephasing rate drops more quickly than in normal metals, behaving as
$(T/T_K)^3$ instead of $(T/T_K)^2$. Furthermore, the resistivity has a distinct
peak above the saturation value near $T_K$. In the case of $\mu > \mu_c$, in
contrast, the resistivity curve has an additional broad shoulder above 10$T_K$
and the dephasing rate exhibits an interesting shoulder-peak shape. In the
narrow boundary region ($\mu \approx \mu_c$), both the resistivity and
dephasing rate curves are similar to the corresponding ones in normal metals.
This explains the conventional Kondo like resistivity from recent experiments
on graphene with defects. The resistivity and dephasing rate are analysized in
terms of the calculated $T$-dependent spectral function, correlation
self-energy and renormalized impurity level.

the channel estimation problem as a weighted sum mean square error (WSMSE)
minimization problem containing pilot symbols and introduced variables. Second,
for fixed pilot symbols, the introduced variables are optimized using minimum
mean square error (MMSE) and generalized Rayleigh quotient methods. Finally,
for $N=1$ and $N=K$ settings, the pilot symbols of all MSs are optimized using
semi definite programming (SDP) convex optimization approach, and for the other
settings of $N$ and $K$, the pilot symbols of all MSs are optimized by applying
simple iterative algorithm. When $N=K$, it is shown that the latter iterative
algorithm gives the optimal pilot symbols achieved by the SDP method.
Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves less WSMSE

Fe-implantation in a TiO$_2$ pellet sample induces heterovalent cation
substitution (Fe$^{2+}\rightarrow$ Ti$^{4+}$) beneath the surface region. But
in thin film samples, the clustering of Fe atoms is primarily detected. In
addition to this, significant amounts of secondary phases of Fe$^{3+}$ are
detected on the surface of all doped samples due to oxygen exposure. These
experimental findings are compared with density functional theory (DFT)
calculations of formation energies for different configurations of structural
defects in the implanted TiO$_2$:Fe system. According to our calculations, the
clustering of Fe-atoms in TiO$_2$:Fe thin films can be attributed to the
formation of combined substitutional and interstitial defects. Further, the
differences due to Fe doping in pellet and thin film samples can ultimately be
attributed to different surface to volume ratios.

systems are among the most critical engineering challenges facing our society.
Water purification is often a multi-step process involving filtration,
desalination, and disinfection of a feedstream. Shock electrodialysis (shock
ED) is a newly developed technique for water desalination, leveraging the
formation of ion concentration polarization (ICP) zones and deionization shock
waves in microscale pores near to an ion selective element. While shock ED has
been demonstrated as an effective water desalination tool, we here present
evidence of other simultaneous functionalities. We show that, unlike
electrodialysis, shock ED can thoroughly filter micron-scale particles and
aggregates of nanoparticles present in the feedwater. We also demonstrate that
shock ED can enable disinfection of feedwaters, as approximately $99\%$ of
viable bacteria (here \textit{E. coli}) in the inflow were killed or removed by
our prototype. Shock ED also separates positive from negative particles,
contrary to claims that ICP acts as a virtual barrier for all charged
particles. By combining these functionalities (filtration, separation and
disinfection) with deionization, shock ED has the potential to enable more
compact and efficient water purification systems.

exist globally; while for $\lambda>\lambda_\delta^*$, all the solution will
quench in finite time. The estimate of the quenching time in terms of large

$\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, if the domain $\Omega$ is radially symmetric,
then the origin is the only quenching point. We not only derive the one-side

of a transiting planet. Such variability has not previously been
well-characterized in the ultraviolet lines used to probe the inflated
atmospheres surrounding hot Jupiters. Therefore, we surveyed 38 F-M stars for
intensity variations in four narrow spectroscopic bands: two enclosing strong
lines from species known to inhabit hot Jupiter atmospheres, CII
$\lambda\lambda$1334,1335 and SiIII $\lambda$1206; one enclosing SiIV
$\lambda\lambda$1393,1402; and 36.5 angstroms of interspersed continuum. For
each star/band combination, we generated 60 s cadence lightcurves from archival
HST COS and STIS time-tagged photon data. Within these lightcurves, we
characterized flares and stochastic fluctuations as separate forms of
variability. Flares: We used a cross-correlation approach to detect 116 flares.
These events occur in the time-series an average of once per 2.5 h, over 50%
last 4 min or less, and most produce the strongest response in SiIV. If the
flare occurred during a transit measurement integrated for 60 min, 90/116 would
destroy the signal of an Earth, 27/116 Neptune, and 7/116 Jupiter, with the
upward bias in flux ranging from 1-109% of quiescent levels. Fluctuations:
Photon noise and underlying stellar fluctuations produce scatter in the
quiescent data. We model the stellar fluctuations as Gaussian white noise with
standard deviation $\sigma_x$. Maximum likelihood values of $\sigma_x$ range
from 1-41% for 60 s measurements. These values suggest that many cool stars
will only permit a transit detection to high confidence in ultraviolet
resonance lines if the radius of the occulting disk is $\gtrsim$ 1 R$_J$.
However, for some M dwarfs this limit can be as low as several $R_{Earth}$.

galaxy-scale mean dust opacity and metallicity, motivated by recent
observations of star formation in nearby galaxies and theoretical
considerations. This new model is used to investigate the effect of such a
feedback on shaping the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution. Star
formation activity is significantly suppressed in dwarf galaxies by the new
feedback effect, and the faint-end slope of local luminosity functions can be
reproduced with a reasonable strength of supernova feedback, which is in
contrast to the previous models that require a rather extreme strength of
supernova feedback. Our model can also reproduce the early appearance of
massive galaxies manifested in the bright-end of high redshift K-band
luminosity functions. Though some of the previous models also succeeded in
reproducing this, they assumed a star formation law depending on the
galaxy-scale dynamical time, which is not supported by observations. We argue
that the feedback depending on dust opacity (or metal column density) is
essential, rather than that simply depending on gas column density, to get
these results.

architecture of planetary systems causing eccentricity excitation and orbital
misalignment between the planet orbit and the equatorial plane of the star. We
explore whether the impulsive changes in the orbital elements of planets,
caused by an hyperbolic stellar flyby, can be fully damped by the circumstellar
disk surrounding the star. The time required to disperse stellar clusters is in
fact comparable to circumstellar disk's lifetime. We have modelled in 3D a
system made of a solar type star surrounded by a low density disk with a giant
planet embedded in it approached on a hyperbolic encounter trajectory by a
second star, of similar mass and with its own disk. We focus on extreme
configurations where a very deep stellar flyby perturbs a Jovian planet on an
external orbit. This allows to test in full the ability of the disk to erase
the effects of the stellar encounter. We find that the amount of mass lost by
the disk during the stellar flyby is less than in 2D models where a single disk
was considered due to the mass exchange between the two disks at the encounter.
The damping in eccentricity is slightly faster than in 2D models and it occurs
on timescales of the order of a few kyr. The only trace of the flyby left in
the planet system, after about 10^4 yr, is a small misalignment, lower than 9
degrees, between the star equatorial plane and the planet orbit. In a realistic
model based on 3D simulations of star--planet--disk interactions, we find that
stellar flybys cannot excite significant eccentricities and inclinations of
planets in stellar clusters. The circumstellar disks hosting the planets damp
on a short timescale all the step changes in the two orbital parameters
produced during any stellar encounter. All records of past encounters are
erased.

Small Magellanic Cloud. It is a young stellar system well-revealed from its
natal environment, comprising complete samples of pre--main-sequence and upper
main-sequence stars, very close to their formation. We apply a comprehensive
characterization of the autocorrelation function for both centrally condensed
stellar clusters and self-similar stellar distributions through numerical
simulations of stellar ensembles. We interpret the observed autocorrelation
function of NGC 346 on the basis of these simulations. We find that it can be
best explained as the combination of two distinct stellar clustering designs, a
centrally concentrated, dominant at the central part of the star-forming
region, and an extended self-similar distribution of stars across the complete
observed field. The cluster component, similar to non-truncated young star
clusters, is determined to have a core radius of ~2.5 pc and a density profile
index of ~2.3. The extended fractal component is found with our simulations to
have a fractal dimension of ~2.3, identical to that found for the interstellar
medium, in agreement to hierarchy induced by turbulence. This suggests that the
stellar clustering at a time very near to birth behaves in a complex manner. It
is the combined result of the star formation process regulated by turbulence
and the early dynamical evolution induced by the gravitational potential of
condensed stellar clusters.

TYPELINE uses TEUs for processing various SDT operations. This architecture
design leads to reducing the number of machine codes, and increases execution

architecture supports some operation for the execution of Abstract Data Types
in parallel. Also it ensures to maintain data type features and entire

framework includes compiler level identifying execution modes and memory

unbiased in the low-temperature limit and also the error bar is reliably
estimated. The level spectroscopy from quantum Monte Carlo data is developed as
an application of the unbiased gap estimation. From the spectral analysis, we
precisely determine the Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase-transition point of
the spin-Peierls model. It is stablished that the quantum phonon with a finite
frequency is essential to the critical theory governed by the antiadiabatic
limit, i.e., the $k=1$ SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model.

systems that exhibit synchronisation. In this article we study the difference
between networks with symmetric and asymmetric distribution of natural
frequencies. We first indicate that the synchronisation frequency of the
oscillators is independent of the natural frequency distribution for a
completely connected network. Further we analyse the case of oscillators in a
directed ring-network where asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution is
seen to shift the synchronisation frequency of the network. We also present an
estimate of the shift in the frequencies for slightly asymmetric distributions.

Namely, we identify the generic complex invariant manifolds of the systems as a
hyperelliptic Prym subvariety of the Jacobian of the spectral curve of the
corresponding Lax representation.
  The exact discretization of the system is described as a translation on the
Prym variety.

combinations of transverse photons and does not include any scalar and/or
longitudinal photons. This approach is also used to determine and investigate
the actual symmetry of the free electromagnetic field. Then we discuss the
Majorana representation of the Maxwell equations, the symmetric form of Maxwell
equations and an original approach to electrodynamics called the ""scalar

quadratic cost function $\|y-Ax\|_2^2$, where A is a dictionary and x is an
unknown sparse vector. It is well-known that imposing an $\ell_0$ constraint
leads to an NP-hard minimization problem. The convex relaxation approach has
received considerable attention, where the $\ell_0$-norm is replaced by the
$\ell_1$-norm. Among the many efficient $\ell_1$ solvers, the homotopy
algorithm minimizes $\|y-Ax\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_1$ with respect to x for a
continuum of $\lambda$'s. It is inspired by the piecewise regularity of the
$\ell_1$-regularization path, also referred to as the homotopy path. In this
paper, we address the minimization problem $\|y-Ax\|_2^2+\lambda\|x\|_0$ for a
continuum of $\lambda$'s and propose two heuristic search algorithms for
$\ell_0$-homotopy. Continuation Single Best Replacement is a forward-backward
greedy strategy extending the Single Best Replacement algorithm, previously
proposed for $\ell_0$-minimization at a given $\lambda$. The adaptive search of
the $\lambda$-values is inspired by $\ell_1$-homotopy. $\ell_0$ Regularization
Path Descent is a more complex algorithm exploiting the structural properties
of the $\ell_0$-regularization path, which is piecewise constant with respect
to $\lambda$. Both algorithms are empirically evaluated for difficult inverse
problems involving ill-conditioned dictionaries. Finally, we show that they can
be easily coupled with usual methods of model order selection.
