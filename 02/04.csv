and empirically proven model (Stahl (89') \cite{Stahl89}) is used. The model is
extended to include an exogenously given bound on prices sellers can offer,
excluding prices below such bound. The finding are rather surprising - when the
bound is set sufficiently high expected price offered (EPO) by sellers drops
significantly. The result seem to be robust in the parameters of the model, and
driven by the information provided to consumers by such legislation step: when
the limitation is set at sufficiently high levels all consumers anticipate the
bound price, and searchers reject any price above it. As a result sellers offer
the bound price as a pure strategy.

non-hermitian wave equations beyond one dimension. We show that if the spectrum
is degenerate in the absence of T-breaking, and T is broken in a generic manner
(without preserving other discrete symmetries), then the standard PT-symmetry
breaking transition does not occur, meaning that the spectrum is complex even
for infinitesimal strength of gain and loss. However the realness of the entire
spectrum can be preserved over a finite interval if additional discrete
symmetries X are imposed when T is broken, if X decouple all degenerate modes.
When this is true only for a subset of the degenerate spectrum, there can be a
partial PT transition in which this subset remains real over a finite interval
of T-breaking. If the spectrum has odd-degeneracy, a fraction of the degenerate
spectrum can remain in the symmetric phase even without imposing additional
discrete symmetries, and they are analogous to dark states in atomic physics.
These results are illustrated by the example of different T-breaking
perturbations of a uniform dielectric disk and sphere, and a group theoretical
analysis is given in the disk case. Finally, we show that multimode coupling is
capable of restoring the T-symmetric phase at finite T-breaking. We also
analyze these questions when the parity operator is replaced by another spatial
symmetry operator and find that the behavior can be qualitatively different.

poroelastic rebound due to fluid flow and post-seismic or post-rifting
viscoelastic relaxation. It can also be used to model deformation due to
processes such as post-glacial rebound, hydrological (un)loading, injection
and/or withdrawal of fluids from subsurface reservoirs etc. Defmod is written

number of subprocesses acting simultaneously across multiple spatial and
temporal scales. An illustrative example important for genomic stability is the
length regulation of telomeres---nucleo-protein structures at the ends of
linear chromosomes. Maintenance of telomeres is often facilitated by the enzyme
telomerase but, particularly in telomerase-free systems, the maintenance of
chromosomal termini depends on alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)
mechanisms mediated by recombination. Various linear and circular DNA
structures were identified to participate in ALT, however, dynamics of the
whole process is still poorly understood. We propose a chemical kinetics model
of ALT with kinetic rates systematically derived from the biophysics of DNA
diffusion and looping. The reaction system is reduced to a
coagulation-fragmentation system by quasi-steady state approximation. The
detailed treatment of kinetic rates yields explicit formulae for expected size
distributions of telomeres that demonstrate the key role played by the
J-factor, a quantitative measure of bending of polymers. The results are in
agreement with experimental data and point out interesting phenomena: an
appearance of very long telomeric circles if the total telomere density exceeds
a critical value (excess mass) and a nonlinear response of the telomere size
distributions to the amount of telomeric DNA in the system. The results can be
of general importance for understanding dynamics of telomeres in
telomerase-independent systems as this mode of telomere maintenance is similar
to the situation in tumor cells lacking telomerase activity. Furthermore, due
to its universality, the model may also serve as a prototype of an interaction
between linear and circular DNA structures in various settings.

was observed (in the far infrared spectra of a multiferroic PrFe3(BO3)4). The
reststrahlen band corresponding to the A2 symmetry nondegenerate phonon mode
near 50 cm-1 (1.5 THz) splits into two bands at about 100 K, well above TN = 32
K. These bands shift and narrow progressively with further lowering the
temperature, demonstrating pronounced peculiarities at TN. The observed effects
were explained by an interaction of the A2 phonon mode with the 4f
crystal-field electronic excitation of Pr3+ whose frequency falls into the TO -
LO frequency region of the phonon mode. Inversion of the TO and LO frequencies
for the electronic excitation and a formation of coupled electron-phonon modes

prototypical perovskites (SrTiO3, BaTiO3, PbTiO3) using a combination of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations with local potentials and hybrid
functionals. First we construct a local correction potential for polaronic
configurations in SrTiO3 that is applied via the DFT+U method and matches the
forces from hybrid calculations. We then use the DFT+U potential to search the
configuration space and locate the lowest energy STH configuration. It is
demonstrated that both the DFT+U potential and the hybrid functional yield a
piece-wise linear dependence of the total energy on the occupation of the STH
level suggesting that self-interaction effects have been properly removed. The
DFT+U model is found to be transferable to BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and formation
energies from DFT+U and hybrid calculations are in close agreement for all
three materials. STH formation is found to be energetically favorable in SrTiO3
and BaTiO3 but not in PbTiO3, which can be rationalized by considering the
alignment of the valence band edges on an absolute energy scale. In the case of
PbTiO3 the strong coupling between Pb 6s and O 2p states lifts the valence band
minimum (VBM) compared to SrTiO3 and BaTiO3. This reduces the separation
between VBM and STH level and renders the STH configuration metastable with
respect to delocalization (band hole state). We expect that the present
approach can be adapted to study STH formation also oxides with different
crystal structures and chemical composition.

confining linear potential between a heavy fermion and antifermion is due to
(1) the Lie algebra and (2) the form of the confining localized function which
has opposite signs at the positions of the particle and antiparticle along the

This could be of particular use in low data or block based estimation problems.
In these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates in

improve with the increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see
through our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for such

subordinate classes instead of basic classes. One major challenge in FGVC is
the co-occurrence of two issues: 1) many subordinate classes are highly
correlated and are difficult to distinguish, and 2) there exists the large
intra-class variation (e.g., due to object pose). This paper proposes to
explicitly address the above two issues via distance metric learning (DML). DML
addresses the first issue by learning an embedding so that data points from the
same class will be pulled together while those from different classes should be
pushed apart from each other; and it addresses the second issue by allowing the
flexibility that only a portion of the neighbors (not all data points) from the
same class need to be pulled together. However, feature representation of an
image is often high dimensional, and DML is known to have difficulty in dealing
with high dimensional feature vectors since it would require $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$
for storage and $\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ for optimization. To this end, we proposed a
multi-stage metric learning framework that divides the large-scale high
dimensional learning problem to a series of simple subproblems, achieving
$\mathcal{O}(d)$ computational complexity. The empirical study with FVGC
benchmark datasets verifies that our method is both effective and efficient
compared to the state-of-the-art FGVC approaches.

standard method of expansion in Gegenbauer polynomials, which requires infinite

divergent terms at each iteration, while in our method the logarithmic

  First, the thesis explains two commonly used supervised learning algorithms,
the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Random Forest classifiers, and includes a
complete proof that the k-NN classifier is universally consistent in any finite
dimensional normed vector space. Second, the thesis introduces two

Mass Transportation Distance (MTD) Feature Selection for discrete domains.
Then, this thesis compares the performance of Random Projections with the k-NN

  The comparative results demonstrate that MTD Feature Selection with Random

in contact with a flat rigid substrate. The contact is in stable equilibrium if
the total energy of the system arising from the elastic and surface forces
exhibits a minimum at a zero or at a slightly negative load. However, as the
system is continually unloaded, the energy barrier decreases and it eventually
disappears, thus leading to a ballistic separation of the contact. While this
type of contact splitting has received wide recognition, what has not been much
appreciated with these types of soft adhesion problems is that rupture of a
contact can also occur at any finite sub critical load in the presence of a
noise. The soft contact problems are unique in that the noise can be a-thermal,
whereas the metastable and stable states of the thermodynamic potential can
arise from the competition of the elastic and the inter-facial energies of the
system. Analysis based on activated rate theory and simulations based on
stochastic dynamics show that the contact rupture dynamics is amenable to a
force and noise induced escape of a particle from a potential well that is
generic to various types of colloidal and macromolecular processes. These ideas
are useful in understanding the results of a recent experiment involving the
noise activated rolling dynamics of a rigid sphere on a surface, where it is
pinned by soft micro-fibrils.

homology theory for the algebra generated by T and T* and its dual cohomology
theory. This leads us to establish homotopy invariance of our homological index
(in the sense of cyclic theory). We are then able to define in a very general
fashion a homological index for certain unbounded operators and prove
invariance of this index under a class of unbounded perturbations.

Navier-Stokes (NS) equations on a d-dimensional torus, in the C^infinity
formulation described, e.g., in [25]. In [22][25] it was shown how to obtain
quantitative estimates on the exact solution of the NS Cauchy problem via the
""a posteriori"" analysis of an approximate solution; such estimates concern the
interval of existence of the exact solution and its distance from the
approximate solution. In the present paper we consider an approximate solutions
of the NS Cauchy problem having the form u^N(t) = sum_{j=0}^N R^j u_j(t), where
R is the ""mathematical"" Reynolds number (the reciprocal of the kinematic
viscosity) and the coefficients u_j(t) are determined stipulating that the NS
equations be satisfied up to an error O(R^{N+1}). This subject was already
treated in [24], where, as an application, the Reynolds expansion of order N=5
in dimension d=3 was considered for the initial datum of Behr-Necas-Wu (BNW).
In the present paper, these results are enriched regarding both the theoretical
analysis and the applications. Concerning the theoretical aspect, we refine the
approach of [24] following [25] and use the symmetries of the initial datum in
building up the expansion. Concerning the applicative aspect we consider two
more (d=3) initial data, namely, the vortices of Taylor-Green (TG) and
Kida-Murakami (KM); the Reynolds expansions for the BNW, TG and KM data are
performed via a Python program, attaining orders between N=12 and N=20. Our a
posteriori analysis proves, amongst else, that the solution of the NS equations
with anyone of the above three data is global if R is below an explicitly
computed critical value. Our critical Reynolds numbers are below the ones
characterizing the turbulent regime; however these bounds have a sound
theoretical support, are fully quantitative and improve previous results of
global existence.

the equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests
that they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius
(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs
cannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A
measurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The
assumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general
relativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We
calculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the
full contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not
probed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere
of radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders
of magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is
beyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of
magnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of
magnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our
results suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing
the hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from
the regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger
ignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains
gravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon
scattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity
models either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their
largest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known. This renders the
crust as the best site to look for deviations from GR.

especially for cryptography. A wide range of applications critically rely on
abundant, high quality random numbers generated securely. Here we show how to
expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying
quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries,
and has the following new features: cryptographic level of security, tolerating
a constant level of imprecision in the devices, requiring only a unit size
quantum memory per device component for the honest implementation, and allowing
a large natural class of constructions for the protocol. In conjunct with a
recent work by Chung, Shi and Wu, it also leads to robust unbounded expansion
using just 2 multi-part devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic
keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined
with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing
that the Renyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific
bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of
the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements, and a method
for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.

numerically, in particular the large-deviation tails. Thus, not only typical
quantities like average or variance but the distributions over the (almost)
full support can be studied. For a proof of principle, a simple transport model
based on the edge-betweenness and three abstract yet widely studied random
network ensembles are considered here: Erdoes-Renyi random networks with finite
connectivity, small world networks and spatial networks embedded in a
two-dimensional plane. Using specific numerical large-deviation techniques,
probability densities as small as 10^(-80) are obtained here. This allows one
to study typical but also the most and the least resilient networks. The
resulting distributions fulfill the mathematical large-deviation principle,
i.e., can be well described by rate functions in the thermodynamic limit. The
analysis of the limiting rate function reveals that the resilience follows an
exponential distribution almost everywhere. An analysis of the structure of the
network shows that the most-resilient networks can be obtained, as a rule of
thumb, by minimizing the diameter of a network. Also, trivially, by including
more links a network can typically be made more resilient. On the other hand,
the least-resilient networks are very rare and characterized by one (or few)
small core(s) to which all other nodes are connected. In total, the spatial
network ensemble turns out to be most suitable for obtaining and studying
resilience of real mostly finite-dimensional networks. Studying this ensemble
in combination with the presented large-deviation approach for more realistic,
in particular dynamic transport networks appears to be very promising.

and, therefore, in generic settings, explicitly violate CP. In settings based
on such groups, CP violation can have pure group-theoretic origin and can be
related to the complexity of some Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. (ii) Groups for
which one can find a CP basis in which all the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are
real. For such groups, imposing CP invariance restricts the phases of coupling
coefficients. (iii) Groups that do not admit real Clebsch-Gordan coefficients

lead to an additional symmetry that forbids certain couplings. We make use of

three types of discrete groups. With $\Delta(27)$, $T^{\prime}$, and
$\Sigma(72)$ we present one explicit example for each type of group, thereby

III]/H-beta at a given [N II]/H-alpha, in agreement with other observations of
z > 1 star-forming galaxies, but composite spectra derived from the sample do
not show an appreciable offset from the local star-forming sequence on the [O

abundance ratio from the composite spectrum, which may contribute to the offset
of the high-redshift galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [O
III]/H-beta versus [N II]/H-alpha diagram. We speculate that the elevated
nitrogen abundance could result from substantial numbers of Wolf-Rayet stars in
starbursting galaxies at z~2. (Abridged)

health and disease. With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible
to follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These
microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of
microbial ecology is to infer the interactions between species from sequence
data. Any algorithm for inferring species interactions must overcome three
obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not
imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative
abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the
parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty,
or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias
inferences of species interactions. Here we introduce an approach, Learning
Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these
obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to
infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested
LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology
of the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to
characterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals
and found that the interaction networks varied significantly between
individuals. Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two
individuals are dominated by distinct ""keystone species"", Bacteroides fragilis
and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a disproportionate influence on the
structure of the gut microbiome even though they are only found in moderate
abundance. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain
keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human gut
microbiome.

N-body simulations to quantify the contribution of different components (main

halo dominates the angular power spectrum of the gamma-ray signal up to quite
large multipoles, where the sub-haloes anisotropy signal starts to emerge, but
the transition multipole strongly depends on the assumed radial profile. The
extrapolation down to radii not resolved by current numerical simulations can
affect both the normalization and the shape of the gamma-ray angular power

entries close to zero in the basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix is
diagonal. This results in specific constraints on the neutrino mixing

masses with the lightest neutrino mass in the $\sim$ meV range and (ii)
testable correlations among the various mixing angles, including a nonzero

it to the amount of hierarchy among Yukawa couplings. These scenarios of
radiative neutrino mass generation also give rise to new short-range
contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay, which dominate over the usual

have a sizable neutrinoless double beta decay rate, in the range of upcoming

well justified by two key observations; first, the shared nature of the
wireless medium which inevitably cross-couples the nodes' forwarding decisions,
thus binding them together as strategic players; second, the stochastic
dynamics associated with the link qualities which renders the transmission
costs noisy, thus motivating a robust formulation. Given the non stationarity
induced by the fading process, an online solution for the formulated game would
then require an adaptive procedure capable of both convergence to and tracking
strategic equilibria as the environment changes. To this end, we deploy the
strategic and non stationary learning algorithm of regret tracking, the
temporally adaptive variant of the celebrated regret matching algorithm, to
guarantee the emergence and active tracking of the correlated equilibria in the
dynamic robust forwarding game. We also make provision for exploiting the
channel state information, when available, to enhance the convergence speed of
the learning algorithm by conducting an accurate transmission cost estimation.
This cost estimate can basically serve as a model which spares the algorithm
from extra action exploration, thus rendering the learning process more sample
efficient. Simulation results reveal that our proposed solution excels in terms
of both the number of transmissions and load distribution while also
maintaining near perfect delivery ratio, especially in dense crowded

space, including the inflaton and the conformon. It appears that such a
non-minimal coupling allows generic chaotic models of inflation to reach an
agreement with the observable (n_{s},r) values. We describe here the
superconformal versions of the cosmological attractors whose bosonic part was
presented in lectures of A. Linde in this volume. A distinguishing feature of
this class of models is that they tend to lead to very similar predictions
which are not very sensitive with respect to strong modifications of the
theory. The (super)conformal symmetry underlying (super)gravity allows a
universal description of a large class of models which agree with observations

induced by the presence of a localized stimulus (pulses) or by transitions
between two levels of activity (fronts). Linear stability analysis allows to
reveal the existence of Hopf bifurcation curves induced by the delays, along
different modes that may be symmetric or asymmetric. We show that instabilities

transitions from being just as hard as boson sampling when the input coherent
amplitudes are sufficiently small, to a classically simulatable problem in the

protoplanetary disk. Refractory inclusions were likely transported by turbulent
diffusion and possible early disk expansion, and required low turbulence for
their subsequent preservation in the disk, possibly in a dead zone. Chondrules
were produced locally but did not necessarily accrete shortly after formation.
Water may have been enhanced in the inner disk because of inward drift of
solids from further out, but likely not by more than a factor of a few.
Incomplete condensation in chondrites may be due to slow reaction kinetics
during temperature decrease. While carbonaceous chondrite compositions might be
reproduced in a ``two-component'' picture (Anders 1964), such components would
not correspond to simple petrographic constituents, although part of the
refractory element fractionations in chondrites may be due to the inward drift
of refractory inclusions. Overall, considerations of chondrite component
transport alone favor an earlier formation for carbonaceous chondrites relative
to their noncarbonaceous counterparts, but independent objections have yet to
be resolved.

relationship between environmental conditions and cholera cases. We seek to
develop a predictive model for cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh based on
environmental predictors. To do this, we estimate the contribution of
environmental variables, such as water depth and water temperature, to cholera
outbreaks in the context of a disease transmission model. We implement a method
which simultaneously accounts for disease dynamics and environmental variables
in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model. The entire system
is treated as a continuous-time hidden Markov model, where the hidden Markov
states are the numbers of people who are susceptible, infected, or recovered at
each time point, and the observed states are the numbers of cholera cases
reported. We use a Bayesian framework to fit this hidden SIRS model,
implementing particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to sample from the
posterior distribution of the environmental and transmission parameters given
the observed data. We test this method using both simulation and data from
Mathbaria, Bangladesh. Parameter estimates are used to make short-term
predictions that capture the formation and decline of epidemic peaks. We
demonstrate that our model can successfully predict an increase in the number
of infected individuals in the population weeks before the observed number of
cholera cases increases, which could allow for early notification of an
epidemic and timely allocation of resources.

beginning prior to Ls=162 and diminishing markedly at Ls=200-204. 2. It has
previously been inferred by temperature measurements(Titus et al., 2003) and
CO2-H2O mixture spectral models (Langevin et al., 2007) that surface water ice
was present in the Cryptic Region in the final stages of sublimation. The high
resolution of CRISM has revealed regions where only water ice is present (not a
CO2-H2O ice mixture). This water ice disappears completely by Ls=252 and may be
the source of water vapor observed by CRISM in southern latitudes between
Ls=240-260 (Smith, et al., this issue). 3. We have estimated surface CO2 ice
grain size distributions for the South Pole Residual Cap (SPRC) and the
seasonal CO2 ice cap that covers it throughout summer spring and summer. Our
analysis suggests that grain sizes peak at Ls=191-199 with an apparent grain
size of ~7 +/-1 cm. By the end of the summer period our analysis demonstrates
minimum apparent grain sizes of ~5 +/-1 mm predominate in the SPRC. 4. Fine
grained CO2 ice condenses from Ls=0-40, and extends symmetrically away from the
geographic pole, extending beyond 80 deg S by Ls=4-10. No evidence for unusual
CO2 depositional processes in the Cryptic Region is observed up to Ls=16.

the solution $u$ in the equation with $(1-\alpha^2\triangle)u$ the operator
$(1-\alpha^2\triangle)$. Another is the generalized Navier-Stokes equation,

that contains as subgraphs the skeletons of solution networks. We introduce the
directed super-structure as a natural generalization of its undirected

network structure learning where the score of a network decomposes into local
scores of its nodes. Results: We show that exact Bayesian network structure
learning can be carried out in non-uniform polynomial time if the
super-structure has bounded treewidth, and in linear time if in addition the
super-structure has bounded maximum degree. Furthermore, we show that if the
directed super-structure is acyclic, then exact Bayesian network structure
learning can be carried out in quadratic time. We complement these positive
results with a number of hardness results. We show that both restrictions
(treewidth and degree) are essential and cannot be dropped without loosing
uniform polynomial time tractability (subject to a complexity-theoretic
assumption). Similarly, exact Bayesian network structure learning remains
NP-hard for ""almost acyclic"" directed super-structures. Furthermore, we show
that the restrictions remain essential if we do not search for a globally

Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving

arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by
the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm

gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex

problems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners working
with these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely used
heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables
--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain
encodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity
constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to
these approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that
represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials
into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The
usual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,
since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available
to be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems
building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical
program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planning
problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled
in a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric
Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid
heuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual
relaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the
causal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two
components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore
how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the
MIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to
augment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting
structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our
results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems
where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.

specifically, they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform

defined by means of constraints, so the flexibility of the grouping is
determined by the expressivity of the constraint language. Existing approaches
for exact lifted inference use specific languages for (in)equality constraints,
which often have limited expressivity. In this article, we decouple lifted
inference from the constraint language. We define operators for lifted
inference in terms of relational algebra operators, so that they operate on the
semantic level (the constraints extension) rather than on the syntactic level,
making them language-independent. As a result, lifted inference can be
performed using more powerful constraint languages, which provide more
opportunities for lifting. We empirically demonstrate that this can improve

expansion of nodes in the GMAA* search tree, which avoids the need to expand
all children, the number of which is in the worst case doubly exponential in

to, and identify significant possible points of failure affecting the
reliability of communication in the network. We show that in general graphs,
calculating the Shapley and Banzhaf power indices is #P-complete, but suggest a

stable payoff divisions of the revenues in CGs, captured by the game theoretic

non-monotonic reasoning. An important question is then: what is the class of
logics that can be subsumed as instantiations of this theory? The goal of this
paper is to identify and study the large class of logic-based instantiations of
Dung's theory which correspond to the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to the
function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge
base. In other words, we study the class of instantiations where very extension
of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent
subset of the knowledge base. We show that an attack relation belonging to this
class must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be
conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. Then, we show that some attack
relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class (e.g. if an attack
relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class). By
using our results, we show for all existing attack relations whether or not
they belong to this class. We also define new attack relations which are
members of this class. Finally, we interpret our results and discuss more
general questions, like: what is the added value of argumentation in such a
setting? We believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our
long-term goal, which is to better understand the role of argumentation and,
particularly, the expressivity of logic-based instantiations of Dung-style
argumentation frameworks.

are very expressive since variables can occur within complex concepts and can
also bind to concept or role names. In this paper, we describe a sound and
complete algorithm for the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime. We further
propose several novel optimizations such as strategies for determining a good

cost-based model, where the costs are based on information about the instances
of concepts and roles that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an
OWL reasoner. We present two ordering strategies: a static and a dynamic one.
For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual
clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one
individual sample from a cluster. We provide a prototypical implementation and
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimizations. Our experimental study
shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when
accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics
are less accurate, e.g., due to nondeterministic reasoning decisions. For
queries that go beyond conjunctive instance queries we observe an improvement

a global phenomenon and is therefore naturally represented and analysed by a
network comprised of the relevant structural elements from the components of a
system. The power flow analysis is a platform for higher-level behaviour
prediction of energy related aspects using local component behaviour models to
capture a state-based representation with a global time. The primary
application is Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a form of
exaggeration reasoning is used, combined with an order of magnitude
representation to derive the worst case failure modes. The novel aspects of the
work are an order of magnitude(OM) qualitative network analyser to represent
any power domain and topology, including multiple power sources, a feature that
was not required for earlier specialised electrical versions of the approach.
Secondly, the representation of generalised energy related behaviour as
state-based local models is presented as a modelling strategy that can be more
vivid and intuitive for a range of topologically complex applications than
qualitative equation-based representations.The two-level modelling strategy
allows the broad system behaviour coverage of qualitative simulation to be
exploited for the FMEA task, while limiting the difficulties of qualitative
ambiguity explanation that can arise from abstracted numerical models. We have
used the method to support an automated FMEA system with examples of an

the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four

to behave each in a different way? From a game theoretic perspective, such
situations lead to undesirable Nash equilibria. For example consider a resource
allocation game in that two players compete for an exclusive access to a single

pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is time-consuming. Secondly,
although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these
algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues,
we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with
forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange
separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge
weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but
also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies
are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as
NuMVC. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks,

local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations
of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework
they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results. The

similar features want to learn from each other. This paper presents an agent
architecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the
actions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task. This is
possible because the proposed architecture displays information that is
essential for observation, making it possible for software agents to observe
each other. The agent architecture supports a learning process that covers all
aspects of learning by observation, such as discovering and observing experts,
learning from the observed data, applying the acquired knowledge and evaluating
the agents progress. The evaluation provides control over the decision to
obtain new knowledge or apply the acquired knowledge to new problems. We
combine two methods for learning from the observed information. The first one,
the recall method, uses the sequence on which the actions were observed to
solve new problems. The second one, the classification method, categorizes the
information in the observed data and determines to which set of categories the
new problems belong. Results show that agents are able to learn in conditions
where common supervised learning algorithms fail, such as when agents do not
know the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the
actions are visible. The results also show that our approach provides better
results than other learning methods since it requires shorter learning periods.

during transit by spectroscopy. For the transit of an Earth twin, models
predict that biogenic $O_2$ and $O_3$ should be detectable, as well as water
vapour, a molecule linked to habitability as we know it on Earth. The aim is to
measure the Earth radius versus wavelength $\lambda$ - or the atmosphere
thickness $h(\lambda)$ - at the highest spectral resolution available to fully
characterize the signature of Earth seen as a transiting exoplanet. We present
observations of the Moon eclipse of 21-12-2010. Seen from the Moon, the Earth
eclipses the Sun and opens access to the Earth atmosphere transmission
spectrum. We used HARPS and UVES spectrographs to take penumbra and umbra
high-resolution spectra from 3100 to 10400 Ang. A change of the quantity of
water vapour above the telescope compromised the quality of the UVES data. We
corrected for this effect in the data processing. We analyzed the data by 3
different methods. The 1st method is based on the analysis of pairs of penumbra
spectra. The 2nd makes use of a single penumbra spectrum, and the 3rd of all
penumbra and umbra spectra. Profiles $h(\lambda)$ are obtained with the three
methods for both instruments. The 1st method gives the best result, in
agreement with a model. The second method seems to be more sensitive to the
Doppler shift of solar spectral lines with respect to the telluric lines. The
3rd method makes use of umbra spectra which bias the result, but it can be
corrected for this a posteriori from results with the first method. The 3
methods clearly show the spectral signature of the Rayleigh scattering in the
Earth atmosphere and the bands of H$_2$O, O$_2$, and O$_3$. Sodium is detected.
Assuming no atmospheric perturbations, we show that the E-ELT is theoretically
able to detect the $O_2$ A-band in 8~h of integration for an Earth twin at
10pc.

unifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance
of using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely
realized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual
hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical
framework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is
trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our
model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information
into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This
training strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at
multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is
purely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments
or shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as
object segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms
state-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also
outperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and
achieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).

These systems are described by a combination of the Gross-Pitaevskii and
Poisson equations (the GPP system). In the analysis of these hypothetical
objects, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation is widely used. This approximation
is based on the assumption that in the presence of a large number of particles,
the kinetic term in the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional can be neglected,
yet it is well known that this assumption is violated near the condensate
surface. We also show that the total energy of the self-gravitating condensate
in the TF-approximation is positive. The stability of a self-gravitating system
is dependent on the total energy being negative. Therefore, the
TF-approximation is ill suited to formulate initial conditions in numerical
simulations. As an alternative, we offer an approximate solution of the full
GPP system.

rotations along the line of sight. The quality of Faraday tomography is,
however, limited by several conditions. Recently, it is reported that Faraday
tomography indicates false signals in some specific situations. In this paper,
we systematically investigate the condition of the appearance of false signals
in Faraday tomography. We study this by pseudo-observing two sources within a
beam, and change in the intrinsic polarization angles, rotation measures,
intensities, and frequency coverage. We find that false signals arise when
rotation measure between the sources is less than 1.5 times the full width at
half maximum of the rotation measure spread function. False signals also depend
on the intensity ratio between the sources and are reduced for large ratio. On
the other hand, the appearance of false signals does not depend on frequency
coverage, meaning that the uncertainty should be correctly understood and taken
into consideration even with future wide-band observations such as Square
Kilometer Array (SKA).

quasi-one-dimensional s-wave and d-wave superconductors with particular
attention paid to the effect of the Fermi-surface anisotropy. The upper
critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ is found to exhibit a qualitatively different
behavior depending on the ratio of the hopping energies $t_b/t_a$ and the
direction of the FFLO modulation vector q, where $t_a$ and $t_b$ are the intra-
and interchain hopping energies, respectively. In particular, when $t_b/t_a <
0.1$ and $\mathbf{q} \parallel \mathbf{a}$, we find a novel dimensional
crossover of $H_{c2}(T)$ from one dimension to two dimensions, where a is the
lattice vector of the most conductive chain. Just below the tricritical
temperature $T^*$, the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$ increases steeply as in
one-dimensional systems, but when the temperature decreases, the rate of
increase in $H_{c2}(T)$ diminishes and a shoulder appears. Near $T = 0$,
$H_{c2}(T)$ shows a behavior typical of the FFLO state in two-dimensional
systems, i.e., an upturn with a finite field at $T = 0$. When the angle between
$\mathbf{q}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ is large, the upper critical field curve is
convex upward at low temperatures, as in three-dimensional systems, but the
magnitude is much larger than that of a three-dimensional isotropic system. For
$t_b/t_a > 0.15$, the upper critical fields exhibit a two-dimensional behavior,
except for a slight shoulder in the range of $0.2 > t_b/t_a > 0.15$. The upper
critical field is maximum for $\mathbf{q} \parallel \mathbf{a}$ both for s-wave
and d-wave pairings, while it is only slightly larger than the Pauli
paramagnetic limit for $\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{a}$. The relevance of the
present results to the organic superconductor ${\rm (TMTSF)_2ClO_4}$ is

Novel and practical approaches for harvesting light for particle rotation have

4R_P$ (where $R_P$ is the radius of Pluto), consistent with its impact origin.
Two tidal models are used, where the tidal dissipation function $Q \propto$
1/frequency and $Q=$ constant, where details of the evolution are strongly
model dependent. The inclusion of the gravitational harmonic coefficient
$C_{22}$ of both bodies in the analysis allows smooth, self consistent
evolution to the dual synchronous state, whereas its omission frustrates
successful evolution in some cases. The zonal harmonic $J_2$ can also be
included, but does not cause a significant effect on the overall evolution. The
ratio of dissipation in Charon to that in Pluto controls the behavior of the
orbital eccentricity, where a judicious choice leads to a nearly constant
eccentricity until the final approach to dual synchronous rotation. The tidal
models are complete in the sense that every nuance of tidal evolution is
realized while conserving total angular momentum - including temporary capture
into spin-orbit resonances as Charon's spin decreases and damped librations

large collecting mirrors ($\sim2~$m$^2$). They have multiple elastic and Raman

technologies have posed new challenges to the area of genomic sequence
comparison.
  The multiple sequence alignment approach is hardly applicable to NGS data due
to the challenging problem of short read assembly.
  Thus alignment-free methods need to be developed for the comparison of NGS
samples of short reads.
  Recently, new $k$-mer based distance measures such as {\it CVTree},
$d_{2}^{S}$, {\it co-phylog} have been proposed to address this problem.
  However, those distances depend considerably on the parameter $k$, and how to
choose the optimal $k$ is not trivial since it may depend on different aspects
of the sequence data.
  Hence, in this paper we consider an alternative parameter-free approach:
compression-based distance measures.
  These measures have shown impressive performance on long genome sequences in
previous studies, but they have not been tested on NGS short reads.
  In this study we perform extensive validation and show that the
compression-based distances are highly consistent with those distances obtained
from the $k$-mer based methods, from the alignment-based approach, and from
existing benchmarks in the literature.
  Moreover, as these measures are parameter-free, no optimization is required
and they still perform consistently well on multiple types of sequence data,
for different kinds of species and taxonomy levels.
  The compression-based distance measures are assembly-free, alignment-free,
parameter-free, and thus represent useful tools for the comparison of long
genome sequences and NGS samples of short reads.

beneficial property, for instance, in control problems. However, it does not
provide a generative model for function values and requires training and test
data to be generated identically, independently. Gaussian (process) regression,

requirements on the distribution of training data, but has much higher

observation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also
automatically adapts object specific action success probabilities. To cope with

The approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a

two-interval case and work perturbatively in their small cross ratio $x$. We
provide various results for the entanglement entropy due to the so-called CDW
elements of the associated Schottky uniformization group. In particular, in the
higher spin current case, we obtain a closed formula for all the contributions
of the form $\mathcal O(x^{2s+p})$ up to $\mathcal O(x^{4s})$, where 2-CDW
elements are relevant. In the scalar field case, we calculate the similar
contributions for generic values of $\Delta$. The terms up to $\mathcal
O(x^{2\Delta+5})$ are compared with an explicit CFT calculation with full
agreement. The analysis exploits various simplifications which are valid in the
strict entanglement limit of the R\'enyi entropy. This allows to identify in a
clean way the relevant operators that provide the gravity result. The 2-CDW
contributions are also analysed and a closed formula for the leading $\mathcal
O(x^{4s})$ coefficient is presented as a function of the generic spin $s$. As a
specific application, we combine the CDW and 2-CDW calculations and present the

given data set using the least squares approach. Different from previous
algorithms which yield a quantum state encoding the optimal parameters, our
algorithm outputs these numbers in the classical form. So by running it once,
one completely determines the fitted model and then can use it to make
predictions on new data at little cost. Moreover, our algorithm works in the
standard oracle model, and can handle data sets with nonsparse design matrices.
It runs in time $\operatorname{poly}(\operatorname{log}(N), d, \kappa,
1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the size of the data set, $d$ is the number of
adjustable parameters, $\kappa$ is the condition number of the design matrix,
and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output. We also show that the
polynomial dependence on $d$ and $\kappa$ is necessary. Thus, our algorithm
cannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we also give a quantum algorithm
that estimates the quality of the least-squares fit (without computing its
parameters explicitly). This algorithm runs faster than the one for finding
this fit, and can be used to check whether the given data set qualifies for
linear regression in the first place.

switched on and off by tuning the position of the Fermi level in order to Pauli
block the two fundamental inter Landau level excitations. The effects of such a
profound change in the electronic excitation spectrum are traced through
investigations of the optical phonon response in polarization resolved
magneto-Raman scattering experiments. We report on the observation of a
splitting of the phonon feature with satellite peaks developing, at particular
values of the Landau level filling factor, on the low or on the high energy
side of the phonon, depending on the relative energy of the discrete electronic
excitation and of the optical phonon. Shifts of the phonon energy as large as
$\pm60$ cm$^{-1}$ are observed close to the resonance. The intraband electronic
excitation, the cyclotron resonance, is shown to play a relevant role in the
observed spectral evolution of the phonon response.

metallicity-dependent prescriptions for stellar winds and remnant formation. We
show that mass-loss by stellar winds influences the reversal of core collapse.
In particular, the post-collapse expansion of the core is faster in metal-rich
YSCs than in metal-poor YSCs, because the former lose more mass (through
stellar winds) than the latter. As a consequence, the half-mass radius expands
more in metal-poor YSCs. We also discuss how these findings depend on the total

less (or more) Ly$\alpha$ attenuation for $z\simeq3$--5 ($z>6$) sources through
usual broad-band filters relative to the original Madau model. This may cause a

multivariate scenario sets based on the notion of half-space depth (HD) and
also introduce the notion of expectile depth (ED) where half-spaces are defined
by expectiles rather than quantiles. We then use the HD and ED functions to
define convex scenario sets that generalize the concepts of quantile and
expectile to higher dimensions. In the case of elliptical distributions these
sets coincide with the regions encompassed by the contours of the density
function. In the context of multivariate skewed distributions, the equivalence
of depth contours and density contours does not hold in general. We consider
two parametric families that account for skewness and heavy tails: the
generalized hyperbolic and the skew-t distributions. By making use of a
canonical form representation, where skewness is completely absorbed by one
component, we show that the HD contours of these distributions are
""near-elliptical"" and, in the case of the skew-Cauchy distribution, we prove
that the HD contours are exactly elliptical. We propose a measure of

images has revealed the largest loops to be predominantly of prismatic 1/2<111>

surprising since isolated loops are expected to be highly mobile, and should
escape from the foil. In this work we show that the observed size and number
density of loops can be explained by the fact that the loops are _not_ isolated
- the loops formed in close proximity in the cascades interact with each other

fields, which prevent the escape of loops from the foil. We find that

state-space models. They use MCMC moves to update the parameters of the models,
and particle filters to propose values for the path of the state-space model.
Currently the default is to use random walk Metropolis to update the parameter
values. We show that it is possible to use information from the output of the
particle filter to obtain better proposal distributions for the parameters. In
particular it is possible to obtain estimates of the gradient of the log
posterior from each run of the particle filter, and use these estimates within
a Langevin-type proposal. We propose using the recent computationally efficient
approach of Nemeth et al. (2013) for obtaining such estimates. We show
empirically that for a variety of state-space models this proposal is more
efficient than the standard random walk Metropolis proposal in terms of:
reducing autocorrelation of the posterior samples, reducing the burn-in time of
the MCMC sampler and increasing the squared jump distance between posterior
samples.

Nevertheless, the exact form of the mass-concentration relation is still widely
debated. One of the most promising method to estimate masses and concentrations
relies on gravitational lensing from massive halos. Here we investigate the
impact of the mass-concentration relation on halo peak abundance in weak
lensing shear maps relying on the aperture mass method for peak detections.
After providing a prescription to take into account the concentration
dispersion (always neglected in previous works) in peak number counts
predictions, we assess their power to constrain the mass-concentration relation
by means of Fisher matrix technique. We find that, when combined with different
cosmological probes, peak statistics information from near-future weak lensing
surveys provides an interesting and complementary alternative method to lessen
the long standing controversy about the mass-concentration relation.

so we call these models isochronous cosmologies. We give a physical
interpretation of such metrics and in particular we show that they may behave
arbitrarily closely, or even identically, to the Friedman-Robertson-Walker

shorter than their period, which can also be assigned arbitrarily), so that
they may reproduce all the satisfactory phenomenological features of the

many mechanical modes are coupled. We calculate the gain, and find that strong
oscillation in one mode suppresses the gain in other modes. For sufficiently
strong oscillation, the gain of the other modes actually switches sign and
becomes damping, a process we call ""anomalous cooling."" We demonstrate that
mode competition leads to single-mode operation and find excellent agreement
with our theory, including anomalous cooling.

model parameters representative of intermediate-mass, main sequence stars. The
work-flow is entirely done using a new Virtual Observatory tool: TOUCAN (the VO
gateway for asteroseismic models), which is presented in this paper. A linear
relation between the large separation and the mean density is predicted to be
found in the low frequency frequency domain (i.e. radial orders spanning from 1
to 8, approximately) of the main-sequence, delta Scuti stars' oscillation
spectrum. We found that such a linear behavior stands whatever the mass,
metallicity, mixing length, and overshooting parameters considered in this
work. The intrinsic error of the method is discussed. This includes the
uncertainty in the large separation determination and the role of rotation. The
validity of the relation found is only guaranteed for stars rotating up to 40
percent of their break-up velocity. Finally, we applied the diagnostic method
presented in this work to five stars for which regular patterns have been
found. Our estimates for the mean density and the frequency of the fundamental
radial mode match with those given in the literature within a 20 percent of
deviation. Asteroseismology has thus revealed an independent direct measure of
the average density of delta Scuti stars, analogous to that of the Sun. This
places tight constraints on the mode identification and hence on the stellar
internal structure and dynamics, and allows a determination the radius of
planets orbiting around delta Scuti stars with unprecedented precision. This
opens the way for studying the evolution of regular patterns in pulsating

scale with flux: bright spots tend to be broader than faint ones, using the

of typical size 3 to 4 pixels FWHM, increase linearly with their flux by up to
$2\%$ over the full CCD dynamic range. This brighter-fatter effect affects both
deep-depleted and thinned CCD sensors. We propose that this effect is a direct
consequence of the distortions of the drift electric field sourced by charges
accumulated within the CCD during the exposure and experienced by forthcoming
light-induced charges in the same exposure. The pixel boundaries then become
slightly dynamical: overfilled pixels become increasingly smaller than their
neighbors, so that bright star sizes, measured in number of pixels, appear
larger than those of faint stars. This interpretation of the brighter-fatter
effect implies that pixels in flat-fields should exhibit statistical
correlations, sourced by Poisson fluctuations, that we indeed directly detect.
We propose to use the measured correlations in flat-fields to derive how pixel
boundaries shift under the influence of a given charge pattern, which allows us
to quantitatively predict how star shapes evolve with flux. This physical model
of the brighter-fatter effect also explains the commonly observed phenomenon
that the spatial variance of CCD flat-fields increases less rapidly than their
average.

on a thorough understanding of how people process information. In the current
paper we test this assumption in the context of social tagging systems.
Cognitive research on how people assign tags has shown that they draw on two
interconnected levels of knowledge in their memory: on a conceptual level of
semantic fields or topics, and on a lexical level that turns patterns on the
semantic level into words. Another strand of tagging research reveals a strong
impact of time dependent forgetting on users' tag choices, such that recently
used tags have a higher probability being reused than ""older"" tags. In this
paper, we align both strands by implementing a computational theory of human
memory that integrates the two-level conception and the process of forgetting
in form of a tag recommender and test it in three large-scale social tagging
datasets (drawn from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr).
  As expected, our results reveal a selective effect of time: forgetting is
much more pronounced on the lexical level of tags. Second, an extensive
evaluation based on this observation shows that a tag recommender
interconnecting both levels and integrating time dependent forgetting on the
lexical level results in high accuracy predictions and outperforms other
well-established algorithms, such as Collaborative Filtering, Pairwise
Interaction Tensor Factorization, FolkRank and two alternative time dependent
approaches. We conclude that tag recommenders can benefit from going beyond the
manifest level of word co-occurrences, and from including forgetting processes
on the lexical level.

1997 to 2000 were considered as a complex function of geomagnetic indices PC,
Kp, and Dst as well as parameters of the magnetosphere size, subsolar Rs and
terminator Rf magnetopause distances. A geosynchronous relativistic electron
enhancement (GREE) is determined as daily maximal electron flux exceeding the
upper root mean square deviation (RMSD) threshold of about 1500 (cm2s sr)-1.
Comparison analysis of the GREE dynamics and geomagnetic conditions on the
rising phase of current solar cycle revealed suppression of the relativistic
electron enhancements by substantially increased strong geomagnetic activity in
the solar maximum. Statistical consideration of a relationship between the
GREEs and the geomagnetic parameters showed that the most important parameters
controlling the geosynchronous relativistic electron enhancements were 4-day
averaged Kp index, PC index and magnetopause termination distance Rf delayed
respectively on 3 and 14 hours. Relatively high averaging time for Kp was
explained by cumulative effect of substorm energy release in a gradual
mechanism accelerating the relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere. Very
short time delay for PC index was interpreted as intensification of a fast
acceleration mechanism producing the GREEs during severe geomagnetic storms.
Substantial increase of the PC index (PC>5) was founded as a sufficient
condition for GREE occurrence. The fast response of the geosynchronous
relativistic electron fluxes on the magnetosphere compression was explained by
drift losses of the energetic electrons at the magnetopause which approaches
the Earth during geomagnetic storms.

procedure based on a spline approximation of the nonparametric part of the
model and the generalized estimating equations (GEE). Although the model in
consideration is natural and useful in many practical applications, the
literature on this model is very limited because of challenges in dealing with
dependent data for nonparametric additive models. We show that the proposed
estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal even if the covariance
structure is misspecified. An explicit consistent estimate of the asymptotic
variance is also provided. Moreover, we derive the semiparametric efficiency
score and information bound under general moment conditions. By showing that
our estimators achieve the semiparametric information bound, we effectively
establish their efficiency in a stronger sense than what is typically
considered for GEE. The derivation of our asymptotic results relies heavily on
the empirical processes tools that we develop for the longitudinal/clustered
data. Numerical results are used to illustrate the finite sample performance of
the proposed estimators.

solving the loop equation with the additional constraint of vanishing trace on
average. The density is generally supported on two disconnected intervals lying
on the two sides of the pole. In the limit of having no pole, we recover the
standard semicircle. Obtained in the planar limit, our results apply to
matrices with orthogonal, unitary or symplectic symmetry alike. The orthogonal
case with $m=2$ is motivated by an application to spin glass physics. In the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean-field model, in the paramagnetic phase and for
sufficiently large systems the spin glass susceptibility is a random variable,
depending on the realization of disorder. It is essentially given by a linear
statistics on the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix. As such its large
deviation function can be computed using standard Coulomb fluid techniques. The
resulting free energy of the associated fluid precisely corresponds to the
partition function of our random matrix model. Numerical simulations provide an
excellent confirmation of our analytical results.

taking into account the effects of the anisotropy in the distribution function

generalize the solutions obtained for isotropic Fermi-Dirac statistics. We also
extend the analysis to equilibrium configurations in the classical regime and

argued that niche construction, which benefits all cells in the tumour, would
be selected against since cheaters could reap the benefits without paying the
cost. We have investigated the impact of niche specificity on tumour evolution
using an individual based model of breast tumour growth, in which the carrying
capacity of each cell consists of two components: an intrinsic,
subclone-specific part and a contribution from all neighbouring cells. Analysis
of the model shows that the ability of a mutant to invade a resident population
depends strongly on the specificity. When specificity is low selection is
mostly on growth rate, while high specificity shifts selection towards
increased carrying capacity. Further, we show that the long-term evolution of
the system can be predicted using adaptive dynamics. By comparing the results
from a spatially structured vs.\ well-mixed population we show that spatial
structure restores selection for carrying capacity even at zero specificity,
which a poses solution to the niche construction dilemma. Lastly, we show that
an expanding population exhibits spatially variable selection pressure, where
cells at the leading edge exhibit higher growth rate and lower carrying
capacity than those at the centre of the tumour.

moderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or a
population where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sited

of Dirac electron interaction with this time-dependent perturbation. We
consider the problem in the framework of the model of noninteracting Dirac

and spatial degrees of freedom, are considered. Their eigenstates can be
classified by Young diagrams, corresponding to non-trivial permutation
symmetries (beyond the conventional paradigm of symmetric--antisymmetric
states).
  The present work obtains (a) selection rules for additional non-separable
(dependent on spins and coordinates) $k$-body interactions: the Young diagrams,
associated with the initial and the final states of a transition, can differ by
relocation of no more than $k$ boxes between their rows; and (b) correlation
rules: eigenstate-averaged local correlations of $k$ particles vanish if $k$
exceeds the number of columns (for bosons) or rows (for fermions) in the
associated Young diagram. It also elucidates the physical meaning of the
quantities conserved due to permutation symmetry --- in 1929, Dirac identified
those with characters of the symmetric group --- relating them to
experimentally observable correlations of several particles.
  The results provide a way to control the formation of entangled states
belonging to multidimensional non-Abelian representations of the symmetric
group. These states can find applications in quantum computation and metrology.

topics in neural coding. It is of great interest to understand the underlying
distribution and geometric structure of given spike train data. However, a
fundamental obstacle is that the space of all spike trains is not an Euclidean
space, and non-Euclidean metrics have been commonly used in the literature to
characterize the variability and pattern in neural observations. Over the past
few years, two Euclidean-like metrics were independently developed to measure
distance in the spike train space. An important benefit of these metrics is
that the spike train space will be suitable for embedding in Euclidean spaces
due to their Euclidean properties. In this paper, we systematically compare
these two metrics on theory, properties, and applications. Because of its
Euclidean properties, one of these metrics has been further used in defining
summary statistics (i.e. mean and variance) and conducting statistical
inferences in the spike train space. Here we provide equivalent definitions
using the other metric and show that consistent statistical inferences can be
conducted. We then apply both inference frameworks in a neural coding problem
for a recording in geniculate ganglion stimulated by different tastes. It is
found that both frameworks achieve desirable results and provide useful new
tools in statistical inferences in neural spike train space.

gluon distribution is obtained by solving the Gribov, Levin, Ryskin, Mueller
and Qiu (GLR-MQ) evolution equation with the nonlinear shadowing term
incorporated. The form of initial condition for the equation is determined. We
find, with decreasing $x$, the emergence of a singular behavior and the
eventual taming (at $R=5\hspace{0.1cm}GeV^{-1}$) and the essential taming (at
$R=2\hspace{0.1cm}GeV^{-1}$) of this singular behavior by shadowing term. The
nonlinear gluon density functions are calculated and compared with the results
for the integrated gluon density from the Balitsky- Kovchegov(BK) equation for
the different values of $Q^{2}$. It is shown, that the results for the gluon
density function are comparable with the results obtained from BK equation
solution. Also we show that for each $x$, the $Q^{2}$ dependence of the data is
well described by gluon shadowing corrections to GLR-MQ equation. The resulting
analytic expression allow us to predict the logarithmic derivative
$\frac{{\partial}F^{s}_{2}(x,Q^{2})}{{\partial}lnQ^{2}}$ and to compare the
results with H1 data and a QCD analysis fit.

nonlinear Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-parisi (NLDGLAP) evolution
equation approach at small $x$. For the gluon distribution, the nonlinear
effects are related to the longitudinal structure function. As, the very small
$x$ behavior of the gluon distribution is obtained by solving the Gribov,
Levin, Ryskin, Mueller and Qiu (GLR-MQ) evolution equation with the nonlinear
shadowing term incorporated. We show, the strong rise that is corresponding to
the linear QCD evolution equations, can be tamed by screening effects.
Consequently, the obtained longitudinal structure function shows a tamed growth
at small $x$. We computed the predictions for all detail of the nonlinear
longitudinal structure function in the kinematic range where it has been
measured by $H1$ collaboration and compared with computation Moch, Vermaseren
and Vogt at the second order with input data from MRST QCD fit.

The set of know-why necessary to achieve this goal is wide, from biochemistry
to electronics and is summarized in an emerging branch of electronics, called
\textit{proteotronics}. Proteotronics is here here applied to state a
comparative analysis of the electrical responses coming from type-1 and type-2
opsins. In particular, the procedure is used as an early investigation of a
recently discovered family of opsins, the proteorhodopsins activated by blue
light, BPRs. The results reveal some interesting and unexpected similarities
between proteins of the two families, suggesting the global electrical response
are not strictly linked to the class identity.

incalculable constants, being supplied by experimental values. Inspired by
observation of the empirical particle mass spectrum, and their corresponding
physical interaction couplings, we propose that the masses of elementary
particles arise solely due to the self-interaction of the fields associated
with the charges of a particle. A first application of this idea is seen to
yield correct order of magnitude predictions for neutrinos, charged leptons and
quarks. We then discuss more ambitious models, where also different generations
may arise from \textit{e.g.} self-organizing bifurcations due to the underlying
non-linear dynamics, with the coupling strength acting as ""non-linearity""
parameter. If the model is extended to include gauge bosons, the photon is
automatically the only fundamental particle to remain massless as it has no
charges. It results that gluons have an effective range $\sim 1$fm, physically
explaining why QCD has finite reach.

being available for Facial Expression Detection. The field of facial expression
detection can have various applications along with its importance & can be
interacted between human being & computer. Many few options are available to

existential rules is a prominent problem in knowledge representation and
databases. This problem can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends
the given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the
chase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of
facts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether
the chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous
acyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase
termination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called
model-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA).
Furthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and
establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that
MFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.
  Existential rules are closely related to the Horn fragments of the OWL 2
ontology language; furthermore, several prominent OWL 2 reasoners implement CQ
answering by using the chase to materialise all relevant facts. In order to
avoid termination problems, many of these systems handle only the OWL 2 RL
profile of OWL 2; furthermore, some systems go beyond OWL 2 RL, but without any
termination guarantees. In this paper we also investigate whether various
acyclicity notions can provide a principled and practical solution to these
problems. On the theoretical side, we show that query answering for acyclic
ontologies is of lower complexity than for general ontologies. On the practical
side, we show that many of the commonly used OWL 2 ontologies are MSA, and that
the number of facts obtained by materialisation is not too large. Our results
thus suggest that principled development of materialisation-based OWL 2
reasoners is practically feasible.
