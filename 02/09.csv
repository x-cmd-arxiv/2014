increase with decreasing Rossby number (i.e., with faster rotation). Assuming
that these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot
cycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\odot}$ stars rotating
with different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and
the meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics
model. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic
solutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux
through the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational
data can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.
Assuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing
rotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission
at low Rossby numbers. The main failure of our model is that it predicts an
increase of magnetic cycle period with increasing rotation rate, which is the
opposite of what is found observationally. Much of our calculations are based
on the assumption that the magnetic buoyancy makes the magnetic flux tubes to
rise radially from the bottom of the convection zone. On taking account of the
fact that the Coriolis force diverts the magnetic flux tubes to rise parallel
to the rotation axis in rapidly rotating stars, the results do not change
qualitatively.

is robust to image misalignment and pixel corruption, and is able to reduce
required gallery images to one sample per class. To compensate for the missing
illumination information traditionally provided by multiple gallery images, a
sparse illumination learning and transfer (SILT) technique is introduced. The
illumination in SILT is learned by fitting illumination examples of auxiliary
face images from one or more additional subjects with a sparsely-used
illumination dictionary. By enforcing a sparse representation of the query
image in the illumination dictionary, the SILT can effectively recover and
transfer the illumination and pose information from the alignment stage to the
recognition stage. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the new
algorithms significantly outperform the state of the art in the single-sample
regime and with less restrictions. In particular, the single-sample face
alignment accuracy is comparable to that of the well-known Deformable SRC
algorithm using multiple gallery images per class. Furthermore, the face

NetMIMO can significantly increase network capacity by reducing interferences
and contentions through the cooperation of the APs. This paper covers a few
representative netMIMO methods, ranging from interference alignment and
cancelation, channel access protocol to allow MIMO nodes to join ongoing
transmissions, distributed synchronization, to interference and contention

two moments of Hamiltonian drift-kinetic systems of interest to plasma physics,
preserve a Hamiltonian structure. The adopted procedure consists of determining
closure relations that allow to truncate the Poisson bracket of the
drift-kinetic system, expressed in terms of the moments, in such a way that the
resulting operation is a Poisson bracket for functionals of the first two fluid
moments. The analysis is carried out for a class of full drift-kinetic
equations and also for drift-kinetic systems in which a splitting between an
equilibrium distribution function and a perturbation is performed. In the
former case we obtain that the only closure, not involving integral or
differential operators, that leads to a Poisson bracket, corresponds to that of
an ideal adiabatic gas made of molecules possessing one degree of freedom. In
the latter case, Hamiltonian closures turn out to be those in which the second
moment is a linear combination of the first two moments, which can be seen as a
linearization of the Hamiltonian closure of the full drift-kinetic case. A
number of weakly-3D Hamiltonian reduced fluid models of interest, for instance
for tokamak plasmas, can be derived in this way and, viceversa given a fluid
model with a Hamiltonian structure of a certain type, a parent Hamiltonian
drift-kinetic model can then be identified. We make use of this correspondence
to identify the drift-kinetic models from which Hamiltonian fluid models for
magnetic reconnection and compressible plasma dynamics in the presence of a
static but inhomogeneous magnetic field can be derived. The Casimir invariants
of the Poisson brackets of the derived fluid models are also discussed.

classify all examples as positive. Since the actual prevalence of positive
examples typically is low, this behavior can be considered undesirable. As a

However, the basic properties and even the depth of the dynamo process, which
operates also in other stars, are unknown. Most of the dynamo models suggest
that the toroidal magnetic field that emerges on the surface and forms sunspots
is generated near the bottom of the convection zone, in the tachocline.
However, there is a number of theoretical and observational problems with
justifying the deep-seated dynamo models. This leads to the idea that the
subsurface angular velocity shear may play an important role in the solar
dynamo. Using helioseismology measurements of the internal rotation and
meridional circulation, we investigate a mean-field MHD model of dynamo
distributed in the bulk of the convection zone but shaped in a near-surface
layer. We show that if the boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo region
allow the large-scale toroidal magnetic fields to penetrate into the surface,
then the dynamo wave propagates along the isosurface of angular velocity in the
subsurface shear layer, forming the butterfly diagram in agreement with the
Parker-Yoshimura rule and solar-cycle observations. Unlike the flux-transport
dynamo models, this model does not depend on the transport of magnetic field by
meridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone, and works well
when the meridional circulation forms two cells in radius, as recently
indicated by deep-focus time-distance helioseismology analysis of the SDO/HMI
and SOHO/MDI data. We compare the new dynamo model with various characteristics
if the solar magnetic cycles, including the cycle asymmetry (Waldmeier's
relations) and magnetic `butterfly' diagrams.

under the influence of an external binary companion to determine the evolution
of the mutual stellar spin - disc misalignment angle. The gravitational torque
on the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary
axis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced
quadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess
around each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated
from a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that
the two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''
behavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of
spin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to
occur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary
parameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass
accretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either
promote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial
binary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc
misalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. We discuss the
implications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, for
the alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and for
the stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems. In particular, if hot Jupiters
are produced by the Kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion, then
it is likely that ``primordial'' star-disc misalignments are already generated
by the star-disc-binary interactions. Even for systems where the Kozai effect
is suppressed, misaligned planets may still be produced during the
protoplanetary disc phase.

norming functions. We study broad classes of inverted max-stable processes

inference in non-randomized studies. This is because it can be used to identify
and estimate causal effects under mild conditions. Specifically, for each
subject, the RD design assigns a treatment or non-treatment, depending on
whether or not an observed value of an assignment variable exceeds a fixed and
known cutoff value.
  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric regression modeling
approach to RD designs, which exploits a local randomization feature. In this
approach, the assignment variable is treated as a covariate, and a
scalar-valued confounding variable is treated as a dependent variable (which
may be a multivariate confounder score). Then, over the model's posterior
distribution of locally-randomized subjects that cluster around the cutoff of
the assignment variable, inference for causal effects are made within this
random cluster, via two-group statistical comparisons of treatment outcomes and
non-treatment outcomes.
  We illustrate the Bayesian nonparametric approach through the analysis of a
real educational data set, to investigate the causal link between basic skills

level in (1+1) dimensions with minimal supersymmetry. In this paper we discuss
this issue from the Casimir energy perspective using phase shifts along with
the mode number cut-off regularization method. Exact solutions and in
particular an exact expression for the phase shifts are already available for
the bosonic sector. In this paper we derive analogous exact results for the
fermionic sector. Most importantly, we derive a unique and exact expression for
the fermionic phase shift, using the exact solutions for the continuum parts of
the spectrum and a prescription we had introduced earlier. We use the strong
and weak forms of the Levinson theorem merely for checking the consistency of
our phase shifts and results, and not as an integral part of our procedure.
Moreover, we find that the properties of the fermionic spectrum, including
bound and continuum states, are independent of the magnitude of the Yukawa
coupling constant $\lambda$, and that the dynamical mass generation occurs at
the tree level. These are all due to SUSY and are in sharp contrast to
analogous models without SUSY, such as the Jackiw-Rebbi model, where $\lambda$
is a free parameter. We use the renormalized perturbation theory and find the
counterterm which is consistent with supersymmetry. We show that this procedure
is sufficient to obtain the accepted value for the one-loop quantum correction
to the mass of the SUSY kink which is $-\frac{m}{2\pi}$.

accounted for by a maximum entropy distribution, the RGF (random group
formation)-prediction. The RGF-distribution is completely determined by the a
priori values of the total number of words in the text (M), the number of
distinct words (N) and the number of repetitions of the most common word
(k_max). It is here shown that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a
text written in Chinese characters. In particular it is shown that although the
same Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite
differently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted by
their respective three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out that
this is analogous to the change in the shape of the distribution when
translating a given text to another language. Another consequence of the
RGF-prediction is that taking a part of a long text will change the input
parameters (M, N, k_max) and consequently also the shape of the frequency
distribution. This is explicitly confirmed for texts written in Chinese
characters. Since the RGF-prediction has no system-specific information beyond
the three a priori values (M, N, k_max), any specific language characteristic
has to be sought in systematic deviations from the RGF-prediction and the
measured frequencies. One such systematic deviation is identified and, through
a statistical information theoretical argument and an extended RGF-model, it is
proposed that this deviation is caused by multiple meanings of Chinese
characters. The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese
words. The relation between Zipf's law, the Simon-model for texts and the

connected to a network acts as his biometric signature. Several tools exploit
this fact to fingerprint and monitor users. Often, though, these tools assume
to access the entire traffic, including IP addresses and payloads. This is not
feasible on the grounds that both performance and privacy would be negatively
affected. In reality, most ISPs convert user traffic into NetFlow records for a
concise representation that does not include, for instance, any payloads. More
importantly, large and distributed networks are usually NAT'd, thus a few IP
addresses may be associated to thousands of users. We devised a new
fingerprinting framework that overcomes these hurdles. Our system is able to
analyze a huge amount of network traffic represented as NetFlows, with the
intent to track people. It does so by accurately inferring when users are
connected to the network and which IP addresses they are using, even though
thousands of users are hidden behind NAT. Our prototype implementation was
deployed and tested within an existing large metropolitan WiFi network serving
about 200,000 users, with an average load of more than 1,000 users
simultaneously connected behind 2 NAT'd IP addresses only. Our solution turned
out to be very effective, with an accuracy greater than 90%. We also devised
new tools and refined existing ones that may be applied to other contexts

parallax to be determined by measuring the position of Venus close to its
inferior conjunction, especially at the stationary points, from observatories
on nearly the same meridian but widely differing in latitude. James M.
Gilliss,astronomer at the newly founded U.S. Naval Observatory,
enthusiastically adopted this idea and procured a grant for the young
astronomical community of the United States for an expedition to Chile. There
they were to observe several conjunctions of Venus and oppositions of Mars,
while the accompanying measurements were to be taken at the US Naval
Observatory in Washington D.C. and the Harvard College Observatory at
Cambridge, USA. This expedition was supported by A. v. Humboldt, C.F. Gau{\ss},
J.F. Encke, S.C. Walker, A.D. Bache, B. Peirce and others. From 1849 to 1852
not only were astronomical, but also meteorological and magnetic observations
and measurements recorded, mainly in Santa Lucia close to Santiago, Chile. By
comparing these measurements with those taken simultaneously at other
observatories around the world the solar parallax could be calculated, although
incomplete data from the corresponding northern observatories threatened the
project's success. In retrospect this expedition can be recognized as the
foundation of the Chilean astronomy. The first director of the new National
Astronomical Observatory of Chile was Dr. C.W. Moesta, a Hessian student of
Christian Ludwig Gerling's. The exchange of data between German, American and
other astronomers during this expedition was well mediated by J.G. Fl\""ugel,
consul of the United States of America and representative of the Smithsonian
Institution in Europe, who altogether played a major role in nurturing the
relationship between the growing scientific community in the U.S. and the well
established one in Europe at that time.

qualitatively new features. First, starting with the exact probability density
function for a given particle (a tracer), we study the long-time asymptotics of
its moments. Both the mean position and the mean square displacement are
controlled by dynamical exponents which depend on the initial order of the
particle in the file. Secondly, conditioning on non-absorption, we study the
distribution of long-living particles. In the conditioned framework, the
dynamical exponents are the same for all particles, however, a given particle
possesses an effective diffusion coefficient which depends on its initial
order. After performing the thermodynamic limit, the conditioned dynamics of
the tracer is subdiffusive, the generalized diffusion coefficient $D_{1/2}$
being different from that reported for the system without absorbing boundary.

Italian astronomy. More than 26% of Italian IAU members are women: this is the
largest fraction among the world leading countries in astronomy. Most of this
high fraction is due to their presence in INAF, where women make up 32% of the
research staff (289 out of 908) and 40% of the technical/administrative staff
(173 out of 433); the percentage is slightly lower among permanent research
staff (180 out of 599, about 30%). The presence of women is lower in the
Universities (27 out of 161, about 17%, among staff). In spite of these
(mildly) positive facts, we notice that similarly to other countries (e.g. USA
and Germany) career prospects for Italian astronomers are clearly worse for
women than for men. Within INAF, the fraction of women is about 35-40% among
non-permanent position, 36% for Investigators, 17% for Associato/Primo
Ricercatore, and only 13% among Ordinario/Dirigente di Ricerca. The situation
is even worse at University (only 6% of Professore Ordinario are women). We
found that similar trends are also present if researchers are ordered according
to citation rather than position: for instance, women make up only 15% among
the 100 most cited astronomers working in Italy, a percentage which is however
twice that over all Europe. A similar fraction is found among first authors of
most influential papers, which cannot be explained as a residual of a lower
female presence in the past. We conclude that implicit sex discrimination
factors probably dominate over explicit ones and are still strongly at work.
Finally, we discuss the possible connection between the typical career pattern
and these factors.
