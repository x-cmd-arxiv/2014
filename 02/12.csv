  arXiv:1305.7110",,,,"math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we focus on the existence of a periodic solution for the
neutral nonlinear dynamic systems with delay% \[
x^{\Delta}(t)=A(t)x(t)+Q^{\Delta}\left(t,x\left(\delta_{-}(s,t)\right) \right)
+G\left(t,x(t),x\left(\delta_{-}(s,t)\right) \right) . \] We utilize the new
periodicity concept in terms of shifts operators, which allows us to extend the
concept of periodicity to time scales where the additivity requirement $t\pm
T\in\mathbb{T}$ for all $t\in\mathbb{T}$ and for a fixed $T>0,$ may not hold.
More, importantly, the new concept will easily handle time scales that are not
periodic in the conventional way such as; $\overline{q^{\mathbb{Z}}}$ and
$\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[ 3^{\pm k},2.3^{\pm k}\right] \cup\left\{0\right\} .$
Hence, we develop a tool that enables the investigation of periodic solutions
of $q$-difference systems. Since we are dealing with systems, in order to
convert our equation to an integral systems, we resort to the transition matrix
of the homogeneous Floquet system $y^{\Delta}(t)=A(t)y(t)$ and then make use of
Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem to obtain a fixed point.

distinguishable'' then their superposition should be hard to observe. We make
this intuition precise and general by quantifying the difficulty to observe the
quantum nature of a superposition of two states that can be distinguished
without microscopic accuracy. First, we quantify the distinguishability of any
given pair of quantum states with measurement devices lacking microscopic
accuracy, i.e. measurements suffering from limited resolution or limited
sensitivity. Next, we quantify the required stability that have to be fulfilled
by any measurement setup able to distinguish their superposition from a mere
mixture. Finally, by establishing a relationship between the stability
requirement and the ``macroscopic distinguishability'' of the two superposed
states, we demonstrate that indeed, the more distinguishable the states are,
the more demanding are the stability requirements.

any $d$-regular triangle-free graph there exists a cut of at least this size.
  Our algorithm can be interpreted as a very efficient randomised distributed
algorithm: each node needs to produce only one random bit, and the algorithm
runs in one synchronous communication round. This work is also a case study of
applying computational techniques in the design of distributed algorithms: our
algorithm was designed by a computer program that searched for optimal

width of the entrance slit. This means that astronomical spectrographs
trade-off throughput with spectral resolving power. Recently, optical
guided-wave transitions known as photonic lanterns have been proposed to
circumvent this trade-off, by enabling the efficient reformatting of multimode
light into a pseudo-slit which is highly multimode in one axis, but
diffraction-limited in the other. Here, we demonstrate the successful
reformatting of a telescope point spread function into such a slit using a
three-dimensional integrated optical waveguide device, which we name the
photonic dicer. Using the CANARY adaptive optics demonstrator on the William
Herschel Telescope, and light centred at 1530 nm with a 160 nm FWHM, the device
shows a transmission of between 10 and 20\% depending upon the type of AO
correction applied. Most of the loss is due to the overfilling of the input
aperture in poor and moderate seeing. Taking this into account, the photonic
device itself has a transmission of 57 $\pm$ 4\%.We show how a fully-optimised
device can be used with AO to provide efficient spectroscopy at high spectral
resolution.

  Chemotherapies",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently there has been much work on early phase cancer designs that
incorporate both toxicity and efficacy data, called Phase I-II designs because
they combine elements of both phases. However, they do not explicitly address
the Phase II hypothesis test of $H_0: p\le p_0$, where $p$ is the probability
of efficacy at the estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) $\widehat{\eta}$ from
Phase I and $p_0$ is the baseline efficacy rate. Standard practice for Phase II
remains to treat $p$ as a fixed, unknown parameter and to use Simon's 2-stage
design with all patients dosed at $\widehat{\eta}$. We propose a Phase I-II
design that addresses the uncertainty in the estimate $p=p(\widehat{\eta})$ in
$H_0$ by using sequential generalized likelihood theory. Combining this with a
Phase I design that incorporates efficacy data, the Phase I-II design provides
a common framework that can be used all the way from the first dose of Phase I
through the final accept/reject decision about $H_0$ at the end of Phase II,
utilizing both toxicity and efficacy data throughout. Efficient group
sequential testing is used in Phase II that allows for early stopping to show
treatment effect or futility. The proposed Phase I-II design thus removes the
artificial barrier between Phase I and Phase II, and fulfills the objectives of
searching for the MTD and testing if the treatment has an acceptable response
rate to enter into a Phase III trial.

derived from the parametrisation of the moduli spaces by the bundle of measured
geodesic laminations over Teichm\""uller space of S and can be viewed as
analytic continuations of the shear coordinates on Teichm\""uller space. In
terms of these coordinates the gravitational symplectic structure takes a
particularly simple form, which resembles the Weil-Petersson symplectic
structure in shear coordinates, and is closely related to the cotangent bundle
of Teichm\""uller space. We then consider the mapping class group action on the

cotangent bundle of Teichm\""uller space, corresponding to different values of
the curvature.

studied. Using the reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg-de Vries
(KdV)-like equation is derived which governs the dynamics of the
small-amplitude solitary waves in a magnetized dusty nonthermal plasma. It is
found that due to the dust thermal pressure, there exists a critical value
$(\beta_c)$ of the nothermal parameter $\beta~(>1)$, denoting the percentage of
energetic electrons, below which the DA solitary waves cease to propagate. The
soliton solution (travelling wave) of the KdV-like equation is obtained, and is
shown to be only of the rarefactive type. The properties of the solitons are
analyzed numerically with the system parameters. It is also seen that the
effect of the static magnetic field (which only modifies the soliton width)
becomes significant when the dust gyrofrequency is smaller than one-tenth of
the dust plasma frequency. Furthermore, the amplitude of the soliton is found
to increase (decrease) when the ratio of the free to trapped ion temperatures
$(\sigma)$ is positive (negative). The effects of the system parameters
including the obliqueness of propagation $(l_z)$ and $\sigma$ on the dynamics
of the DA solitons are also discussed numerically, and it is found that the
soliton structures can withstand perturbations and turbulence during a
considerable time. The results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear

simulations we reconstruct the observed double flash. The optical flash is
dominated by synchrotron emission from the thermal plasma behind the forward

fields"", the formal methods of the two fields are radically different. This
dissertation aims to shrink that gap by presenting a theory of logical schemes,
geometric entities which relate to first-order logical theories in much the
same way that algebraic schemes relate to commutative rings.
  The construction relies on a Grothendieck-style representation theorem which
associates every coherent or classical first-order theory with an affine
scheme: a topological groupoid (the spectrum of the theory) together with a
sheaf of (local) syntactic categories. The groupoid is constructed from the
semantics of the theory (models and isomorphisms) and topologized using a
Stone-type construction. The sheaf of categories can be regarded as a logical
theory varying over the spectrum, and its global sections recover the theory up
to semantic equivalence. These affine pieces can be glued together to give more
general logical schemes and these are studied using methods from algebraic
geometry. The final chapter also presents some connections between schemes and
other areas of logic such as model theory, type theory and topos theory.

degradation in the mode quality after transmission through simulated turbulence
and consecutive coherent detection. Here we experimentally analyze the
transmission of one prominent class of spatial modes, the orbital-angular
momentum (OAM) modes, through 3 km of strong turbulence over the city of
Vienna. Instead of performing a coherent phase-dependent measurement, we employ
an incoherent detection scheme which relies on the unambiguous intensity
patterns of the different spatial modes. We use a pattern recognition algorithm
(an artificial neural network) to identify the characteristic mode pattern
displayed on a screen at the receiver. We were able to distinguish between 16
different OAM mode superpositions with only ~1.7% error, and use them to encode
and transmit small grey-scale images. Moreover, we found that the relative
phase of the superposition modes is not affected by the atmosphere,
establishing the feasibility for performing long-distance quantum experiments
with the OAM of photons. Our detection method works for other classes of
spatial modes with unambiguous intensity patterns as well, and can further be
improved by modern techniques of pattern recognition.

during early design stages, such as standard cell compliance, improves the
layout decomposability. With the pre-coloring solutions of standard cells, we
present a TPL aware detailed placement, where the layout decomposition and

deconvolution, matrix factorization, dictionary learning and blind source
separation share the common characteristic of being bilinear inverse problems
(BIPs), i.e. the observation model is a function of two variables and
conditioned on one variable being known, the observation is a linear function
of the other variable. A key issue that arises for such inverse problems is
that of identifiability, i.e. whether the observation is sufficient to
unambiguously determine the pair of inputs that generated the observation.
Identifiability is a key concern for applications like blind equalization in
wireless communications and data mining in machine learning. Herein, a unifying
and flexible approach to identifiability analysis for general conic prior
constrained BIPs is presented, exploiting a connection to low-rank matrix
recovery via lifting. We develop deterministic identifiability conditions on
the input signals and examine their satisfiability in practice for three
classes of signal distributions, viz. dependent but uncorrelated, independent
Gaussian, and independent Bernoulli. In each case, scaling laws are developed
that trade-off probability of robust identifiability with the complexity of the
rank two null space. An added appeal of our approach is that the rank two null
space can be partly or fully characterized for many bilinear problems of
interest (e.g. blind deconvolution). We present numerical experiments involving
variations on the blind deconvolution problem that exploit a characterization
of the rank two null space and demonstrate that the scaling laws offer good
estimates of identifiability.

Insofar as $\textbf{B}$ outside such a domain is considered as vanishingly

through the rope. By 'topological' it is meant that
$\oint_C\textbf{A}\cdot\mathrm d\textbf{s}$ measures along any loop $C$
surrounding the flux rope the same constant flux $\Phi$. The electric current
intensity is another invariant of the theory, but non-topological. We show
that, in this theoretical framework, the linear force-free field (LFFF)
Lundquist model and the non-linear (NLFFF) Gold-Hoyle model of a flux rope
exhibit stable solutions distributed over quantized strata of increasing
energies (an infinite number of strata in the first case, only one stratum in
the second case); each stratum is made of a continuous set of stable states.
The lowest LFFF stratum and the unique NLFFF stratum come numerically close one
to the other, and match with a reasonable accuracy the data collected by
spacecrafts travelling across magnetic clouds. The other LFFF strata do not
match these data at all. It is not possible at this stage to claim which model
fits better the magnetic cloud data. We also analyze in some detail the merging
of tubes belonging to the same stratum, with conservation of the magnetic
helicity, and the transition of a tube from one stratum to another one, which
does not conserve magnetic helicity.

this infrastructure has a direct influence on the lives of most of citizens in
developed regions by providing a critical lifeline between communities and the
transportation of goods and services, and as a critical component of the
transportation network, bridges have received a lot of attention regarding
condition assessment and maintenance practices. Despite successful
implementation of advanced evaluation techniques, what is still lacking is a
fundamental understanding of the system behavior in the presence of
deteriorating conditions that can be used for preservation decision-making.
This paper aims to present a performance-based framework that can be used to
characterize the behavior of in-service bridge superstructures. In order to
measure the bridge system performance with deteriorating conditions,
system-level behavior of a representative composite steel girder bridge,
degraded with three common damage scenarios was investigated in this study.
Results obtained from validated numerical analysis demonstrated significant
impact of integrated damage mechanisms on the ultimate capacity, redundancy and
system ductility of the simulated bridge superstructure. It is expected that
the proposed framework for evaluating system behavior will provide a first step
for establishing a critical linkage between design, maintenance, and
rehabilitation of highway bridges, which are uncoupled in current

redshift systems at $z_{abs}<0.75$ covering total redshift pathlengths $\Delta
z_{HI}=21.7$ and $\Delta z_{OVI}=14.5$. Our semi-automated line-finding and
measurement technique renders the catalog as objectively-defined as possible.
The cumulative column-density distribution of HI systems can be parametrized
$dN(>N)/dz=C_{14}(N/10^{14} cm^{-2})^{-(\beta-1)}$, with $C_{14}=25\pm1$ and
$\beta=1.65\pm0.02$. This distribution is seen to evolve both in amplitude,
$C_{14}\sim(1+z)^{2.0\pm0.1}$, and slope $\beta(z)=1.73-0.26 z$ for $z<0.47$.
We observe metal lines in 427 systems, and find that the fraction of IGM
absorbers detected in metals is strongly dependent on N_{HI}. The distribution
of OVI absorbers appear to evolve in the same sense as the Lya forest. We
calculate contributions to $\Omega_b$ from different components of the low-$z$
IGM and determine the Lya decrement as a function of redshift. IGM absorbers
are analyzed via a two-point correlation function (TPCF) in velocity space. We
find substantial clustering of \HI\ absorbers on scales of $\Delta v=50-300$
km/s with no significant clustering at $\Delta v>1000$ km/s. Splitting the
sample into strong and weak absorbers, we see that most of the clustering

declustering"", which recursively removes soft wide-angle radiation from a jet.
The soft drop algorithm depends on two parameters--a soft threshold
$z_\text{cut}$ and an angular exponent $\beta$--with the $\beta = 0$ limit
corresponding roughly to the (modified) mass drop procedure. To gain an
analytic understanding of soft drop and highlight the $\beta$ dependence, we
perform resummed calculations for three observables on soft-dropped jets: the
energy correlation functions, the groomed jet radius, and the energy loss due
to soft drop. The $\beta = 0$ limit of the energy loss is particularly
interesting, since it is not only ""Sudakov safe"" but also largely insensitive
to the value of the strong coupling constant. While our calculations are
strictly accurate only to modified leading-logarithmic order, we also include a
discussion of higher-order effects such as multiple emissions and (the absence
of) non-global logarithms. We compare our analytic results to parton shower
simulations and find good agreement, and we also estimate the impact of
non-perturbative effects such as hadronization and the underlying event.
Finally, we demonstrate how soft drop can be used for tagging boosted W bosons,
and we speculate on the potential advantages of using soft drop for pileup
mitigation.

investigated through Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS). In a simulation, physical dissipation of the velocity field
and species mass fraction often compete with numerical dissipation arising from
the errors of the numerical method. In a DNS the computational mesh resolves
all physical gradients of the flow and the relative effect of numerical
dissipation is small. In LES, unresolved scales are present and numerical
dissipation can have a large impact on the flow, depending on the computational
mesh. A suite of simulations explores the space between these two extremes by
studying the effects of grid resolution, Reynolds number and numerical method
on the mixing process. Results from a DNS are shown using two different codes,
which use a high- and low-order numerical method and show convergence in the
temporal and spectral dependent quantities associated with mixing. Data from a
coarse LES are also presented and include a grid convergence study. A model for
an effective viscosity is proposed which allows for an a posteriori analysis of
the simulation data that is agnostic to the LES model, numerics and the
physical Reynolds number of the simulation. An analogous approximation for an
effective species diffusivity is also presented. This framework can then be
used to estimate the effective Reynolds number and Schmidt number of future
simulations, elucidate the impact of numerical dissipation on the mixing
process for an arbitrary numerical method and provide guidance for resolution
requirements of future calculations

Although the quasars show evidence for being heavily obscured Compton-thick
systems on the basis of the 2-10 keV to [OIII] luminosity ratio and
multiwavelength diagnostics, their X-ray absorbing column densities (N_H) are
poorly known. In this analysis: (1) we study X-ray emission at >10 keV, where
X-rays from the central black hole are relatively unabsorbed, in order to
better constrain N_H; (2) we further characterize the physical properties of
the sources through broad-band near-UV to mid-IR spectral energy distribution
(SED) analyses. One of the quasars is detected with NuSTAR at >8 keV with a
no-source probability of <0.1%, and its X-ray band ratio suggests near
Compton-thick absorption with N_H \gtrsim 5 x 10^23 cm^-2. The other two
quasars are undetected, and have low X-ray to mid-IR luminosity ratios in both
the low energy (2-10 keV) and high energy (10-40 keV) X-ray regimes that are
consistent with extreme, Compton-thick absorption (N_H \gtrsim 10^24 cm^-2). We
find that for quasars at z ~ 0.5, NuSTAR provides a significant improvement
compared to lower energy (<10 keV) Chandra and XMM-Newton observations alone,

calibration would substantially reduce the tension found between the Planck

high redshift in quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) II
Data Release 7 and SDSS-III Data Release 9. We have selected candidates using a
modified profile fitting technique taking into account that the Ly$\alpha$
forest can effectively mimic H$_2$ absorption systems at the resolution of SDSS
data. To estimate the confidence level of the detections, we use two methods: a
Monte-Carlo sampling and an analysis of control samples. The analysis of
control samples allows us to define regions of the spectral quality parameter
space where H$_2$ absorption systems can be confidently identified. We find
that H$_2$ absorption systems with column densities $\log {\rm N_{H_2}} > 19$
can be detected in only less than 3% of SDSS quasar spectra. We estimate the
upper limit on the detection rate of saturated H$_2$ absorption systems ($\log
{\rm N_{H_2}} > 19$) in Damped Ly-$\alpha$ (DLA) systems to be about 7%. We
provide a sample of 23 confident H$_2$ absorption system candidates that would
be interesting to follow up with high resolution spectrographs. There is a
1$\sigma$ $r-i$ color excess and non-significant $A_{\rm V}$ extinction excess
in quasar spectra with an H$_2$ candidate compared to standard DLA-bearing
quasar spectra. The equivalent widths (EWs) of C II, Si II and Al III (but not
Fe II) absorptions associated with H$_2$ candidate DLAs are larger compared to
standard DLAs. This is probably related to a larger spread in velocity of the
absorption lines in the H$_2$ bearing sample.

covariate effects parametrically, while the genetic markers are considered

nonparametric tests of independence. We show the equivalence between the score

to a novel generalization of the KDC test that incorporates the covariates. Our
contributions are three-fold: (1) establishing the equivalence between KMR and

discriminative power, so false positive matches occur prevalently. Apart from
the information loss during quantization, another cause is that the SIFT
feature only describes the local gradient distribution. To address this
problem, this paper proposes a coupled Multi-Index (c-MI) framework to perform
feature fusion at indexing level. Basically, complementary features are coupled
into a multi-dimensional inverted index. Each dimension of c-MI corresponds to
one kind of feature, and the retrieval process votes for images similar in both
SIFT and other feature spaces. Specifically, we exploit the fusion of local
color feature into c-MI. While the precision of visual match is greatly
enhanced, we adopt Multiple Assignment to improve recall. The joint cooperation
of SIFT and color features significantly reduces the impact of false positive
matches.
  Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that c-MI
improves the retrieval accuracy significantly, while consuming only half of the
query time compared to the baseline. Importantly, we show that c-MI is well
complementary to many prior techniques. Assembling these methods, we have
obtained an mAP of 85.8% and N-S score of 3.85 on Holidays and Ukbench

from 7 to 375 Msun, that probably surround multiple young stars. The CH_3CN
line emission is detected toward all the molecular cores at least up to the
K=6-component and is mostly associated with the emission peaks of the dusty

rotational diagram method and a simultaneous synthetic LTE model with the
XCLASS program to estimate the temperatures and column densities of the cores.
For all sources, we obtained reasonable fits from XCLASS by using a model that
combines two components: an extended and warm envelope, and a compact hot core
of molecular gas, suggesting internal heating by recently formed massive stars.
The rotational temperatures lie in the range of 40-132 K and 122-485 K for the

spectral data, based on a corpus recorded with a human-like audiomotor robot
head. A non-linear dimensionality reduction technique is used to show that
these data lie on a two-dimensional (2D) smooth manifold parameterized by the
motor states of the listener, or equivalently, the sound source directions. We
propose a probabilistic piecewise affine mapping model (PPAM) specifically
designed to deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting an intrinsic piecewise

procedure for estimating the model parameters, followed by Bayes inversion for
obtaining the full posterior density function of a sound source direction. We
extend this solution to deal with missing data and redundancy in real world
spectrograms, and hence for 2D localization of natural sound sources such as
speech. We further generalize the model to the challenging case of multiple
sound sources and we propose a variational EM framework. The associated
algorithm, referred to as variational EM for source separation and localization
(VESSL) yields a Bayesian estimation of the 2D locations and time-frequency
masks of all the sources. Comparisons of the proposed approach with several

profile is symmetric and its line center agrees with that of CO line, implying
that there are no significant bulk flows and that the photo-ionization from the

is carried out in this study. The stiffened gas equation of state is adopted to
capacitate the proposed method to deal with single-phase gases and/or liquids
effectively, whilst direct applying the perfect gas equation of state for
compressible liquid flows might encounter great difficulties in correlating the

hadronic species that would potentially contribute to the degradation of a

concerning the verification, synthesis and correction of concurrent systems
that can be modeled by bounded p/t-nets. We express concurrency via partial
orders and assume that behavioral specifications are given via monadic second
order logic. A c-partial-order is a partial order whose Hasse diagram can be
covered by c paths. For a finite set T of transitions, we let P(c,T,\phi)
denote the set of all T-labelled c-partial-orders satisfying \phi. If N=(P,T)
is a p/t-net we let P(N,c) denote the set of all c-partially-ordered runs of N.
A (b, r)-bounded p/t-net is a b-bounded p/t-net in which each place appears
repeated at most r times. We solve the following problems:
  1. Verification: given an MSO formula \phi and a bounded p/t-net N determine
whether P(N,c)\subseteq P(c,T,\phi), whether P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq P(N,c), or
whether P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi)=\emptyset.
  2. Synthesis from MSO Specifications: given an MSO formula \phi, synthesize a
semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N satisfying P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq
P(N, c).
  3. Semantically Safest Subsystem: given an MSO formula \phi defining a set of
safe partial orders, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, possibly containing unsafe
behaviors, synthesize the safest (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N' whose behavior lies
in between P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi) and P(N,c).

trustee-based social authentication) has been shown to be a promising backup
authentication mechanism. A user in this system is associated with a few
trustees that were selected from the user's friends. When the user wants to
regain access to the account, the service provider sends different verification
codes to the user's trustees. The user must obtain at least k (i.e., recovery
threshold) verification codes from the trustees before being directed to reset
his or her password.
  In this paper, we provide the first systematic study about the security of
trustee-based social authentications. Specifically, we first introduce a novel
framework of attacks, which we call forest fire attacks. In these attacks, an
attacker initially obtains a small number of compromised users, and then the
attacker iteratively attacks the rest of users by exploiting trustee-based
social authentications. Then, we construct a probabilistic model to formalize
the threats of forest fire attacks and their costs for attackers. Moreover, we
introduce various defense strategies. Finally, we apply our framework to
extensively evaluate various concrete attack and defense strategies using three
real-world social network datasets. Our results have strong implications for
the design of more secure trustee-based social authentications.

information to a few random contacts. By their very nature, gossip algorithms
tend to be distributed and fault tolerant. If done right, they can also be fast
and message-efficient. A common model for gossip communication is the random
phone call model, in which in each synchronous round each node can PUSH or PULL
information to or from a random other node. For example, Karp et al. [FOCS
2000] gave algorithms in this model that spread a message to all nodes in
$\Theta(\log n)$ rounds while sending only $O(\log \log n)$ messages per node
on average.
  Recently, Avin and Els\""asser [DISC 2013], studied the random phone call
model with the natural and commonly used assumption of direct addressing.
Direct addressing allows nodes to directly contact nodes whose ID (e.g., IP
address) was learned before. They show that in this setting, one can ""break the
$\log n$ barrier"" and achieve a gossip algorithm running in $O(\sqrt{\log n})$
rounds, albeit while using $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ messages per node.
  We study the same model and give a simple gossip algorithm which spreads a
message in only $O(\log \log n)$ rounds. We also prove a matching $\Omega(\log
\log n)$ lower bound which shows that this running time is best possible. In
particular we show that any gossip algorithm takes with high probability at
least $0.99 \log \log n$ rounds to terminate. Lastly, our algorithm can be
tweaked to send only $O(1)$ messages per node on average with only $O(\log n)$
bits per message. Our algorithm therefore simultaneously achieves the optimal
round-, message-, and bit-complexity for this setting. As all prior gossip
algorithms, our algorithm is also robust against failures. In particular, if in
the beginning an oblivious adversary fails any $F$ nodes our algorithm still,
with high probability, informs all but $o(F)$ surviving nodes.

redshift of zero in a fully cosmological Lambda cold dark matter context as
part of high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. We
performed bulge-disc decompositions of the galaxies using artificial
observations, in order to conduct a fair comparison to observations. We also
dynamically decomposed the galaxies and compared the star formation histories
of the bulges to those of the entire galaxies. These star formation histories
showed that the bulges were primarily formed before z = 1 and during periods of
rapid star formation. Both galaxies have large amounts of early star formation,
which is likely related to the relatively high bulge-to-disc ratios also
measured for them. Unlike almost all previous cosmological simulations, the
realistically concentrated bulges of these galaxies do not lead to unphysically
high rotational velocities, causing them to naturally lie along the observed
Tully-Fisher relation.

paper addresses this gap and presents a tractable model for analyzing

user-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent cooperation activation.
Assuming all BSs of each tier follow a stationary Poisson point process, the
coverage probability for non-coherent JT is derived. Using the developed model,
it is shown that for small cooperative clusters of small-cell BSs, non-coherent
JT by small cells provides spectral efficiency gains without significantly
increasing cell load. Further, when cooperation is aggressively triggered
intra-cluster frequency reuse within small cells is favorable over
intra-cluster coordinated scheduling.

in silico. These dyes are designed through chemical modifications of the
conjugated bridge of a reference organic sensitizer known as Carbz-PAHTDDT (S9)
dye. The aim of designing these dyes was to reduce the energy gap between their
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) and to red-shift their absorption response compared to those of
the reference S9 dye sensitizer. This reference dye has a reported promising
efficiency when coupled with ferrocene-based electrolyte composition. To
investigate geometric and electronic structure, density functional theory (DFT)
and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were conducted on the new dyes as
well as the reference dye. The present study indicated that the long-range
correction to the theoretical model in the TD-DFT simulation is important to
produce accurate absorption wavelengths.The theoretical studies have shown a
reduced HOMO-LUMO gap and red-shifted absorption spectra for both of the new
candidate dyes. Such findings suggest that the new dyes are promising and
suitable for optoelectronic applications.

scanned in order to find a small number of candidates which are linked to a
particular disease or phenotype. This is a variable selection problem in the
""large p, small n"" paradigm where many more variables than samples are
available. Additionally, a complex dependence structure is often observed among
the markers/genes due to their joint involvement in biological processes and
pathways. Bayesian variable selection methods that introduce sparseness through
additional priors on the model size are well suited to the problem. However,
the model space is very large and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms such as a Gibbs sampler sweeping over all p variables in each
iteration are often computationally infeasible. We propose to employ the
dependence structure in the data to decide which variables should always be
updated together and which are nearly conditionally independent and hence do
not need to be considered together. Here, we focus on binary classification
applications. We follow the implementation of the Bayesian probit regression
model by Albert and Chib (1993) and the Bayesian logistic regression model by
Holmes and Held (2006) which both lead to marginal Gaussian distributions. We
in- vestigate several MCMC samplers using the dependence structure in different
ways. The mixing and convergence performances of the resulting Markov chains
are evaluated and compared to standard samplers in two simulation studies and
in an application to a real gene expression data set.

methods for solving nuclear many-body problems based on the shell model.
Various approaches have been proposed which are constructed in terms of the

et al}. In order to find out a method of calculating them we make decomposition
of a full Hilbert space into subspaces (the Krylov subspaces) and transform a
Hamiltonian to a block-tridiagonal form. This transformation brings about much
simplification of the calculation of the $\widehat{Q}$ box. In the previous
work a recursion method has been derived for calculating the $\widehat{Q}$ box
analytically on the basis of such transformation of the Hamiltonian. In the
present study, by extending the recursion method for the $\widehat{Q}$ box, we
derive another recursion relation to calculate the derivatives of the
$\widehat{Q}$ box of arbitrary order. With the $\widehat{Q}$ box and its
derivatives thus determined we apply them to the calculation of the
$E$-independent effective interaction given in the so-called Lee-Suzuki (LS)
method for a system with a degenerate unperturbed energy. We show that the
recursion method can also be applied to the generalized LS scheme for a system
with non-degenerate unperturbed energies. If the Hilbert space is taken to be
sufficiently large, the theory provides an exact way of calculating the
$\widehat{Q}$ box and its derivatives. This approach enables us to perform
recursive calculations for the effective interaction to arbitrary order for
both systems with degenerate and non-degenerate unperturbed energies.

  Our spectra exhibit the well-known predominance of highly circularly
polarized features, interpreted as $\sigma$ components of Zeeman patterns.
Focusing on the generally weaker and rarer linear polarization, we found three
examples of likely full Zeeman triplets (a linearly polarized $\pi$ component,
straddled in velocity by $\sigma$ components), adding to the solitary example
previously reported. We also identify 40 examples of likely isolated $\pi$
components, contradicting past beliefs that $\pi$ components might be extremely

polarization on one transition is accompanied on the other transition by a
matching feature, at the same velocity and also with significant linear
polarization.

for areal data that arise from, for instances, epidemiological, socio-economic
or ecological studies. Various multivariate conditional autoregressive models
have also been extensively studied in the literature and it has been shown that
extending from the univariate case to the multivariate case is not trivial. The
difficulties lie in many aspects, including validity, interpretability,
flexibility and computational feasibility of the model. In this paper, we
approach the multivariate modeling from an element-based perspective instead of
the traditional vector-based perspective. We focus on the joint adjacency
structure of elements and discuss graphical structures for both the spatial and
non-spatial domains. We assume that the graph for the spatial domain is
generally known and fixed while the graph for the non-spatial domain can be
unknown and random. We propose a very general specification for the
multivariate conditional modeling and then focus on three special cases, which
are linked to well known models in the literature. Bayesian inference for
parameter learning and graph learning is provided for the focused cases, and
finally, an example with public health data is illustrated.

are referred as the LL1 and LL2 points respectively and can generate the
different types of low-energy trajectories transferring from Earth to Moon. The
time-dependent analytic model including the gravitational forces from the Sun,
Earth and Moon is employed to investigate the energy-minimal and practical
transfer trajectories. However, different from the circular restricted
three-body problem, the equivalent gravitational equilibria are defined
according to the geometry of instantaneous Hill's boundary due to the
gravitational perturbation from the Sun. The relationship between the altitudes
of periapsis and eccentricities is achieved from the Poincar\'e mapping for all
the lunar captured trajectories, which presents the statistical feature of the
fuel cost and captured orbital elements rather than generating a specified
Moon-captured segment. The minimum energy required by the captured trajectory
on a lunar circular orbit is deduced in the spatial bi-circular model. It is
presented that the asymptotical behaviors of invariant manifolds approaching
to/from the libration points or halo orbits are destroyed by the solar
perturbation. In fact, the energy-minimal cislunar transfer trajectory is
acquired by transiting LL1 point, while the energy-minimal trans-lunar transfer
trajectory is obtained by transiting LL2 point. Finally, the transfer
opportunities for the practical trajectories escaped from the Earth and
captured by the Moon are yielded by transiting halo orbits near LL1 and LL2
points, which can be used to generate the whole trajectories.

observed during the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope

J0038+4128 is a Seyfert 1-Seyfert 2 AGN pair. The HST WFPC2 F336W/U-band image

atomic sites with on-site potentials distributed according to a quasiperiodic
Aubry-Andre potential. SMC claim the existence of multiple mobility edges, i.e.
metal-insulator transitions at multiple values of the Fermi energy. SMC use
numerical calculations of the conductance and den- sity of states, and an
analytical result in a limiting case. In the following, we restate in the real
space the change of basis done by SMC. This change of basis reduces their model
to two decoupled chains, each with its own Aubry- Andre potential. Each of the
chains has its own critical point, where all states change from metallic to
insulat- ing, without any notion of a mobility edge. Since the two chains are
not interacting, their spectra may overlap such that localized states (from one
chain) and delocal- ized states (from the other chain) coexist at the same en-
ergy. Consequently, the analysis of the density of states and the conductance
alone is misleading, and that is due to the choice of the symmetric
quasiperiodic potential. We briefly outline the possibility to obtain true
mobility edges.

models. An open problem with the DP is how to choose its infinite dimensional
parameter (base measure) in case of lack of prior information. In this work we
present the Imprecise DP (IDP) -- a prior near-ignorance DP-based model that
does not require any choice of this probability measure. It consists of a class
of DPs obtained by letting the normalized base measure of the DP vary in the
set of all probability measures. We discuss the tight connections of this
approach with Bayesian robustness and in particular prior near-ignorance
modeling via sets of probabilities. We use this model to perform a Bayesian
hypothesis test on the probability P(X<Y). We study the theoretical properties
of the IDP test (e.g., asymptotic consistency), and compare it with the
frequentist Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank test that is commonly employed as a test
on P(X< Y). In particular we will show that our method is more robust, in the
sense that it is able to isolate instances in which the aforementioned test is
virtually guessing at random.

an agent decides if it remains idle or if it wants to move to one of the

If it planned to move and the fault happened, the agent is aware of it. We
consider three scenarios of fault distribution: random (independently in each

polynomial in the size n of the network and polylogarithmic in the larger label

By contrast, for unbounded adversarial faults we show that rendezvous is not
feasible, even in the class of rings. Under this scenario we give a rendezvous
algorithm with cost O(nl), where l is the smaller label, working in arbitrary

[IEEE Trans. Automatic Control, 58 (2013), pp. 935--946], by an antagonistic
interaction between a pair of nodes updating their scalar states we mean one
node receives the opposite of the state of the other and naturally by an
cooperative interaction we mean the former receives the true state of the
latter. Here the pairwise communication can be either unidirectional or
bidirectional and the overall network topology graph may change with time. The
concept of modulus consensus is introduced to characterize the scenario that
the moduli of the node states reach a consensus. It is proved that modulus
consensus is achieved if the switching interaction graph is uniformly jointly
strongly connected for unidirectional communications, or infinitely jointly
connected for bidirectional communications. We construct a counterexample to
underscore the rather surprising fact that quasi-strong connectivity of the
interaction graph, i.e., the graph contains a directed spanning tree, is not
sufficient to guarantee modulus consensus even under fixed topologies. Finally,
simulation results using a discrete-time Kuramoto model are given to illustrate
the convergence results showing that the proposed framework is applicable to a

inclined to the rotation axis by an angle that depends on the wave frequency.
In closed domains, multiple reflections from the boundaries may cause inertial
waves to focus on to particular structures known as wave attractors. Such
structures have previously been studied from a theoretical point of view, in
laboratory experiments, in linear numerical calculations and in some recent
numerical simulations. In the present paper, two-dimensional direct numerical
simulations of an inertial wave attractor are presented. In the linear regime,
we first recover the results of the linear calculations and asymptotic theory
of Ogilvie (2005) who considered a prototypical problem involving the focusing
of linear internal waves into a narrow beam centred on a wave attractor in a
steady state. The velocity profile of the beam and its scalings with the Ekman
number, as well as the asymptotic value of the dissipation rate, are found to
be in agreement with the linear theory. We also find that, as the beam builds
up around the wave attractor, the power input by the applied force reaches its
limiting value more rapidly than the dissipation rate, which saturates only
when the beam has reached its final thickness. In the nonlinear regime, the
beam is strongly affected and becomes unstable to a subharmonic instability.
This instability transfers energy to secondary waves possessing shorter
wavelengths and lower frequencies. The onset of the instability of a narrow
inertial wave beam is investigated by means of a separate linear analysis and
the results, such as the onset of the instability, are found to be consistent
with the global simulations of the wave attractor. The excitation of such
secondary waves described theoretically in this work has also been seen in
recent laboratory experiments on internal gravity waves.

of an order of magnitude after the protostar birth, while that of HNC,
Dfrac(HNC), remains constant for much longer. We tested these predictions by
deriving Dfrac(HNC) in 22 high-mass star forming cores divided in three
different evolutionary stages, from high-mass starless core candidates (HMSCs,
8) to high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs, 7) to Ultracompact HII regions
(UCHIIs, 7). For all of them, Dfrac (N2H+) was already determined through
IRAM-30m Telescope observations, which confirmed the theoretical rapid decrease
of Dfrac(N2H+) after protostar birth (Fontani et al. 2011). Therefore our
comparative study is not affected by biases introduced by the source selection.
We have found average Dfrac(HNC) of 0.012, 0.009 and 0.008 in HMSCs, HMPOs and
UCHIIs, respectively, with no statistically significant differences among the
three evolutionary groups. These findings confirm the predictions of the
chemical models, and indicate that large values of Dfrac(N2H+) are more
suitable than large values of Dfrac(HNC) to identify cores on the verge of

decoding Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes on the binary-input additive
white Gaussian noise channel. The new algorithm, called Noisy GDBF (NGDBF),
introduces a random perturbation into each symbol metric at each iteration. The
noise perturbation allows the algorithm to escape from undesirable local
maxima, resulting in improved performance. A combination of heuristic
improvements to the algorithm are proposed and evaluated. When the proposed
heuristics are applied, NGDBF performs better than any previously reported GDBF
variant, and comes within 0.5 dB of the belief propagation algorithm for
several tested codes. Unlike other previous GDBF algorithms that provide an
escape from local maxima, the proposed algorithm uses only local, fully
parallelizable operations and does not require computing a global objective
function or a sort over symbol metrics, making it highly efficient in
comparison. The proposed NGDBF algorithm requires channel state information
which must be obtained from a signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimator.
Architectural details are presented for implementing the NGDBF algorithm.
Complexity analysis and optimizations are also discussed.

functions for data in infinite dimensional spaces. In this paper, we consider
some notions of depth in infinite dimensional spaces and study their properties
under various stochastic models. Our analysis shows that some of the depth

commonly used probability distributions in infinite dimensional spaces of
sequences and functions. As a consequence, they are not very useful for the
analysis of data satisfying such infinite dimensional probability models.
However, some modified versions of those depth functions as well as an infinite

The variations of solar activity over long time intervals using a

nonlinear dynamics, the solar activity cycle is studied using solar activity
proxies that have been reaching into the past for over 9300 years. The
complexity of the system is expressed by several parameters of nonlinear
dynamics, such as embedding dimension or false nearest neighbors, and the
method of delay coordinates is applied to the time series. We also fit a damped
random walk model, which accurately describes the variability of quasars, to
the solar 10Be data and investigate the corresponding power spectral
distribution. The periods in the data series were searched by the Fourier and
wavelet analyses. The solar activity on the long-term scale is found to be on
the edge of chaotic behavior. This can explain the observed intermittent period
of longer lasting solar activity minima. Filtering the data by eliminating
variations below a certain period (the periods of 380 yr and 57 yr were used)
yields a far more regular behavior of solar activity. A comparison between the
results for the 10Be data with the 14C data shows many similarities. Both
cosmogenic isotopes are strongly correlated mutually and with solar activity.
Finally, we find that a series of damped random walk models provides a good fit
to the 10Be data with a fixed characteristic time scale of 1000 years, which is
roughly consistent with the quasi-periods found by the Fourier and wavelet

investigate the impact of beam-related backgrounds on the detector by
overlaying events from different simulated event samples. Moreover, we present
full simulation studies, determining the performance of the calorimeter and

Yet, complex networks pose challenges to established multilevel algorithms, in
particular to their coarsening phase.
  One way to specify a (recursive) coarsening of a graph is to rate its edges
and then contract the edges as prioritized by the rating. In this paper we (i)
define weights for the edges of a network that express the edges' importance
for connectivity, (ii) compute a minimum weight spanning tree $T^m$ with
respect to these weights, and (iii) rate the network edges based on the
conductance values of $T^m$'s fundamental cuts. To this end, we also (iv)
develop the first optimal linear-time algorithm to compute the conductance
values of \emph{all} fundamental cuts of a given spanning tree. We integrate
the new edge rating into a leading multilevel graph partitioner and equip the
latter with a new greedy postprocessing for optimizing the maximum
communication volume (MCV). Experiments on bipartitioning frequently used
benchmark networks show that the postprocessing already reduces MCV by 11.3%.
Our new edge rating further reduces MCV by 10.3% compared to the previously
best rating with the postprocessing in place for both ratings. In total, with a
modest increase in running time, our new approach reduces the MCV of complex

then they would decay slower and easily survive the inflationary era. However,
the existence of supercurvature mode strongly depends on details of the system.
To clarify whether a massive vector field has supercurvature modes, we consider
a U(1) gauge field with gauge and conformal invariances spontaneously broken
through the Higgs mechanism, and present explicit expressions for the Euclidean
vacuum mode functions. We find that, for any values of the vector field mass,
there is no supercurvature mode. In the massless limit, the absence of

production to feed the growing human population. Current chemical and genetic
technologies used to manage plant diseases are highly vulnerable to pathogen
evolution and are not sustainable. Pathogen evolution is facilitated by the
genetic uniformity underlying modern agroecosystems, suggesting that one path
to sustainable disease control lies through increasing genetic diversity at the
field scale by using genetically diverse host mixtures. We investigate how host
mixtures can improve disease control using a population dynamics model. We find
that when a population of crop plants is exposed to host-specialized pathogen
species or strains, the overall disease severity is smaller in the mixture of
two host varieties than in each of the corresponding pure stands. The disease
severity can be minimized over a range of mixing ratios. These findings may
help in designing host mixtures that efficiently control diseases of crops. We
then generalize the model to describe host mixtures with many components. We
find that when pathogens exhibit host specialization, the overall disease
severity decreases with the number of components in the mixture. As the degree
of specialization increases, the decrease in disease severity becomes larger.
Using these model outcomes, we propose ways to optimize the use of host
mixtures to decrease disease in agroecosystems.

sites have hopping probability to sites which are not nodes of the localized

for very particular values of magnetic flux. The conductance exhibits a zero
frequency peak with a dip which is a distinct fingerprint of the variable
extension of these localized states.

account for giant planets on close orbits highly inclined to the stellar
equatorial plane. We obtain conditions for maintaining approximate coplanarity
and test them with SPH-simulations. For parameters of interest, the system
undergoes approximate rigid body precession with modest warping while the
planets migrate inwards. Because of pressure forces, disc self-gravity is not
needed to maintain the configuration. We consider a disc and single planet for
different initial inclinations of the binary orbit to the midplane of the
combined system and a system of three planets for which migration leads to
dynamical instability that reorders the planets. As the interaction is
dominated by the time averaged quadrupole component of the binary's perturbing
potential, results for a circular orbit can be scaled to apply to eccentric
orbits. The system responded adiabatically when changes to binary orbital
parameters occurred on time scales exceeding the orbital period. Accordingly
inclination changes are maintained under its slow removal. Thus the scenario
for generating high inclination planetary orbits studied here, is promising.

with higher accuracy order (2nd order) than would be expected from its weak

coefficients in an asymptotic expansion for the weak error, demonstrating that
the convergence to 2nd order is exponentially rapid in time. Moreover, we

maximum strength of local depolarization fields is rather determined by the

Furthermore, field screening due to electronic band bending and due to presence
of intrinsic defects leads to asymmetric space charge regions near the grain
boundary, which produce an effective dipole layer at the surface of the grain.
This results in the formation of a potential difference between the grain
surface and its interior of the order of 1 V, which can be of either sign
depending on defect transition levels and concentrations. Exemplary acceptor

quantum-interference-related phenomena, such as electromagnetically induced
transparency, gain without inversion and enhanced refractive index. Gain and
dispersion characteristics of such transitions strongly depend upon the
relative phase between the driving and the probe fields. Unlike allowed
transitions, gain/absorption behavior of ac-Stark allowed transitions exhibit

simulations. Exact solutions for waves can, however, differ significantly from
the GO approximation. In particular, effects that are ""perfect"" for waves
cannot usually be derived using GO. Here we give a method for designing
materials in which GO is exact for some waves. This enables us to find
interesting analytical solutions for exact wave propagation in inhomogeneous
media. Two examples of the technique are given: a material in which two point
sources do not interfere, and a perfect isotropic cloak for waves from a point
source. We also give the form of material response required for GO to be exact
for all waves.

difficulties of the physics of SSSS in the f(R) theories of gravity
\cite{Felice10,Berti} applying novel highly nontrivial nonlinear boundary
conditions, which depend on the global properties of the solution and on the
EOS. We also introduce two pairs of new notions: cosmological-energy-pressure
densities and dilaton-energy-pressure densities, as well as two new EOS for
them: cosmological EOS (CEOS) and dilaton EOS (DEOS). Special attention is paid
to the dilatonic sphere (in brief -- disphere) of SSSS, introduced in this

evolves in rounds. Initially, there is a subset of infected nodes and in each

  We consider this process in the case where the underlying graph is an
inhomogeneous random graph whose kernel is of rank 1. Assuming that initially
every vertex is infected independently with probability p > 0, we provide a law
of large numbers for the number of vertices that will have been infected by the
end of the process.
  We also focus on a special case of such random graphs which exhibit a
power-law degree distribution with exponent in (2,3). The first two authors
have shown the existence of a critical function a_c(n) such that a_c(n)=o(n)
with the following property. Let n be the number of vertices of the underlying
random graph and let a(n) be the number of the vertices that are initially
infected. Assume that a set of a(n) vertices is chosen randomly and becomes
externally infected. If a(n) << a_c(n), then the process does not evolve at
all, with high probability as n grows, whereas if a(n)>> a_c(n), then with high
probability the final set of infected vertices is linear.
  Using the techniques of the previous theorem, we give the precise asymptotic

However, we observe that a complete factorization, equivalent to the ""decorated

3N_0$, about tens of times the most probable length of the prime knots tied on
the rings. The decorated ring hypothesis has been used in literature to justify
the factorization of composite knots probabilities into the knotting
probabilities of their prime components. Following our results, we suggest that
such hypothesis may not be necessary to explain the factorization of the
knotting probabilities, at least when polymers excluded volume is not relevant.
We rationalize the behavior of the system through a simple one dimensional
model in which prime knots are replaced by sliplinks randomly placed on a
circle, with the only constraint that the length of the loops has the same
distribution of the length of the corresponding prime knots.

inspires us to sub-sample the atlas of genes by repeatedly drawing random sets
of 200 genes and refitting the model. This results in a random distribution of
density profiles, that can be compared to the predictions of the model. This
results in a ranking of cell types by the overlap between the original and
sub-sampled density profiles. Cell types with high rank include medium spiny
neurons, several samples of cortical pyramidal neurons, hippocampal pyramidal
neurons, granule cells and cholinergic neurons from the brain stem. In some
cases with lower rank, the average sub-sample can have better contrast
properties than the original model (this is the case for amygdalar neurons and
dopaminergic neurons from the ventral midbrain). Finally, we add some noise to
the cell-type-specific transcriptomes by mixing them using a scalar parameter
weighing a random matrix. After refitting the model, we observe than a mixing
parameter of $5\%$ leads to modifications of density profiles that span the
same interval as the ones resulting from sub-sampling.

addressing the spherical location problem H_0:theta=theta_0, with theta_0 a
fixed location, is the so-called Watson test, which is based on the sample mean

implementation requires the sample size n to be large compared to the dimension
p. This is a severe limitation, since more and more problems nowadays involve
high-dimensional directional data (e.g., in genetics or text mining). In this
work, we therefore introduce a modified Watson statistic that can cope with
high-dimensionality. We derive its asymptotic null distribution as both n and p
go to infinity. This is achieved in a universal asymptotic framework that
allows p to go to infinity arbitrarily fast (or slowly) as a function of n. We
further show that our results also provide high-dimensional tests for a problem

with rather low electron energy ($\sim$1 keV) can efficiently excite graphene

can be further scattered into free space by the grating for those satisfying

varying the velocity of the moving electrons. Importantly, the radiation
frequencies can be tuned by varying the Fermi level of the graphene layer,
offering tunable THz radiations that can cover a wide frequency range. Our

in this theory are in very good agreement with simulations. The proximity with
a simple homogeneous pair-approximation is elicited showing that the transition

MNRAS, 2014",,"10.1093/mnras/stu304",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In this paper, we address the migration of small mass planets in 3D radiative
disks. Indeed, migration of small planets is known to be too fast inwards in
locally isothermal conditions. However, thermal effects could reverse its
direction, potentially saving planets in the inner, optically thick parts of
the protoplanetary disc. This effect has been seen for masses larger than 5
Earth masses, but the minimum mass for this to happen has never been probed
numerically, although it is of crucial importance for planet formation
scenarios. We have extended the hydro-dynamical code FARGO to 3D, with thermal
diffusion. With this code, we perform simulations of embedded planets down to 2
Earth masses. For a set of discs parameters for which outward migration has
been shown in the range of $[5, 35]$ Earth masses, we find that the transition
to inward migration occurs for masses in the range $[3, 5]$ Earth masses. The
transition appears to be due to an unexpected phenomenon: the formation of an
asymmetric cold and dense finger of gas driven by circulation and libration
streamlines. We recover this phenomenon in 2D simulations where we control the
cooling effects of the gas through a simple modeling of the energy equation.

New effects related to the finite velocity of the diffusion process are
predicted, that can partially explain the strange behavior associated to
adsorption phenomenon. For sake of simplicity, the analysis is performed by
considering a sample in the shape of a slab limited by two perfectly blocking
surfaces, in such a manner that the problem is one-dimensional in the space.
Two cases are investigated. In the former, the initial distribution of the
diffusing particles is assumed of gaussian type, centered around the symmetry
surface in the middle of the sample. In the latter, the initial distribution is
localized close to the limiting surfaces. In both cases, we show that the
evolution toward to the equilibrium distribution is not monotonic. In
particular, close to the limiting surfaces the bulk density of diffusing
particles present maxima and minima related to the finite velocity of the
diffusion process connected to the second order time derivative in the partial
differential equation describing the evolution of the bulk density in the

at an average angular resolution of ~10 arcsec (22 arcsec for the 6_K-5_K
lines), as part of a new 2D line survey of this region using the IRAM 30m
telescope. These fully sampled maps show extended emission from warm gas to the
northeast of IRc2 and the distinct kinematic signatures of the hot core and
compact ridge source components. We have constructed population diagrams for
the four sets of K-ladder emission lines at each position in the maps and have
derived rotational excitation temperatures and total beam-averaged column
densities from the fitted slopes. In addition, we have fitted LVG model spectra
to the observations to determine best-fit physical parameters at each map
position, yielding the distribution of kinetic temperatures across the region.
The resulting temperature maps reveal a region of hot (T > 350 K) material
surrounding the northeastern edge of the hot core, whereas the column density
distribution is more uniform and peaks near the position of IRc2. We attribute
this region of hot gas to shock heating caused by the impact of outflowing
material from active star formation in the region, as indicated by the presence
of broad CH3CN lines. This scenario is consistent with predictions from C-shock
chemical models that suggest that gas-phase methyl cyanide survives in the
post-shock gas and can be somewhat enhanced due to sputtering of grain mantles
in the passing shock front.

polynomial annihilation to assign function values to different regions and thus
seed an automated labeling procedure, followed by a refinement phase that
adaptively updates a kernel support vector machine representation of the
separating surface via active learning. The overall approach avoids structured
grids and exploits any available simplicity in the geometry of the separating
surface, thus reducing the number of model evaluations required to localize the

improved scaling and efficiency over other discontinuity localization

deduced by means of the kinetic equation at the interface. The predicted
non-monotonic behavior of the surface density versus the time is in agreement
with experimental observations reported in the literature, and is related to
the finite velocity of propagation of the density variations.

occurs at a higher packing fraction $\phi_J$ than observed in compression. A
growing relaxation time and translational correlation length is found as $\phi$
increases towards $\phi_J$. We consider the orientational ordering and rotation
of particles induced by the shear flow. Both nematic and tetratic ordering are
found, but these decrease as $\phi$ increases to $\phi_J$. At the jamming
transition, the nematic ordering further decreases, while the tetratic ordering
increases, but the orientational correlation lengths remain small throughout.
The average angular velocity of the particles is found to increase as $\phi$
increases, saturating to a plateau just below $\phi_J$, but then increasing
again as $\phi$ increases above $\phi_J$.

decomposition as a finite union of disjoint max-plus cones. These cones can be
interpreted as faces of several max-plus hyperplanes. Briec-Horvath proved that
the closure of a max-plus hemispace is bounded by a max-plus hyperplane. Given
a hyperplane, we give a simple condition for the assignment of the faces
between a pair of complementary max-plus hemispaces. Our result allows for
counting and enumeration of the associated max-plus hemispaces. We recall that
an n-dimensional max-plus hyperplane is called strictly affine and
nondegenerate if it has a linear equation that contains all variables
x_1,x_2,...,x_n and a free term. We prove that the number of max-plus
hemispaces in R^n_max, supported by strictly affine nondegenerate hyperplanes
centered in the origin, is twice the n-th ordered Bell number. Our work can be
viewed as a complement to the recent results of Katz-Nitica-Sergeev, who
described generating sets for max-plus hemispaces, and the results of
Briec-Horvath, who proved that closed/open max-plus hemispaces are max-plus

the intra-system couplings. In particular, we obtain the well-known quantum
oscillations of the site populations. We determine the exciton transfer
efficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment. While
the majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath, we
address the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and
examine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy
transfer efficiency. We find that, for the vibronic frequencies below 16 meV,
the exciton transfer is drastically suppressed. We attribute this effect to the
formation of ""polaronic states"" where the exciton is transferred back and forth
between the two pigments with the absorption/emission of the vibronic quanta,
instead of proceeding to the reaction center. The same effect suppresses the
