LiCrGe$_2$O$_6$ is studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, neutron diffraction, as well as
low-field and high-field magnetization measurements. In contrast with earlier
reports, we find that the two compounds feature remarkably different, albeit
non-frustrated magnetic models. In LiCrSi$_2$O$_6$, two relevant exchange
integrals, $J_1 \simeq$ 9 K along the structural chains and $J_{\text{ic1}}$
$\simeq$ 2 K between the chains, form a 2D anisotropic honeycomb lattice. In
contrast, the spin model of LiCrGe$_2$O$_6$ is constituted of three different
exchange couplings. Surprisingly, the leading exchange $J_{\text{ic1}}$
$\simeq$ 2.3 K operates between the chains, while $J_1$ $\simeq$ 1.2 K is about
two times smaller. The additional interlayer coupling $J_{\text{ic2}}$ $\simeq$
$J_1$ renders this model 3D. QMC simulations reveal excellent agreement between
our magnetic models and the available experimental data. Underlying mechanisms
of the exchange couplings, magnetostructural correlations, as well as
implications for other pyroxene systems are discussed.

general class of rank-structured matrices are $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices: they
can reach the optimal order of complexity, but are still general enough for a
large number of practical applications. We consider algorithms for performing
algebraic operations with $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices, i.e., for approximating the
matrix product, inverse or factorizations in almost linear complexity. The new
approach is based on local low-rank updates that can be performed in linear
complexity. These updates can be combined with a recursive procedure to
approximate the product of two $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices, and these products can
be used to approximate the matrix inverse and the LR or Cholesky factorization.
Numerical experiments indicate that the new method leads to preconditioners
that require $\mathcal{O}(n)$ units of storage, can be evaluated in
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ operations, and take $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ operations to set
up.

self-sustaining turbulence with a mean flow as well as structural and dynamical

large arrays of well-controlled circular model wounds within an epithelium at
confluence, without injuring any cells. We propose a physical model that takes
into account border forces, friction with the substrate, and tissue rheology.
Despite the presence of a contractile actomyosin cable at the periphery of the
wound, epithelization was mostly driven by border protrusive activity. Closure
dynamics was quantified by an epithelization coefficient $D = \sigma_p/\xi$
defined as the ratio of the border protrusive stress $\sigma_p$ to the friction

broader point of view would enable investigators to better understand the
relations between entities that exist in different processes. Therefore,
relating a possible perturbation to several known processes represents a new
approach to this field of study. We propose to use a network representation of
metabolism in terms of reactants, enzyme and metabolite. To model these systems
it is possible to describe both reactions and relations among enzymes and
metabolites. In this way, analysis of the impact of changes in some metabolites

Results: We release the MetaboX library, an open source PHP framework for

bipartite enzyme-metabolite and unipartite enzyme networks. These networks can
be exported in different formats for data visualization with standard tools. As

hierarchy of approximations of different resolution, whereas the latter gives
an efficient way to estimate quantities of interest using samples on different
levels. The number of basis functions in the online GMsFEM stage can be varied
to determine the solution resolution and the computational cost, and to
efficiently generate samples at different levels. In particular, it is cheap to
generate samples on coarse grids but with low resolution, and it is expensive
to generate samples on fine grids with high accuracy. By suitably choosing the
number of samples at different levels, one can leverage the expensive
computation in larger fine-grid spaces toward smaller coarse-grid spaces, while
retaining the accuracy of the final Monte Carlo estimate. Further, we describe
a multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which sequentially screens the
proposal with different levels of approximations and reduces the number of
evaluations required on fine grids, while combining the samples at different
levels to arrive at an accurate estimate. The framework seamlessly integrates
the multiscale features of the GMsFEM with the multilevel feature of the MLMC
methods following the work in \cite{ketelson2013}, and our numerical
experiments illustrate its efficiency and accuracy in comparison with standard
Monte Carlo estimates.

  arXiv:1312.4046",,,,"math.DG math.AG math.AP math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In real algebraic geometry, Lojasiewicz's theorem asserts that any integral
curve of the gradient flow of an analytic function that has an accumulation
point has a unique limit. Lojasiewicz proved this result in the early 1960s as
a consequence of his gradient inequality.
  Many problems in calculus of variations are questions about critical points
or gradient flow lines of an infinite dimensional functional. Perhaps
surprisingly, even blowups at singularities of many nonlinear PDE's can, in a
certain sense, be thought of as limits of infinite dimensional gradient flows
of analytic functionals. Thus, the question of uniqueness of blowups can be
approached as an infinite dimensional version of Lojasiewicz's theorem. The
question of uniqueness of blowups is perhaps the most fundamental question
about singularities.
  This approach to uniqueness was pioneered by Leon Simon thirty years ago for
the area functional and many related functionals using an elaborate reduction
to a finite dimensional setting where Lojasiewicz's arguments applied.
  Recently, the authors proved two new infinite dimensional Lojasiewicz
inequalities at noncompact singularities where it was well-known that a
reduction to Lojasiewicz's arguments is not possible, but instead entirely new
techniques are required. As a consequence, the authors settled a major
long-standing open question about uniqueness of blowups for mean curvature flow
at all generic singularities and for mean convex mean curvature flow at all
singularities. Using this, the authors have obtained a rather complete
description of the space-time singular set for MCF with generic singularities.
In particular, the singular set of a MCF in $\bf{R}^{n+1}$ with only generic
singularities is contained in finitely many compact Lipschitz submanifolds of
dimension at most $n-1$ together with a set of dimension at most $n-2$.

supernovae (SNe Ia) to study the uncertainties inherent to NIR K corrections.
To do so, 75 previously published NIR spectra of 33 SNe Ia are employed to
determine K-correction uncertainties in the YJHK_s passbands as a function of
temporal phase and redshift. The resultant K corrections are then fed into an
interpolation algorithm that provides mean K corrections as a function of
temporal phase and robust estimates of the associated errors. These
uncertainties are both statistical and intrinsic --- i.e., due to the diversity
of spectral features from object to object --- and must be included in the
overall error budget of cosmological parameters constrained through the use of
NIR observations of SNe Ia. Intrinsic variations are likely the dominant source
of error for all four passbands at maximum light. Given the present data, the
total Y-band K-correction uncertainties at maximum are smallest, amounting to
+/- 0.04 mag at a redshift of z = 0.08. The J-band K-term errors are also
reasonably small (+/- 0.06 mag), but intrinsic variations of spectral features
and noise introduced by telluric corrections in the H band currently limit the
total K-correction errors at maximum to +/- 0.10 mag at z = 0.08. Finally,
uncertainties in the K_s-band K terms at maximum amount to +/- 0.07 mag at this
same redshift. These results are largely constrained by the small number of

block distribution is a parsimonious multinomial distribution where the few

remaining probability mass is uniformly spread over the other modality
crossings. Thus, the proposed model allows to bring out the intra-class

Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler to overcome the computational intractability of
the block structure search. As this approach involves the computation of the

continuous parameters and approximated for the discrete ones) which avoids the

The proposed singular layer uses the singular value decomposition of the
Gaussian quantum channel, which yields an additional degree of freedom for the
phase space transmission. This additional degree of freedom can further be
exploited in a multiple-access scenario. The singular layer defines the
eigenchannels of the Gaussian physical link, which can be used for the
simultaneous reliable transmission of multiple user data streams. Our
transmission model also includes the singular interference avoider (SIA)
precoding scheme. The proposed SIA precoding scheme prevents the eigenchannel
interference to reach an optimal transmission over a Gaussian link. We
demonstrate the results through the adaptive multicarrier quadrature
division-multiuser quadrature allocation (AMQD-MQA) CVQKD multiple-access

examples that such changes in the potential can significantly modify the
inflationary dynamics. Our results have immediate implications for effective
descriptions of inflation derived from string theory, where higher-derivative
kinetic terms are generally present. In addition we elucidate the structure of
the theory in the parameter range where there are three real solutions to the
auxiliary field's equation of motion, studying the resulting three branches of
the theory, and finding that one of them suffers from a singularity in the
speed of propagation of fluctuations.

integral domain and which splits over the fraction field of this ring are
generically trivial, i.e., they are trivial in an open neighborhood of the
generic point of the spectrum of the base ring. This generalizes a classical
result by Brauer in modular representation theory of finite groups. We
furthermore show that this is true precisely on an open set in case all fibers

defines a new discriminant of such algebras which generalizes Schur elements of

In an intermediate volume fraction crossover regime, the local cage process is

super-Arrhenius collective barrier is more strongly dependent on volume
fraction, dominates the highly viscous regime, and is well described by a
nonsingular law below jamming. The increase of the collective barrier is
determined by the amplitude of thermal density fluctuations, shear modulus or

quantitatively address in a unified manner the alpha relaxation time over 14 or
more decades. The theory has no singularities above zero Kelvin, and relaxation
in the equilibrium low temperature limit is predicted to be of a roughly
Arrhenius form. The two-barrier (local cage and long range collective elastic)
description results in a rich dynamic behavior including apparent Arrhenius,
narrow crossover and deeply supercooled regimes, and multiple characteristic or
crossover times and temperatures of clear physical meaning. Application of the
theory to nonpolar molecules, alcohols, rare gases and liquids metals is
carried out. Overall, the agreement with experiment is quite good for the
temperature dependence of the alpha time, plateau shear modulus and Boson-like
peak frequency for van der Waals liquids, though less so for hydrogen-bonding
molecules. The theory predicts multiple growing length scales upon cooling,
which reflect distinct aspects of the coupled local hopping and cooperative
elastic physics. Calculations of an activation volume that grows with cooling,
which is correlated with a measure of dynamic cooperativity, agree
quantitatively with experiment. Comparisons with elastic, entropy crisis,
dynamic facilitation and other approaches are performed, and a fundamental
basis for empirically-extracted crossover temperatures is established. The

that the modified ADMM method has an optimal convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(s\log d/T)$, where $s$ is the sparsity level, $d$ is the data

bounds for sparse estimation. For matrix decomposition into sparse and low rank
components, we provide the first guarantees for any online method, and prove a
convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((s+r)\beta^2(p) /T) +
\mathcal{O}(1/p)$ for a $p\times p$ matrix, where $s$ is the sparsity level,
$r$ is the rank and $\Theta(\sqrt{p})\leq \beta(p)\leq \Theta(p)$. Our
guarantees match the minimax lower bound with respect to $s,r$ and $T$. In
addition, we match the minimax lower bound with respect to the matrix dimension
$p$, i.e. $\beta(p)=\Theta(\sqrt{p})$, for many important statistical models
including the independent noise model, the linear Bayesian network and the
latent Gaussian graphical model under some conditions. Our ADMM method is based
on epoch-based annealing and consists of inexpensive steps which involve
projections on to simple norm balls. Experiments show that for both sparse
optimization and matrix decomposition problems, our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we reach higher accuracy with same

there is a crossover regime. Based on a finite-size scaling analysis and

properties of CE random matrices. Consequently, the Floquet Hamiltonian is
nonlocal and has multi-body interactions; and the driving leads to the
equivalent of an infinite temperature state at long times. These results are

star-forming galaxies, but there is still little theoretical progress in
modelling their physical properties. We predict nebular emission from
star-forming galaxies within a cosmological galaxy formation model. Emission
lines are computed by combining the semi-analytical model \sag\ with the
photoionisation code \mapp. We characterise the interstellar medium (ISM) of
galaxies by relating the ionisation parameter of gas in galaxies to their cold
gas metallicity, obtaining a reasonable agreement with the observed \ha, \oii,
\oiii\ luminosity functions, and the the BPT diagram for local star-forming
galaxies. The average ionisation parameter is found to increase towards low
star-formation rates and high redshifts, consistent with recent observational
results. The predicted link between different emission lines and their
associated star-formation rates is studied by presenting scaling relations to
relate them. Our model predicts that emission line galaxies have modest
clustering bias, and thus reside in dark matter haloes of masses below $M_{\rm
halo} \lesssim 10^{12} {[\rm h^{-1} M_{\odot}]}$. Finally, we exploit our
modelling technique to predict galaxy number counts up to $z\sim 10$ by
targeting far-infrared (FIR) emission lines detectable with submillimetre
facilities

(RSGs). These stars have observed mass-loss rates that span more than two
orders of magnitude, from $< 10^{-6}$ solar masses yr$^{-1}$ to almost $
10^{-4} $ solar masses yr$^{-1}$. Thermal bremsstrahlung X-ray emission from at
least some IIP's should reflect the larger end of the high mass-loss rates.
Strangely, no IIP SNe are seen where the X-ray luminosity is large enough to
suggest mass-loss rates greater than about $ 10^{-5} $ solar masses yr$^{-1}$.
We investigate if this could be due to absorption of the X-ray emission. After
carefully studying all the various aspects, we conclude that absorption would
not be large enough to prevent us from having detected X-ray emission from high
mass-loss rate IIP's. This leads us to the conclusion that there may be an
upper limit of $\sim 10^{-5} $ solar masses yr$^{-1}$ to the mass-loss rate of
Type IIP progenitors, and therefore to the luminosity of RSGs that explode to
form Type IIPs. This is turn suggests an upper limit of $\leq 19 $ solar masses
for the progenitor mass of a Type IIP SN. This limit is close to that obtained
by direct detection of IIP progenitors, as well as that suggested by recent
stellar evolution calculations. Although the statistics need to be improved,
many current indicators support the notion that RSGs above $\sim 19 $ solar
masses do not explode to form Type IIP SNe.

The best matches recover the infrared luminosity and the star formation rate of

from simulations of more massive galaxies. The most morphologically distorted

  - Even the weakest notion of individual rationality restricts the set of
solutions to be equilibria. This observation holds for all types of solutions:
in pure-strategies, in mixed strategies, and in correlated strategies where the
corresponding notions of equilibria are pure-Nash, Nash and coarse-correlated.
  An action profile is (strict) simultaneous maximizer if it simultaneously
globally (strictly) maximizes the payoffs of all players.
  - If we require that a simultaneous maximizer (if it exists) will be a
solution, then the solution contains the set of pure Nash equilibria.
  - There is no solution for which a strict simultaneous maximizer (if it
exists) is the unique solution.

a new method that produces measurements with greater reliability and accuracy
by fitting multiple modes simultaneously. We demonstrate how this method
permits measurements of sub-surface flows deeper into the Sun while providing
higher uniformity in data coverage and velocity response closer to the limb of

from the design idea of a popular class of quantum algorithms, namely quantum
walk-based algorithms. The generality of this paradigm is guaranteed by the
universality of quantum walks as a computational model. A new quantum
programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of
superposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of
Dijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL
splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation
(of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced
in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct
for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs.
  The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new
mathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions.
Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived.
Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming
paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily
defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices
and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local
variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be
used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive
power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and
generalizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum
alternation and quantum choice. We believe that quantum programming with
quantum alternation and choice will play an important role in further
exploiting the power of quantum computing.

depletion in water and carbon monoxide vapors inside the water's iceline with
carbon monoxide depleting slower than water. This effect increases the gaseous
C/O and decreases the C/H ratio in this region to values similar to those found
in WASP 12b's day side atmosphere. Giant planets whose envelopes were accreted
inside the water's iceline should then display C/O values larger than those of
their parent stars, making them members of the class of so-called ``carbon-rich

from its current position to the target position while avoiding any collision
with the en-route obstacles, and the appropriate obstacle avoidance strategies
are the key factors to ensure safe navigation tasks in dynamic environments. In
this report, three different obstacle avoidance strategies for safe navigation
in dynamic environments have been presented. The biologically-inspired
navigation algorithm (BINA) is efficient in terms of avoidance time. The
equidistant based navigation algorithm (ENA) is able to achieve navigation task
with in uncertain dynamic environments. The navigation algorithm algorithm
based on an integrated environment representation (NAIER) allows the object to
seek a safe path through obstacles in unknown dynamic environment in a
human-like fashion. The performances and features of the proposed navigation
algorithms are confirmed by extensive simulation results and experiments with a
real non-holonomic mobile robot. The algorithms have been implemented on two
real control systems: intelligent wheelchair and robotic hospital bed. The
performance of the proposed algorithms with SAM and Flexbed demonstrate their
capabilities to achieve navigation tasks in complicated real time scenarios.
The proposed algorithms are easy to be implemented in real time and costly
efficient. An extra study on networked multi-robots formation building
algorithm is presented in this paper. A constructive and easy-to-implement
decentralised control is proposed for a formation building of a group of random
positioned objects. Furthermore, the problem of formation building with
anonymous objects is addressed. This randomised decentralised navigation
algorithm achieves the convergence to a desired configuration with probability

coordinating access to a shared resource. A good backoff protocol should,
arguably, satisfy three natural properties: (i) it should provide constant
throughput, wasting as little time as possible; (ii) it should require few
failed access attempts, minimizing the amount of wasted effort; and (iii) it
should be robust, continuing to work efficiently even if some of the access
attempts fail for spurious reasons. Unfortunately, exponential backoff has some
well-known limitations in two of these areas: it provides poor (sub-constant)
throughput (in the worst case), and is not robust (to resource acquisition
failures).
  The goal of this paper is to ""fix"" exponential backoff by making it scalable,
particularly focusing on the case where processes arrive in an on-line,
worst-case fashion. We present a relatively simple backoff
protocol~Re-Backoff~that has, at its heart, a version of exponential backoff.
It guarantees expected constant throughput with dynamic process arrivals and
requires only an expected polylogarithmic number of access attempts per
process.
  Re-Backoff is also robust to periods where the shared resource is unavailable
for a period of time. If it is unavailable for $D$ time slots, Re-Backoff
provides the following guarantees. When the number of packets is a finite $n$,
the average expected number of access attempts for successfully sending a
packet is $O(\log^2( n + D))$. In the infinite case, the average expected
number of access attempts for successfully sending a packet is $O( \log^2(\eta)
+ \log^2(D) )$ where $\eta$ is the maximum number of processes that are ever in
the system concurrently.

phase of the Iron-based superconductors by applying a group theoretical
analysis on a realistic five-band model. We find the orbital order can be
either of the inter-orbital s-wave form or the intra-orbital d-wave form. From
the comparison with existing ARPES measurements of band splitting, we find the
orbital ordering in the 122 system is dominated by an intra-orbital d-wave
component, while that in the 111 system is dominated by an inter-orbital s-wave
component. We find both forms of orbital order are strongly entangled with the
nematicity in the spin correlation of the system. The condensation energy of
the magnetic ordered phase is found to be significantly improved(by more than
20 percents) when the degeneracy between the $(\pi,0)$ and $(0,\pi)$ ordering
pattern is lifted by the orbital order. We argue there should be large
difference in both the scattering rate and the size of the possible pseudogap
on the electron pocket around the $\mathrm{X}=(\pi,0)$ and $\mathrm{Y}=(0,\pi)$
point in the electronic nematic phase. We propose this as a possible origin for
the observed nematicity in resistivity measurements.

ratio in terms of the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations. Our
approach avoids several of the largest sources of uncertainty in existing
techniques. By focusing on mid-IR wavelengths, we gain a virtually dust
extinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dust
model to correctly interpret optical or optical/NIR colors normally leveraged
to assign M/L. By calibrating a new relation between NIR and mid-IR colors of
GLIMPSE giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for the
[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecular
line opacities. We find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarily
by metallicity, provides a tight constraint on M/L_3.6, which varies
intrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. The uncertainty on M/L_3.6 of
~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvement
on existing techniques for estimating the stellar M/L with shorter wavelength
data. A single M/L_3.6=0.6 (assuming a Chabrier IMF), independent of
[3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to old,
metal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (or
better) accuracy (~0.1 dex) as alternatives. We expect our M/L_3.6 to be
optimal for mapping the stellar mass distributions in S4G galaxies, for which
we have developed an Independent Component Analysis technique to first isolate
the old stellar light at 3.6 micron from non-stellar emission (e.g. hot dust
and the 3.3 PAH feature). Our estimate can also be used to determine the
fractional contribution of non-stellar emission to global (rest-frame) 3.6
micron fluxes, e.g. in WISE imaging, and establishes a reliable basis for
exploring variations in the stellar IMF.

  In 2013, Cameron and Killpatrick gave the inversion generating function for
Fibonacci tableaux which are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of

a set of five or fewer consecutive permutation patterns. In addition, we
introduce the more general notion of a strip tableaux which are a useful
combinatorial object for studying consecutive pattern avoidance. We go on to
give the inversion generating functions for all but one of the cases where
$\Pi$ is a subset of three consecutive permutation patterns and we give several

  Bifurcations in Gene Expressions and Regulation of Networks Structures",,,,,"q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Search for possible relationships between phylogeny and ontogeny is one of
the most important issues in the field of evolutionary developmental biology.
By representing developmental dynamics of spatially located cells with gene
expression dynamics with cell-to-cell interaction under external morphogen
gradient, evolved are gene regulation networks under mutation and selection
with the fitness to approach a prescribed spatial pattern of expressed genes.
For most of thousands of numerical evolution experiments, evolution of pattern
over generations and development of pattern by an evolved network exhibit
remarkable congruence. Here, both the pattern dynamics consist of several
epochs to form successive stripe formations between quasi-stationary regimes.
In evolution, the regimes are generations needed to hit relevant mutations,
while in development, they are due to the emergence of slowly varying
expression that controls the pattern change. Successive pattern changes are
thus generated, which are regulated by successive combinations of feedback or
feedforward regulations under the upstream feedforward network that reads the
morphogen gradient. By using a pattern generated by the upstream feedforward
network as a boundary condition, downstream networks form later stripe
patterns. These epochal changes in development and evolution are represented as
same bifurcations in dynamical-systems theory, and this agreement of
bifurcations lead to the evolution-development congruences. Violation of the
evolution-development congruence, observed exceptionally, is shown to be
originated in alteration of the boundary due to mutation at the upstream
feedforward network. Our results provide a new look on developmental stages,
punctuated equilibrium, developmental bottlenecks, and evolutionary acquisition
of novelty in morphogenesis.

properties are induced in a normal conductor that is in contact with an
intrinsically superconducting material. In particular, the combination of
nano-structured semiconductors with bulk superconductors is of interest because
these systems can host unconventional electronic excitations such as Majorana
fermions when the semiconductor's charge carriers are subject to a large
spin-orbit coupling. The latter requirement generally favors the use of
hole-doped semiconductors. On the other hand, basic symmetry considerations
imply that states from typical simple-metal superconductors will predominantly
couple to a semiconductor's conduction-band states and, therefore, in the first
instance generate a proximity effect for band electrons rather than holes. In
this article, we show how the superconducting correlations in the conduction
band are transferred also to hole states in the valence band by virtue of
inter-band coupling. A general theory of the superconducting proximity effect
for bulk and low-dimensional hole systems is presented. The interplay of
inter-band coupling and quantum confinement is found to result in unusual
wave-vector dependencies of the induced superconducting gap parameters. One
particularly appealing consequence is the density tunability of the proximity
effect in hole quantum wells and nanowires, which creates new possibilities for
manipulating the transition to nontrivial topological phases in these systems.

evaluate the effect of the relative scale factor, RSF, (ratio of gear

describe a Parallel Force/Velocity Actuator (PFVA) based on a
Dual-Input-Single- Output (DISO) epicyclic gear train. We then present an
analytical formulation for the variation of the dynamic coupling term w.r.t.
RSF. Conclusions from this formulation are illustrated through a numerical
example involving a 1-DOF four-bar linkage. It is shown, both analytically and
numerically, that as we increase the RSF, the two inputs to the PFVA are
decoupled w.r.t. the inertia torques. This understanding can serve as an
important design guideline for PFVAs. The paper also presents two limitations
of this study and suggests future work based on these caveats.

the rotation measure of the M 87 core to be between $-$7.5$\times$10$^{5}$ and
3.4$\times$10$^{5}$ rad/m$^{2}$. Assuming a density profile of the accretion
flow that follows a power-law distribution and a magnetic field that is
ordered, radial, and has equipartition strength, the limit on the rotation
measure constrains the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ to be below
9.2$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of 21 Schwarzchild
radii from the central black hole. This value is at least two orders of
magnitude smaller than the Bondi accretion rate, suggesting significant
suppression of the accretion rate in the inner region of the accretion flow.
Consequently, our result disfavors the classical \emph{advection dominated
accretion flow} (ADAF) and prefers the \emph{adiabatic inflow-outflow solution}

analysis of a long-term (1989-2004) spectropolarimetric survey of 9 additional
classical Be stars, including systems exhibiting evidence of partial
disk-loss/disk-growth episodes as well as systems exhibiting long-term stable
disks. After carefully characterizing and removing the interstellar
polarization along the line of sight to each of these targets, we analyze their
intrinsic polarization behavior. We find that many steady-state Be disks pause
at the top of the PCD, as predicted by theory. We also observe sharp declines
in the Balmer jump polarization for later spectral type, near edge-on
steady-state disks, again as recently predicted by theory, likely caused when
the base density of the disk is very high, and the outer region of the edge-on
disk starts to self absorb a significant number of Balmer jump photons. The
intrinsic $V$-band polarization and polarization position angle of $\gamma$ Cas
exhibits variations that seem to phase with the orbital period of a known
one-armed density structure in this disk, similar to the theoretical
predictions of Halonen & Jones. We also observe stochastic jumps in the
intrinsic polarization across the Balmer jump of several known Be+sdO systems,
and speculate that the thermal inflation of part of the outer region of these
disks could be responsible for producing this observational phenomenon.
Finally, we estimate the base densities of this sample of stars to be between

with the barycentric velocity of the mixture. This leads to evolution equations
for the total density, momentum, the differential velocity between the dust and
the gas phases and either the dust-to-gas ratio or the dust fraction. The
equations are similar to the usual equations of gas dynamics, providing a
convenient way to extend existing codes to simulate two-fluid mixtures without
modifying the code architecture. Our approach avoids the inherent difficulties
related to the standard approach where the two phases are separate and coupled
via a drag term. In particular, the requirements of infinite spatial and
temporal resolution as the stopping time tends to zero are no longer necessary.
This means that both small and large grains can be straightforwardly treated
with the same method, with no need for complicated implicit schemes. Since
there is only one resolution scale the method also avoids the problem of
unphysical trapping of one fluid (e.g. dust) below the resolution of the other.
We also derive a simplified set of equations applicable to the case of strong
drag/small grains, consisting of the standard fluid equations with a modified
sound speed, plus an advection-diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio.
This provides a simple and fast way to evolve the mixture when the stopping
time is smaller than the Courant timestep. We present a Smoothed Particle

one-fluid dusty gas algorithm using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The
algorithm preserves the conservation properties of the SPH formalism. In
particular, the total gas and dust mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy
are all exactly conserved. Shock viscosity and conductivity terms are
generalised to handle the two-phase mixture accordingly. The algorithm is
benchmarked against a comprehensive suit of problems: dustybox, dustywave,
dustyshock and dustyoscill, each of them addressing different properties of the
method. We compare the performance of the one-fluid algorithm to the standard
two-fluid approach. The one-fluid algorithm is found to solve both of the
fundamental limitations of the two- fluid algorithm: it is no longer possible
to concentrate dust below the resolution of the gas (they have the same
resolution by definition), and the spatial resolution criterion h < csts,
required in two-fluid codes to avoid over-damping of kinetic energy, is
unnecessary. Implicit time stepping is straightforward. As a result, the
algorithm is up to ten billion times more efficient for 3D simulations of small
grains. Additional benefits include the use of half as many particles, a single
kernel and fewer SPH interpolations. The only limitation is that it does not
capture multi-streaming of dust in the limit of zero coupling, suggesting that
in this case a hybrid approach may be required.

merely rescaling the particle's free motion with the obstacle density, while
slow obstacle dynamics results in particle motion that is more singularly
related to its free motion and preserves the negative differential mobility
already seen at $\gamma=0$. In more general terms that we also illustrate using
one-dimensional random walkers, the mobility transition is between the
time-scales of the quasi-stationary regime and that of the fluid limit.

perturbations requires to find equilibrium correlation function of the
responding system variable in the absence of external perturbations. Studies of
the response of the systems exhibiting anomalously slow dynamics are often
based on the continuous time random walk description (CTRW) with divergent mean
waiting times. The bulk of the literature on anomalous response contains linear
response functions like one by Cole-Cole calculated from such a CTRW theory and
applied to thermal systems. Here we show within a fairly simple and general
model that for the systems with divergent mean waiting times the stationary
response is absent, in accordance with some recent studies. The absence of
stationary response at thermal equilibrium (or dying to zero non-stationary
response in aging experiments) would confirm CTRW with divergent mean waiting
times as underlying physical relaxation mechanism, but reject it otherwise. We
show that the absence of stationary response is closely related to the breaking
of ergodicity of the corresponding dynamical variable. As an important new
result, we derive a generalized Cole-Cole response within ergodic CTRW dynamics
with finite waiting time. Moreover, we provide a physically reasonable
explanation of the origin and wide presence of 1/f noise in condensed systems
for ergodic dynamics close to normal, rather than mostly deviating.

extreme horizontal branch. About half of the known sdB stars are found in close
binaries. Their short orbital periods of 1.2 h to a few days suggest that they
are post common-envelope systems. Eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries are rare, but
important to determine the fundamental stellar parameters. Low-mass companions
are identified by the reflection effect. In most cases the companion is a main
sequence star near the stellar mass limit. Here we report the discovery of an
eclipsing hot subdwarf binary SDSS J162256.66+473051.1 (J1622) of very short
orbital period (0.0697 d), found in the course of the MUCHFUSS project. The
lightcurve shows grazing eclipses and a prominent reflection effect. An
analysis of the light- and radial velocity (RV) curves indicated a mass ratio
of $q=$ 0.1325, an RV semiamplitude $K=47.2\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$, and an inclination
of $i=72.33^\circ$. We show that a companion mass of 0.064 $M_{\rm \odot}$,
well below the hydrogen-burning limit, is the most plausible solution, which
implies a mass close to the canonical mass (0.47 $M_{\rm \odot}$) of the sdB
star. Therefore, the companion is a brown dwarf, which not only survived the
engulfment by the red-giant envelope, but also triggered its ejection, and
enabled the sdB star to form. The rotation of J1622 is expected to be tidally
locked to the orbit. However, J1622 rotates too slowly ($v_{\rm rot}=74.5\pm
7\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$) to be synchronized, challenging tidal interaction models.

the interference generated at other receivers which generally leads to
inefficient performance of the links. To improve this situation, we study
cooperation between the links using coalitional games. The players (links) in a
coalition either perform zero forcing transmission or Wiener filter precoding
to each other. The $\epsilon$-core is a solution concept for coalitional games
which takes into account the overhead required in coalition deviation. We
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong and weak
$\epsilon$-core of our coalitional game not to be empty with zero forcing
transmission. Since, the $\epsilon$-core only considers the possibility of
joint cooperation of all links, we study coalitional games in partition form in
which several distinct coalitions can form. We propose a polynomial time
distributed coalition formation algorithm based on coalition merging and prove
that its solution lies in the coalition structure stable set of our coalition
formation game. Simulation results reveal the cooperation gains for different
coalition formation complexities and deviation overhead models.

forces are not sufficient to break detailed balance, i.e. cannot produce a
motor effect. We discuss two possibile mechanisms to elude this problem. A
first possibility, exploited in several models inspired to recent experiments,
is to replace the heat bath's white noise by a ``collisional noise'', that is
the effect of random collisions with an external equilibrium gas of particles.
A second possibility is enlarging the phase space, e.g. by adding an external
potential which couples velocity to position, as in a Klein-Kramers equation.
In both cases, non-linear friction becomes sufficient to achieve a
non-equilibrium steady state and, in the presence of an even small spatial
asymmetry, a motor effect is produced.

one can differentiate between imitation processes and aspiration-driven
dynamics. In the former case, individuals imitate the strategy of a more
successful peer. In the latter case, individuals adjust their strategies based
on a comparison of their payoffs from the evolutionary game to a value they
aspire, called the level of aspiration. Unlike imitation processes of pairwise
comparison, aspiration-driven updates do not require additional information
about the strategic environment and can thus be interpreted as being more
spontaneous. Recent work has mainly focused on understanding how aspiration
dynamics alter the evolutionary outcome in structured populations. However, the
baseline case for understanding strategy selection is the well-mixed population
case, which is still lacking sufficient understanding. We explore how
aspiration-driven strategy-update dynamics under imperfect rationality
influence the average abundance of a strategy in multi-player evolutionary
games with two strategies. We analytically derive a condition under which a
strategy is more abundant than the other in the weak selection limiting case.
This approach has a long standing history in evolutionary game and is mostly
applied for its mathematical approachability. Hence, we also explore strong
selection numerically, which shows that our weak selection condition is a
robust predictor of the average abundance of a strategy. The condition turns
out to differ from that of a wide class of imitation dynamics, as long as the
game is not dyadic. Therefore a strategy favored under imitation dynamics can
be disfavored under aspiration dynamics. This does not require any population
structure thus highlights the intrinsic difference between imitation and
aspiration dynamics.

4-3, and 5-4) of both optically thick (HCN, HCO$^+$) as well as optically thin
(N$_2$H$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$) molecules using constant abundance laws. We find
that less than 50% of simulated (1-0) transition lines show blue infall
asymmetries due to obscuration by the surrounding filament. However, the
fraction of collapsing cores that have a blue asymmetric emission line profile
rises to 90% when observed in the (4-3) transition. Since the densest gas
towards the collapsing core can excite higher rotational states, upper level
transitions are more likely to produce blue asymmetric emission profiles. We
conclude that even in irregular, embedded cores one can trace infalling gas
motions with blue asymmetric line profiles of optically thick lines by
observing higher transitions. The best tracer of collapse motions of our sample
is the (4-3) transition of HCN, but the (3-2) and (5-4) transitions of both HCN

line-search methods on the real-algebraic variety $\mathcal{M}_{\le k}$ of real
$m \times n$ matrices of rank at most $k$. Such methods extend Riemannian
optimization methods, which are successfully used on the smooth manifold
$\mathcal{M}_k$ of rank-$k$ matrices, to its closure by taking steps along
gradient-related directions in the tangent cone, and afterwards projecting back
to $\mathcal{M}_{\le k}$. Considering such a method circumvents the
difficulties which arise from the nonclosedness and the unbounded curvature of
$\mathcal{M}_k$. The pointwise convergence is obtained for real-analytic
functions on the basis of a \L{}ojasiewicz inequality for the projection of the
antigradient to the tangent cone. If the derived limit point lies on the smooth
part of $\mathcal{M}_{\le k}$, i.e. in $\mathcal{M}_k$, this boils down to more
or less known results, but with the benefit that asymptotic convergence rate
estimates (for specific step-sizes) can be obtained without an a priori
curvature bound, simply from the fact that the limit lies on a smooth manifold.
At the same time, one can give a convincing justification for assuming critical
points to lie in $\mathcal{M}_k$: if $X$ is a critical point of $f$ on
$\mathcal{M}_{\le k}$, then either $X$ has rank $k$, or $\nabla f(X) = 0$.

begin to form; the width of the corresponding peaks in the spectrum depends on
the interaction strength. As expected from the Luttinger liquid theory,
impurities also induce a reduction of the local density of states at small

extra-modulation in the density of states at non-zero Fermi momentum when

into account in order to recover the Coulomb blockade regime for strong

so-far-uncovered intermediate phase, placed between the standard synchronous

stems from the hierarchical modular organization of the connectome. Where one
would expect a hierarchical synchronization process, we show that the interplay
between structural bottlenecks and quenched intrinsic frequency heterogeneities
at many different scales, gives rise to frustrated synchronization,
metastability, and chimera-like states, resulting in a very rich and complex
phenomenology. We uncover the origin of the dynamic freezing behind these
features by using spectral graph theory and discuss how the emerging complex
synchronization patterns relate to the need for the brain to access --in a
robust though flexible way-- a large variety of functional attractors and
dynamical repertoires without ad hoc fine-tuning to a critical point.

10$-$1500 K for H+H$_2$ and 10$-$100 K for H$^+$+H$_2$. Calculations were based
on highly accurate H$_3$ and H$_3^+$ global potential energy surfaces.
Comparisons with previous calculations and with available measurements are
presented and discussed. It is shown that the existence of a long-lived
intermediate complex H$_3^+$ in the (barrierless) H$^+$+H$_2$ reaction give
rise to a pronounced resonance structure and a statistical behaviour, in
contrast to H+H$_2$ which proceeds through a barrier of $\sim 5000$ K. In the
cold interstellar medium ($T\leq 100$ K), the ortho-to-para conversion is thus
driven by proton exchange while above $\sim$300 K, the contribution of hydrogen
atoms become significant or even dominant. Astrophysical applications are
briefly discussed by comparing, in particular, the relative role of the
conversion processes in the gas phase ({\it via} H, H$^+$, H$_2$ and H$_3^+$)

dominant terms where there is the exchange of a light meson. The pion exchange
and the Weinberg-Tomozawa interactions are generalized and with this dynamics
we look for states generated from the interaction, with a unitary coupled

We find two states with nearly zero width which are associated to the
$\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c(2625)$. The lower state, with $J^P = 1/2^-$,
couples to $D N$ and $D^* N$, and the second one, with $J^P = 3/2^-$, to $D^*

  A selfconsistent treatment is used, where the stationary local profiles are

  The electron density gradient can significantly affect the stationary

explore the link between disk faintness and the proposed disk dispersal

sample of disks (9 sources) with low 1.3mm continuum flux (mostly <30 mJy) with
the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer and simultaneously searched for 13CO
(or CO) J=2-1 line emission. Using a simple parametric disk model, we determine
characteristic sizes of the disks, in dust and gas, and we constrain surface
densities in the central 50 AU. All disks are much smaller than the bright
disks imaged so far, both in continuum and 13CO lines (5 detections). In
continuum, half of the disks are very small, with characteristic radii less
than 10AU, but still have high surface density values. Small sizes appear to be
the main cause for the low disk luminosity. Direct evidence for grain growth is
found for the three disks that are sufficiently resolved. Low continuum opacity
is attested in two systems only, but we cannot firmly distinguish between a low
gas surface density and a lower dust emissivity resulting from grain growth. We
report a tentative discovery of a 20 AU radius cavity in DS Tau, bringing the
proportion of transitional disks to a similar value to that of brighter
sources, but cavities cannot explain the low mm flux. This study highlights a
category of very compact dust disks, still exhibiting high surface densities,

selection scan is based on statistics that measure population differentiation
such as $F_{ST}$. However they are important caveats with approaches related to
$F_{ST}$ because they require grouping individuals into populations and they
additionally assume a particular model of population structure. Here we
implement a more flexible individual-based approach based on Bayesian factor
models. Factor models capture population structure with latent variables called
factors, which can describe clustering of individuals into populations or
isolation-by-distance patterns. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we both
infer population structure and identify outlier loci that are candidates for
local adaptation. As outlier loci, the hierarchical factor model searches for
loci that are atypically related to population structure as measured by the
latent factors. In a model of population divergence, we show that the factor
model can achieve a 2-fold or more reduction of false discovery rate compared
to the software BayeScan or compared to a $F_{ST}$ approach. We analyze the
data of the Human Genome Diversity Panel to provide an example of how factor
models can be used to detect local adaptation with a large number of SNPs. The

  Inverse Problems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it has been shown that incoherence is an unrealistic assumption for
compressed sensing when applied to many inverse problems. Instead, the key
property that permits efficient recovery in such problems is so-called local
incoherence. Similarly, the standard notion of sparsity is also inadequate for
many real world problems. In particular, in many applications, the optimal
sampling strategy depends on asymptotic incoherence and the signal sparsity
structure. The purpose of this paper is to study asymptotic incoherence and its
implications towards the design of optimal sampling strategies and efficient
sparsity bases. It is determined how fast asymptotic incoherence can decay in
general for isometries. Furthermore it is shown that Fourier sampling and
wavelet sparsity, whilst globally coherent, yield optimal asymptotic
incoherence as a power law up to a constant factor. Sharp bounds on the
asymptotic incoherence for Fourier sampling with polynomial bases are also
provided. A numerical experiment is also presented to demonstrate the role of
asymptotic incoherence in finding good subsampling strategies.

using the renormalization method of Beane \textit{et} \textit{al.,}with two

aforementioned range of the coupling constant $\alpha$, there exists at most
one bound state, in complete agreement with the method of self-adjoint

non-degenerate joint distribution. The seminal work of Cadambe and Jafar shows
that when $L$ is unbounded, vector space interference alignment can achieve
$1/2$ degrees of freedom per user independent of the number of users $K$.
However wireless channels have limited diversity in practice, dictated by their
coherence time and bandwidth, and an important question is the number of
degrees of freedom achievable at finite $L$. When $K=3$ and if $L$ is finite,
Bresler et al show that the number of degrees of freedom achievable with vector
space interference alignment is bounded away from $1/2$, and the gap decreases
inversely proportional to $L$. In this paper, we show that when $K\geq4$, the
gap is significantly larger. In particular, the gap to the optimal $1/2$
degrees of freedom per user can decrease at most like $1/\sqrt{L}$, and when
$L$ is smaller than the order of $2^{(K-2)(K-3)}$, it decays at most like
$1/\sqrt[4]{L}$.

criteria. Two notions have received particular attention: trophic groups, which
have been used for decades in the ecological literature, and more recently,
modules. The relationship between these two group definitions remains unknown
in empirical food webs because they have so far been studied separately. While
recent developments in network theory have led to efficient methods for
detecting modules in food webs, the determination of trophic groups (sets of
species that are functionally similar) is based on subjective expert knowledge.
Here, we develop a novel algorithm for trophic group detection. We apply this
method to several well-resolved empirical food webs, and show that aggregation
into trophic groups allows the simplification of food webs while preserving
their information content. Furthermore, we reveal a 2-level hierarchical
structure where modules partition food webs into large bottom-top trophic
pathways whereas trophic groups further partition these pathways into sets of
species with similar trophic connections. Bringing together trophic groups and
modules provides new perspectives to the study of dynamical and functional
consequences of food-web structure, bridging topological analysis and dynamical
systems. Trophic groups have a clear ecological meaning in terms of trophic
similarity, and are found to provide a trade-off between network complexity and
information loss.
