Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) one-step ADER-WENO finite volume schemes
for the solution of nonlinear systems of conservative and non-conservative
hyperbolic partial differential equations with stiff source terms on moving
tetrahedral meshes in three space dimensions. A WENO reconstruction technique
is used to achieve high order of accuracy in space, while an element-local
space-time Discontinuous Galerkin finite element predictor on moving meshes is
used to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. Within the
space-time predictor the physical element is mapped onto a reference element
using an isoparametric approach, where the space-time basis and test functions
are given by the Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through a
predefined set of space-time nodes. Since our algorithm is cell-centered, the
final mesh motion is computed by using a suitable node solver algorithm. A
rezoning step as well as a flattener strategy are used in some of the test
problems to avoid mesh tangling or excessive element deformations that may
occur when the computation involves strong shocks or shear waves. We apply our
new high order unstructured ALE schemes to the 3D Euler equations of
compressible gas dynamics, for which a set of classical numerical test problems
has been solved and for which convergence rates up to sixth order of accuracy
in space and time have been obtained. We furthermore consider the equations of
classical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as well as the non-conservative
seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows with stiff
relaxation source terms.

regimes naturally occur in the $D_{1}-D_{m}$ plane. Solutions in the first
regime, which lie between two concave curves, are shown to be regular, owing to
strong nonlinear depletion. Moreover, numerical experiments have suggested, so
far, that all dynamics lie in this heavily depleted regime \cite{DGGKPV13}\,;
new numerical evidence for this is presented. Estimates for the dimension of a
global attractor and a corresponding inertial range are given for this regime.
However, two more regimes can theoretically exist. In the second, which lies
between the upper concave curve and a line, the depletion is insufficient to
regularize solutions, so no more than Leray's weak solutions exist. In the
third, which lies above this line, solutions are regular, but correspond to
extreme initial conditions. The paper ends with a discussion on the possibility
of transition between these regimes.

geometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a
dynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent
and curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is
a structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are
strictly associated with physical objects such as particles and
finite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As
I will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum
physics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example
that physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only
when the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach
properties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing
real objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain
perturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy
shifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the
vacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct
viable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum.

multiplexing relation of the transmit signals only from the antenna scattering
parameters and the modulating reactive loading. This not only avoids tedious
far-field calculations, but more importantly provides an efficient and
practical strategy for spatially multiplexing PSK signals of any modulation
order. The proposed approach allows ensuring a constant impedance matching at
the input of the driving antenna for all symbol combinations, and as
importantly uses only passive reconfigurable loads. This obviates the use of
reconfigurable matching networks and active loads, respectively, thereby
overcoming stringent limitations of previous single-feed MIMO techniques in
terms of complexity, efficiency, and power consumption. The proposed approach
is illustrated by the design of a realistic very compact antenna system
optimized for multiplexing QPSK signals. The results show that the proposed
approach can bring the MIMO benefits to the low-end user terminals at a reduced

systematic magnetic length ($l_B$) expansion within a Green's function
framework we derive quantum functionals for the local spin-resolved particle
and current densities which can be useful for future studies combining disorder
and mean-field electron-electron interaction in the quantum Hall regime. We
point out that the spin polarization presents a peculiar spatial dependence
which can be used to determine the strength of the Rashba coupling by local
probes. The spatial structure of the current density, consisting of both
compressible and incompressible contributions, also essentially reflects the
effects of Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the energy spectrum. We show that
in the semiclassical limit $l_B \rightarrow 0$ the local Hall conductivity
remains, however, still quantized in units of $e^2/h$ for any finite strength
of the spin-orbit interaction. In contrast, it becomes half-integer quantized
when the latter is infinite, a situation which corresponds to a disordered
topological insulator surface consisting of a single Dirac cone. Finally, we
argue how to define at high magnetic fields a spin Hall conductivity related to
a dissipationless angular momentum flow, which is characterized by a sequence

present a shock-cloud model which simulates a supernova remnant interacting
with a cloud in a metal-free environment at redshift $z=10$. Pre-supernova
conditions are considered, which include a multiphase neutral medium and H II
region. A small dense clump ($n=100$ cm$^{-3}$), located 40 pc from a 40
M$_\odot$ metal-free star, embedded in a $n=10$ cm$^{-3}$ ambient cloud. The
evolution of the supernova remnant (explosion energy $10^{52}$ erg) and its
subsequent interaction with the dense clump is examined. This is the first
study to include a comprehensive treatment of the non-equilibrium chemistry and
associated radiative cooling that is occurring at all stages of the shock-cloud
model. We have included a primordial chemistry network that covers the
temperature range $10-10^9$ K, and is coupled to thermal models of atomic &
molecular cooling. We find $\times10^{3}$ density enhancement of the clump (i.e
maximum density $\sim 78000$ cm$^{-3}$) within this metal-free model. This is
consistent with Galactic shock-cloud models considering solar metallicity gas
with equilibrium cooling functions. Despite this strong compression, the cloud
does not become gravitationally unstable. We find that the small cloud modelled
here is destroyed for shock velocities $\gtrsim 50\,$km s$^{-1}$, and not
significantly affected by shocks with velocity $\lesssim 30\,$km s$^{-1}$.
Rather specific conditions are required to make such a cloud collapse.

into four phases based on the idealised CN optical lightcurve; the initial rise
(1.5-3.3d), the pre-maximum halt (3.3-13.3d), the final rise (14.7-27.9d), and
the early decline (27.9d-). The SMEI lightcurve contains a strongly detected
period of 1.44+/-0.05d during the pre-maximum phase. These oscillations
resemble those found in TNR models arising from instabilities in the expanding
envelope. No spectral variation mirroring the lightcurve periodicity was found.
A marked dip at 22-24d just before maximum light (27.9d) may represent the same
phenomenon seen in novae observed by SMEI. Spectra from the Liverpool Telescope
and SMARTS 1.5m were obtained from 0.8-80.7 and 155.1-249.9d, covering the
major phases of development. A distinct high velocity ejection phase was
evident during the early rise (V~4000 km/s). A marked drop at 5.7d, and then a
gradual increase occurred in the ejection velocity which stabilised at ~1500
km/s at the pre-maximum halt. Here we propose two stages of mass loss, a
short-lived phase occurring immediately after outburst, lasting ~6d, followed
by a steadily evolving and higher mass loss phase. The overall spectral
development follows that typical of a CN and comparison with the photometric
behaviour reveals consistencies with the evolving pseudo-photosphere model of a
CN outburst. Comparing optical spectra to X-ray and radio lightcurves, weak [Fe
X] 6375 Angstrom emission was marginally detected before the X-ray rise and was
clearly present during the brightest phase of X-ray emission. If the onset of
the X-ray phase and the start of the optical final decline are related to the
cessation of significant mass loss, then this occurred at 90-110d.

energy of such BHs is sufficient to power up (long) gamma-ray bursts and
hypernovae (GRBs/HNe) and still leave a Kerr BH behind. However, strong
magnetic fields (B fields) and/or dynamo effects in the interior of a
BH-progenitor star may be capable of rapidly depleting the angular momentum
from the stellar core, hence, preventing the formation of a collapsar. Thus,
even if binaries can produce Kerr BHs, most of their rotation is acquired from
accreting the stellar mantle, with a long delay between the formation of the BH
and its spin up. Hence, not being good sources of GRBs.
  We study the necessary conditions to produce GRBs by the progenitors of such
BHs. Tidal-synchronization and Alfv\'en timescales are compared for B fields of
different intensities threading trough He stars. We search for a B-field range
which allows tidal spin up all the way into stellar core but prevents its slow
down during differential rotation phases. Energetics for producing a strong B
field during core collapse, which allows for GRB central engines, are also
estimated. An observationally-reasonable choice of parameters is found.

fundamental importance for relativistic collisionless reconnection, as it

technologies that are nonvolatile, that can scale to high density and high

magnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient
mechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current
and power. There has been considerable recent progress in this effort, in
particular discoveries that spin-orbit interactions in heavy metal/ferromagnet
bilayers can yield strong current-driven torques on the magnetic layer, via the
spin Hall effect in the heavy metal or the Rashba-Edelstein effect in the
ferromagnet. As part of the search for materials to provide even more efficient
spin-orbit-induced torques, some proposals have suggested topological
insulators (TIs), which possess a surface state in which the effects of
spin-orbit coupling are maximal in the sense that an electron's spin
orientation is locked relative to its propagation direction. Here we report
experiments showing that charge current flowing in-plane in a thin film of the
TI Bi_2Se_3 at room temperature can indeed apply a strong spin-transfer torque
to an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy (Py = Ni81Fe19) thin film, with a
direction consistent with that expected from the topological surface state. We
find that the strength of the torque per unit charge current density in the
Bi_2Se_3 is greater than for any other spin-torque source material measured to

conduction. Our data suggest that TIs have potential to enable very efficient

transformation zone (STZ) theory, a statistical thermodynamic theory, to
describe irreversible macroscopic plastic deformations due to local
rearrangements of the gouge particles. We track the temperature evolution at
the grain contacts using a one dimensional heat diffusion equation. At low
temperatures, the strength of the asperities is limited by the flow strength,
as predicted by dislocation creep models. At high temperatures, some of the
constituents of the grains may melt leading to the degradation of the asperity
strength. Our model predicts a logarithmic rate dependence of the steady state
shear stress in the quasi-static regime. In the dense flow regime the
frictional strength decreases rapidly with increasing slip rate due to the
effect of thermal softening at the granular interfaces. The transient response
following a step in strain rate includes a direct effect and a following
evolution effect, both of which depend on the magnitude and direction of the
velocity step. In addition to frictional heat, the energy budget includes an
additional energy sink representing the fraction of external work consumed in
increasing local disorder. The model links low-speed and high-speed frictional
response of gouge layers, and provides an essential ingredient for multiscale
modeling of earthquake ruptures with enhanced coseismic weakening.

has long been of scientific and technological interest. In an AC magnetic
field-assisted cancer therapy, \textit{e.g.}, from a biological point of view,
the interaction of the nanoparticles with cells is critically determined by the
surface properties which control their fate in biological environments. Besides
the size, factors as the shape also seems to affect the cellular uptake. On the
other hand, the specific absorption rate (SAR) at a fixed frequency and
magnetic field, is hugely dependent on average and distribution of size, shape,
crystalline anisotropy, and degree of aggregation or agglomeration of the

a cognitive radio wiretap channel under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints
and interference power limitations inflicted on primary users (PUs). We
initially define four different transmission scenarios regarding channel
sensing results and their correctness. We provide effective secure transmission
rates at which a secondary eavesdropper is refrained from listening to a
secondary transmitter (ST). Then, we construct a channel state transition
diagram that characterizes this channel model. We obtain the effective secure
capacity which describes the maximum constant buffer arrival rate under given
QoS constraints. We find out the optimal transmission power policies that
maximize the effective secure capacity, and then, we propose an algorithm that,
in general, converges quickly to these optimal policy values. Finally, we show
the performance levels and gains obtained under different channel conditions
and scenarios. And, we emphasize, in particular, the significant effect of
hidden-terminal problem on information-theoretic security in cognitive radios.

modeling it in the spatial context remains a challenging problem. In this study
a skew-Gaussian random field is considered. The skew-Gaussian random field is
constructed by using the multivariate closed skew-normal distribution, which is
a generalization of the traditional normal distribution. We present a
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for simulating realizations efficiently from the
random field, and an algorithm for estimating parameters by maximum likelihood

the algorithms on synthetic cases. The skewness in the skew-Gaussian random
field is found to be strongly influenced by the spatial correlation in the

of the random field. Moreover, we use the closed skew-normal distribution in a
multivariate random field predictive setting on real seismic data from the

present flux calibrated IFS observations in H2 1-0 S(1) obtained with
SINFONI/VLT. Thanks to spatial deconvolution by the PSF and to accurate
correction for uneven slit illumination, we performed a thorough analysis and
modeled the morphology, kinematics, and surface brightness. We also compared
our results with studies in [FeII], [OI], and FUV-pumped H2. The
limb-brightened H2 emission in the blue lobe is strikingly similar to
FUV-pumped H2 imaged 6yr later, confirming that they trace the same hot gas and
setting an upper limit of 12km/s on any expansion proper motion. The wide-angle
H2 rims are at lower blueshifts than probed by narrow long-slit spectra. We
confirm that they extend to larger angle and to lower speed the onion-like
velocity structure observed in optical atomic lines. The latter is shown to be
steady over more/equal than 4yr but undetected in [FeII] by SINFONI, probably
due to strong iron depletion. The H2 rim thickness less/equal than 14AU rules
out excitation by C-shocks, and J-shock speeds are constrained to 10km/s. We
find that explaining the H2 wide-angle emission with a shocked layer requires
either a recent outburst (15yr) into a pre-existing ambient outflow or an
excessive wind mass flux. A slow photoevaporative wind from the dense
irradiated disk surface and an MHD disk wind heated by ambipolar diffusion seem
to be more promising and need to be modeled in more detail.

the redshift range 1.2<z<1.8 with morphological diversity shows that the spin
of low-mass blue galaxies is preferentially aligned with their neighbouring

reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers,

Galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate
towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular

properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a
strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench
in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. It
allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and,
therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.

black-hole growth triggered by minor mergers in local spiral (disk) galaxies.
Since major mergers destroy disks and create spheroids, morphologically
disturbed spirals are likely remnants of minor mergers. Disturbed spirals
exhibit enhanced specific star formation rates (SSFRs), the enhancement
increasing in galaxies of 'later' morphological type (which have more gas and
smaller bulges). By combining the SSFR enhancements with the fraction of time
spirals spend in this 'enhanced' mode, we estimate that ~40% of the star
formation in local spirals is directly triggered by minor mergers. The
disturbed spirals also exhibit higher nuclear-accretion rates, implying that
minor mergers enhance the growth rate of the central black hole. However, the
specific accretion rate shows a lower enhancement than that in the SSFR,
suggesting that the coupling between stellar-mass and black-hole growth is weak
in minor-merger-driven episodes. Given the significant fraction of star
formation that is triggered by minor mergers, this weaker coupling may
contribute to the large intrinsic scatter observed in the stellar vs.
black-hole mass relation in spirals. Combining our results with the star
formation in early-type galaxies -- which is minor-merger-driven and accounts
for ~14% of the star formation budget -- suggests that around half of the star
formation activity in the local Universe is triggered by the minor-merger
process.

velocity offset of Lya from a systemic redshift determined with nebular lines
to be dv_Lya=234+-9 km s-1. Using a Kolmogorv-Smirnov test, we confirm the
previous claim of Hashimoto et al. (2013) that the average dv_Lya of LAEs is
smaller than that of LBGs. Our LRIS data successfully identify blue-shifted
multiple IS absorption lines in the UV continua of four LAEs on an individual
basis. The average velocity offset of IS absorption lines from a systemic
redshift is dv_IS=204+-27 km s-1, indicating LAE's gas outflow with a velocity
comparable to typical LBGs. Thus, the ratio, R^Lya_ IS = dv_Lya/dv_IS of LAEs,
is around unity, suggestive of low impacts on Lya transmission by resonant
scattering of neutral hydrogen in the IS medium. We find an anti-correlation
between Lya EW and the covering fraction, f_c, estimated from the depth of
absorption lines, where f_c is an indicator of average neutral hydrogen column

on three different environmental parameters: group halo mass, halo-centric
distance and large-scale structure over-density. The fraction of quenched
satellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scale
overdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previously
found. The morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,
indicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from the
increasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. The
constancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching and
satellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.
The quenched satellites have larger B/T and smaller half-light radii than the
star-forming satellites. These are mostly due to differences in the disks. The
bulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surface
brightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated with
quenching cannot greatly change these quantities. The quenched disks are
fainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. This
can be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks were
generally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-out
growth of disks. At least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenched
satellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.
A comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiency
of group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms to
increase the B/T of low mass quenched satellites. [abridged]

optical telescopes that are well-suited for rapid photometry of bright sources.
I investigate their potential in observing stellar occultations by small
objects in the outer Solar System, Transjovian Objects (TJOs). These
occultations cast diffraction patterns on the Earth. Current IACT arrays are
capable of detecting objects smaller than 100 metres in radius in the Kuiper
Belt and 1 km radius out to 5000 AU. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
will have even greater capabilities. Because the arrays include several
telescopes, they can potentially measure the speeds of TJOs without
degeneracies, and the sizes of the TJOs and background stars. I estimate the
achievable precision using a Fisher matrix analysis. With CTA, the precisions
of these parameter estimations will be as good as a few percent. I consider how
often detectable occultations occur by members of different TJO populations,
including Centaurs, Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), Oort cloud objects, and
satellites and Trojans of Uranus and Neptune. The great sensitivity of IACT
arrays means that they likely detect KBO occultations once every O(10) hours
when looking near the ecliptic. IACTs can also set useful limits on many other
TJO populations.

controlled by a surrounding circumplanetary disk. Current astrophysical
accretion disk models rely on hydromagnetic turbulence or gravitoturbulence as
the source of effective viscosity within the disk. However, the
magnetically-coupled accreting region in these models is so limited that the
disk may not support inflow at all radii, or at the required rate. Here, we
examine the conditions needed for self-consistent accretion, in which the disk
is susceptible to accretion driven by magnetic fields or gravitational
instability. We model the disk as a Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$ disk and calculate
the level of ionisation, the strength of coupling between the field and disk
using Ohmic, Hall and Ambipolar diffusevities for both an MRI and vertical
field, and the strength of gravitational instability. We find that the standard
constant-$\alpha$ disk is only coupled to the field by thermal ionisation
within $30\,R_J$ with strong magnetic diffusivity prohibiting accretion through
the bulk of the midplane. In light of the failure of the constant-$\alpha$ disk
to produce accretion consistent with its viscosity we drop the assumption of
constant-$\alpha$ and present an alternate model in which $\alpha$ varies
radially according to the level magnetic turbulence or gravitoturbulence. We
find that a vertical field may drive accretion across the entire disk, whereas
MRI can drive accretion out to $\sim200\,R_J$, beyond which Toomre's $Q=1$ and
gravitoturbulence dominates. The disks are relatively hot ($T\gtrsim800\,$K),
and consequently massive ($M_{\text{disk}}\sim0.5\,M_J$).

models today. Usually described by a single free parameter, alpha, the common
practice is to calibrate it using the properties of the Sun, and apply it to
all other stellar models as well. Asteroseismic data from Kepler and CoRoT
provide precise properties of other stars which can be used to determine alpha
as well, and a recent study of stars in the Kepler field of view found alpha to
vary with metallicity. Interpreting alpha obtained from calibrated stellar
models, however, is complicated by the fact that the value for alpha depends on
the surface boundary condition of the stellar model, or T-tau relation.
Calibrated models that use typical T-tau relations, which are static and
insensitive to chemical composition, do not include the complete effect of
metallicity on alpha. We use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to extract
metallicity-dependent T-tau relations and use them in calibrated stellar
models. We find the previously reported alpha-metallicity trend to be robust,
and not significantly affected by the surface boundary condition of the stellar
models.

marginal evidence for azimuthal asymmetries and a global offset of the outer

limits on the scattered light surface brightness of the outer ring. Using
radiative transfer modeling, we find that it is impossible to account for all
observed properties of the system under the assumption that both rings contain
dust populations with the same properties. While the outer belt is in
reasonable agreement with the expectations of steady-state collisional cascade
models, albeit with a minimum grain size that is four times larger than the
blow-out size, the inner belt appears to contain copious amounts of small dust
grains, possibly below the blow-out size. This suggests that the inner belt
cannot result from a simple transport of grains from the outer belt and rather
supports a more violent phenomenon as its origin. We also find that the
emission from the inner belt has not declined over three decades, a much longer
timescale than its dynamical timescale, which indicates that the belt is

find new exotic objects, we explored ways to eliminate commonly found objects
so that a larger number of objects may be searched. We find that all but one
eclipsing binary are excluded by requiring moderate color variation during a
dimming event and most of the active galaxies and young stellar objects are
excluded by placing a limit on the standard deviation of the magnitude
distribution in the light curve.

Brown, with the possible addition of spin-torque terms. In the process of
constructing this functional in the Cartesian coordinate system, we critically
revisit this stochastic equation. We present it in a form that accommodates for
any discretization scheme thanks to the inclusion of a drift term. The
generalized equation ensures the conservation of the magnetization modulus and
the approach to the Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium in the absence of non-potential
and time-dependent forces. The drift term vanishes only if the mid-point
Stratonovich prescription is used. We next reset the problem in the more
natural spherical coordinate system. We show that the noise transforms
non-trivially to spherical coordinates acquiring a non-vanishing mean value in
this coordinate system, a fact that has been often overlooked in the
literature. We next construct the generating functional formalism in this
system of coordinates for any discretization prescription. The functional
formalism in Cartesian or spherical coordinates should serve as a starting
point to study different aspects of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of magnets.
Extensions to colored noise, micro-magnetism and disordered problems are
straightforward.

equilibrium (DUE) that incorporates the notion of boundedly rational (BR) user
behavior in the selection of departure time and route choices. Intrinsically,
the boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (BR-DUE) model we present
assumes that travelers do not always seek the least costly
route-and-departure-time choice. Rather, their perception of travel cost is
affected by an indifference band describing travelers' tolerance of the
difference between their experienced travel costs and the minimum travel cost.
An extension of the BR-DUE problem is the so-called variable tolerance dynamic
user equilibrium (VT-BR-DUE) wherein endogenously determined tolerances may
depend not only on paths, but also on the established path departure rates.
This paper presents a unified approach for modeling both BR-DUE and VT-BR-DUE,
which makes significant contributions to model formulation, analysis of
existence, solution characterization, and heuristic numerical computation of
such problems. The VT-BR-DUE problem, together with the BR-DUE problem as a
special case, is formulated as a variational inequality. We provide a very
general existence result for VT-BR-DUE and BR-DUE that relies on assumptions
weaker than those required for mere DUE models. Moreover, a characterization of
the solution set is provided based on rigorous topological analysis. Finally,
three computational algorithms are proposed based on the VI and DVI
formulations. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the proposed algorithms
in terms of solution quality, convergence, and computational efficiency.

and extraterrestrial civilization (SETI and METI) communication. Large
distances demand large transmitted power and/or large antennas, while the
propagation is transparent over a wide bandwidth. Recognizing a fundamental
tradeoff, reduced energy delivered to the receiver at the expense of wide
bandwidth (the opposite of terrestrial objectives) is advantageous. Wide
bandwidth also results in simpler design and implementation, allowing
circumvention of dispersion and scattering arising in the interstellar medium
and motion effects and obviating any related processing. The minimum energy
delivered to the receiver per bit of information is determined by cosmic
microwave background alone. By mapping a single bit onto a carrier burst, the
Morse code invented for the telegraph in 1836 comes closer to this minimum
energy than approaches used in modern terrestrial radio. Rather than the
terrestrial approach of adding phases and amplitudes to increases information
capacity while minimizing bandwidth, adding multiple time-frequency locations
for carrier bursts increases capacity while minimizing energy per information
bit. The resulting location code is extremely simple and yet can approach the
minimum energy as bandwidth is expanded. It is consistent with easy discovery,
since carrier bursts are energetic and straightforward modifications to
post-detection pattern recognition can identify burst patterns. The
interstellar coherence hole captures the time and frequency coherence
constraints, and observations of the environment by transmitter and receiver
constrain the burst parameters and limit the search scope.

temperature, uncorrected for optics loss, ranges from 50K at 185 GHz, 33K at
246 GHz, to 51K at 280 GHz. In this frequency range the mixer has a DSB

observation, by means of separating the incoming circular polarized electric

consist of image-charge and potential alignment corrections. A wide variety of
schemes for both corrections have been proposed for decades. Regarding the
image-charge correction, Freysoldt, Neugebauer, and Van de Walle (FNV) recently
proposed a novel method that enables us to accurately estimate the correction
energy a posteriori through alignment of the defect-induced potential to the
model charge potential [Freysoldt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 016402 (2009)].
This method, however, still has two issues in practice. Firstly, it uses
planar-averaged potential for determining the potential offset, which cannot be
readily applied to relaxed system. Secondly, the long-range Coulomb interaction
is assumed to be screened by a macroscopic dielectric constant. This is valid
only for cubic systems and can bring forth huge errors for defects in
anisotropic materials. In this study, we use the atomic site electrostatic
potential as a potential marker instead of the planar-averaged potential, and
extend the FNV scheme by adopting the point charge model in an anisotropic
medium for estimating long-range interactions. We also revisit the conventional
potential alignment correction and show that it is fully included in the
image-charge correction and therefore unnecessary. In addition, we show that
the potential alignment corresponds to a part of first-order and full of
third-order image-charge correction; thus the third-order image-charge
contribution is absent after the potential alignment. Finally, a systematic
assessment of the accuracy of the extended FNV correction scheme is performed
for a wide range of material classes. The defect formation energies calculated
using around 100-atom supercells are successfully corrected even after atomic
relaxation within a few tenths of eV compared to those in the dilute limit.

induce in general non-minimal kinetic term for the inflaton field, and two
types of SUGRA corrections in the potential - the Hubble-induced mass

inflationary framework can now be constrained from (i) the speed of sound,
$c_s$, and (ii) from the upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio,
$r_{\star}$. We will illustrate this by considering a heavy scalar degree of
freedom at a scale, $M_s$, and a light inflationary field which is responsible
for a slow-roll inflation. We will compute the corrections to the kinetic term
and the potential for the light field explicitly. As an example, we will
consider a visible sector inflationary model of inflation where inflation
occurs at the point of inflection, which can match the density perturbations
for the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also explain why the
universe is filled with the Standard Model degrees of freedom. We will scan the
parameter space of the non-renormalizable K\""ahler operators, which we find
them to be order ${\cal O}(1)$, consistent with physical arguments. While the
scale of heavy physics is found to be bounded by the tensor-to scalar ratio,

upheavals in our view of mass loss, and observations of a high binary fraction
among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard metallicity-dependent winds of
hot stars are now thought to be lower by a factor of 2-3 compared to rates
adopted in modern stellar evolution models, due to the influence of clumping.
Weaker line-driven winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal elsewhere, so
that the dominant modes of mass loss are the winds, pulsations, and eruptions
of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass transfer. Studies of
stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer.
Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which
have massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse. The shifting
emphasis from steady winds to episodic mass loss is a major change for
low-metallicity regions, since eruptions and binary mass transfer are less
sensitive to metallicity. We encounter the predicament that the most important
modes of mass loss are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive
power of single-star evolution models beyond core H burning. Moreover, the
influence of winds and rotation in models has been evaluated by testing
single-star models against observed statistics that, as it turns out, are
heavily influenced by binary evolution. This alters our view about the most
basic outcomes of massive-star mass loss --- are WR stars and SNe Ibc the
products of single-star winds, or are they mostly the result of binary
evolution and eruptive mass loss? This paradigm shift has far-reaching impact

importance of taking into account the successive regeneration and decay of

Carlo simulations, the potential benefits of particle filtering in revealing
accurate statistical information on the imprecisely known model parameters or
modeling errors of dynamical systems, based on limited time series data, have
not been quite realized. A major numerical bottleneck precipitating this
under-performance, especially for higher dimensional systems, is the
progressive particle impoverishment owing to weight collapse and the aim of the
current work is to address this problem by replacing weight-based updates
through additive ones. Thus, in the context of nonlinear filtering problems, a
novel additive particle update scheme, in its non-iterative and iterative
forms, is proposed based on manipulations of the innovation integral in the
governing Kushner-Stratonovich equation. Numerical evidence for the
identification of nonlinear and large dimensional dynamical systems indicates a
substantively superior performance of the non- iterative version of the EnKS
vis-\`a-vis most existing filters. The costlier iterative version, though
conceptually elegant, mostly appears to effect a marginal improvement in the
reconstruction accuracy over its non-iterative counterpart. Prominent in the
reported numerical comparisons are variants of the Ensemble Kalman Filter
(EnKF) that also use additive updates, albeit with many inherent limitations of
a Kalman filter.

estimators. We do this in the context of a generalized GARCH model with
multiple time scales and asymmetry. It is argued that the reason for the
observed volatility risk premium is tail risk aversion. We parametrize such
risk aversion in terms of three coefficients: convexity, skew and kurtosis risk
premium. We propose that option prices under the real-world measure are not
martingales, but that their drift is governed by such tail risk premia. We then
derive a fair-pricing equation for options and show that the solutions can be
written in terms of a stochastic volatility model in continuous time and under
a martingale probability measure. This gives a precise connection between the
pricing and real-world probability measures, which cannot be obtained using
Girsanov Theorem. We find that the convexity risk premium, not only shifts the
overall implied volatility level, but also changes its term structure.
Moreover, the skew risk premium makes the skewness of the volatility smile
steeper than a pure historical estimate. We derive analytical formulas for
certain implied moments using the Bergomi-Guyon expansion. This allows for very
fast calibrations of the models. We show examples of a particular model which
can reproduce the observed SPX volatility surface using very few parameters.

(SM) in one and three dimensions is presented. The method consists of
transformation of the infinite domain to the bounded domain in $(0, \pi)$ and
using the Fourier sine series as a set of basis functions for the SM. It is
shown that with an appropriate choice of transformation functions, this method
manages to preserve the good properties of original SMs; more precisely, superb
computational efficiency when high level of accuracy is necessary. This is made
possible by analytically exploiting the properties of the transformation
function and the Fourier sine series. An especially important property of this
approach is the possibility of calculating the Hartree energy very efficiently.
This is done by exploiting the positive properties of the sine series as a
basis set and conducting an extinctive part of the calculations analytically.
We illustrate the efficiency of this method and implement it to solve the
Poisson's and Helmholtz equations in both one and three dimensions. The
efficiency of the method is verified through a comparison to recently published
results for both one and three dimensional problems.

individual diagnoses are extremely noisy. The motivation for this problem is
the plethora of examples (influenza strains in humans, or computer viruses in
smartphones, etc.) where reliable diagnoses are scarce, but noisy data
plentiful. In flu/phone-viruses, exceedingly few infected people/phones are
professionally diagnosed (only a small fraction go to a doctor) but less
reliable secondary signatures (e.g., people staying home, or
greater-than-typical upload activity) are more readily available. These
secondary data are often plagued by unreliability: many people with the flu do
not stay home, and many people that stay home do not have the flu. This paper
identifies the precise regime where knowledge of the contact network enables
finding the needle in the haystack: we provide a distributed, efficient and
robust algorithm that can correctly identify the existence of a spreading
epidemic from highly unreliable local data. Our algorithm requires only
local-neighbor knowledge of this graph, and in a broad array of settings that
we describe, succeeds even when false negatives and false positives make up an
overwhelming fraction of the data available. Our results show it succeeds in
the presence of partial information about the contact network, and also when
there is not a single ""patient zero"", but rather many (hundreds, in our

localization. The planted clustering problem assumes that a random graph is
generated based on some underlying clusters of the nodes; the task is to
recover these clusters given the graph. The submatrix localization problem
concerns locating hidden submatrices with elevated means inside a large
real-valued random matrix. Of particular interest is the setting where the
number of clusters/submatrices is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem
size. These formulations cover several classical models such as planted clique,
planted densest subgraph, planted partition, planted coloring, and stochastic
block model, which are widely used for studying community detection and
clustering/bi-clustering.
  For both problems, we show that the space of the model parameters
(cluster/submatrix size, cluster density, and submatrix mean) can be
partitioned into four disjoint regions corresponding to decreasing statistical
and computational complexities: (1) the \emph{impossible} regime, where all
algorithms fail; (2) the \emph{hard} regime, where the computationally
expensive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) succeeds; (3) the \emph{easy}
regime, where the polynomial-time convexified MLE succeeds; (4) the
\emph{simple} regime, where a simple counting/thresholding procedure succeeds.
Moreover, we show that each of these algorithms provably fails in the previous
harder regimes.
  Our theorems establish the minimax recovery limit, which are tight up to
constants and hold with a growing number of clusters/submatrices, and provide a
stronger performance guarantee than previously known for polynomial-time
algorithms. Our study demonstrates the tradeoffs between statistical and
computational considerations, and suggests that the minimax recovery limit may
not be achievable by polynomial-time algorithms.

the maximal limit of regularity and entrainability entails many inherent

inevitably contains a dead zone, a time during which light pulses neither

temperature a variety of scattering processes contribute towards the overall
longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These were studied by combining
magnetometry and magnetotransport measurements. The high-field
magnetoresistance (MR) displays three clear temperature regimes: Lorentz force
MR dominates at low temperatures, above T ~ 80 K scattering from spin-waves
predominates, whilst finally for T > 200 K scattering from fluctuating local
moments describes the MR. At low fields, where the magnetisation is no longer
technically saturated, we find a scaling of magnetoresistance with the square
of the magnetisation, indicating that the MR due to the unwinding of spins in
the conical phase arises from a similar mechanism to that in magnetic domain
walls. This MR is only visible up to a temperature of about 200 K. No features
can be found in the temperature or field dependence of the longitudinal
resistivity that belie the presence of the underlying magnetic phase transition
at TN: the marked changes in behavior are at much lower temperatures. The
anomalous Hall effect has a dramatic temperature dependence in which the
anomalous Hall resistivity scales quadratically with the longitudinal
resistivity: comparison with anomalous Hall scaling theory shows that our

market could be fully encoded in a geometrical shape. Still,the present paper
will reveal the geometry behind the stock market transactions. The prices of
market index (DJIA) stock components are arranged in ascending order from the
smallest one in the left to the highest in the right. In such arrangement, as
stock prices changes due to daily market quotations, it could be noticed that
the price of a certain stock get over /under the price of a neighbor stock.
These stocks are crossing. Arranged this way, the diagram of successive stock
crossings is nothing else than a permutation diagram. From this point on the
financial and combinatorial concepts are netted together to build a bridge
connecting the stock market to a beautiful geometrical object that will be
called stock market polytope. The stock market polytope is associated with the
remarkable structure of positive Grassmannian . This procedure makes all the
relevant information about the stock market encoded in the geometrical shape of
the stock market polytope more readable.

performance on large-scale systems. While communication overlapping attempts to
hide communications cost, 2.5D communication avoiding algorithms improve
performance scalability by reducing the volume of data transfers at the cost of
extra memory usage. Both approaches can be used together or separately and the
best choice depends on the machine, the algorithm and the problem size. Thus,
the development of performance models is crucial to determine the best option
for each scenario. In this paper, we present a methodology for constructing
performance models for parallel numerical routines on Cray XE systems. Our
models use portable benchmarks that measure computational cost and network
characteristics, as well as performance degradation caused by simultaneous
accesses to the network. We validate our methodology by constructing the
performance models for the 2D and 2.5D approaches, with and without
overlapping, of two matrix multiplication algorithms (Cannon's and SUMMA),
triangular solve (TRSM) and Cholesky. We compare the estimations provided by
these models with the experimental results using up to 24,576 cores of a Cray
XE6 system and predict the performance of the algorithms on larger systems.
Results prove that the estimations significantly improve when taking into

which is an advantage compared to the case of conventional ferroelectric

metallic host can form the many-body Kondo state with itinerant electrons due
to the effective antiferromagnetic coupling. Such effect is manifested
spectroscopically by a narrow Abrikosov-Suhl peak appearing at the Fermi level
below a characteristic temperature T_K. Recent experiments using nanoscopic
heterojunctions where the correlated quantum impurities (dots) are coupled to
superconducting reservoirs revealed that the Kondo-type correlations are
substantially weaker because: i) the single-particle states of superconductors
are depleted around the Fermi level and ii) the on-dot pairing (proximity
effect) competes with the spin ordering. Within the Anderson impurity scenario
we study here influence of such induced on-dot paring on the exchange
interaction adopting the continuous unitary transformation, which goes beyond
the perturbative framework. Our analytical and numerical results show strong
detrimental influence of the electron pairing on the effective
antiferromagnetic coupling thereby suppressing the Kondo temperature in
agreement with the experimental observations.

believed to lead to unconventional superconductivity and in some cases to
high-temperature superconductivity. However, the exact mechanism by which this
occurs remains poorly understood. The iron-pnictide superconductor
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ is perhaps the clearest example to date of a high
temperature quantum critical superconductor, and so it is a particularly
suitable system in which to study how the quantum critical fluctuations affect
the superconducting state. Here we show that the proximity of the QCP yields
unexpected anomalies in the superconducting critical fields. We find that both
the lower and upper critical fields strongly violate the expectations from the
conventional theory taking into account the observed mass enhancement near the
QCP. These anomalous behaviours of the critical fields imply that the energy of
superconducting vortices is enhanced, possibly due to a microscopic mixing of
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity, suggesting that a highly unusual
vortex state is realised in quantum critical superconductors.

be able to share this information between each other, information about people,

information gathering phase where we did our field search and interviewed and
elaborated on how is the situation of environment perception for blind users,
followed by a technical phase where we implement a system based on the first

variable Rabi frequency and frequency detuning we mention that the most notable
features of the models provided by the derived classes are due to the extra
constant term in the detuning modulation function. Due to this term the classes
suggest numerous symmetric or asymmetric chirped pulses and a variety of models
with two crossings of the frequency resonance. The latter models are generated
by both real and complex transformations of the independent variable. In
general, the resulting detuning functions are asymmetric, the asymmetry being
controlled by the parameters of the detuning modulation function. In some

modulation function. We present an example of the latter possibility and
additionally mention a constant amplitude model with periodically repeated

the way people materialized their cosmology across Scotland with the
introduction of free-standing stones. These were erected almost until the end
of the Bronze Age (Burl 2000, 1993). Significantly, a series of astronomical
patternings have been empirically verified for many Bronze Age monuments that
were erected between 1400-900 BC (Higginbottom et 14 al. 2013, 2003, 2001,

same monuments and their orientations have been identified (Higginbottom et al.

isle of Mull). However, when and where these patterns were first associated
with standing-stone structures was unknown. Through innovative statistics and
software we show that visible astronomical-landscape variables found at Bronze
Age sites on the inner isles and mainland of western Scotland were actually
first established nearly two millennia earlier, with the erection of the first
'great circles' in Britain: Callanish on the Isle of Lewis and Stenness on the
Isle of Orkney. In particular, we introduce our new statistical test that
enables the quantitative determination of astronomical connections of stone
circles. It is seen that, whilst different standing-stone monuments were
created over time (Burl 2000, 1993; 22 Higginbottom et al. 2013; Sheridan &
Brophy 2012) with a mixture of landscape variables (Higginbottom et al. 2013),

between 5 and 36 AU, and evolve under planetary, stellar and Galactic
perturbations for 4.5 Gyr. This process leads to the formation of an Oort cloud
(which we define as the region of semimajor axes a>1000 AU), and to a flux of
cometary bodies from the Oort cloud returning to the planetary region at the
present epoch. The results are consistent with the dynamical characteristics of
short-period comets and other observed cometary populations: the near-parabolic
flux, Centaurs, and high-eccentricity trans-Neptunian objects. To achieve this
consistency with observations, the model requires that the number of comets
versus initial perihelion distance is concentrated towards the outer planetary
region. Moreover, the mean physical lifetime of observable comets in the inner
planetary region (q<2.5 AU) at the present epoch should be an increasing
function of the comets' initial perihelion distances. Virtually all observed
Halley-type comets and nearly half of observed Jupiter-family comets come from
the Oort cloud, and initially (4.5 Gyr ago) from orbits concentrated near the
outer planetary region. Comets that have been in the Oort cloud also return to
the Centaur (5<q<28 AU, a<1000 AU) and near-Neptune high-eccentricity regions.
Such objects with perihelia near Neptune are hard to discover, but Centaurs
with characteristics predicted by the model (e.g., large semimajor axes, above
60 au, or high inclinations, above 40 degrees) are increasingly being found by
observers. The model predicts that the mean physical lifetime of all comets in
the region q<1.5 AU is less than approximately 200 revolutions.

external/our space and an arbitrary pressure in the internal space. We show
that the Einstein equations are compatible only if the matter source is smeared
over the internal space and perturbed metric components do not depend on
coordinates of extra dimensions. The latter means the absence of KK modes
corresponding to the metric fluctuations. Maybe, the absence of KK particles in
LHC experiments is explained by such mechanism.

massive galaxies, using the DR11 main galaxy sample of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-III (CMASS galaxies), and the DR7 quasar spectra
of SDSS-II. The cross-correlation is measured by stacking quasar absorption
spectra shifted to the redshift of galaxies that are within a certain impact
parameter bin of the quasar, after dividing by a quasar continuum model. This
results in an average MgII equivalent width as a function of impact parameter
from a galaxy, ranging from 50 kpc to more than 10 Mpc in proper units, which
includes all MgII absorbers. We show that special care needs to be taken to use
an unbiased quasar continuum estimator, to avoid systematic errors in the
measurement of the mean stacked MgII equivalent width. The measured
cross-correlation follows the expected shape of the galaxy correlation
function, although measurement errors are large. We use the cross-correlation
amplitude to derive the bias factor of MgII absorbers, finding bMgII = 2.33
\pm? 0.19, where the error accounts only for the statistical uncertainty in
measuring the mean equivalent width. This bias factor is larger than that
obtained in previous studies and may be affected by modeling uncertainties that
we discuss, but if correct it suggests that MgII absorbers at redshift z \simeq
0:5 are spatially distributed on large scales similarly to the CMASS galaxies
in BOSS.

step in the planet formation process. Planetesimals are the seeds of both
terrestrial planets and the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core
accretion. Left-over planetesimals in the form of asteroids, trans-Neptunian
objects and comets provide a unique record of the physical conditions in the
solar nebula. Debris from planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts
that the planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation, is
ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage extends from
micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies which can undergo run-away accretion.
The latter ranges in size from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal
eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations. Particles face many
barriers during this growth, arising mainly from inefficient sticking,
fragmentation and radial drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass
transfer, where small aggregates transfer up to 50% of their mass in high-speed
collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy growth, where aggregate cross
sections and sticking probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A
wide range of particle sizes, from mm to 10 m, concentrate in the turbulent gas
flow. Overdense filaments fragment gravitationally into bound particle clumps,
with most mass entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 to 500 km,
depending on local disc properties. We propose a hybrid model for planetesimal
formation where particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later
proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals
with a wide range of sizes.

rocky cores, the first step toward planet formation is the growth of dust
grains into larger and larger aggregates and eventually planetesimals. Although
dust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of
interstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular
clouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and
kilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the
formation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can
be observed directly in young extrasolar systems.
  In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain
collisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical
computations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the
global processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks,
including dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted
observational signatures are summarized.
  We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular
cloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the
initial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence
for the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent
evidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a
brief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size
distribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations.
The observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models,
in particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early
growth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks. We also
highlight the limits of current models, including the need to slow the radial
drift of grains.

in active systems. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how
active solutes perturb osmotic steady states. We find that solute activity
increases the osmotic pressure, and can also expel solvent from the solution -
i.e. cause reverse osmosis. The latter effect cannot be described by an
effective temperature, but can be reproduced by mapping the active solution
onto a passive one with the same degree of local structuring as the passive
solvent component. Our results provide a basic framework for understanding
active osmosis, and suggest that activity-induced structuring of the passive
component may play a key role in the physics of active-passive mixtures.

are largely independent of the specific internal level structure and are
therefore universally applicable to different kinds of nanoparticles, ranging

sensitive to fringe shifts as small as a few nanometers and yet robust against
velocity-dependent phase shifts, since the gratings exist only for nanoseconds

only the order of the participants is unknown. On-line secret sharing is a
useful primitive when the set of participants grows in time, and redistributing
the secret is too expensive. In this paper we start the investigation of
unconditionally secure on-line secret sharing schemes. The complexity of a
secret sharing scheme is the size of the largest share a single participant can
receive over the size of the secret. The infimum of this amount in the on-line
or off-line setting is the on-line or off-line complexity of the access
structure, respectively. For paths on at most five vertices and cycles on at
most six vertices the on-line and offline complexities are equal, while for
other paths and cycles these values differ. We show that the gap between these
values can be arbitrarily large even for graph based access structures. We
present a general on-line secret sharing scheme that we call first-fit. Its
complexity is the maximal degree of the access structure. We show, however,
that this on-line scheme is never optimal: the on-line complexity is always
strictly less than the maximal degree. On the other hand, we give examples
where the first-fit scheme is almost optimal, namely, the on-line complexity
can be arbitrarily close to the maximal degree. The performance ratio is the
ratio of the on-line and off-line complexities of the same access structure. We
show that for graphs the performance ratio is smaller than the number of
vertices, and for an infinite family of graphs the performance ratio is at
least constant times the square root of the number of vertices.

the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) suggested that these were due
to calibration with incomplete sky models. A theoretical framework is derived
that validates this suggestion, and provides predictions of ghost formation in
a two-source scenario. The predictions are found to accurately match the result
of simulations, and qualitatively reproduce the ghosts previously seen in
observational data. The theory also provides explanations for many previously
puzzling features of these artefacts (regular geometry, PSF-like sidelobes,
seeming independence on model flux), and shows that the observed phenomenon of
flux suppression affecting unmodelled sources is due to the same mechanism. We
demonstrate that this ghost formation mechanism is a fundamental feature of
calibration, and exhibits a particularly strong and localized signature due to
array redundancy. To some extent this mechanism will affect all observations
(including those with non-redundant arrays), though in most cases the ghosts
remain hidden below the noise or masked by other instrumental artefacts. The
implications of such errors on future deep observations are discussed.

characterized by a double quantization of the orbit spatial extent and of the

(FCC), TV white spaces (TVWS) can now be accessed by secondary users (SUs)
after a list of vacant TV channels is obtained via a geo-location database.
Proper business models are therefore essential for database operators to manage
geo-location databases. Database access can be simultaneously priced under two
different schemes: the registration scheme and the service plan scheme. In the
registration scheme, the database reserves part of the TV bandwidth for
registered White Space Devices (WSDs). In the service plan scheme, the WSDs are
charged according to their queries. In this paper, we investigate the business
model for the TVWS database under a hybrid pricing scheme. We consider the
scenario where a database operator employs both the registration scheme and the
service plan scheme to serve the SUs. The SUs' choices of different pricing
schemes are modeled as a non-cooperative game and we derive distributed
algorithms to achieve Nash Equilibrium (NE). Considering the NE of the SUs, the
database operator optimally determines pricing parameters for both pricing
schemes in terms of bandwidth reservation, registration fee and query plans.

and large-scale disturbances propagating in the solar corona, named after the
Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) as EIT waves, which trace the
lateral expansion of a coronal mass ejection (CME). A comprehensive search for
SOHO/EIT waves was carried out for 179 SEP events during Solar Cycle 23
(1997-2006). 87% of the SEP events were found to be accompanied by EIT waves.
In order to test if the EIT waves play a role in the SEP acceleration, we
compared their extrapolated arrival time at the footpoint of the Parker spiral
with the particle onset in the 26 eastern SEP events that had no direct
magnetic connection to the Earth. We find that the onset of proton events was
generally consistent with this scenario. However, in a number of cases the
first near-relativistic electrons were detected too early. Furthermore, the
electrons had in general only weakly anisotropic pitch-angle distributions.
This poses a problem for the idea that the SEPs were accelerated by the EIT
wave or in any other spatially confined region in the low corona. The presence
of weak electron anisotropies in SEP events from the eastern hemisphere
suggests that transport processes in interplanetary space, including
cross-field diffusion, play a role in giving the SEPs access to a broad range
of helio-longitudes.

(Ls=304{\deg}-92{\deg}). Our investigations have led to the following
observations: 1. We classify the retreat of the north polar seasonal cap into
'pre-sublimation', 'early spring', 'asymmetric' and 'stable' periods according
to the prevalent H2O ice grain size distributions. 2. During the early spring,
the signatures of CO2 ice at the edge of the cap are obscured by H2O ice, which
increases the apparent size of the H2O ice annulus around the seasonal CO2 cap
at this time. At around Ls=25{\deg}, this process changes into an asymmetrical
distribution of H2O deposition, covering CO2 signatures more rapidly in the
longitude range from 90-210{\deg}E. 3. We detect signatures of 'pure' CO2 ice
in extremely limited locations (in Lomonosov Crater) even in mid winter. H2O
ice signatures appear everywhere in the retreating CO2 seasonal cap, in
contrast with the south polar seasonal cap. 4. We find that average H2O ice
grain sizes continuously increase from northern mid-winter to the end of
springtime - this is the inverse of the behavior of CO2 ice grain sizes in the
southern springtime.
