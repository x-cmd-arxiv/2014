entropy production principle (MEPP) by enforcing a local conservation of
energy. This leads to an equation for the vorticity distribution that conserves
all the Casimirs, the energy, and that increases monotonically the mixing
entropy ($H$-theorem). Furthermore, the equation for the coarse-grained
vorticity dissipates monotonically all the generalized enstrophies. These
equations may provide a parametrization of 2D turbulence. They do not generally
relax towards the maximum entropy state. The vorticity current vanishes for any
steady state of the 2D Euler equation. Interestingly, the equation for the
coarse-grained vorticity obtained from the MEPP turns out to coincide, after
some algebraic manipulations, with the one obtained with the anticipated
vorticity method. This shows a connection between these two approaches when the
conservation of energy is treated locally. Furthermore, the newly derived
equation, which incorporates a diffusion term and a drift term, has a nice
physical interpretation in terms of a selective decay principle. This gives a
new light to both the MEPP and the anticipated vorticity method.

recover the physically bound galaxies we focus on the satellites which are
within the escape speed of each CIG galaxy. We also propose a more conservative
method using the stacked Gaussian distribution of the velocity difference of
the neighbours. The tidal strengths affecting the primary galaxy are estimated
to quantify the effects of the local and LSS environments. We also define the
projected number density parameter at the 5$^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour to
characterise the LSS around the CIG galaxies. Out of the 386 CIG galaxies
considered in this study, at least 340 (88\% of the sample) have no physically
linked satellite. Out of the 386 CIG galaxies, 327 (85\% of the sample) have no
physical companion within a projected distance of 0.3 Mpc. The CIG galaxies are
distributed following the LSS of the local Universe, although presenting a
large heterogeneity in their degree of connection with it. A clear segregation
appears between early-type CIG galaxies with companions and isolated late-type
CIG galaxies. Isolated galaxies are in general bluer, with likely younger
stellar populations and rather high star formation with respect to older,
redder CIG galaxies with companions. Reciprocally, the satellites are redder
and with an older stellar populations around massive early-type CIG galaxies,
while they have a younger stellar content around massive late-type CIG
galaxies. This suggests that the CIG is composed of a heterogeneous population
of galaxies, sampling from old to more recent, dynamical systems of galaxies.

optically inhomogeneous lenses the method of geometrization of the Maxwell
equations seems to be perspective. The basic idea is to transform the
coefficients of material equations, namely the dielectric permittivity and
magnetic permeability in the effective geometry of space-time (besides the
vacuum Maxwell equations). This allows us to solve the direct and inverse
problems, that is, to find the permittivity and magnetic permeability for a
given effective geometry (paths of rays), as well as finding an effective
geometry on the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The most
popular naive geometrization was proposed by J. Plebanski. Under certain
limitations it is quite good for solving relevant problems. It should be noted
that in his paper only the resulting formulas and exclusively for Cartesian
coordinate systems are given. In our work we conducted a detailed derivation of
formulas for the naive geometrization of Maxwell's equations, and these
formulas are written for an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system. This work
is a step toward building a complete covariant geometrization of the
macroscopic Maxwell's equations.

of a sample of forty nearby early-type galaxies. The majority of sample
galaxies are known to have dust in various forms viz. dust lanes, nuclear dust
and patchy/filamentary dust. A detailed study of dust was performed for 12
galaxies with prominent dust features. The extinction curves for these galaxies
run parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, implying that the properties of
dust in these galaxies are similar to those of the Milky-Way. The ratio of
total to selective extinction (Rv) varies between 2.1 and 3.8, with an average
of 2.9 +/- 0.2, fairly close to its canonical value of 3.1 for our Galaxy. The
average relative grain size <a>/a_Gal of dust particles in these galaxies turns
out to be 1.01 +/- 0.2, while dust mass estimated using optical extinction lies
in the range 10^2 to 10^4 M(sun) . The Halpha emission was detected in 23 out
of 29 galaxies imaged through narrow- band filters with the Halpha luminosities
in the range 10^38 - 10^41 erg s^-1. The mass of the ionized gas is in the
range 10^3-10^5 M(sun). The morphology and extent of ionized gas is found
similar to those of dust, indicating possible coexistence of dust and ionized
gas in these galaxies. The absence of any apparent correlation between blue
luminosity and normalized IRAS dust mass is suggestive of merger related origin
of dust and gas in these galaxies.

magneto-transport properties of single-crystal, n-type, Mn-doped Bi2Te3 thin
films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. With increasing Mn concentration, the
crystal structure changes from the tetradymite structure of the Bi2Te3 parent
crystal at low Mn concentrations towards a BiTe phase in the (Bi2Te3)m(Bi2)n
homologous series. Magnetization measurements reveal the onset of
ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature in the range 13.8 K - 17 K in films
with 2 % - 10 % Mn concentration. Magnetization hysteresis loops reveal that
the magnetic easy axis is along the c-axis of the crystal (perpendicular to the
plane). Polarized neutron reflectivity measurements of a 68 nm-thick sample
show that the magnetization is uniform through the film. The presence of
ferromagnetism is also manifest in a strong anomalous Hall effect and a
hysteretic magnetoresistance arising from domain wall scattering. Ordinary Hall
effect measurements show that the carrier density is n-type, increases with Mn
doping, and is high enough (> 2.8 x 10^{13} cm^{-2}) to place the chemical
potential in the conduction band. Thus, the observed ferromagnetism is likely
associated with both bulk and surface states. Surprisingly, the Curie
temperature does not show any clear dependence on the carrier density but does
increase with Mn concentration. Our results suggest that the ferromagnetism
probed in these Mn-doped Bi2Te3 films is not mediated by carriers in the
conduction band or in an impurity band.

applications, and has long been dominated by Mahalanobis methods. Recent
advances in nonlinear metric learning have demonstrated the potential power of
non-Mahalanobis distance functions, particularly tree-based functions. We
propose a novel nonlinear metric learning method that uses an iterative,
hierarchical variant of semi-supervised max-margin clustering to construct a
forest of cluster hierarchies, where each individual hierarchy can be
interpreted as a weak metric over the data. By introducing randomness during
hierarchy training and combining the output of many of the resulting
semi-random weak hierarchy metrics, we can obtain a powerful and robust
nonlinear metric model. This method has two primary contributions: first, it is
semi-supervised, incorporating information from both constrained and
unconstrained points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint
satisfaction, allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the
constraints at different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to
simultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning
algorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks on
$k$-nearest neighbor classification, large-scale image retrieval and
semi-supervised clustering problems, and find that our algorithm yields results
comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art, and is significantly more
robust to noise.

directions. First, we modify the diagonally corrected method of (Greenewald et

structure. Second, we improve the conditioning of the estimate in the very low
sample regime by using Ledoit-Wolf type shrinkage regularization similar to
(Chen, Hero et al. 2010). For improved robustness to heavy tailed
distributions, we modify the KronPCA to incorporate robust shrinkage estimation
(Chen, Hero et al. 2011). Results of numerical simulations establish benefits
in terms of estimation MSE when compared to previous methods. Finally, we apply
our methods to a real-world network spatio-temporal anomaly detection problem

a lightcurve range 0.42 mag., the latter corresponding to projected dimensions
3.6 x 5.4 km (axis ratio 1.5:1), at the previously measured geometric albedo of
0.05+/-0.02. We explored a range of continuous and impulsive emission models to
simultaneously fit the measured surface brightness profile, width and position
angle of the antisolar tail. Preferred fits invoke protracted emission, over a
period of 150 days or less, of dust grains following a differential power-law
size distribution with index 3.25 < q < 3.5 and having a wide range of sizes.
Ultra-low surface brightness dust projected in the sunward direction is a
remnant from emission activity occurring in previous orbits, and consists of
the largest (>cm-sized) particles. Ejection velocities of one micron-sized
particles are comparable to the ~1.8 m/s gravitational escape speed of the
nucleus, while larger particles are released at speeds less than the
gravitational escape velocity. The observations are consistent with, but do not
prove, a hybrid hypothesis in which mass loss is driven by gas drag from the
sublimation of near-surface water ice, but escape is aided by centripetal
acceleration from the rotation of the elongated nucleus. No plausible

(101955) Bennu (formerly 1999 RQ$_{36}$), is a half-kilometer near-Earth
asteroid with an extraordinarily well constrained orbit. An extensive data set
of optical astrometry from 1999--2013 and high-quality radar delay measurements
to Bennu in 1999, 2005, and 2011 reveal the action of the Yarkovsky effect,
with a mean semimajor axis drift rate $da/dt = (-19.0 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}$
au/Myr or $284\pm 1.5\;\rm{m/yr}$. The accuracy of this result depends
critically on the fidelity of the observational and dynamical model. As an
example, neglecting the relativistic perturbations of the Earth during close
approaches affects the orbit with $3\sigma$ significance in $da/dt$.
  The orbital deviations from purely gravitational dynamics allow us to deduce
the acceleration of the Yarkovsky effect, while the known physical
characterization of Bennu allows us to independently model the force due to
thermal emissions. The combination of these two analyses yields a bulk density
of $\rho = 1260\pm70\,\rm{kg/m^3}$, which indicates a macroporosity in the
range $40\pm10$% for the bulk densities of likely analog meteorites, suggesting
a rubble-pile internal structure. The associated mass estimate is
$(7.8\pm0.9)\times 10^{10}\, \rm{kg}$ and $GM = 5.2\pm0.6\,\rm{m^3/s^2}$.
  Bennu's Earth close approaches are deterministic over the interval
1654--2135, beyond which the predictions are statistical in nature. In
particular, the 2135 close approach is likely within the lunar distance and
leads to strong scattering and therefore numerous potential impacts in
subsequent years, from 2175--2196. The highest individual impact probability is
$9.5\times 10^{-5}$ in 2196, and the cumulative impact probability is
$3.7\times 10^{-4}$, leading to a cumulative Palermo Scale of -1.70.

detailed fluctuation theorems can be formulated for several other thermodynamic

the weak gravitational fields of the Solar system. Hence, only the weak-field
slow-motion aspects of relativistic celestial mechanics could be investigated.
Testing gravity beyond the first post-Newtonian contributions was for a long
time out of reach.
  The discovery of the first binary pulsar by Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor
in the summer of 1974 initiated a completely new field for testing the
relativistic dynamics of gravitationally interacting bodies. For the first time
the back reaction of gravitational wave emission on the binary motion could be
studied. Furthermore, the Hulse-Taylor pulsar provided the first test bed for
the orbital dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies.
  To date there are a number of pulsars known, which can be utilized for
precision test of gravity. Depending on their orbital properties and their
companion, these pulsars provide tests for various different aspects of
relativistic dynamics. Besides tests of specific gravity theories, like general
relativity or scalar-tensor gravity, there are pulsars that allow for generic
constraints on potential deviations of gravity from general relativity in the
quasi-stationary strong-field and the radiative regime.
  This article presents a brief overview of this modern field of relativistic
celestial mechanics, reviews some of the highlights of gravity tests with radio
pulsars, and discusses their implications for gravitational physics and
astronomy, including the upcoming gravitational wave astronomy.

This allows us to construct valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for

to recent work in high-dimensional statistics, our results are exact

constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis testing is negligible compared
to the cost of linear regression, thus making our methods particularly suitable
for extremely large datasets. Although we focus on marginal screening to
illustrate the applicability of the condition on selection framework, this

framework to several other selection procedures including orthogonal matching
pursuit, non-negative least squares, and marginal screening+Lasso.

Significance of the components exceeds $4\sigma$-level and admits an increase

($101 \pm 2$)h$^{-1}$ Mpc, respectively. These quasi-periods turn out to be
close to the characteristic scale ($101 \pm 6$)h$^{-1}$Mpc of the
quasi-periodical component obtained earlier for the radial distribution of
luminous red galaxies (LRGs). On the other hand, the scales are close to the
spatial scale corresponding to the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) revealed

foraging is a prime example of individuals following simple behavioral rules
based on local information producing complex, organized and ``intelligent''
strategies at the population level. One of its main aspects is the widespread
use of pheromones, which are chemical compounds laid by the ants used to
attract other ants to a food source. In this work, we consider a continuous
description of a population of ants and simulate numerically the foraging
behavior using a system of PDEs of chemotaxis type. We show that, numerically,
this system accurately reproduces observed foraging behavior, such as trail
formation and efficient removal of food sources.

Galactic Plane observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (GLIMPSE survey: l ~
51.0 deg, b ~ 0.1 deg). The bubble represents an example of shell-like
structures found all over the Milky Way Galaxy.
  Aims. We aim to analyse the atomic and molecular components of N107, as well
as its radio continuum emission. With the help of numerical simulations, we aim
to estimate the bubble age and other parameters which cannot be derived
directly from observations.
  Methods. From the observations of the HI (I-GALFA) and 13CO (GRS) lines we
derive the bubble's kinematical distance and masses of the atomic and molecular
components. With the algorithm DENDROFIND, we decompose molecular material into
individual clumps. From the continuum observations at 1420 MHz (VGPS) and 327
MHz (WSRT), we derive the radio flux density and the spectral index. With the
numerical code ring, we simulate the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles similar
to N107.
  Results. The total HI mass associated with N107 is 5.4E3 Msun. The total mass
of the molecular component (a mixture of cold gasses of H2, CO, He and heavier
elements) is 1.3E5 Msun, from which 4.0E4 Msun is found along the bubble
border. We identified 49 molecular clumps distributed along the bubble border,
with the slope of the clump mass function of -1.1. The spectral index of -0.30
of a strong radio source located apparently within the bubble indicates
nonthermal emission, hence part of the flux likely originates in a supernova
remnant, not yet catalogued. The numerical simulations suggest N107 is likely
less than 2.25 Myr old. Since first supernovae explode only after 3 Myr or
later, no supernova remnant should be present within the bubble. It may be
explained if there is a supernova remnant in the direction towards the bubble,
however not associated with it.

the accurate reconstruction of these times from experimental data presents a

optical tunnelling through the barrier created by the field and the core

in diagnostic procedures. But there are some conditions, like in case of
myocardial infarction, in which the regular modeling approaches are not useful.
In this section, using a point-wise approach in deformation estimation, we try
to estimate the deformation under some abnormal conditions of cardiac muscle.
First, the endocardial and epicardial contour points are ordered with respect
to the center of gravity of endocardial contour and boundary point displacement
vectors are extracted. Then to solve the governing equation of deformation,
which is an elliptic equation, we apply boundary conditions in accordance with
the computed displacement vectors and then the Finite Element method (FEM) will
be used to solve the governing equation. Using obtained displacement field
through the cardiac muscle, strain map is extracted to show the mechanical
behavior of cardiac muscle. To validate the proposed algorithm in case of
infracted muscle, a non-homogeneous ring is modeled using ANSYS under a uniform
time varying internal pressure, which is the case in real cardiac muscle
deformation and then the proposed algorithm implemented in MATLAB and the
results for such problem are extracted.
