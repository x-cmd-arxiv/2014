These layers generate an additional 3-dimensional hole pocket and cone-like
electron pockets. The former is attributed to the Ca $d$ and As1 $p_z$ orbitals
and the latter are attributed to the anisotropic Dirac cone, contributed by As1
$p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. We find that large gaps on these pockets open in the
collinear antiferromagnetic ground state of CaFeAs$_2$, suggesting that the
chain-like As layers are strongly coupled to FeAs layers. Moreover due to the
low symmetry crystal induced by the As layers, the bands attributed to FeAs
layers in $k_y=\pi$ plane are two-fold degenerate but in $k_x=\pi$ plane are
lifted. This degeneracy is protected by a hidden symmetry
$\hat{\Upsilon}=\hat{T}\hat{R}_y$. Ignoring the electron cones, the materials
can be well described by a six-band model, including five Fe $d$ and As1 $p_z$
orbitals. We suggest that these new features may help us to identify the sign

recent work on left-induced model category structures (arXiv:1401.3651v2

proper, simplicial model category structure on the category of $X_+$-comodules,
with respect to which the adjunction is a Quillen equivalence after
localization with respect to some generalized homology theory. We show moreover
that this model category structure stabilizes, giving rise to a model category
structure on the category of $\Sigma^\infty X_{+}$-comodule spectra.
  The Waldhausen $K$-theory of $X$, $A(X)$, is thus naturally weakly equivalent
to the Waldhausen $K$-theory of the category of homotopically finite
$\Sigma^\infty X_{+}$-comodule spectra, with weak equivalences given by twisted

The Sun shows strong variability in its magnetic activity, from Grand

understood, mostly because of the insufficient length of the directly observed
solar activity records and of uncertainties related to long-term
reconstructions. Here we present a new adjustment-free reconstruction of solar
activity over three millennia and study its different modes. Methods. We
present a new adjustment-free, physical reconstruction of solar activity over
the past three millennia, using the latest verified carbon cycle, 14C
production, and archeomagnetic field models. This great improvement allowed us
to study different modes of solar activity at an unprecedented level of
details. Results. The distribution of solar activity is clearly bi-modal,
implying the existence of distinct modes of activity. The main regular activity
mode corresponds to moderate activity that varies in a relatively narrow band
between sunspot numbers about 20 and 67. The existence of a separate Grand
minimum mode with reduced solar activity, which cannot be explained by random
fluctuations of the regular mode, is confirmed at a high confidence level. The
possible existence of a separate Grand maximum mode is also suggested, but the
statistics is too low to reach a confident conclusion. Conclusions. The Sun is
shown to operate in distinct modes - a main general mode, a Grand minimum mode
corresponding to an inactive Sun, and a possible Grand maximum mode
corresponding to an unusually active Sun. These results provide important
constraints for both dynamo models of Sun-like stars and investigations of
possible solar influence on Earth's climate.

previous algorithms that achieve the same approximation ratios. Finally, we use

avalanche models of solar flares. These models are readily amenable to a
relatively unambiguous physical interpretation in terms of slow twisting of a
coronal loop. They share similarities with other avalanche models, such as the
classical stick--slip self-organized critical model of earthquakes, in that
they are driven globally by a fully deterministic energy loading process. The
model design leads to a systematic deficit of small scale avalanches. In some
portions of model space, mid-size and large avalanching behavior is scale-free,
being characterized by event size distributions that have the form of
power-laws with index values, which, in some parameter regimes, compare
favorably to those inferred from solar EUV and X-ray flare data. For models
using conservative or near-conservative redistribution rules, a population of
large, quasiperiodic avalanches can also appear. Although without direct
counterparts in the observational global statistics of flare energy release,
this latter behavior may be relevant to recurrent flaring in individual coronal
loops. This class of models could provide a basis for the prediction of large
solar flares.

complexity renders their use intractable on our long-duration observations of
high-resolution events, or both. In this paper we present a new and efficient
method for inferring a distribution over intensity functions that uses direct
numeric integration and smooth interpolation over Gaussian processes. We
demonstrate that our direct method is up to twice as accurate and two orders of
magnitude more efficient than the best existing method (thinning). Importantly,
the direct method can infer intensity functions over the full range of bursty
to memoryless to regular events, which thinning and many other methods cannot.
Finally, we apply the method to clinical event data and demonstrate the
face-validity of the abstraction, which is now amenable to standard learning
algorithms.

source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires
solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence
machine learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on
`shallow' machine learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex
non-linear functions of the inputs, and rely on a pain-staking search through
manually constructed non-linear features. Progress on this problem has slowed,
as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances
in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions
and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Using benchmark
datasets, we show that deep learning methods need no manually constructed
inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8\% over the
best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep learning approaches can
improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.

continue interactions when the offer is rejected, which we call the Not Quite

probabilistic decision making contributes to the increase of proposers' offer

responders' advantage because they can wait until a good offer comes. These
simple extensions greatly promote evolution of fairness in both proposers'

$\mathcal{O}_{k,\epsilon}(d^3\log^5 d)$, both significantly lower than

what was previously known. We also show that

Boltzmann equation for $d$-dimensional inelastic Maxwell models. By granular
gas we mean here a low density system of identical spheres that lose a fraction
of their kinetic energy after collisions. In the present work, the granular gas
is fluidized by the presence of a thermostat that aides the system to reach a
steady state. The thermostat is composed by two terms: a random force and a
drag force. The combined action of both forces, that act homogeneously on the
granular gas, tries to mimic the interaction of the set of particles with a
surrounding fluid. The Chapman-Enskog method is applied to solve the inelastic
Boltzmann equation to first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic fields
from their values in the homogeneous steady state. Since the collisional
cooling cannot be compensated locally for by the heat produced by the driving
forces, the reference (zeroth-order) distribution function $f^{(0)}$ depends on
time through its dependence on the granular temperature. To simplify the
analysis and obtain explicit forms for the transport coefficients, the steady
state conditions are considered. A comparison with previous results obtained
for inelastic hard spheres is also carried out.

abundances relative to hydrogen that are below their values in stars,
indicating their removal by condensation into solid form. The relative amounts
of these depletions vary from one location to the next, and different elements
show varying degrees of depletion. In a study of abundances along 243 different
sight lines reported in more than 100 papers, Jenkins (2009) characterized the
systematic patterns for the depletions of 17 different elements, and these
results in turn were used to help us understand the compositions of dust
grains. Since the conclusions are based on differential depletions along
different sightlines, they are insensitive to errors in the adopted values for
the total element abundances. Some of the more remarkable conclusions to emerge
from this study are that (1) oxygen depletions in the denser gas regions (but
not as dense as the interiors of molecular clouds) are stronger than what we
can expect from just the formation of silicates and metallic oxides, and (2)
the chemically inert element krypton shows some evidence for weak depletion,
perhaps as a result of trapping within water clathrates or binding with H_3^+.

are ""Perytons"" -- similar pulsed, dispersed sources, but most certainly local.
Suggested models of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can originate in the Earth's
atmosphere, in stellar coronae, in other galaxies, and even at cosmological
distances. Using physically motivated assumptions combined with observed
properties, we explore these models. In our analysis, we focus on the Lorimer
event: a 30 Jy, 5-ms duration burst with DM$=$ 375 cm$^{-3}$ pc, exhibiting a
steep frequency-dependent pulse width (the {\it Sparker}). To be complete, we
drop the assumption that high DMs are produced by plasma propagation and assume
that the source produces pulses with frequency-dependent arrival time (""chirped
signals""). Within this framework we explore a scenario in which Perytons, the
{\it Sparker}, and the FRBs are all atmospheric phenomenon occurring at
different heights. This model is {\it ad hoc} in that we cannot explain why
Perytons at higher altitudes show greater DMs or exhibit narrower pulses.
Nonetheless, we argue the {\it Sparker} may be a Peryton. We end with two
remarks. First, the detection of a single FRB by an interferometer with a
kilometer (or longer) baseline will prove that FRBs are of extra-terrestrial
origin. Second, we urge astronomers to pursue observations and understanding of
Perytons since they form (at least) a formidable foreground for the FRBs.

where only one longitudinal resonant mode has a lower loss than the small

configuration enables ultra-widely tunable single-frequency lasers based on
either homogeneously or inhomogeneously broadened gain media. The concept is an
alternative to the common external cavity configurations for achieving tunable
single-mode operation in a laser. The proposed laser concept builds on a high-Q
""dark state"" that is established by radiative interference coupling and bears a
direct analogy to parity-time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonians in optical systems.

humidity -- is very important for a proper reconstruction of air showers,
especially with the fluorescence technique. The Global Data Assimilation System
(GDAS) provides altitude-dependent profiles of these state variables of the
atmosphere and several more. Every three hours, a new data set on 23 constant
pressure level plus an additional surface values is available for the entire
globe. These GDAS data are now used in the standard air shower reconstruction
of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The validity of the data was verified by
comparisons with monthly models that were averaged from on-site meteorological
radio soundings and weather station measurements obtained at the Observatory in
Malarg\""ue. Comparisons of reconstructions using the GDAS data and the monthly
models are also presented. Since GDAS is a global model, the data can
potentially be used for other cosmic and gamma ray detectors. Several studies
were already performed or are underway for several locations worldwide. As an
example, a study performed in Colorado as part of an Atmospheric R&D for a
possible future cosmic ray observatory is presented.

general form of bijective maps on the space of all $m\times n$ matrices over a
division ring $\mathbb{D}$ which preserve adjacency in both directions. This
result proved by Hua in the nineteen forties has been recently improved in
several directions. One can study such maps without the bijectivity assumption
or one can try to get the same conclusion under the weaker assumption that
adjacency is preserved in one direction only. And the last possibility is to
study maps acting between matrix spaces of different sizes. The optimal result
would describe maps preserving adjacency in one direction only acting between
spaces of rectangular matrices of different sizes in the absence of any
regularity condition (injectivity or surjectivity).
  A division ring is said to be EAS if it is not isomorphic to any proper
subring. It has been known before that it is possible to construct adjacency
preserving maps with wild behaviour on matrices over division rings that are
not EAS. For matrices over EAS division rings it has been recently proved that
adjacency preserving maps acting between matrix spaces of different sizes
satisfying a certain weak surjectivity condition are either degenerate or of
the expected simple standard form. We will remove this weak surjectivity
assumption, thus solving completely the long standing open problem of the

Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/psu151",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some models of coronal heating suppose that convective motions at the
photosphere shuffle the footpoints of coronal magnetic fields and thereby
inject sufficient magnetic energy upward to account for observed coronal and
chromospheric energy losses in active regions. Using high-resolution
observations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope
aboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward
transport of magnetic energy --- the vertical Poynting flux, S_z --- across the
photosphere in a plage region. To do so, we combine: (i) estimates of
photospheric horizontal velocities, v_h, determined by local correlation
tracking applied to a sequence of line-of-sight magnetic field maps from the
Narrowband Filter Imager, with (ii) a vector magnetic field measurement from
the SpectroPolarimeter. Plage fields are ideal observational targets for
estimating energy injection by convection, because they are: (i) strong enough
to be measured with relatively small uncertainties; (ii) not so strong that
convection is heavily suppressed (as within umbrae); and (iii) unipolar, so S_z
in plage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux emergence)
unrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields. In this plage region, we
found that the average S_z varied in space, but was positive (upward) and
sufficient to explain coronal heating, with values near (5 +/- 1) x 10^7
erg/cm^2/s. We find the energy input per unit magnetic flux to be on the order
of 10^5 erg/s/Mx. A comparison of intensity in a Ca II image co-registered with
the this plage shows stronger spatial correlations with both total field, B,
and unsigned vertical field, |B_z|, than either S_z or horizontal field, B_h.
The observed Ca II brightness enhancement, however, probably contains a strong
contribution from a near-photosphere hot-wall effect unrelated to atmospheric
heating.

question is important not only for the efficiency and the security of
information processing, but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable
events are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures
in the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among
two or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and
difficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can
be circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical
laws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with
the recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv:1402:0489), our physical randomness
extractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily
long and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against
all-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of
implementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to
the devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary.
  Our central technical contribution, the Equivalence Lemma, provides a general
principle for proving composition security of untrusted-device protocols. It
implies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by
cross-feeding any two expansion protocols. In particular, such an unbounded
expansion can be made robust, which is known for the first time. Another
significant implication is, it enables the secure randomness generation and key
distribution using public randomness, such as that broadcast by NIST's
Randomness Beacon. Our protocol also provides a method for refuting local
hidden variable theories under a weak assumption on the available randomness
for choosing the measurement settings.

hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Whether- and when this remnant collapses to a
black hole (BH) depends primarily on the equation of state and on angular
momentum transport processes, both of which are uncertain. Here we show that
the lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the
radioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger. We employ
axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion
disks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this
delay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively
prompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form
heavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral
peak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical
ejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to
raise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that
potentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would
produce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived ~ day-long emission (a `blue
bump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial
wind. This new diagnostic of BH formation should be useful for events with a
signal to noise lower than that required for direct detection of gravitational
waveform signatures.

(around 100), suggesting that the source is viewed at small angles from the jet
axis, and could be a blazar. The X-ray observations fully confirm this
hypothesis, due to the high level and hardness of the flux. This makes SDSS
J114657.79+403708.6 the third most distant blazar known, after Q0906+693

of heavy (larger than one billion solar masses) black holes at high redshifts.

bolometric luminosity where the 2--10 keV to bolometric luminosity ratio is
$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. Additionally, Mrk 231 has
a low X-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm OX}\sim-1.7$). It is a
local example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasar that is
intrinsically X-ray weak. The weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack of
mid-infrared [O IV], [Ne V], and [Ne VI] fine-structure emission lines which
are present in sources with otherwise similar AGN properties. We argue that the
intrinsic X-ray weakness may be a result of the super-Eddington accretion
occurring in the nucleus of this ULIRG, and may also be naturally related to
the powerful wind event seen in Mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from its

on dimerized and plaquettized Heisenberg models on the square lattice.
Considering both full systems and line shaped subsystems, $SU(2)$ symmetry
breaking on the N\'eel ordered side of the transition is characterized by the
presence of a logarithmic term in the scaling of Shannon-R\'enyi entropies,
which is absent in the disordered gapped phase. Such a difference in the
scalings allows to capture the quantum critical point using Shannon-R\'enyi
entropies for line shaped subsystems of length $L$ embedded in $L\times L$
tori, as the smaller subsystem entropies are numerically accessible to much
higher precision than for the full system. Most interestingly, at the quantum
phase transition an additive subleading constant $b_\infty^{*\rm line}=0.41(1)$
emerges in the critical scaling of the line Shannon-R\'enyi entropy
$S_\infty^\text{line}$. This number appears to be universal for 3d $O(3)$
criticality, as confirmed for the finite-temperature transition in the 3d
antiferromagnetic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model. Additionally, the phases
and phase transition can be detected in several features of the participation
spectrum, consisting of the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of
the line subsystem. In particular the N\'eel ordering transition can be simply
understood in the $\{S^z\}$ basis by a confinement mechanism of ferromagnetic

formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the
blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies
in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which
most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes
morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue
early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies
are transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.
In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,
and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates
decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these
conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a
striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms
of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that
late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of
gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion
of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental
processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas
supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid
quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.
This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,
which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and
mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN
feedback.

the CQM, consistent with fluorescent and pumped Ly-alpha produced by the
ionizing and Ly-alpha continuum of the QSO. Many features present in PCWI
spectral images match those detected in narrow-band images. Filamentary
structures with narrow line profiles are detected in several cases as long as
250-400 kpc. One of these is centered at a velocity redshifted with respect to
the systemic velocity, and displays a spatially collimated and kinematically
cold line profile increasing in velocity width approaching the QSO. This
suggests that the filament gas is infalling onto the QSO, perhaps in a cold
accretion flow. Because of the strong ionizing flux, the neutral column density
is low, typically N(HI) is roughly 10E12-10E15/square-cm, and the line center
optical depth is also low (typically tau0 is less than 10), insufficient to
display well-separated double peak emission characteristic of higher line
optical depths. With a simple ionization and cloud model we can very roughly
estimate the total gas mass (log M(gas) equal to 12.5 +/- 0.5) and the total
mass (log M(tot) equal to 13.3+/- 0.5). We can also calculate a kinematic mass
from the total line profile (2x10E13 M(sun)), which agrees with the mass

here for the two-dimensional (2D) fermionic effective field theory model, which
includes only the so-called ""hot spots"" that are connected by the
spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering wavevector on a Fermi surface generated by the
2D $t-t'$ Hubbard model at low hole doping. We compute the Callan-Symanzik RG
equation up to two loops describing the flow of the single-particle Green's
function, the corresponding spectral function, the Fermi velocity, and some of
the most important order-parameter susceptibilities in the model at lower
energies. As a result, we establish that -- in addition to clearly dominant SDW
correlations -- an approximate (pseudospin) symmetry relating a short-range
\emph{incommensurate} $d$-wave charge order to the $d$-wave superconducting
order indeed emerges at lower energy scales, which is in agreement with recent
works available in the literature addressing the 2D spin-fermion model. We
derive implications of this possible electronic phase in the ongoing attempt to
describe the phenomenology of the pseudogap regime in underdoped cuprates.

proxy of the functional connectivity of in vivo neuronal tissues. Thus, the
functional complex network inferred from activity patterns is a promising way
to unravel the interplay between structure and functionality of neuronal
systems. Here, we monitor the spontaneous self-sustained dynamics in neuronal
cultures formed by interconnected aggregates of neurons (clusters). Dynamics is
characterized by the fast activation of groups of clusters in sequences termed
bursts. The analysis of the time delays between clusters' activations within
the bursts allows the reconstruction of the directed functional connectivity of
the network. We propose a method to statistically infer this connectivity and
analyze the resulting properties of the associated complex networks.
Surprisingly enough, in contrast to what has been reported for many biological
networks, the clustered neuronal cultures present assortative mixing
connectivity values, as well as a rich--club core, meaning that there is a
preference for clusters to link to other clusters that share similar functional
connectivity, which shapes a `connectivity backbone' in the network. These
results point out that the grouping of neurons and the assortative connectivity
between clusters are intrinsic survival mechanisms of the culture.

their analysis difficult and labor intensive. Mobile application analysis is
indeed inherently different from desktop application analysis: In the latter,
the interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for the malware to
correctly expose all its malicious behaviors.
  We propose a novel approach to analyze (malicious) mobile applications. The
goal is to exercise the user interface (UI) of an Android application to
effectively trigger malicious behaviors, automatically. Our key intuition is to
record and reproduce the UI interactions of a potential victim of the malware,
so as to stimulate the relevant behaviors during dynamic analysis. To make our
approach scale, we automatically re-execute the recorded UI interactions on
apps that are similar to the original ones. These characteristics make our
system orthogonal and complementary to current dynamic analysis and
UI-exercising approaches.
  We developed our approach and experimentally shown that our stimulation
allows to reach a higher code coverage than automatic UI exercisers, so to
unveil interesting malicious behaviors that are not exposed when using other
approaches.
  Our approach is also suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push
further the collection of new stimulation traces. This can potentially change
the way we conduct dynamic analysis of (mobile) applications, from fully
automatic only, to user-centric and collaborative too.

shown that a particular canonical extension, when well-defined, may be used for
the construction of Bell-type models from models of more general kinds in such
a way that the constructed model is equivalent to the original in terms of
non-locality/contextuality. This is important since on practical and

be motivated than the corresponding general notion of contextuality. We
consider examples of Bell-type models generated from some standard examples of

both the observed differential and cumulative age distributions are better

metallic nanostructures, an effect that defines the sub-field of
thermoplasmonics and has been leveraged in diverse applications from biomedical
technology to optoelectronics. Quantitatively characterizing the resulting
local temperature increase can be very challenging in isolated nanostructures.
By measuring the optically-induced change in resistance of metal nanowires with
a transverse plasmon mode, we quantitatively determine the temperature increase
in single nanostructures, with the dependence on incident polarization clearly
revealing the plasmonic heating mechanism. Computational modeling explains the
resonant and nonresonant contributions to the optical heating and the dominant

fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction provides this
protection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via
quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows
for constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with
microfabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural
choice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and
rapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The
per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99%. Here, we demonstrate a universal
set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an
average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92% and a two-qubit gate fidelity up
to 99.4%. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant
threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first
step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array
with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a
five-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit

unusual non-monotonic behavior as a function of the interaction parameters

detector directly, but also can be strongly forward-scattered by the
interstellar dust along the line of sight (LOS), leading to a detectable
diffuse halo around the X-ray point source. The geometry of small angle X-ray
scattering is straightforward, namely, the scattered photons travel longer
paths and thus arrive later than the unscattered ones; thus the delay time of
X-ray scattered halo photons can reveal information of the distances of the
interstellar dust and the point source. Here we present a study of the X-ray
scattered around IGR J17544-2619, which is one of the so-called supergiant fast
X-ray transients. IGR J17544-2619 underwent a striking outburst when observed
with Chandra on 2004 July 3, providing a near delta-function lightcurve. We
find that the X-ray scattered halo around IGR J17544-2619 is produced by two
interstellar dust clouds along the LOS. The one which is closer to the observer
gives the X-ray scattered at larger observational angles; whereas the farther
one, which is in the vicinity of the point source, explains the halo with a
smaller angular size. By comparing the observational angle of the scattered
halo photons with that predicted by different dust grain models, we are able to
determine the normalized dust distance. With the delay times of the scattered
halo photons, we can determine the point source distance, given a dust grain
model. Alternatively we can discriminate between the dust grain models, given
the point source distance.

First, a beam-steering system to begin optical observations within ~ 1 s after
location; second, a near-IR (NIR) camera viewing the same sky, for sensitivity
to extinguished bursts. These features allow measurement of the rise phase of
GRB optical-NIR emission. Thus far, the rise time and transition between prompt
and afterglow in the optical and NIR are rarely measured. Rapid-response
measurements explore many science topics including optical emission mechanisms
(synchrotron vs. SSC, photospheric emission) and jet characteristics (reverse
vs. forward shock emission, baryon-dominated vs. magnetic dominated). Rapid
optical-NIR response can measure dynamic evolution of extinction due to
vaporization of dust, and separate star system and galaxy dust extinction. We
discuss these measurements, giving reliable detection rate estimates from
analysis of Swift data and scaled Swift performance. The NGRG will explore
optical/NIR emission measured earlier than ever before, and potentially
fainter, more extinguished GRBs than ever before. In the current era, costs are
important. Our proposed modest NGRG can still produce new GRB science, while
providing rapid GRB alerts for the entire community for post-Swift GRB science.
We show that an X-ray instrument barely 1/5 the area of Swift BAT will yield a
significant fraction of Swift's detection rate: more than 65 X-ray, and with a
30 cm optical-IR telescope and modern cameras, more than 19 NIR and 14 optical
detections each year. In addition, active feedback control of the beam-steering
would remove the need for arc sec stabilization of the spacecraft, for a
substantial cost saving.

observed to undergo five outburst cycles. The periodicity of these outbursts,
and their high inferred maximum accretion rates of $\sim{\rm few}\times 10^{-4}
M_\odot {\rm yr}^{-1}$, naturally suggest Roche lobe overflow at the pericenter
of an eccentric orbit. It is, however, difficult for the Roche lobe overflow
model to explain the apparent trend of decreasing decay times over the
different outbursts while the integrated luminosity also drops. Thus if the
trend is real rather than simply being a reflection of the complex physics of
accretion disks, a different scenario may be necessary. We present a
speculative model in which, within the last decade, a high-mass giant star had
most of its envelope tidally stripped by the $\sim 10^{4-5} M_\odot$ black hole
in HLX-1, and the remaining core plus low-mass hydrogen envelope now feeds the
hole with a strong wind. This model can explain the short decay time of the
disk, and could explain the fast decrease in decay time if the wind speed
increases with time. A key prediction of this model is that there will be
excess line absorption due to the wind; our analysis does in fact find a flux
deficit in the $\sim 0.9-1.1$ keV range that is consistent with predictions,
albeit at low significance. If this idea is correct, we also expect that within
tens of years the bound material from the original disruption will return and
will make HLX-1 a persistently bright source.

at the Galactic center (GC) and put constraints on their number and central
mass distribution. Models of the GC are considered that have not yet achieved a
steady state under the influence of random gravitational encounters. Contrary
to some recent claims that mass-segregation can rapidly rebuild a density cusp
in the stars, we find that time scales associated with cusp regrowth are longer
than the Hubble time. These results cast doubts on standard models that
postulate high densities of BHs near the GC and motivate studies that start
from initial conditions which correspond to well-defined physical models. For
the first time, we consider the distribution of BHs in a dissipationless
formation model for the Milky Way nuclear cluster (NC), in which massive
stellar clusters merge in the GC to form a nucleus. We simulate the successive
inspiral of massive clusters containing an inner dense cluster of BHs. The
pre-existing mass segregation is not completely erased as the clusters are
disrupted by the massive black hole tidal field. As a result, after 12 inspiral
events a NC forms in which the BHs have higher central densities than the
stars. After evolving the model for 5-10 Gyr, the BHs do form a steep central
cusp, while the stellar distribution maintains properties that resemble those
of the Milky Way NC. Finally, we investigate the effect of BH perturbations on
the motion of the GC S-stars, as a means of constraining the number of the
perturbers. We find that reproducing the S-star orbital distribution requires
>~1000 BHs within 0.1 pc of Sgr A*. A dissipationless formation scenario for
the Milky Way NC is consistent with this lower limit and therefore could
reconcile the need for high central densities of BHs (to explain the orbits of
the S-stars), with the missing-cusp problem of the GC giant star population.

We find that increasing heterogeneous noise monotonously promotes cooperation

the complete cooperation phase. Moreover, the promotion effect of this
mechanism can be attributed to the leading role of cooperators who have the
heterogeneous noise. These type of cooperators can attract more agents

cost sensitive trends around pricing point boundaries, particularly with
long-term users of the system. Based on the results, recommendations for

The stability boundaries of the synchronized states are determined on the space

characterized by means of the persistence probability of equivalent spin
variables that define two phases, and by a magnetization-like order parameter
that measures the phase-ordering behavior. As a consequence of the global
interaction, the persistence probability saturates for all values of the
coupling parameter, in contrast to the transition observed in the temporal
behavior of the persistence in coupled maps on regular lattices. A
discontinuous transition from a non-ordered state to a collective phase-ordered
state takes place at a critical value of the coupling. On an interval of the
coupling parameter, we find three distinct realizations of the phase-ordered
state, which can be discerned by the corresponding values of the saturation
persistence. Thus, this statistical quantity can provide information about the
transient behaviors that lead to the different phase configurations in the

Intel MIC; supercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with
48,000 MIC boards to offer ~55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows
CPU-based software to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often
inferior to GPU counterparts as an MIC board contains only ~60 cores (while a
GPU board typically has over a thousand cores). Results: To better utilize
MIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we developed a new short-read
aligner MICA that is optimized in view of MICs limitation and the extra
parallelism inside each MIC core. Experiments on aligning 150bp paired-end
reads show that MICA using one MIC board is 4.9 times faster than the BWA-MEM

probability space in order to facilitate the uncertainty quantification in the
presence of discontinuities in random space. A discontinuity in random space
makes the application of generalized polynomial chaos expansion techniques
prohibitively expensive. The reason is that for discontinuous problems, the
expansion converges very slowly. An alternative to using higher terms in the
expansion is to divide the random space in smaller elements where a lower
degree polynomial is adequate to describe the randomness. In general, the
partition of the random space is a dynamic process since some areas of the
random space, particularly around the discontinuity, need more refinement than
others as time evolves. In the current work we propose a way to decide when and
where to refine the random space mesh based on the use of a reduced model. The
idea is that a good reduced model can monitor accurately, within a random space
element, the cascade of activity to higher degree terms in the chaos expansion.
In terms, this facilitates the efficient allocation of computational sources to
the areas of random space where they are more needed. For the Kraichnan-Orszag
system, the prototypical system to study discontinuities in random space, we

single-channel mesoscopic capacitor, which is composed by a quantum dot
connected to an electron reservoir via a single quantum channel. At low
frequencies, it is known that the Wigner-Smith delay time $\tau_W$ plays a
dominant role and it can be interpreted as the time delay between the current
leaving the dot and the current entering the dot. At higher frequencies, we
find that another characteristic time $\tau_S$ can also be important. It
describes the deformation of the leaving current to the entering one and hence
can be referred as the deformation time. At sufficient low temperatures, the
deformation time $\tau_S$ can be approximated from the second-order derivative
of $\tau_W$ via a simple relation $\tau""_W/\tau^3_S=24/\hbar^2$. As the
temperature increases, this relation breaks down and one has instead
$\tau""_W/\tau^3_S \to 0$ in the high temperature limit. We further show that
the deformation time $\tau_S$ can have a pronounced influence on the quantum
inductance $L_q$ of the mesoscopic capacitor, leading to features different
from the ones of the quantum capacitance. The most striking one is that $L_q$
can change its sign as the temperature increases: It can go from positive
values at low temperatures to large negative values at high temperatures. The
above results demonstrate the importance of the deformation time $\tau_S$ on
the ac conductance of the mesoscopic capacitor.

coefficients of the three highest powers of $n$ do not vary with $n$. On the
other hand, we present simple pieces for which the fourth coefficient varies
periodically. We develop detailed properties of counting quasipolynomials that
will be applied in sequels to partial queens, whose moves are subsets of those
of the queen, and the nightrider, whose moves are extended knight's moves.
  We conclude with the first, though strange, formula for the classical

range of dimensions ($2 \le d \le 8$). We have also calculated the packing and
covering densities, pair correlation function $g_2(r)$ and structure factor
$S(k)$ of the saturated RSA configurations. As the space dimension increases,
we find that pair correlations markedly diminish, consistent with a recently
proposed ""decorrelation"" principle, and the degree of ""hyperuniformity""

functional connectivity between brain areas, their directionality, the direct

ratio, reflecting direct and indirect connections. Later, a major breakthrough
was the partial directed coherence of Baccala and Sameshima (2001) for direct
connections. The simple aim of this study consists of two parts: (1) To expose
a major problem with the partial directed coherence, where it is shown that it
is affected by irrelevant connections to such an extent that it can
misrepresent the frequency response, thus defeating the main purpose for which
the measure was developed, and (2) To provide a solution to this problem,
namely the ""isolated effective coherence"", which consists of estimating the
partial coherence under a multivariate auto-regressive model, followed by
setting all irrelevant associations to zero, other than the particular
directional association of interest. Simple, realistic, toy examples illustrate
the severity of the problem with the partial directed coherence, and the
solution achieved by the isolated effective coherence. For the sake of

upgrades for VLA and GMRT, and commissioning of the aperture-array-based,

necessity to deconvolve the very many detectable sources within their wide

due to the ionosphere.

various SPAM software modifications. Nowadays, semi-automated SPAM data
reduction recipes can be applied to almost any GMRT data set, yielding good
quality continuum images comparable with (or often better than) hand-reduced

arises from the two-fold in-plane anisotropy of the complex refractive index,

unknown quantum states from a sender to a spatially distant receiver, who share
an entangled state and can communicate classically. It is the essence of many
sophisticated protocols for quantum communication and computation. In order to
realize flying qubits in these schemes, photons are an optimal choice, however,
teleporting a photonic qubit has been limited due to experimental
inefficiencies and restrictions. Major disadvantages have been the
fundamentally probabilistic nature of linear-optics Bell measurements as well
as the need for either destroying the teleported qubit or attenuating the input
qubit when the detectors do not resolve photon numbers. Here we experimentally
realize fully deterministic, unconditional quantum teleportation of photonic
qubits. The key element is to make use of a ""hybrid"" technique:
continuous-variable (CV) teleportation of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit.
By optimally tuning the receiver's feedforward gain, the CV teleporter acts as
a pure loss channel, while the input dual-rail encoded qubit, based on a single
photon, represents a quantum error detection code against amplitude damping and
hence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for
a faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect CV entangled states: the overall
transfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 for four distinct qubits, all of
them exceeding the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a
relatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more
efficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into
account only the qubit subspaces), with a fidelity comparable to the previously
reported values.

the longer separation time of modern and archaic humans. We also revisit the

conductance in Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We reveal that our theory reproduces the
previous results by Yamakage {\it et al} [Phys. Rev. B 85, 180509(R) (2012)].
We further study magneto-tunneling spectroscopy in the presence of external
magnetic fields, where the energy of quasiparticles is shifted by the Doppler
effect. By rotating magnetic fields in the basal plane, we can distinguish
between two different topological superconducting states with and without point
nodes, in their magneto-tunneling spectra.

chromospheric jets, the full Stokes spectra of the Paschen series of neutral
hydrogen in a surge and in some active region jets that took place at the solar
limb were observed on May 5, 2012, using the spectropolarimeter of the Domeless
Solar Telescope at Hida observatory, Japan. First, we inverted the Stokes
spectra taking into account only the effect of magnetic fields on the energy
structure and polarization of the hydrogen levels. Having found no definitive
evidence of the effects of electric fields in the observed Stokes profiles, we
then estimated an upper bound for these fields by calculating the polarization
degree under the magnetic field configuration derived in the first step, with
the additional presence of a perpendicular (Lorentz type) electric field of
varying strength. The inferred direction of the magnetic field on the plane of
the sky (POS) approximately aligns to the active region jets and the surge,
with magnetic field strengths in the range 10 G < B < 640 G for the surge.
Using magnetic field strengths of 70, 200, and 600 G, we obtained upper limits
for possible electric fields of 0.04, 0.3, and 0.8 V/cm, respectively. Because
the velocity of neutral atoms of hydrogen moving across the magnetic field
derived from these upper limits of the Lorentz electric field is far below the
bulk velocity of the plasma perpendicular to the magnetic field as measured by
the Doppler shift, we conclude that the neutral atoms must be highly frozen to
the magnetic field in the surge.

junctions, including non-linear setups and multi-lead configurations. A
heuristic derivation of our working equation leads to explicit expressions for
the damping and driving terms, which serve as appropriate electron sources and
sinks that effectively ""open"" the finite model system. Although the method does
not forbid it, in practice we find neither violation of Pauli's exclusion

atomistic time-dependent transport calculations in realistic molecular

stronger correlation with $r_{p}$ than $\Sigma_{n}$ and $TI$, whereas the

thoroughly by CoRot. Two dozens of frequency shifts, which are closely related
with the change in magnetic activity, have been measured. To explore the
effects of the magnetic activity on the frequency shifts, we calculate
frequency shifts for the radial and $l = 1$ p-modes of HD 49933 with the
general variational method, which evaluates the shifts using a spatial integral
of the product of a kernel and some sources. The theoretical frequency shifts
well reproduce the observation. The magnitudes and positions of the sources are
determined according to the $\chi^2$ criterion. We predict the source that
contributes to both $l = 0$ and $l = 1$ modes is located at $0.48 - 0.62$Mm
below the stellar surface. In addition, based on the assumption that $A_{0}$ is
proportional to the change in the MgII activity index $\Delta{i}_{MgII}$, we
obtained that the change of MgII index between minimum and maximum of HD 49933
cycle period is about 0.665. The magnitude of the frequency shifts compared to
the Sun already told us that HD 49933 is much more active than the Sun, which
is further confirmed in this paper. Furthermore, our calculation on the
frequency shifts of $l = 1$ modes indicates the variation of turbulent velocity
in the stellar convective zone may be an important source for the $l = 1$
shifts.

different phases: If the charge fluctuations are small, the magnetic
fluctuations confine the charges to short loops around hexagons, yielding a
gapped charge ordered phase. When the charge fluctuations dominate, the system
undergoes a quantum phase transition to a resonating plaquette phase with
ordered spins and gapless spin excitations. We find that a peculiar
conservation law is fulfilled: the electron in the chains can be divided into
two sublattices, and this division is conserved by the ring exchange term.

capture other information than strictly necessary for the recognition process,
and provides relatively good performance. A critical step in fingerprint
identification system is thinning of the input fingerprint image. The
performance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of
the thinning algorithm. So, a fast fingerprint thinning algorithm is proposed.
The algorithm works directly on the gray-scale image as binarization of
fingerprint causes many spurious minutiae and also removes many important
features. The performance of the thinning algorithm is evaluated and
experimental results show that the proposed thinning algorithm is both fast and
accurate. A new minutiae-based fingerprint matching technique is proposed. The
main idea is that each fingerprint is represented by a minutiae table of just
two columns in the database. The number of different minutiae types
(terminations and bifurcations) found in each track of a certain width around
the core point of the fingerprint is recorded in this table. Each row in the
table represents a certain track, in the first column, the number of
terminations in each track is recorded, in the second column, the number of
bifurcations in each track is recorded. The algorithm is rotation and
translation invariant, and needs less storage size. Experimental results show
that recognition accuracy is 98%, with Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2%. Finally,
the integrity of the data transmission via communication channels must be
secure all the way from the scanner to the application. After applying Gaussian
noise addition, and JPEG compression with high and moderate quality factors on
the watermarked fingerprint images, recognition accuracy decreases slightly to
reach 96%.

Careful selection of the wavelength results in one of the pair of atoms having
sufficient velocity to exactly cancel that of the parent molecule, and it

two opposing neodymium permanent magnets. Dissociation of molecules at the

or potential modulations influencing the electronic transport properties of
graphene based devices. However, their impact on the local mechanical
properties of graphene is much less studied. Here we show that graphene near a
metallic interface can exhibit a set of ripples self-organized in domains whose
topographic roughness is controlled by the tip bias of a scanning tunneling
microscope. The reconstruction from topographic images of graphene bending
energy maps sheds light on the local electro-mechanical response of graphene
under STM imaging and unveils the role of the stress induced by the vicinity of
graphene/metal interface in the formation and the manipulation of these
ripples. Since microscopic rippling is one of the important factors that limit
charge carrier mobility in graphene, the control of rippling with a gate
voltage may have important consequences in the conductance of graphene devices
where transverse electric fields are created by contactless suspended gate
electrodes. This opens also the possibility to dynamically control the local
morphology of graphene nanomembranes.

underdepleted residual-energy detector has been performed. Five different bias
voltages have been used, one corresponding to full depletion, the others
associated with a depleted layer ranging from 90% to 60% of the detector
thickness. Fragment identification has been performed using either the DE-E
technique or Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA). Both detectors are reverse mounted:
particles enter from the low field side, to enhance the PSA performance. The
achieved charge and mass resolution has been quantitatively expressed using a
Figure of Merit (FoM). Charge collection efficiency has been evaluated and the
possibility of energy calibration corrections has been considered. We find that
the DE-E performance is not affected by incomplete depletion even when only 60%
of the wafer is depleted. Isotopic separation capability improves at lower bias
voltages with respect to full depletion, though charge identification
thresholds are higher than at full depletion. Good isotopic identification via
PSA has been obtained from a partially depleted detector whose doping
uniformity is not good enough for isotopic identification at full depletion.

validate this idea by showing that it justifies the use of low-momenta n-point

These results enable the calculation of distinguishability in quantum field

incompressible flow in terms of three invariants that generalize to three
dimensions the now well-known law of conservation of vorticity along fluid
particle trajectories for two-dimensional flow. This has very recently been
used to prove analyticity in time of fluid particle trajectories for 3D
incompressible Euler flow and can be extended to compressible flow, in
particular to cosmological dark matter. Hankel showed that Cauchy's formulation
gives a very simple Lagrangian derivation of the Helmholtz vorticity-flux
invariants and, in the middle of the proof, derived an intermediate result
which is the conservation of the circulation of the velocity around a closed
contour moving with the fluid. This circulation theorem was to be rediscovered
independently by William Thomson (Kelvin) in 1869. Cauchy's invariants were
only occasionally cited in the 19th century --- besides Hankel, foremost by

Short-range correlations are in such a system conveniently described by using a

chemistry. To account for long-range polarization effects, on the other hand,
we adopt the approximation of a dielectric continuum. Having as ""uncorrelated""
reference the Hartree-Fock band structure, the post-Hartree-Fock treatment is
carried out in terms of localized Wannier functions derived from the
Hartree-Fock solution. The computed correlation-induced corrections to the
relevant real-space matrix elements are important and give rise to a strong
reduction, in the range of $50\%$, of the initial Hartree-Fock gap. While our
final results for the indirect and direct gaps, 5.4 and 6.9 eV, respectively,
compare very well with the experimental data, the width of the valence band
comes out by $10$ to $15\%$ too large as compared to experiment. This

described vesselness filter via scale-orientation scores performs considerably
better at enhancing vessels throughout crossings and bifurcations than the
Frangi version. Both methods are evaluated on a public dataset. Performance is
measured by comparing ground truth data to the segmentation results obtained by
basic thresholding and morphological component analysis of the filtered images.

inflation model up to a scale which can be almost as high as the Planck mass.
This is achieved by coupling the inflaton to the Lorentz-violating sector
described by the Einstein-aether theory or its khronometric version. Compared
to previous works on ghost inflation our setup allows to go beyond the study of
small perturbations and include the background dynamics in a unified framework.
In the specific regime when the expansion of the Universe is dominated by the
kinetic energy of the inflaton we find that the model predicts rather high
tensor-to-scalar ratio r ~ 0.02 $\div$ 0.2 and non-Gaussianity of equilateral
type with f_NL in the range from -50 to -5.

thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies. These anomalies are observed at
surprisingly low TBA mole fraction, with $x_{\text{TBA}} \approx 0.03 - 0.07$.
We demonstrate here that the origin of the anomalies lies in the local
structural changes that occur due to self-aggregation of TBA molecules. We
observe a percolation transition of the TBA molecules at $x_{\text{TBA}}
\approx 0.05$. We note that ""islands"" of TBA clusters form even below this mole
fraction, while a large spanning cluster emerges above that mole fraction. At
this percolation threshold, we observe a lambda-type divergence in the
fluctuation of the size of the largest TBA cluster, reminiscent of a critical
point. Alongside, the structure of water is also perturbed, albeit weakly, by
the aggregation of TBA molecules. There is a monotonic decrease in the
tetrahedral order parameter of water, while the dipole moment correlation shows
a weak non-linearity. Interestingly, water molecules themselves exhibit a
reverse percolation transition at higher TBA concentration, $x_{\text{TBA}}
\approx 0.45$, where large spanning water clusters now break-up into small
clusters. This is accompanied by significant divergence of the fluctuations in
the size of largest water cluster. This second transition gives rise to another
set of anomalies around. Both the percolation transitions can be regarded as
manifestations of Janus effect at small molecular level.

phase cluster synchronization of network nodes. In both cases the localization
nodes remain unaltered in course of the dynamics, i.e., the localization is
nonwandering. Moreover this is predictable: the localization nodes are found to
have specific dynamical and topological properties and they can be found
without computing of the covariant vectors. This is an example of explicit
relations between the system topology, its phase space dynamics, and the
associated tangent space dynamics of covariant Lyapunov vectors.

first search in data from the Virgo laser interferometric gravitational wave
detector for periodic gravitational waves from a priori unknown, isolated
rotating neutron stars. We searched a frequency $f_0$ range from 100 Hz to 1
kHz and the frequency dependent spindown $f_1$ range from $-1.6\,(f_0/100\,{\rm
Hz}) \times 10^{-9}\,$ Hz/s to zero. A large part of this frequency - spindown
space was unexplored by any of the all-sky searches published so far. Our
method consisted of a coherent search over two-day periods using the
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic, followed by a search for coincidences among the
candidates from the two-day segments. We have introduced a number of novel
techniques and algorithms that allow the use of the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) algorithm in the coherent part of the search resulting in a fifty-fold
speed-up in computation of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with respect to the
algorithm used in the other pipelines. No significant gravitational wave signal
was found. The sensitivity of the search was estimated by injecting signals
into the data. In the most sensitive parts of the detector band more than 90%
of signals would have been detected with dimensionless gravitational-wave
amplitude greater than $5 \times 10^{-24}$.

induced by secular processes, in the disk of an $N$-body Milky Way-like galaxy.
We assign a [Fe/H] value to each particle of the simulation according to an
initial, cosmologically motivated, radial chemical distribution and let the
disk dynamically evolve for 6 Gyr. This direct approach allows us to take into
account only the effects of dynamical evolution and to gauge how and to what
extent they affect the initial chemical conditions. The initial [Fe/H]
distribution increases with R in the inner disk up to R ~ 10 kpc and decreases
for larger R. We find that the initial chemical profile does not undergo major
transformations after 6 Gyr of dynamical evolution. The final radial chemical
gradients predicted by the model in the solar neighborhood are positive and of
the same order of those recently observed in the Milky Way thick disk.
  We conclude that: 1) the spatial chemical imprint at the time of disk
formation is not washed out by secular dynamical processes, and 2) the observed
radial gradient may be the dynamical relic of a thick disk originated from a
stellar population showing a positive chemical radial gradient in the inner
regions.

High power conversion efficiency can be realised in both mesoporous and

context of the materials chemistry and physics of the bulk perovskite as
described by electronic structure calculations. In addition to the basic
optoelectronic properties essential for an efficient photovoltaic device
(spectrally suitable band gap, high optical absorption, low carrier effective
masses), the materials are structurally and compositionally flexible. As we
show, hybrid perovskites exhibit spontaneous electric polarisation; we also
suggest ways in which this can be tuned through judicious choice of the organic
cation. The presence of ferroelectric domains will result in internal junctions
that may aid separation of photoexcited electron and hole pairs, and reduction
of recombination through segregation of charge carriers. The combination of
high dielectric constant and low effective mass promotes both Wannier-Mott
exciton separation and effective ionisation of donor and acceptor defects. The
photoferroic effect could be exploited in nanostructured films to generate a
higher open circuit voltage and may contribute to the current-voltage
hysteresis observed in perovskite solar cells.

functions: a set of learning curves, a set of brain signals, a set of spatial

each individual function $g_{i}\left(x\right)$ is assumed to be a variation
around some shared mean $f(x)$. Gaussian processes provide an elegant way of
constructing such additive models, but suffer from computational difficulties
arising from the matrix operations that need to be performed. Recently Heersink
& Furrer have shown that functional additive model give rise to covariance
matrices that have a specific form they called quasi-Kronecker (QK), whose
inverses are relatively tractable. We show that under additional assumptions
the two-level additive model leads to a class of matrices we call restricted
quasi-Kronecker, which enjoy many interesting properties. In particular, we
formulate matrix factorisations whose complexity scales only linearly in the
number of functions in latent field, an enormous improvement over the cubic
scaling of na\""ive approaches. We describe how to leverage the properties of
rQK matrices for inference in Latent Gaussian Models.

improved CDP version, based on five layouts including the Structure of Arrays
(SoA), the Array of Sturcutes (AoS), the Array of aligned Sturcutes (AoaS), the
Structure of Arrays of aligned Structures (SoAoS), and the Hybrid layout.
Experimental results show that: the layouts AoS and AoaS achieve better
performance than the layout SoA for both the naive version and tiled version,
while the layout SoA is the best choice for the improved CDP version. We also
observe that: for the two combined data layouts (the SoAoS and the Hybrid),
there are no notable performance gains when compared to other three basic
layouts. We recommend that: in practical applications, the layout AoaS is the
best choice since the tiled version is the fastest one among the three versions

require the new composite states to come in pairs of rather heavy, close to

actually be lighter without clashing with experimental bounds. As an example, I
consider a composite model with a light pseudovector resonance that couples to
the Standard Model gauge boson, fermion and scalar fields. I show how such a
resonance leaves basically no imprint on the NLO corrections to the Standard
Model. This happens not through parameter tuning, but rather as a consequence
of generic properties of realistic UV completions. This pseudovector is mostly
unconstrained by existing data and could be as light as 600 GeV. In the last

wireless networks face the challenge of nodes with heterogeneous transmission
power. However, for more realistic models of wireless communication only few
algorithmic results are known. In this paper we consider nodes with arbitrary,
possibly variable, transmission power in the so-called physical or SINR model.
Our first result is a bound on the probabilistic interference from all
simultaneously transmitting nodes on receivers. This result implies that
current local broadcasting algorithms can be generalized to the case of
non-uniform transmission power with minor changes. The algorithms run in
$\O(\Gamma^{2} \Delta \log n)$ time slots if the maximal degree $\Delta$ is
known, and $\O((\Delta + \log n)\Gamma^{2} \log n)$ otherwise, where $\Gamma$
is the ratio between the maximal and the minimal transmission range. The broad
applicability of our result on bounding the interference is further
highlighted, by generalizing a distributed coloring algorithm to this setting.

is based on minimizing the mean-payoff, i.e., the long-run average amount of
resources (""energy"") consumed per transition. However, this approach inherently
assumes that the energy source has an unbounded capacity, which is not always
realistic. For example, an autonomous robotic device has a battery of finite
capacity that has to be recharged periodically, and the total amount of energy
consumed between two successive charging cycles is bounded by the capacity.
Hence, a controller minimizing the mean-payoff must obey this restriction. In
this paper we study the controller synthesis problem for consumption systems
with a finite battery capacity, where the task of the controller is to minimize
the mean-payoff while preserving the functionality of the system encoded by a
given linear-time property. We show that an optimal controller always exists,
and it may either need only finite memory or require infinite memory (it is
decidable in polynomial time which of the two cases holds). Further, we show
how to compute an effective description of an optimal controller in polynomial
time. Finally, we consider the limit values achievable by larger and larger
battery capacity, show that these values are computable in polynomial time, and
we also analyze the corresponding rate of convergence. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first results about optimizing the long-run running
costs in systems with bounded energy stores.

the analysis here shows that the corresponding electric-field polarization
trajectories display topologies very different from those expected from
classical electrodynamics. Rather than incompatibility with the usual classical
model, this result demonstrates the dynamical richness of quantum motions,
determined by local variations of the system quantum phase in the corresponding
(polarization) configuration space, absent in classical-like models. These
variations can be related to the evolution in time of the phase, but also to
its dependence on configurational coordinates, which is the crucial factor to
generate motion in the case of stationary states like those here considered. In
this regard, for completeness these results are compared those obtained from

with a mass ratio of 3.848, and it is a W-type contact binary where the less
massive component is slightly hotter than the more massive one. The asymmetries
of the light curves are explained by the presence of a dark spot on the more
massive component. The derived orbital inclination (i = 83.6o) indicates that
it is a total eclipsing binary, which suggests that the determined parameters
are reliable. The orbital period may show a long-term increase at a rate of P =
+2.48 x 10-6 days/year that reveals a rapid mass transfer from the less massive
component to the more massive one. However, more observations are needed to
confirm this conclusion. The presence of an intermediate-contact binary in an

very short pre-contact timescale. The presence of a third body or/and stellar

of signals and the additivity of interference. As such, they are closer to
reality than other models. However, nearly all theoretic work in the SINR model
depends on the assumption of smooth geometric decay, one that is true in free
space but is far off in actual environments. The challenge is to model
realistic environments, including walls, obstacles, reflections and anisotropic
antennas, without making the models algorithmically impractical or analytically
intractable.
  We present a simple solution that allows the modeling of arbitrary static
situations by moving from geometry to arbitrary decay spaces. The complexity of
a setting is captured by a metricity parameter Z that indicates how far the
decay space is from satisfying the triangular inequality. All results that hold
in the SINR model in general metrics carry over to decay spaces, with the
resulting time complexity and approximation depending on Z in the same way that
the original results depends on the path loss term alpha. For distributed
algorithms, that to date have appeared to necessarily depend on the planarity,
we indicate how they can be adapted to arbitrary decay spaces.
  Finally, we explore the dependence on Z in the approximability of core
problems. In particular, we observe that the capacity maximization problem has
exponential upper and lower bounds in terms of Z in general decay spaces. In
Euclidean metrics and related growth-bounded decay spaces, the performance
depends on the exact metricity definition, with a polynomial upper bound in
terms of Z, but an exponential lower bound in terms of a variant parameter phi.
On the plane, the upper bound result actually yields the first approximation of
a capacity-type SINR problem that is subexponential in alpha.

speed of sound technique (RSST), which is simple to implement and requires only
local communication in the parallel computation. In addition, the RSST allows
us to expand the computational domain upward to about $0.99 R_{\odot}$ as it
can also handle compressible flows. Using this approach, we study the solar
convection zone on the global scale, including small-scale near-surface
convection. In particular, we investigate the influence of the top boundary
condition on the convective structure throughout the convection zone as well as
on small-scale dynamo action. Our main conclusions are: 1. The small-scale
downflows generated in the near-surface layer penetrate into deeper layers to
some extent and excite small-scale turbulence in the region $>0.9R_\odot$,
where $R_\odot$ is the solar radius. 2. In the deeper convection zone
($<0.9R_\odot$), the convection is not influenced by the location of the upper
boundary. 3. Using an LES approach, we can achieve small-scale dynamo action
and maintain a field of about $0.15-0.25 B_\mathrm{eq}$ throughout the
convection zone, where $B_\mathrm{eq}$ is the equipartition magnetic field to
the kinetic energy. 4. The overall dynamo efficiency varies significantly in
the convection zone as a consequence of the downward directed Poynting flux and
the depth variation of the intrinsic convective scales.

Fourier Transform, we give a inequality that allows us to relate the minimizer

maintaining the integrity and coherence of the content is integral for the
system's success. To do so, we present an automatic method for generating
content about everyday activities through combining computer science techniques
with the crowd. We use the crowd in three basic ways: to capture a database of
scenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements
for specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting
scenarios. We found that the generated scenarios were rated as reliable and
consistent by the crowd when compared to the scenarios that were originally
captured. We also compared the generated scenarios to those created by
traditional planning techniques. We found that both methods were equally
effective in generated reliable and consistent scenarios, yet the main
advantages of our approach is that the content we generate is more varied and
much easier to create. We have begun integrating this approach within a

molecular gas close to the nebula, the location of the PDR, and the shape of
radio continuum emission suggest that the ionized gas is expanding against its
parental cloud, and confirm the ""champagne flow"" scenario. We have identified
several molecular clumps and determined some of their physical and dynamical
properties. We have compared the physical properties of the clumps to
investigate how the molecular gas has been affected by the HII region. Clumps
adjacent to the ionization fronts of NGC 3503 and/or the bright rimmed cloud
SFO62 have been heated and compressed by the ionized gas, but their line width
is not different to those that are too distant to the ionization fronts. We
identified several candidate YSOs in the region. Their spatial distribution
suggests that stellar formation might have been boosted by the expansion of the

coupled transport equations for gluons and quarks (and antiquarks) are derived
within the diffusion approximation of the Boltzmann equation, with only 2<-> 2
processes included in the collision term. Then, these transport equations are
solved numerically in order to study the thermalization of the quark-gluon
plasma. At initial time, we assume that no quarks or antiquarks are present and
we choose the gluon distribution in the form f = f_0 theta (1-p/Q_s) with Q_s
the saturation momentum and f_0 a constant. The subsequent evolution of systems
may, or may not, lead to the formation of a (transient) Bose condensate,
depending on the value of f_0. In fact, we observe, depending on the value of
f_0, three different patterns: (a) thermalization without gluon Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) for f_0 < f_{0t}, (b) thermalization with transient BEC for
f_{0t} < f_0 < f_{0c}, and (c) thermalization with BEC for f_{0c} < f_0. The
values of f_{0t} and f_{0c} depend on N_f. When f_0> 1 > f_{0c}, the onset of
BEC occurs at a finite time t_c ~ 1/((alpha_s f_0)^2 Q_s). We also find that
quark production slows down the thermalization process: the equilibration time

(KS) density functional theory (DFT). The equivalence between either a local or
global minimizer of the KS total energy minimization problem and the solution
to the KS equation is established under certain assumptions. The nonzero charge
densities of a strong local minimizer are shown to be bounded below by a
positive constant uniformly. We analyze the self-consistent field (SCF)
iteration by formulating the KS equation as a fixed point map with respect to
the potential. The Jacobian of these fixed point maps is derived explicitly.
Both global and local convergence of the simple mixing scheme can be
established if the gap between the occupied states and unoccupied states is
sufficiently large. This assumption can be relaxed if the charge density is
computed using the Fermi-Dirac distribution and it is not required if there is
no exchange correlation functional in the total energy functional. Although our
assumption on the gap is very stringent and is almost never satisfied in
reality, our analysis is still valuable for a better understanding of the KS
minimization problem, the KS equation and the SCF iteration.

established the first table of the eigenmode frequencies, widths, and heights

organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations.
Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation
is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying a lower level of organization, by
their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of
mechanisms lying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational
advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when
plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations,
create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another
case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the
mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic
theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase
in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be
relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent
behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses
indicate that the two well-known traverses-neural plasticity and neural
activity-are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one
additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution
in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory.
The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory
gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.

can see their shared personal items. Nonetheless, most approaches focus on
enhancing privacy in Social Networks through improved privacy settings,
neglecting the fact that privacy awareness is a prerequisite for privacy
control. Social Network users first need to know about privacy issues before
being able to make adjustments. In this paper, we introduce Friend Inspector, a
serious game that allows its users to playfully increase their privacy
awareness on Facebook. Since its launch, Friend Inspector has attracted a
significant number of visitors, emphasising the need for better tools to
understand privacy settings on Social Networks.

We have not completed full analyses",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based brain computer interfaces (BCI) can
potentially control upper extremity prostheses to restore independent function
to paralyzed individuals. However, current research is mostly restricted to the
offline decoding of finger or 2D arm movement trajectories, and these results
are modest. This study seeks to improve the fundamental understanding of the
ECoG signal features underlying upper extremity movements to guide better BCI
design. Subjects undergoing ECoG electrode implantation performed a series of
elementary upper extremity movements in an intermittent flexion and extension
manner. It was found that movement velocity, $\dot\theta$, had a high positive
(negative) correlation with the instantaneous power of the ECoG high-$\gamma$
band (80-160 Hz) during flexion (extension). Also, the correlation was low
during idling epochs. Visual inspection of the ECoG high-$\gamma$ band revealed
power bursts during flexion/extension events that have a waveform that strongly
resembles the corresponding flexion/extension event as seen on $\dot\theta$.
These high-$\gamma$ bursts were present in all elementary movements, and were
spatially distributed in a somatotopic fashion. Thus, it can be concluded that
the high-$\gamma$ power of ECoG strongly encodes for movement trajectories, and
can be used as an input feature in future BCIs.

  Transaction Data Set","8 Pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Introduction: The United States Federal Government operates one of the worlds
largest medical insurance programs, Medicare, to ensure payment for clinical
services for the elderly, illegal aliens and those without the ability to pay
for their care directly. This paper evaluates the Medicare 2011 Transaction
Data Set which details the transfer of funds from Medicare to private and
public clinical care facilities for specific clinical services for the
operational year 2011. Methods: Data mining was conducted to establish the
relationships between reported and computed transaction values in the data set
to better understand the drivers of Medicare transactions at a programmatic
level. Results: The models averaged 88 for average model accuracy and 38 for
average Kappa during training. Some reported classes are highly independent
from the available data as their predictability remains stable regardless of
redaction of supporting and contradictory evidence. DRG or procedure type
appears to be unpredictable from the available financial transaction values.
Conclusions: Overlay hypotheses such as charges being driven by the volume
served or DRG being related to charges or payments is readily false in this
analysis despite 28 million Americans being billed through Medicare in 2011 and
the program distributing over 70 billion in this transaction set alone. It may
be impossible to predict the dependencies and data structures the payer of last
resort without data from payers of first and second resort. Political concerns
about Medicare would be better served focusing on these first and second order
payer systems as what Medicare costs is not dependent on Medicare itself.
