the frequency-related delay of radiation in broadband Jovian radio storms
consisting of periodic S-bursts (S-burst trains) at 16 to 30 MHz. It was found
that up to 1% of bursts in a train are of distorted meandering shape in dynamic
spectrum, where the emission from one radio source was observed at several
frequencies simultaneously. It is difficult to explain such spectra in terms of
radio waves beaming or causality without significant frequency-related delay of
radio emission. We found experimentally that the frequency drift rate of middle
lines of such events coincides with the drift rate of disturbances in common
S-bursts. This indicates a general distortion of the dynamic spectrum of
S-bursts. As a result, the correlation method for the measurement of the
spectral distortion is proposed. Using this method, we found the approximation
coefficients for the distortion in 32 spectra of 8 Io-B storms. The corrected
spectra formally show that S-burst trains do not move mainly outward from
Jupiter, as it is usually assumed, but fly in the opposite direction. Our
simulation confirms that the dispersion is capable in principle to reproduce
the found spectral distortion. Hence, the dispersion-like phenomena in Jovian
S-bursts deserve discussion because they have no satisfactory explanations in

show that certain combinations of polarimetric observables exhibit features

estimate fundamental parameters such as the inclination angle, the disk density

graphene nanostructures, including graphene ribbons. We discuss several
possible strategies to extend these plasmons towards the visible and near

prescriptions based on geometry to increase the level of electrostatic doping
without causing electrical breakdown. Results are also presented for plasmons
in highly-doped single-wall carbon nanotubes, which exhibit similar
characteristics as narrow ribbons and show a relatively small dependence on the
chirality of the tubes. We further discuss perfect light absorption by a
single-atom carbon layer, which we illustrate by investigating arrays of
ribbons using fully analytical expressions. Finally, we explore the possibility
of exploiting optically pumped transient plasmons in graphene, whereby the
optically heated graphene valence band can sustain collective plasmon
oscillations similar to those of highly doped graphene, and well-defined during
the picosecond time window over which the electron is at an elevated

competes with the recent sparse coding classifiers, when the dictionary is
learned appropriately. The adopted classification scheme further requires less

temporal variation of the interstellar helium flow over the last forty years.
Concerning the recent IBEX-Lo direct detection of Helium neutrals, there are
two types of precise and unambiguous measurements which do not rely on the
exact response of the instrument: the count rate maxima as a function of the
spin angle, which determines the ecliptic latitude of the flow, and the count
rate maxima as a function of IBEX longitude, which determines a tight
relationship between the ecliptic longitude of the flow and its velocity far
from the Sun. These measurements provide parameters (and couples of parameters
in the second case) remarkably similar to the canonical, old values. In
contrast, the preferential choice of a lower velocity and higher longitude
reported before from IBEX data is based only on the count rate variation (at
each spin phase maximum) as a function of the satellite longitude, when
drifting across the region of high fluxes. We have examined the consequences of
dead time counting effects, and conclude that their inclusion at a realistic
level is sufficient to reconcile the data with the old parameters, calling for
further investigations. We discuss the analyses of the STEREO pickup ion (PUI)
data and argue that the statistical method that has been preferred to infer the
neutral flow longitude (instead of the more direct method based on the PUI
maximum flux directions), is not appropriate. Moreover, transport effects may
have been significant at the very weak solar activity level of 2007-2009, in
which case the longitudes of the PUI maxima are only upper limits on the flow
longitude. Finally, we found that the use of some flow longitude determinations
based on UV glow data are not adequate. At variance with recent conclusions we
find no evidence for a temporal variability of the interstellar helium flow.

inexperienced user when applying the deductive approach. A system, and its
architecture, for the deduction-based verification of workflow-oriented models

The algorithm for an automatic generation of logical specifications is

for BPMN, which is a standard and dominant notation for the modeling of
business processes. The main idea for the approach is to consider patterns,
defined in terms of temporal logic,as a kind of (logical) primitives which
enable the transformation of models to temporal logic formulas constituting a
logical specification. Automation of the generation process is crucial for
bridging the gap between intuitiveness of the deductive reasoning and the
difficulty of its practical application in the case when logical specifications

hopefully enhancing our understanding of, the deduction-based formal

Then, we extend the study of the dynamic to the half-line $\mathbb{R}^{-}$, in
connection with the 3x-1 problem. Finally, we analyze the mean behaviour of
real iterations near infinity and present a method based on a heuristic
argument by R. E. Crandall in the discrete case. It follows that the average

player has a quNit (a normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space
${\cal H}_N$) upon which he applies his strategy (a matrix $U \in$ SU(N)). The
players draw their payoffs from a state $|\Psi \ra=J^\dagger U_1 \otimes U_2
J|\Psi_0 \ra \in {\cal H}_N \otimes {\cal H}_N $. Here $|\Psi_0 \ra$ and $J$
(both determined by the game's referee) are respectively an {\it unentangled}
2-quNit (pure) state and a unitary operator such that $|\Psi_1 \ra \equiv
J|\Psi_0 \ra \in {\cal H}_N \otimes {\cal H}_N$ is {\it partially entangled}.
The existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the quantum game is
intimately related to the degree of entanglement of $|\Psi_1 \ra$. Hence, it is
practical to design the entangler $J=J(\beta)$ to be dependent on a {\it
single} real parameter $\beta$ that controls the degree of entanglement of
$|\Psi_1 \ra$, such that its von-Neumann entropy $ {\cal S}_N(\beta)$ is
continuous and obtains {\it any value} in $[0, \log N]$. Moreover, an efficient
control of $ {\cal S}_N(\beta)$ is possible only if $|\Psi_1 \ra$ appears in a
Schmidt decomposed form. Designing $J(\beta)$ for $N=2$ is quite standard.
Extension to $N>2$ is not obvious, and here we suggest an algorithm to achieve
it.

Universe which eventually grew into the large-scale structure we observe today,
and thereby provides an indirect probe of inflation or other
structure-formation mechanisms. Here, we introduce a new method to estimate
this spectrum from the empirical power spectrum of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) maps.
  A sparsity-based linear inversion method, coined \textbf{PRISM}, is
presented. This technique leverages a sparsity prior on features in the
primordial power spectrum in a wavelet basis to regularise the inverse problem.
This non-parametric approach does not assume a strong prior on the shape of the
primordial power spectrum, yet is able to correctly reconstruct its global
shape as well as localised features. These advantages make this method robust
for detecting deviations from the currently favoured scale-invariant spectrum.
  We investigate the strength of this method on a set of WMAP 9-year simulated
data for three types of primordial power spectra: a nearly scale-invariant
spectrum, a spectrum with a small running of the spectral index, and a spectrum
with a localised feature. This technique proves to easily detect deviations
from a pure scale-invariant power spectrum and is suitable for distinguishing
between simple models of the inflation. We process the WMAP 9-year data and
find no significant departure from a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum with
the spectral index $n_s = 0.972$.
  A high resolution primordial power spectrum can be reconstructed with this
technique, where any strong local deviations or small global deviations from a
pure scale-invariant spectrum can easily be detected.

Deductive reasoning is an important alternative among other formal methods.
However, logical specifications, considered as sets of temporal logic formulas,

Organizing activity diagrams into predefined workflow patterns enables

Researchers have used trip distance distribution, radius of gyration of

during natural disasters is limited owing to both a lack of empirical data and
the low precision of available data. Here, we studied human mobility using
high-resolution movement data from individuals in New York City during and for
several days after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We found the human movements
followed truncated power-law distributions during and after Hurricane Sandy,
although the {\beta} value was noticeably larger during the first 24 hours
after the storm struck. Also, we examined two parameters: the center of mass
and the radius of gyration of each individual's movements. We found that their
values during perturbation states and steady states are highly correlated,
suggesting human mobility data obtained in steady states can possibly predict
the perturbation state. Our results demonstrate that human movement
trajectories experienced significant perturbations during hurricanes, but also
exhibited high resilience. We expect the study will stimulate future research
on the perturbation and inherent resilience of human mobility under the
influence of natural disasters. For example, mobility patterns in coastal urban
areas could be examined as tropical cyclones approach, gain or dissipate in
strength, and as the path of the storm changes. Understanding nuances of human
mobility under the influence of disasters will enable more effective
evacuation, emergency response planning and development of strategies and
policies to reduce fatality, injury, and economic loss.

suppression of proximity-induced superconductivity is a direct consequence of
the emergence of quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase of the

  (i) $G'=G+uv$ for some vertices $u,v\in V(G)$ such that no facial cycle of
$G$ contains both $u$ and $v$, or
  (ii) $G'=G+u_1v_1+u_2v_2$ for some distinct vertices $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2\in
V(G)$ such that $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2$ appear on some facial cycle of $G$ in the
order listed.
  This is a lemma to be used in other papers. In fact, we prove a more general
theorem, where we relax the connectivity assumptions, do not assume that $G$ is
planar, and consider subdivisions rather than minors. Instead of face
boundaries we work with a collection of cycles that cover every edge twice and
have pairwise connected intersection. Finally, we prove a version of this
result that applies when $G\backslash X$ is planar for some set $X\subseteq
V(G)$ of size at most $k$, but $H\backslash Y$ is non-planar for every set
$Y\subseteq V(H)$ of size at most $k$.

print scholarship (book, reports, article) to online resources via

scaling number of parallel reads while keeping the rate to be an arbitrarily
high constant. It further shows that this is possible with the minimum distance
arbitrarily close to the Singleton bound. This paper also presents a bound
demonstrating a trade-off between minimum distance, availability and locality.

conservation imposes severe constraints on the length scale of production of a
single hadron with high pT. As a result, the main reason for hadron quenching

have an on-line complexity of $\mathcal{O}(k^{p+1})$, where $k$ is the
dimension of POD basis, and therefore is independent of full space dimension.
However it is efficient only for quadratic nonlinear terms since for higher
nonlinearities standard POD proves to be less time consuming once the POD basis
dimension $k$ is increased. Numerical experiments are carried out with a two
dimensional shallow water equation (SWE) test problem to compare the
performance of tensorial POD, standard POD, and POD/Discrete Empirical

decreases by $76\times$ times the computational cost of the on-line stage of
standard POD for configurations using more than $300,000$ model variables. The

AUTHORIS is software developed to enhance authority control and information

  Design / methodology / approach: The article analyzes different methods
previously developed for authority control as well as IFLA and ALA standards
for managing bibliographic records. Semantic Web technologies are also
evaluated. AUTHORIS relies on Drupal and incorporates the protocols of Dublin
Core, SIOC, SKOS and FOAF. The tool has also taken into account the
obsolescence of MARC and its substitution by FRBR and RDA. Its effectiveness
was evaluated applying a learning test proposed by RDA. Over 80 percent of the
actions were carried out correctly.
  Findings: The use of learning rules and the facilities of linked data make it
easier for information organizations to reutilize products for authority
control and distribute them in a fair and efficient manner.
  Research limitations / implications: The ISAD-G records were the ones
presenting most errors. EAD was found to be second in the number of errors
produced. The rest of the formats --MARC 21, Dublin Core, FRAD, RDF, OWL, XBRL
and FOAF-- showed fewer than 20 errors in total.
  Practical implications: AUTHORIS offers institutions the means of sharing
data with a high level of stability, helping to detect records that are
duplicated and contributing to lexical disambiguation and data enrichment.
  Originality / value: The software combines the facilities of linked data, the
potency of the algorithms for converting bibliographic data, and the precision
of learning rules.

the dynamical evolution of the Solar System. Prior investigation into their
origin has focused on two source regions: the Oort cloud and the Scattered
Disc. From the former it has been difficult to reproduce the non-isotropic,
prograde skew in the inclination distribution of the observed HTCs without
invoking a multi-component Oort cloud model and specific fading of the comets.
The Scattered Disc origin fares better but suffers from needing an order of
magnitude more mass than is currently advocated by theory and observations.
Here we revisit the Oort cloud origin and include cometary fading. Our
observational sample stems from the JPL catalogue. We only keep comets
discovered and observed after 1950 but place no a priori restriction on the
maximum perihelion distance of observational completeness. We then numerically
evolve half a million comets from the Oort cloud through the realm of the giant
planets and keep track of their number of perihelion passages with perihelion
distance q<2.5AU, below which the activity is supposed to increase
considerably. We can simultaneously fit the HTC inclination and semi-major axis
distribution very well with a power law fading function of the form m^-k, where
m is the number of perihelion passages with q<2.5 AU and k is the fading index.
We match both the inclination and semi-major axis distributions when k~1 and
the maximum imposed perihelion distance of the observed sample is q~1.8AU. The
value of k is higher than the one obtained for the Long-Period Comets (LPCs),
with k~0.7. This increase in k is most likely the result of cometary surface
processes. We argue the HTC sample is now most likely complete for q<1.8AU. We
calculate that the steady-state number of active HTCs with diameter D>2.3km and
q<1.8AU is of the order of 100.

self-consistent treatment for the hot halo gas configuration and the assembly
of central disks. Using the model, we explore a preventative feedback model, in
which the circum-halo medium is assumed to be preheated up to a certain entropy
level by early starbursts or other processes, and compare it with an ejective
feedback model, in which baryons are first accreted into dark matter halos and
subsequently ejected out by feedback. The model demonstrates that when the
medium is preheated to an entropy comparable to the halo virial entropy the
baryon accretion can be largely reduced and delayed. In addition, the preheated
medium can establish an extended low density gaseous halo when it accretes into
the dark matter halos, and result in a specific angular momentum of the cooling
gas large enough to form central disks as extended as those observed. Combined
with simulated halo assembly histories, the preventative feedback model can
reproduce remarkably well a number of observational scaling relations. These
include the cold baryon (stellar plus cold gas) mass fraction-halo mass
relations, star formation histories, disk size-stellar mass relation and its
evolution, and the number density of low-mass galaxies as a function of
redshift. In contrast, the conventional ejective feedback model fails to
reproduce these observational trends. Using the model, we demonstrate that the
properties of disk galaxies are closely tied to the thermal state of hot halo
gas and even possibly the circum-halo medium, which suggests that observational
data for the disk properties and circum-galactic hot/warm medium may jointly
provide interesting constraints for galaxy formation models.

exchange-enhanced Pauli paramagnetic metal SrCo$_2$P$_2$, the magnetization
curve shows two characteristic anomalies. The low-field anomaly is small
without obvious hysteresis, and the high-field one is a typical behavior of the
itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition (IEMT). Such a successive transition
in the magnetization curve cannot be explained by the conventional
phenomenological theory for IEMT due to the Landau expansion of the free
energy, but by the extended Landau expansion theory with distinguishable two
energy states. In the systematical study of Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Co$_2$P$_2$,
furthermore, the metamagnetic transition field decreases and goes to zero as
$x$ increases up to 0.5, indicating that the ferromagnetic quantum critical

of $n$ wireless ad hoc nodes, base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple
antennas, and one remote central processor (RCP), is analyzed when wired
backhaul links between the BSs and the RCP are rate-limited. We deal with a
general scenario where the number of BSs, the number of antennas at each BS,
and the backhaul link rate can scale at arbitrary rates relative to $n$ (i.e.,
we introduce three scaling parameters). We first derive the minimum backhaul
link rate required to achieve the same capacity scaling law as in the
infinite-capacity backhaul link case. Assuming an arbitrary rate scaling of
each backhaul link, a generalized achievable throughput scaling law is then
analyzed in the network based on using one of pure multihop, hierarchical
cooperation, and two infrastructure-supported routing protocols, and moreover,
three-dimensional information-theoretic operating regimes are explicitly
identified according to the three scaling parameters. In particular, we show
the case where our network having a power limitation is also fundamentally in
the degrees-of-freedom- or infrastructure-limited regime, or both. In addition,
a generalized cut-set upper bound under the network model is derived by cutting
not only the wireless connections but also the wired connections. It is shown
that our upper bound matches the achievable throughput scaling even under
realistic network conditions such that each backhaul link rate scales slower
than the aforementioned minimum-required backhaul link rate.

high-frequency trading affects asset price dynamics. Our main goal is to
investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and
generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules
based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist
strategies. On the contrary, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven
and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional
strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders.
Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized
facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of
high-frequency trading increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role
in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained
by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e. their ability to
i) generate high bid-ask spreads and ii) synchronize on the sell side of the
limit order book. Finally, we find that higher rates of order cancellation by
high-frequency traders increase the incidence of flash crashes but reduce their
duration.

$f_1$ and octet $f_8$ or of quark-flavor states $f_{1q}$ and $f_{1s}$. We show
that the pQCD predictions for the branching ratio of $B_s \to J/\psi f_1(1285)$

\approx 20^\circ (\phi_{^3P_1} \approx 15^\circ)$ between $f_1 (f_{1q})$ and

spectroscopy (LIBS) is limited by its low measurement precision and accuracy. A
spectrum standardization method was proposed to achieve both reproducible and
accurate results for the quantitative analysis of carbon content in coal with
LIBS. The proposed method utilized the molecular carbon emissions to compensate
the diminution of atomic carbon emission caused by matrix effect. The
compensated carbon line intensities were further converted into an assumed
standard state with fixed plasma temperature, electron density, and total
number density of elemental carbon, which is proportional to its concentration
in the coal samples. In addition, in order to obtained better compensation for
total carbon number density fluctuations, an iterative algorithm was applied,
which is different from our previous standardization calculations. The modified
spectrum standardization model was applied to the measurement of carbon content
in 24 bituminous coal samples. The results demonstrated that the proposed
method had superior performance over the generally applied normalization
methods. The average relative standard deviation, the coefficient of
determination, the root-mean-square error of prediction, and the average
maximum relative error for the modified model were 3.44%, 0.83, 2.71%, and

extended to approximate the solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the whole
physical space. This is done for a class of particle interactions including
Maxwell and soft cut-off potentials in the sense of Grad.
  The main result shows that the solutions of the discrete model converge in
$\mathbb{L}^1$ to the solutions of the Boltzmann equation, when the
discretization parameters go simultaneously to zero. The convergence is uniform
with respect to the discretization parameters.
  In addition, a sufficient condition for the implementation of the main result
is provided.

laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is suffered from relatively low
precision and accuracy. In the present work, the spectrum standardization
method was combined with the dominant factor based partial least square (PLS)
method to improve the measurement accuracy of carbon content in coal by LIBS.
The combination model employed the spectrum standardization method to convert
the carbon line intensity into standard state for more accurately calculating
the dominant carbon concentration, and then applied PLS with full spectrum
information to correct the residual errors. The combination model was applied
to the measurement of carbon content for 24 bituminous coal samples. The
results demonstrated that the combination model could further improve the
measurement accuracy compared with both our previously established spectrum
standardization model and dominant factor based PLS model using spectral area
normalized intensity for the dominant factor model. For example, the
coefficient of determination (R2), the root-mean-square error of prediction
(RMSEP), and the average relative error (ARE) for the combination model were
0.99, 1.75%, and 2.39%, respectively; while those values for the spectrum
standardization method were 0.83, 2.71%, and 3.40%, respectively; and those
values for the dominant factor based PLS model were 0.99, 2.66%, and 3.64%,

interacting through screened Coulomb potentials which are repulsive between
particles of the same species and attractive between particles of different

relevant coefficients of the effective $\varphi^{4}$ Ginzburg-Landau
Hamiltonian in a one-loop approximation. Within the framework of this
approximation, we calculate the critical parameters and gas-liquid coexistence
curves for different values of the dimensionless inverse screening length $z$.
The critical temperature scaled by the Yukawa potential contact value as well
as the critical packing fraction rapidly decrease with an increase of the
interaction range and then for $z<0.05$ slowly approach the values found for a
purely ionic model, i.e., a restricted primitive model (RPM). The both trends
are qualitatively consistent with the results of Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that gas-liquid coexistence region reduces with an increase of $z$ and
completely vanishes at $z\simeq 2.781$. This qualitatively agrees with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations indicating a stable gas-liquid coexistence
for $z\leq 4$. It is also shown that an increase in the interaction range from
the one typical of simple fluids to the one typical of ionic fluids leads to a
decrease of the crossover temperature. For $z\simeq 0.01$, the crossover
temperature is the same as for the RPM. For $z\simeq 2.781$, our results

as a grade to which an object is red or a grade to which two objects are
similar. We thus extend the classical agenda by allowing graded, or fuzzy,
attributes instead of Boolean attributes in case of attribute implications, and
allowing approximate match based on degrees of similarity instead of exact
match in case of functional dependencies. In a sense, we move from bivalence,
inherently present in the now-available theories of dependencies, to a more
flexible setting that involves grades. Such a shift has far-reaching
consequences. We argue that a reasonable theory of dependencies may be
developed by making use of mathematical fuzzy logic. Namely, the theory of
dependencies is then based on a solid logic calculus the same way the classical
dependencies are based on classical logic. For instance, rather than handling
degrees of similarity in an ad hoc manner, we consistently treat them as truth
values, the same way as true (match) and false (mismatch) are treated in
classical theories. In addition, several notions intuitively embraced in the
presence of grades, such as a degree of validity of a particular dependence or
a degree of entailment, naturally emerge and receive a conceptually clean
treatment in the presented approach. In the paper, we discuss motivations,
provide basic notions of syntax and semantics, and develop basic results which
include entailment of dependencies, associated closure structures, a logic of
dependencies with two versions of completeness theorem, results and algorithms
regarding complete non-redundant sets of dependencies, relationship to and a
possible reductionist interface to classical dependencies, and relationship to

Therefore a profound understanding of these processes is essential in order to

two-electron Auger processes, leading to neutralization/ionization of an
ion/neutral atom in front of a solid surface, has been a long-standing problem.
It can be dated back to the 1950s when H. D. Hagstrum proposed to use the

neutralization of slow noble gas ions as a surface analytical tool
complementing photoelectron spectroscopy. However, only recently a
comprehensive description of the Auger neutralization mechanism has been
achieved by the combined efforts of theoretical and experimental methods. In
this article we review the theoretical models for this problem, stressing how
their outcome compare with experimental results. We also analyze the inverse
problem of Auger ionization. We emphasize the understanding of the key
quantities governing the processes and outline the challenges remaining. This
opens new perspectives for future developments of theoretical and experimental

function has remarkable features: The black hole entropy $S=A/4\ell_P^2$ is
reproduced correctly for infinitely many $\gamma= i\eta$, at least for
$\eta\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. The near-horizon Unruh temperature emerges
as the pole of partition function. Interestingly, by analytic continuation the
partition function can have a dual statistical interpretation corresponding to
a dual quantum theory of $\gamma\in i\mathbb{Z}$. The dual quantum theory
implies a semiclassical area spectrum for $\gamma\in i\mathbb{Z}$. It also
implies that at a given near horizon (quantum) geometry, the number of quantum
states inside horizon is bounded by a holographic degeneracy $d=
e^{A/4\ell_P}$, which produces the Bekenstein bound from LQG.

  Balancing with (Almost) Arbitrary Load Functions",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In geographically-distributed systems, communication latencies are
non-negligible. The perceived processing time of a request is thus composed of
the time needed to route the request to the server and the true processing
time. Once a request reaches a target server, the processing time depends on
the total load of that server; this dependency is described by a load function.
We consider a broad class of load functions; we just require that they are
convex and two times differentiable. In particular our model can be applied to
heterogeneous systems in which every server has a different load function. This
approach allows us not only to generalize results for queuing theory and for
batches of requests, but also to use empirically-derived load functions,
measured in a system under stress-testing. The optimal assignment of requests
to servers is communication-balanced, i.e. for any pair of non
perfectly-balanced servers, the reduction of processing time resulting from
moving a single request from the overloaded to underloaded server is smaller
than the additional communication latency. We present a centralized and a
decentralized algorithm for optimal load balancing. We prove bounds on the
algorithms' convergence. To the best of our knowledge these bounds were not
known even for the special cases studied previously (queuing theory and batches
of requests). Both algorithms are any-time algorithms. In the decentralized
algorithm, each server balances the load with a randomly chosen peer. Such
algorithm is very robust to failures. We prove that the decentralized algorithm
performs locally-optimal steps. Our work extends the currently known results by
considering a broad class of load functions and by establishing theoretical
bounds on the algorithms' convergence. These results are applicable for servers
whose characteristics under load cannot be described by a standard mathematical
models.

resolution (55 milliarcsec) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at a

to show a triple system, with XZ Tau A resolved into two sources, XZ Tau A and
XZ Tau C. The angular separation of XZ Tau A and C (0.09 arcsec) suggested a
projected orbital separation of around 13 AU with a possible orbital period of
around 40 yr. Our observations were obtained approximately 8 yr later, a fifth
of this putative orbital period, and should therefore allow us to constrain the
orbit of XZ Tau C, and evaluate the possibility that a recent periastron
passage of C coincided with the launch of extended optical outflows from XZ Tau
A. Despite improved sensitivity and resolution compared with previous
observations, we find no evidence of XZ Tau C in our data. Components A and B
are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than ten; their orbits are
consistent with previous studies, although the emission from XZ Tau A appears
to be weaker. Three possible interpretations are offered: either XZ Tau C is
transiting XZ Tau A, which is broadly consistent with the periastron passage
hypothesis, or the emission seen in 2004 was that of a transient, or XZ Tau C
does not exist. A fourth interpretation, that XZ Tau C was ejected from the
system, is dismissed due to the lack of angular momentum redistribution in the
orbits of XZ Tau A and XZ Tau B that would result from such an event. Our
observations are insufficient to distinguish between the remaining
possibilities, at least not until we obtain further VLA observations at a
sufficiently later time. A further non-detection would allow us to reject the
transit hypothesis, and the periastron passage of XZ Tau C as agent of XZ Tau
A's outflows.

use the most up-to-date stellar evolutionary models and implement a full
description of the observational selection biases to obtain realistic
simulations of the observed white dwarf population. Our theoretical results are
compared with the luminosity function of hot white dwarfs obtained from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for both DA and non-DA white dwarfs. We find
that the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the observational
data for the population of white dwarfs with hydrogen deficient atmospheres
(non-DA white dwarfs). For the population of white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich
atmospheres (white dwarfs of the DA class), our simulations show some
discrepancies with the observations for the brightest luminosity bins. These
discrepancies can be attributed to the way in which the masses of the white
dwarfs contributing to this luminosity bin have been computed, as most of them
have masses smaller than the theoretical lower limit for carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs. We conclude that the way in which the observational luminosity function
of hot white dwarfs is obtained is very sensitive to the particular
implementation of the method used to derive the masses of the sample. We also
provide a revised luminosity function for hot white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich

curve from the circle onto the fractal, extending an idea that has been used in
the case of certain Julia sets. The Peano curve allows us to visualize
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian by graphing the pullback to the circle. We
study in detail three fractals: the pentagasket, the octagasket and the magic
carpet. We also use the method for two nonfractal self-similar sets, the torus
and the equilateral triangle, obtaining appealing new visualizations of
eigenfunctions on the triangle. In contrast to the many familiar pictures of
approximations to standard Peano curves, that do no show self-intersections,
our descriptions of approximations to the Peano curves have self-intersections
that play a vital role in constructing graph approximations to the fractal with
explicit graph Laplacians that give the fractal Laplacian in the limit.

is transmit and receive power. This energy consumption can be reduced by
avoiding unnecessary transmission and reception. Efficient routing techniques
and incorporating aggregation whenever possible can save considerable amount of
energy. Aggregation reduces repeated transmission of relative values and also
reduces lot of computation at the base station. In this paper, the benefits of
aggregation over direct transmission in saving the amount of energy consumed is

ab-initio LDA calculations with hopping parameters extracted from the fit to
ARPES experiments. We find that the pairing interaction almost decouples
between two subsets, one consists of the outer hole pocket and two electron
pockets, which are quasi-2D and are made largely out of dxy orbital, and the
other consists of the two inner hole pockets, which are quasi-3D and are made
mostly out of dxz and dyz orbitals. Furthermore, the bare inter-pocket and
intra-pocket interactions within each subset are nearly equal. In this
situation, small changes in the intra-pocket and inter-pocket interactions due
to renormalizations by high-energy fermions give rise to a variety of different
gap structures. We find four different configurations of the s-wave gap
immediately below Tc: the one in which superconducting gap changes sign between
two inner hole pockets and between the outer hole pocket and two electron
pockets, the one in which the gap changes sign between two electron pockets and
three hole pockets, the one in which the gap on the outer hole pocket differs
in sign from the gaps on the other four pockets, and the one in which the gaps
on two inner hole pockets have one sign, and the gaps on the outer hole pockets
and on electron pockets have different sign. Different s-wave gap
configurations emerge depending on whether the renormalized interactions
increase attraction within each subset or increase the coupling between
particular components of the two subsets. We argue that the state with opposite
sign of the gaps on the two inner hole pockets has the best overlap with ARPES
data.

to describe non-treelike evolutionary histories and are thus a generalization
of phylogenetic trees. The hybridization number of a phylogenetic network is
the sum of all indegrees minus the number of nodes plus one. The Hybridization
Number problem takes as input a collection of phylogenetic trees and asks to
construct a phylogenetic network that contains an embedding of each of the
input trees and has a smallest possible hybridization number. We present an
algorithm for the Hybridization Number problem on three binary trees on $n$
leaves, which runs in time $O(c^k poly(n))$, with $k$ the hybridization number
of an optimal network and $c$ a constant. For two trees, an algorithm with
running time $O(3.18^k n)$ was proposed before whereas an algorithm with
running time $O(c^k poly(n))$ had prior to this article remained elusive for
more than two trees. The algorithm for two trees uses the close connection to
acyclic agreement forests to achieve a linear exponent in the running time,
while previous algorithms for more than two trees (explicitly or implicitly)
relied on a brute force search through all possible underlying network
topologies, leading to running times that are not $O(c^k poly(n))$ for any $c$.
The connection to acyclic agreement forests is much weaker for more than two
trees, so even given the right agreement forest, reconstructing the network
poses major challenges. We prove novel structural results that allow us to
reconstruct a network without having to guess the underlying topology. Our
techniques generalize to more than three input trees with the exception of one
key lemma that maps nodes in the network to tree nodes and, thus, minimizes the
amount of guessing involved in constructing the network. The main open problem
therefore is to establish a similar mapping for more than three trees.

probably associated to the formation of oxygen vacancies. At 15 GPa a second
phase transition occurs to a phase with Eg = 1.2 eV. In this phase, the
resistivity increases as pressure does probably due to the self-compensation of
donor levels and the augmentation of the scattering of electrons with ionized
impurities. In the three phases the band gap red shifts under compression. At

$G^{d_1}F^{d_2}E^{d_3}$, the first $d_1$ levels (counting from the root of the

wall turbulence data, for the first time to our knowledge. Wind tunnel data for
velocity differences a streamwise distance $r$ apart are compared to the
prediction from theory as developed by Beck. The simplest theory, in which all
free parameters are removed, is found to reproduce statistics for the
wall-normal velocity component remarkably well, even for $r$ well beyond the
corresponding integral scale, while the corresponding description of the
streamwise velocity fluctuations is reasonable at separations below the
integral scale. A least-squares 2-parameter fit is performed, and the
dependence of the optimum parameter values on wall separation and $r$ is
analysed. Both parameters are found to be approximately independent of
wall-separation in the logarithmic sub-layer.

is a powerful way to discriminate dark energy models, where an open question
nowadays is whether this component is constant or evolves with time. One
possible source of ambiguity in this kind of analyses comes from cosmic
opacity, which can mimick a dark enery behaviour. However, most tests of cosmic
opacity have been restricted to the redshift range $z<2$. In this work, by
using luminosity distances of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), {given the validity of
the Amati relation}, and the latest $H(z)$ data we determine constraints on the
cosmic opacity at high redshifts ($z>2$) for a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. A
possible degenerescence of the results with the adopted cosmological model is
also investigated by considering a flat XCDM model. The limits on cosmic

Ia) from the Union2.1 sample, where we added the most distant ($z=1.713$)

both SNe Ia and GRBs samples are compatible with a transparent universe at

We find that a pole at the eigenfrequency of a set of generalized Landau

the energy shift preferable to the magnetic moment for a physically meaningful

little agreement. We propose that the supply of heavy elements is accreted from
external sources rather than being intrinsic to the star. These elements are
then retained in the white dwarf atmospheres by radiative levitation, a model
that can explain both the diversity of measured abundances for stars of similar

light intensity sensor consisting of a photodiode. This light sensor has been
used previously in the Knuth Cyberphysics Laboratory on a robotic arm that
performs its own experiments to locate a white circle in a dark field (Knuth et
al., 2007). To use the light sensor to learn about its surroundings, the
robot's inference software must be able to model and predict the light sensor's
response to a hypothesized stimulus. Previous models of the light sensor
treated it as a point sensor and ignored its spatial characteristics. Here we
propose a parametric approach where the SSF is described by a mixture of
Gaussians (MOG). By performing controlled calibration experiments with known
stimulus inputs, we used nested sampling to estimate the SSF of the light
sensor using an MOG model with the number of Gaussians ranging from one to
five. By comparing the evidence computed for each MOG model, we found that one
Gaussian is sufficient to describe the SSF to the accuracy we require. Future
work will involve incorporating this more accurate SSF into the Bayesian

charged particle detectors. CMOS processes allow to integrate a sensing volume
and readout electronics in a single silicon die allowing to build sensors with
a small pixel pitch ($\sim 20 \mu m$) and low material budget ($\sim 0.2-0.3\%
X_0$) per layer. These characteristics make CPS an attractive option for
vertexing and tracking systems of high energy physics experiments. Moreover,
thanks to the mass production industrial CMOS processes used for the
manufacturing of CPS the fabrication construction cost can be significantly
reduced in comparison to more standard semiconductor technologies. However, the
attainable performance level of the CPS in terms of radiation hardness and
readout speed is mostly determined by the fabrication parameters of the CMOS
processes available on the market rather than by the CPS intrinsic potential.
  The permanent evolution of commercial CMOS processes towards smaller feature
sizes and high resistivity epitaxial layers leads to the better radiation
hardness and allows the implementation of accelerated readout circuits. The
TowerJazz $0.18 \mu m$ CMOS process being one of the most relevant examples
recently became of interest for several future detector projects. The most
imminent of these project is an upgrade of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) of
the ALICE detector at LHC. It will be followed by the Micro-Vertex Detector
(MVD) of the CBM experiment at FAIR. Other experiments like ILD consider CPS as
one of the viable options for flavour tagging and tracking sub-systems.

security identification, inventory tracking, prevention of falsification and
theft of waste casks, copper canisters, spent fuel containers, mercury
containers, waste packages and other items. The suggested concept is based on
the use of a unique combination of radioisotopes with different predictable
half life. As an option for applying the radioisotope tag to spent fuel
safeguarding it is suggested to use a mixture of {\alpha}-emitting isotopes,
such as 241Am etc., with materials that easily undergo {\alpha}-induced
reactions with emission of specific {\gamma}-lines. Thus, the existing problem
of the disposing of smoke detectors or other devices [1] which contain
radioisotopes can be addressed, indirectly solving an existing waste problem.
The results of the first pilot experiments with two general designs of storage
canisters, namely a steel container which corresponds to the one which is
commonly used for long-term storing of mercury in Europe and USA and a copper
canister, the one which is in applications for nuclear repositories, are
presented. As one of the options for a new labeling method it is proposed to
use a multidimensional bar code symbology and tungsten plate with ultrasound
techniques. It is shown that the new radioisotope label offers several
advantages in the scope of existing tagging techniques (overview is given) and
can be implemented even with low activity sources.

Methods: The nuclear ground states are calculated with the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method using the Skyrme interaction. Microscopic
$\alpha$-decay formation amplitudes are calculated from the HFB wave functions,
and the $R$-matrix formalism is utilized to obtain decay probabilities.
Results: Using a large harmonic-oscillator basis we obtain converged
$\alpha$-decay widths. A comparison with experiment including all spherical
even-even $\alpha$ emitting nuclei shows that the model consistently predicts
too small formation amplitudes while relative values are in good agreement with
experiment. Conclusions: The method was found to be numerically practical even
with a large basis size. The comparison of formation amplitudes suggests that
the pairing type correlations included in the HFB approach cannot produce
sufficient $\alpha$-particle clustering.

  Switching Topologies",,,,,"cs.SY cs.MA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper constructs a framework to describe and study the coordinated
output regulation problem for multiple heterogeneous linear systems. Each agent
is modeled as a general linear multiple-input multiple-output system with an
autonomous exosystem which represents the individual offset from the group
reference for the agent. The multi-agent system as a whole has a group
exogenous state which represents the tracking reference for the whole group.
Under the constraints that the group exogenous output is only locally available
to each agent and that the agents have only access to their neighbors'
information, we propose observer-based feedback controllers to solve the
coordinated output regulation problem using output feedback information. A
high-gain approach is used and the information interactions are allowed to be
switched over a finite set of fixed networks containing both graphs that have a
directed spanning tree and graphs that do not. The fundamental relationship
between the information interactions, the dwell time, the non-identical
dynamics of different agents, and the high-gain parameters is given.
Simulations are shown to validate the theoretical results.

Lagrangian systems. Each system observes a convex set as its local target. The
intersection of these local sets is the group aggregation target. We first
propose a control law based on each system's own target sensing and information
exchange with neighbors. With necessary connectivity for both cases of fixed
and switching communication graphs, multiple Lagrangian systems are shown to
achieve rendezvous on the intersection of all the local target sets while the
vectors of generalized coordinate derivatives are driven to zero. Then, we
introduce the collision avoidance control term into set aggregation control to
ensure group dispersion. By defining an ultimate bound on the final generalized
coordinate between each system and the intersection of all the local target
sets, we show that multiple Lagrangian systems approach a bounded region near
the intersection of all the local target sets while the collision avoidance is
guaranteed during the movement. In addition, the vectors of generalized
coordinate derivatives of all the mechanical systems are shown to be driven to
zero. Simulation results are given to validate the theoretical results.

is intended to be applicable to all types of data, however, it does not
consider relational (graph) data. We therefore extended both their data model

version to produce a comprehensive list of tasks of interest during exploratory
analysis of temporal graph data. As expected, our instantiation of the
framework resulted in a very large task list; with more than 144 variations of

  Chile (2011)",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strong seismic motions in soils generally lead to both a stiffness reduction
and an increase of the energy dissipation in the surficial layers. In order to
study such phenomena, several nonlinear constitutive models were proposed and
were generally implemented for 1D soil columns. However, one of the main
difficulties of complex rheologies is the large number of parameters needed to
describe the model. In this sense, the multi-surface cyclic plasticity
approach, developed by Iwan in 1967 but linked to Prandtl or Preisach
theoretical work, is an interesting choice: the only data needed is the modulus
reduction curve. Past studies have generally implemented such models for
one-directional shear wave propagation in a ""1D"" soil column considering one
motion component only (""1C""). Conversely, this work aims at studying strong
motion amplification by considering seismic wave propagation in a ""1D"" soil
column accounting for the influence of the 3D loading path on the nonlinear
behavior of each soil layer. In the ""1D-3C"" approach, the three components (3C)
of the outcrop motion are simultaneously propagated into a horizontally layered
soil for which a three-dimensional constitutive relation is used (Finite
Element Method). The alluvial site considered in this study corresponds to the
Tiber River Valley, close to the historical centre of Rome (Italy). The
computations are performed considering the waveforms referred as the 14th
October 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake, recorded on outcropping bedrock. Time
histories and stress-strain hysteretic loops are computed all along the soil
column. The octahedral stress, the strain-depth profiles and the transfer
functions in acceleration (surface/outcrop spectral ratios) are estimated for
the 1D-1C and the 1D-3C approaches, evidencing the influence of the
three-dimensional loading path.

unidirectional (1D) propagation of a three component (3C) earthquake for
seismic response analyses of horizontal multilayer soils, considering a 3D
nonlinear constitutive behaviour for soils. An elasto-plastic cyclic
constitutive behaviour of the Masing-Prandtl-Iwan type, using just the shear
modulus decay curve for soil characterization, is implemented in a finite
element scheme. Seismic response of soil profiles appears dependent on incident
wave polarization, elastic and dynamic properties of medium and seismic
impedance contrast between soil layers. Propagating a 3C signal induces a
multiaxial stress interaction decreasing soil strength and increasing nonlinear
effects. Soil profiles in the Tohoku area (Japan) are loaded by seismic signals
recorded at outcrops or downhole, during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The
nonlinear seismic response of each soil profile, represented in terms of
acceleration, hysteresis loops and stress and strain profiles with depth, is
compared in both cases of superposition of three one-component propagation
effects (1D-1C) and 1D-3C.

the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of these
techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of
the state space. Our framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is
a core property for verification, and is illustrated through two distinct
instantiations. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available,
and performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding
precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles
the case where we may only sample the MDP, and yields probabilistic guarantees,
again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient
stopping criteria for the approximation. The latter is the first extension of
statistical model-checking for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast with
other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded
(finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular properties
of the MDP. We also show how our techniques extend to LTL objectives. We
present experimental results showing the performance of our framework on
several examples.

subjected to combined axial load, bending moment and shear force.
Cross-sections of general shape are divided, along the height, into plane
elements. The biaxial behavior is represented according to the smeared rotating
crack approach. Using traditionally accepted hypotheses for beams, the shear
flow is determined by applying the Jouravski formula to an ""equivalent
section"", which takes into account the nonlinear material behavior. The
""Equivalent Section Method"", originally proposed by Diaz (1980) and Diaz and
Schulz (1981), is improved and simplified. The formulation is implemented
applying the bidimensional constitutive model A, proposed by Vecchio and
Collins (1993). The tension-stiffening effect is considered as adopted by Polak
and Vecchio (1993). Shear slip at crack surfaces, Poisson's ratio and other
secondary effects are not considered. Validation is undertaken by comparison
with experimental results obtained by other researchers. The examples include
reinforced and prestressed concrete beams, for normal and high strength
concrete. The formulation satisfactorily predicts the ultimate capacity under
different load combinations. The whole set of equilibrium, compatibility and
constitutive equations are satisfied, the stiffness derivatives are explicitly
calculated and the algorithms show good convergence.

considered here. We consider equations of motion for 3-dimensional
non-stationary incompressible flow. The field of flow velocity as well as the
equation of momentum should be split to the sum of two components: an
irrotational (curl-free) one, and a solenoidal (divergence-free) one. The
obviously irrotational (curl-free) part of equation of momentum used for
obtaining of the components of pressure gradient. As a term of such an
equation, we used the irrotational (curl-free) vector field of flow velocity,
which is given by the proper potential (besides, the continuity equation
determines such a potential as a harmonic function). The other part of equation
of momentum could also be split to the sum of 2 equations: - with zero curl for
the field of flow velocity (viscous-free), and the proper Eq. with viscous
effects but variable curl. A solenoidal Eq. with viscous effects is represented
by the proper Heat equation for each component of flow velocity with variable
curl. Non-viscous case is presented by the PDE-system of 3 linear differential
equations (in regard to the time-parameter), depending on the components of
solution of the above Heat Eq. for the components of flow velocity with
variable curl. So, the existence of the general solution of Navier-Stokes
equations is proved to be the question of existence of the proper solution for
such a PDE-system of linear equations. Final solution is proved to be the sum
of 2 components: - an irrotational (curl-free) one and a solenoidal (variable
curl) components.
