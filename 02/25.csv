power is counterbalanced by the interaction with phonons and by the heat flow
from the overheated leads. We study aluminium-based coolers that are equipped
with a suspended normal metal and an efficient quasi-particle drain. At
intermediate temperatures, the phonon bath of the suspended normal metal is
cooled. At lower temperatures, by adjusting the junction transparency, we
control the injection current, and thus the superconductor temperature. The
device shows a strong cooling from 150 mK down to about 30 mK, a factor of five
in temperature. We suggest that spatial non-uniformity in the superconductor
gap limits the cooling toward lower temperatures.

issue of late boundary layer transition and turbulence theory. We studied the
mechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally
considered as a result of large background noise and non-periodic spanwise
boundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected
by background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects
the small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and
formation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry
starts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still
symmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the
small length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss at
the bottom of the boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through
ejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore,
the internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the
middle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the
background noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused
by the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses.

assumptions on the structure of the function to be modeled. To model complex

restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different
representation of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space
is often learned in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data
representations that are not useful for the overall regression task. In this
paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel supervised method that
jointly learns a transformation of the data into a feature space and a GP
regression from the feature space to observed space. The Manifold GP is a full
GP and allows to learn data representations, which are useful for the overall
regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on complex
non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as step functions

first, second, and third order derivatives without artificial constants, but
never mistake high frequency waves and critical points, expansion waves as

transition and turbulence generation. It was widely accepted that small length
vortices were generated by large vortex breakdown. According to our recent DNS,
we find that the hairpin vortex structure is very stable and never breaks down
to small pieces. On the other hand, we recognize that there are strong positive
spikes besides the ring neck in the spanwise direction. The strongly positive
spikes are caused by second sweeps which are generated by perfectly circular
and perpendicularly standing vortex rings. The second sweep brings energy from
the invisid region downdraft to the bottom of the boundary layers, which
generates high shear layers around the positive spikes.Since the high shear
layer is not stable, all small length scales (turbulence) are generated around
high shear layers especially near the wall surface (bottom of boundary layers).
This happens near the ring neck in the streamwise direction and besides the
original vortex legs in the spanwise direction.The small length scales then
rise up from the wall surface and travel to the upper boundary layer.

is the rest of the part. The density is supposed to be constant in each layer.
The present study derives averaged stresses over the whole volume of these
bodies and uses limit analysis to determine their global failure. The upper
bound condition of global failure is considered in terms of the size of the
internal layer and the aspect ratio of the shape. The result shows that the
two-density-layer causes the body to have different strength against structural
failure.

training data is provided in groups, or ""bags"", and only the proportion of each
class in each bag is known. The task is to learn a model to predict the class
labels of the individual instances. LLP has broad applications in political
science, marketing, healthcare, and computer vision. This work answers the
fundamental question, when and why LLP is possible, by introducing a general
framework, Empirical Proportion Risk Minimization (EPRM). EPRM learns an
instance label classifier to match the given label proportions on the training
data. Our result is based on a two-step analysis. First, we provide a VC bound
on the generalization error of the bag proportions. We show that the bag sample
complexity is only mildly sensitive to the bag size. Second, we show that under
some mild assumptions, good bag proportion prediction guarantees good instance
label prediction. The results together provide a formal guarantee that the
individual labels can indeed be learned in the LLP setting. We discuss
applications of the analysis, including justification of LLP algorithms,
learning with population proportions, and a paradigm for learning algorithms
with privacy guarantees. We also demonstrate the feasibility of LLP based on a
case study in real-world setting: predicting income based on census data.

equations when the nonlinear characteristic fields loose their genuine
nonlinearity. In this context, exact solvers for nonconvex 1D Riemann problems
are developed. First a scalar conservation law for a nonconvex flux with two
inflection points is studied. Then the P-system for an isothermal version of
the van der Waals gas model is examined in a range of temperatures allowing for
a nonconvex pressure function. Eventually the system of the Euler equations of
gasdynamics is considered for the polytropic van der Waals gas. In this case, a
suitably large specific heat is considered such that the isentropes display a
local loss of convexity near the saturation curve and the critical point. Such
a nonconvex physical model allows for nonclassical waves to appear as a result
of the change of sign of the fundamental derivative of gasdynamics. The
solution of the Riemann problem for the considered real gas model reduces to a
system of two nonlinear equations for the values of the density on the two
sides of the contact discontinuity, much in the same manner of a recently
proposed solution method for gases admitting nonlinear wavefields only fully
genuine. Solutions containing nonclassical and mixed waves are presented for
the three mathematical models. Vacuum formation is described analytically
including the presence of composite rarefaction waves, and to the best of

  Perspective","Shorter version will be presented at ISIT 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many wireless networks, link strengths are affected by many topological
factors such as different distances, shadowing and inter-cell interference,
thus resulting in some links being generally stronger than other links. From an
information theoretic point of view, accounting for such topological aspects
has remained largely unexplored, despite strong indications that such aspects
can crucially affect transceiver and feedback design, as well as the overall
performance.
  The work here takes a step in exploring this interplay between topology,
feedback and performance. This is done for the two user broadcast channel with
random fading, in the presence of a simple two-state topological setting of
statistically strong vs. weaker links, and in the presence of a practical
ternary feedback setting of alternating channel state information at the
transmitter (alternating CSIT) where for each channel realization, this CSIT
can be perfect, delayed, or not available.
  In this setting, the work derives generalized degrees-of-freedom bounds and
exact expressions, that capture performance as a function of feedback
statistics and topology statistics. The results are based on novel topological
signal management (TSM) schemes that account for topology in order to fully
utilize feedback. This is achieved for different classes of feedback mechanisms
of practical importance, from which we identify specific feedback mechanisms
that are best suited for different topologies. This approach offers further
insight on how to split the effort --- of channel learning and feeding back
CSIT --- for the strong versus for the weaker link. Further intuition is
provided on the possible gains from topological spatio-temporal diversity,
where topology changes in time and across users.

deformable mirror upstream of the coronagraph is mandatory. These aberrations
need to be calibrated and focal-plane wavefront-sensing techniques in the
science channel are being developed. One of these, the self-coherent camera, of
which we present the latest laboratory results. Methods. We present here an
enhancement of the method: we directly minimized the complex amplitude of the
speckle field in the focal plane. Laboratory tests using a four-quadrant
phase-mask coronagraph and a 32x32 actuator deformable mirror were conducted in
monochromatic light and in polychromatic light for different bandwidths.
Results. We obtain contrast levels in the focal plane in monochromatic light
better than 3.10^-8 (RMS) in the 5 - 12 {\lambda}/D region for a correction of
both phase and amplitude aberrations. In narrow bands (10 nm) the contrast

the positive fragment of standard modal logic. His completeness result consists
of an axiomatization that derives all modal formulas that are valid on all
Kripke frames and are built only from atomic propositions, conjunction,
disjunction, box and diamond. In this paper, we provide a coalgebraic analysis
of this theorem, which not only gives a conceptual proof based on duality
theory, but also generalizes Dunn's result from Kripke frames to coalgebras for
weak-pullback preserving functors. To facilitate this analysis we prove a
number of category theoretic results on functors on the categories
$\mathsf{Set}$ of sets and $\mathsf{Pos}$ of posets: Every functor
$\mathsf{Set} \to \mathsf{Pos}$ has a $\mathsf{Pos}$-enriched left Kan
extension $\mathsf{Pos} \to \mathsf{Pos}$. Functors arising in this way are
said to have a presentation in discrete arities. In the case that $\mathsf{Set}
\to \mathsf{Pos}$ is actually $\mathsf{Set}$-valued, we call the corresponding
left Kan extension $\mathsf{Pos} \to \mathsf{Pos}$ its posetification. A
$\mathsf{Set}$-functor preserves weak pullbacks if and only if its
posetification preserves exact squares. A $\mathsf{Pos}$-functor with a
presentation in discrete arities preserves surjections. The inclusion
$\mathsf{Set} \to \mathsf{Pos}$ is dense. A functor $\mathsf{Pos} \to
\mathsf{Pos}$ has a presentation in discrete arities if and only if it
preserves coinserters of `truncated nerves of posets'. A functor $\mathsf{Pos}
\to \mathsf{Pos}$ is a posetification if and only if it preserves coinserters
of truncated nerves of posets and discrete posets. A locally monotone
endofunctor of an ordered variety has a presentation by monotone operations and
equations if and only if it preserves $\mathsf{Pos}$-enriched sifted colimits.

dynamics of the high-inclination Twotinos in the 1:2 Neptune mean motion
resonance (NMMR). Depending on the inclination $i$, we show the existence of
two critical eccentricities $e_a(i)$ and $e_c(i)$, which are lower limits of
the eccentricity $e$ for the resonant angle $\sigma$ to exhibit libration and
asymmetric libration, respectively. Accordingly, we have determined the
libration centres $\sigma_0$ for inclined orbits, which are strongly dependent
on $i$. With initial $\sigma=\sigma_0$ on a fine grid of $(e, i)$, the
stability of orbits in the 1:2 NMMR is probed by 4-Gyr integrations. It is
shown that symmetric librators are totally unstable for $i\ge30^{\circ}$; while
stable asymmetric librators exist for $i$ up to $90^{\circ}$.
  We further investigate the 1:2 NMMR capture and retention of planetesimals
with initial inclinations $i_0\le90^{\circ}$ in the planet migration model
using a time-scale of $2\times10^7$ yr. We find that: (1) the capture
efficiency of the 1:2 NMMR decreases drastically with the increase of $i_0$,
and it goes to 0 when $i_0\ge60^{\circ}$; (2) the probability of discovering
Twotinos with $i>25^{\circ}$, beyond observed values, is roughly estimated to
be $\le0.1$ per cent; (3) more particles are captured into the leading rather
than the trailing asymmetric resonance for $i_0\le10^{\circ}$, but this number
difference appears to be the opposite at $i_0=20^{\circ}$ and is continuously
varying for even larger $i_0$; (4) captured Twotinos residing in the trailing
resonance or having $i>15^{\circ}$ are practically outside the Kozai mechanism,
like currently observed samples.

the velocity field is obtained analytically using a parameterised description
of the line acceleration that only depends on radius r at any given latitude
$\theta$. The line acceleration g(r) is obtained from Monte-Carlo multi-line
radiative transfer calculations. The critical/sonic point of our equation of
motion varies with latitude $\theta$. Furthermore, an approximate analytical
solution for the supersonic flow of a rotating wind is derived, which is found
to closely resemble the exact solution. For the simultaneous solution of the

radio outburst. In the 1990s, the jet structure was ridge-brightening rather
than limb-brightening, despite the observations being done with similar angular
resolution. This indicates that the transverse jet structure has changed
recently. This change in the morphology shows an interesting agreement with the
$\gamma$-ray flux increase, i.e., the $\gamma$-ray flux in 1990s was at least
seven times lower than the current one. One plausible explanation for the
limb-brightening is the velocity structure of the jet in the context of the
stratified jet, which is a successful scenario to explain the $\gamma$-ray
emission in some active galactic nuclei (AGNs). If this is the case, the change
in apparent transverse structure might be caused by the change in the
transverse velocity structure. We argue the possibility that the transition
from ridge-brightening to limb-brightening is related to the $\gamma$-ray time
variability on the timescale of decades. We also discuss the collimation

Fourier power spectra, respectively, and investigated their evolution during
the passage of the active region through the field of view of HMI. Flaring
active region NOAA 11158 produces an average one-dimensional spatial power
spectral density that follows approximately a $k^{-2}$ power law -- a spectrum
that suggests parallel MHD fluctuations in an anisotropic turbulent medium. In
addition, we found that values of $\alpha$ capture systematic changes in the

smoothing. Three approaches for the multigrid hierarchy are compared: 1)
high-order $h$-multigrid, which uses high-order interpolation and restriction
between geometrically coarsened meshes; 2) $p$-multigrid, in which the
polynomial order is reduced while the mesh remains unchanged, and the
interpolation and restriction incorporate the different-order basis functions;
and 3), a first-order approximation multigrid preconditioner constructed using
the nodes of the high-order discretization. This latter approach is often
combined with algebraic multigrid for the low-order operator and is attractive
for high-order discretizations on unstructured meshes, where geometric
coarsening is difficult. Based on a simple performance model, we compare the
computational cost of the different approaches. Using scalar test problems in
two and three dimensions with constant and varying coefficients, we compare the
performance of the different multigrid approaches for polynomial orders up to
16. Overall, both $h$- and $p$-multigrid work well; the first-order
approximation is less efficient. For constant coefficients, all smoothers work
well. For variable coefficients, Chebyshev and SSOR smoothing outperforms
Jacobi smoothing. While all of the tested methods converge in a
mesh-independent number of iterations, none of them behaves completely
independent of the polynomial order. When multigrid is used as a preconditioner
in a Krylov method, the iteration number decreases significantly compared to
using multigrid as a solver.

surprisingly similar to that of supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios. For each
level-1 bosonic (fermionic) Kaluza-Klein (KK) state, there is a fermionic
(bosonic) analog in SUSY and thus UED scenarios are often known as bosonic
supersymmetry. The minimal version of UED (mUED) gives rise to a
quasi-degenerate particle spectrum at each KK-level and thus, can not explain
the enhanced Higgs to diphoton decay rate hinted by the ATLAS collaboration of
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment. However, in the non-minimal version
of the UED (nmUED) model, the enhanced Higgs to diphoton decay rate can be
easily explained via the suitable choice of boundary localized kinetic (BLK)
terms for higher dimensional fermions and gauge bosons. BLK terms remove the
degeneracy in the KK mass spectrum and thus, pair production of level-1 quarks
and gluons at the LHC gives rise to hard jets, leptons and large missing energy
in the final state. These final states are studied in details by the ATLAS and
CMS collaborations in the context of SUSY scenarios. We find that the absence
of any significant deviation of the data from the Standard Model (SM)
prediction puts a lower bound of about 2.1 TeV on equal mass excited quarks and
gluons.

gauge transformations of the effective theory, and explicitly identify the
emergence of massive vector fields in the same number as massless
('pseudo-Goldstone') scalars in the compactified theory, verifying that a
Higgs-like mechanism operates in the compactification process. It is found
that, in contrast with the one UED scenario, in cases with two or more UEDs
there emerge massive scalar fields. Besides, at phase-space level, the
Hamiltonian analysis yields that the higher-dimensional and compactified
theories are classically equivalent using the fundamental concept of canonical
transformation. This work lays the ground for a wider study on these theories
concerning their quantization and predictive power at the level of quantum

models, at the onset of core collapse, to capture any dynamical instabilities

enhance explosive yields by mixing hot ash with fuel, thereby accelerating
nuclear burning, and affect the spectra of the supernova by dredging up heavy
elements from greater depths in the star at early times. Our grid of models

mass expected for these events. We find that fluid instabilities driven by
oxygen and helium burning arise at the upper and lower boundaries of the oxygen
shell $\sim$ 20 - 100 seconds after core bounce. Instabilities driven by
burning freeze out after the SN shock exits the helium core. As the shock later
propagates through the hydrogen envelope, a strong reverse shock forms that
drives the growth of Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities. In red supergiant

specific SFR, gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity,
without assuming that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. We find that the
timescale required to reach equilibrium, tau_eq, which is determined by the
product of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor, is the central
parameter that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxy
properties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations, such as the
mass-SFR relation and mass-metallicity relation, are primarily governed by
tau_eq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by
tau_eq (apart from the cosmic time). Although the precise evolution of the sSFR
depends on tau_eq, the sSFR history is largely insensitive to different values
of tau_eq. The difference between the minimum and maximum sSFR at any epoch is
less than a factor of four. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply
mimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos
(sMIR_DM) with the typical value of the sSFR around 2*sMIR_DM, in good
agreement with the predictions from typical Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs), but
both are fundamentally different from the observed sSFR history. This clearly
implies that some key process is missing in both typical SAMs and gas regulator
model, and we hint at some possible culprit. We emphasize the critical role of
tau_eq in controlling the evolution of the galaxy population, especially for
gas rich low mass galaxies that are very unlikely to live around the
equilibrium state at any epoch and this has been largely ignored in many
similar studies.

quantum effects from the interaction between the Fermi surface and a critical

scalar field via a Yukawa coupling of the form $g(x)\propto |x|^\kappa$. The
approximate non-Fermi liquid behavior arises in the limit of small $\kappa$ and
persists over an exponentially large window of scales, being cut off by the
regime where the coupling becomes large, or by superconducting instabilities.
The translation breaking coupling introduces anisotropic deformations of the
Fermi surface depending on the direction of the gradient. An extension of this
mechanism to 2+1 dimensions could provide a strongly translation-breaking, but
weakly coupled non-fermi liquid, something we leave for further work.

8.5$\times$10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ and an average temperature of 23$\pm$2 K. We
also fit the pixel-by-pixel SEDs to produce maps of the dust mass and
temperature. The dust mass distribution correlates with the total stellar
population as traced by the 3.6 $\mu$m emission. The derived dust temperature,
which ranges from approximately 17 to 24 K, is found to correlate with the 24

emissivity spectral index and dust temperature, but do not observe any
variation of this relationship with vertical height from the mid-plane of the

ISM reveals strong spatial correlations between the surface mass densities of
dust and the molecular hydrogen and total gas surface densities. Observed
asymmetries in the dust temperature, and the H$_{2}$-to-dust and total

the result of larger quantities of molecular gas available to fuel star
formation in the NE compared to the SW. Whilst the asymmetry likely arises from
dust obscuration due to the geometry of the line-of-sight projection of the
spiral arms, we cannot exclude an enhancement in the star formation rate in the
NE side of the disk.

discs differs significantly from migration in isothermal discs. Depending on
the thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and
the radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,
this will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as
predicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the
global effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap
opening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic
planet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies
and 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for
the application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We
find a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative
hydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,
towards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the
migration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type
II like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones even
without an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined
halting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration including
non-isothermal effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migration
rate reduction factor obsolete. Conclusions: Outward migration in parts of a
disc makes some planets survive long enough to become massive. The convergence
zones lead to a potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets at
certain semimajor axes. Our results indicate that further studies of the mass
where the corotation torque saturates will be needed since its value has a
major impact on the properties of planet populations.

severe constraints on widefield MOS observations. Flux reduction and spectral
distortions must be minimised by a careful planning of the observations --
which is especially true for instruments that use slits instead of fibres. This
is the case of VIMOS at the VLT, where MOS observations have been restricted,
since the start of operations, to a narrow two-hour range from the meridian to
minimise slit losses. We revisit in detail the impact of atmospheric effects on
the quality of VIMOS-MOS spectra. We model slit losses across the entire VIMOS
FOV as a function of target declination. We explore two different slit
orientations at the meridian: along the parallactic angle (North-South), and
perpendicular to it (East-West). We show that, for fields culminating at zenith
distances larger than 20 deg, slit losses are minimised with slits oriented
along the parallactic angle at the meridian. The two-hour angle rule holds for
these observations using N-S orientations. Conversely, for fields with zenith
angles smaller than 20 deg at culmination, losses are minimised with slits
oriented perpendicular to the parallactic angle at the meridian. MOS
observations can be effectively extended to plus/minus three hours from the
meridian in these cases. In general, night-long observations of a single field
will benefit from using the E-W orientation. All-sky or service mode
observations, however, require a more elaborate planning that depends on the
target declination, and the hour angle of the observations. We establish
general rules for the alignment of slits in MOS observations that will increase
target observability, enhance the efficiency of operations, and speed up the
completion of programmes -- a particularly relevant aspect for the forthcoming
spectroscopic public surveys with VIMOS.

localization. We estimate the degree to which coupling to a bath broadens these
spectral features, and find that characteristics of incipient localization
survive as long as the system-bath coupling is much weaker than the
characteristic energy scales of the system. Since perfect isolation is
impossible, we expect the ideas discussed in this paper to be relevant for all

Four-dimensional Bianchi identities are generalized to ten dimensions with

Without sources, our Bianchi identities are also recovered by squaring a

allows us in addition to express the equations of motion explicitly in terms of
fluxes. In the second half, we perform a general analysis of ten-dimensional

$\beta$-supergravity. We determine a well-defined class of such vacua, that are
non-geometric in standard supergravity: they involve $\beta$-transforms, a

detected in PACS (rest frame mid-infrared) and 15% additionally in the SPIRE

with prominent FIR emission, also by a cold (~50K) component. In the FIR
detected cases the luminosity of the cold component is on the order of 10^13

determine that the AGN dust-to-accretion disk luminosity ratio declines with

showing that nuclear dust is ubiquitous in luminous QSOs out to redshift 6.

immediate connection between the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scale and the weak scale. We
wish to incorporate the DFSZ axion in a complete supersymmetric model, valid at
all scales, and then to implement it in a numerical code connecting the high
scale and the low scale physics on a quantitative level. We find that the
simplest supersymmetric DFSZ model, as proposed by Rajagopal et al. in 1990, is
inconsistent when we consider the minimization of the scalar potential. The
problem is that we obtain a negative squared mass for the saxion, the scalar
partner of the axion, at the minimum. We then consider the minimal extension in
order to get a consistent model for all scales: one has to include an
additional explicit sector to spontaneously break the PQ symmetry. In the
complete model we can determine the mass of the axino, the fermionic partner of
the axion. It is useful to distinguish two cases: (1) the supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking scale is lower than the PQ breaking scale, and (2) the scales are
comparable. We find that the axino is very light in (1), while its mass is
generically of the order of the other soft SUSY breaking masses in (2). We have
implemented SUSY breaking via generic soft breaking terms, and thus make no
explicit statement about the form and mediation of SUSY breaking. This complete
model can then be incorporated in a numerical code connecting the two scales.
We briefly discuss the renormalization group equations and the couplings of the
axion to gluons and photons.

big challenge. Only few examples of renormalizable theories are known, such as
the scalar Grosse-Wulkenhaar model. Gauge fields are even more difficult, since
new renormalization techniques are required which are compatible with the
inherently non-local setting on the one hand, and also allow to properly treat
the gauge symmetry on the other hand. In this proceeding (which is based on my

hyperbolic space into rotationally symmetric surfaces. This problem exhibits
markedly different phenomena than its Euclidean counterpart due to the
exponential volume growth of concentric geodesic spheres on the domain.
  In particular, when the target is the 2-sphere, we find a family of
equivariant harmonic maps indexed by a parameter that measures how far the
image of each harmonic map wraps around the sphere. These maps have energies
taking all values between zero and the energy of the unique co-rotational
Euclidean harmonic map, Q, from the Euclidean plane to the 2-sphere, given by
stereographic projection. We prove that the harmonic maps are asymptotically
stable for values of the parameter smaller than a threshold that is large
enough to allow for maps that wrap more than halfway around the sphere. Indeed,
we prove Strichartz estimates for the operator obtained by linearizing around
such a harmonic map. However, for harmonic maps with energies approaching the
Euclidean energy of Q, asymptotic stability via a perturbative argument based
on Strichartz estimates is precluded by the existence of gap eigenvalues in the
spectrum of the linearized operator.
  When the target is 2d hyperbolic space, we find a continuous family of
asymptotically stable equivariant harmonic maps with arbitrarily small and
arbitrarily large energies. This stands in sharp contrast to the corresponding
problem on Euclidean space, where all finite energy solutions scatter to zero
as time tends to infinity.

isolated galaxy models for the purpose of verifying whether dynamical and
chemical properties of the thick discs formed in such clumpy galaxies are
compatible with observations. The results of our simulations seem nearly
consistent with observations in dynamical properties such as radial and
vertical density profiles, significant rotation velocity lag with height and
distributions of orbital eccentricities. In addition, the thick discs in our
simulations indicate nearly exponential dependence of azimuthal and vertical
velocity dispersions with radius, nearly isothermal kinematics in vertical

directions. However, our simulations cannot reproduce altitudinal dependence of
eccentricities, metallicity relations with eccentricities or rotation
velocities, which shows striking discrepancy from recent observations of the
Galactic thick disc. From this result, we infer that the clumpy disc scenario
for thick-disc formation would not be suitable at least for the Milky Way. Our
study, however, cannot reject this scenario for external galaxies if not all
galaxies form their thick discs by the same process. In addition, we found that
a large fraction of thick-disc stars forms in giant clumps.

using the second method, to feedforward networks with Markov arrival processes

they are closed not only under superposition and splitting, as known, but also
under input-output caching operations as proven herein for phase-type TTL
distributions. The crucial benefit of the two closure properties is that they
jointly enable the first exact analysis of feedforward networks of TTL caches

event definitions to infer occurrences of events in time. The manual
development of such knowledge is a tedious and error-prone task, thus
event-based applications may benefit from automated knowledge construction
techniques, such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which combines machine
learning with the declarative and formal semantics of First-Order Logic.
However, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by
logic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP
systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data is usually
massive and collected at different times and under various circumstances.
Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an
incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of
new evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order
to account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past
knowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of
ILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that
scale poorly. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and
revising event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus programs. The
proposed algorithm relies on abductive-inductive learning and comprises a
scalable clause refinement methodology, based on a compressive summarization of
clause coverage in a stream of examples. We present an empirical evaluation of
our approach on real and synthetic data from activity recognition and city

125-126 GeV Higgs mass at the expense of a scalar spectrum in the multi-TeV
range and a much lighter wino as the lightest supersymmetric particle. In these
models, it is also quite generic that the Higgs mixing mass parameter, $\mu$,
which is determined by the minimization of the Higgs potential is also in the
multi-TeV range. For $\mu > 0$, the thermal relic density of winos is too small
to account for the dark matter. The same is true for $\mu < 0$ unless the
gravitino mass is of order 500 TeV. Here, we consider the origin of a multi-TeV
$\mu$ parameter arising from the breakdown of a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. A
coupling of the PQ-symmetry breaking field, $P$, to the MSSM Higgs doublets,
naturally leads to a value of $\mu \sim \langle P \rangle^2 /M_P \sim
\mathcal{O}(100)$ TeV and of order that is required in PGM models. In this
case, axions make up the dark matter or some fraction of the dark matter with
the remainder made up from thermal or non-thermal winos. We also provide
solutions to the problem of isocurvature fluctuations with axion dark matter in

interventions such as transition care management and discharge reengineering
have been practiced in recent years, the effectiveness and sustainability
depends on how well they can identify and target patients at high risk of
rehospitalization. Based on the literature, most current risk prediction models
fail to reach an acceptable accuracy level; none of them considers patient's
history of readmission and impacts of patient attribute changes over time; and
they often do not discriminate between planned and unnecessary readmissions.
Tackling such drawbacks, we develop a new readmission metric based on

all other types of readmission. We further propose a tree based classification

adaptive meshes. They also confirm the second order convergence of the error
that is predicted by the theoretical analysis.
  The effects of approximation of curved boundaries on the computation of
eigenvalue problems is also studied in two dimensions. It is shown that the
initial mesh used to define the geometry of the physical domain should contain
at least \sqrt{N} boundary points to keep the effects of boundary approximation
at the level of the error of the finite element approximation, where N is the
number of the elements in the final adaptive mesh. Only about N^{1/3} boundary
points in the initial mesh are needed for boundary value problems. This implies
that the computation of eigenvalue problems is more sensitive to the boundary
approximation than that of boundary value problems.

pump-probe infrared spectroscopy with ~20 nm spatial resolution, far below the
diffraction limit, which is accomplished using a scattering scanning near-field
optical microscope (s-SNOM). This technique allows us to investigate exfoliated
graphene single-layers on SiO2 at technologically significant mid-infrared

accessible through the excitation of surface plasmons via the s-SNOM tip.
Optical pumping at near-infrared (NIR) frequencies prompts distinct changes in
the plasmonic behavior on 200 femtosecond (fs) time scales. The origin of the
pump-induced, enhanced plasmonic response is identified as an increase in the
effective electron temperature up to several thousand Kelvin, as deduced
directly from the Drude weight associated with the plasmonic resonances.

the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $p$, is at least twice its
mean? Writing it as $\exp[- r(n,p)]$, already the order of the rate function
$r(n,p)$ was a longstanding open problem when $p=o(1)$, finally settled in 2012
by Chatterjee and by DeMarco and Kahn, who independently showed that
$r(n,p)\asymp n^2p^2 \log (1/p)$ for $p \gtrsim \frac{\log n}n$; the exact
asymptotics of $r(n,p)$ remained unknown.
  The following variational problem can be related to this large deviation
question at $p\gtrsim \frac{\log n}n$: for $\delta>0$ fixed, what is the
minimum asymptotic $p$-relative entropy of a weighted graph on $n$ vertices
with triangle density at least $(1+\delta)p^3$? A beautiful large deviation
framework of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011) reduces upper tails for triangles
to a limiting version of this problem for fixed $p$. A very recent breakthrough
of Chatterjee and Dembo extended its validity to $n^{-\alpha}\ll p \ll 1$ for
an explicit $\alpha>0$, and plausibly it holds in all of the above sparse
regime.
  In this note we show that the solution to the variational problem is
$\min\{\frac12 \delta^{2/3}\,,\, \frac13 \delta\}$ when $n^{-1/2}\ll p \ll 1$
vs. $\frac12 \delta^{2/3}$ when $n^{-1} \ll p\ll n^{-1/2}$ (the transition
between these regimes is expressed in the count of triangles minus an edge in
the minimizer). From the results of Chatterjee and Dembo, this shows for
instance that the probability that $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ for $ n^{-\alpha} \leq p
\ll 1$ has twice as many triangles as its expectation is $\exp[-r(n,p)]$ where
$r(n,p)\sim \frac13 n^2 p^2\log(1/p)$. Our results further extend to
$k$-cliques for any fixed $k$, as well as give the order of the upper tail rate
function for an arbitrary fixed subgraph when $p\geq n^{-\alpha}$.

CP violation. We illustrate the sensitivity under varying assumptions, from
modest to optimistic ones, on experimental errors and theoretical uncertainty
of nuclear matrix elements. Assuming that the latter can be reduced to a factor
of ~1.5 we find that one of the two Majorana phases (denoted as alpha_(21)) can
be constrained by excluding ~10-40% of the phase space at 2sigma CL even with
the modest choice of experimental error for the lowest neutrino mass of 0.1 eV.

time-scales, to characterize the spectral evolution of the bursts. Using a
Comptonized model, we find that the peak energy, E_peak, anti-correlates with
flux, while the low-energy photon index remains constant at -0.8 up to a flux
limit F~10^-5 erg s-1 cm-2. Above this flux value the E_peak-flux correlation
changes sign, and the index positively correlates with flux reaching 1 at the
highest fluxes. Using a two black-body model, we find that the areas and fluxes
of the two emitting regions correlate positively. Further, we study here for
the first time, the evolution of the temperatures and areas as a function of
flux. We find that the area-kT relation follows lines of constant luminosity at
the lowest fluxes, R^2 \propto kT^-4, with a break at higher fluxes ($F>10^-5.5
erg s-1 cm-2). The area of the high-kT component increases with flux while its
temperature decreases, which we interpret as due to an adiabatic cooling
process. The area of the low-kT component, on the other hand, appears to
saturate at the highest fluxes, towards R_max~30 km. Assuming that crust quakes
are responsible for SGR bursts and considering R_max as the maximum radius of
the emitting photon-pair plasma fireball, we relate this saturation radius to a
minimum excitation radius of the magnetosphere, and put a lower limit on the
internal magnetic field of SGR J1550-5418, B_int>~4.5x10^15 G.

take pre-images of 0 under successive iterates of phi, and thus obtain an
infinite rooted tree T by assigning edges according to the action of phi. The
absolute Galois group of K acts on T by tree automorphisms, giving a subgroup
G(phi) of the group Aut(T) of all tree automorphisms. Beginning in the 1980s
with work of Odoni, and developing especially over the past decade, a
significant body of work has emerged on the size and structure of this Galois
representation. These inquiries arose in part because knowledge of G(phi)
allows one to prove density results on the set of primes of K that divide at
least one element of a given orbit of phi.
  Following an overview of the history of the subject and two of its
fundamental questions, we survey cases where G(phi) is known to have finite
index in Aut(T). While it is tempting to conjecture that such behavior should
hold in general, we exhibit four classes of rational functions where it does
not, illustrating the difficulties in formulating the proper conjecture.
Fortunately, one can achieve the aforementioned density results with
comparatively little information about G(phi), thanks in part to a surprising
application of probability theory. Underlying all of this analysis are results
on the factorization into irreducibles of the numerators of iterates of phi,
which we survey briefly. We find that for each of these matters, the arithmetic
of the forward orbits of the critical points of phi proves decisive, just as
the topology of these orbits is decisive in complex dynamics.

are investigated theoretically. Two main approaches to the calculation of
directivity patterns of laser-generated sound are discussed for the most
important case of thermo-optical regime of generation. The first approach,
which is widely used in practice, is based on the simple modelling of the
equivalent thermo-optical source as a mechanical dipole comprising two
horizontal forces applied to the surface in opposite directions. The second
approach is based on the rigorous theory that takes into account all
acoustical, optical and thermal parameters of a solid material and all
geometrical and physical parameters of a laser beam. Directivity patterns of
laser-generated bulk longitudinal and shear elastic waves, as well as the
amplitudes of generated Rayleigh surface waves, are calculated for different
values of physical and geometrical parameters and compared with the directivity
patterns calculated in case of dipole-source representation. It is demonstrated
that the simple approach using a dipole-source representation of
laser-generated sound is rather limited, especially for description of
generated longitudinal acoustic waves. A practical criterion is established to
define the conditions under which the dipole-source representation gives
predictions with acceptable errors. It is shown that, for radiation in the
normal direction to the surface, the amplitudes of longitudinal waves are
especially sensitive to the values of thermal parameters and of the acoustic
reflection coefficient from a free solid surface. A discussion is given on the
possibility of using such a high sensitivity to the values of the reflection
coefficient for investigation of surface properties of real solids.

Applications are illustrated by examples with both convex and nonconvex stored

models, respectively. Results show that the nonconvex variational problem could
have multiple solutions at each material point, the complementary gap function

well-understood theoretically, empirical confirmation of their effectiveness is
generally scarce. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of the most
popular multi-armed bandit algorithms. Three important observations can be made
from our results. Firstly, simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy and
Boltzmann exploration outperform theoretically sound algorithms on most
settings by a significant margin. Secondly, the performance of most algorithms
varies dramatically with the parameters of the bandit problem. Our study
identifies for each algorithm the settings where it performs well, and the
settings where it performs poorly. Thirdly, the algorithms' performance
relative each to other is affected only by the number of bandit arms and the
variance of the rewards. This finding may guide the design of subsequent
empirical evaluations. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention
to an important area of application of bandit algorithms: clinical trials.
Although the design of clinical trials has been one of the principal practical
problems motivating research on multi-armed bandits, bandit algorithms have
never been evaluated as potential treatment allocation strategies. Using data
from a real study, we simulate the outcome that a 2001-2002 clinical trial
would have had if bandit algorithms had been used to allocate patients to
treatments. We find that an adaptive trial would have successfully treated at
least 50% more patients, while significantly reducing the number of adverse
effects and increasing patient retention. At the end of the trial, the best
treatment could have still been identified with a high level of statistical
confidence. Our findings demonstrate that bandit algorithms are attractive

the Three Interaction Site (TIS) model in which each nucleotide is represented
by three beads corresponding to sugar, phosphate, and base. The other is the
Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) model in which each nucleotide is represented as a
single interaction center. Applications of the TIS model to study the
complexity of hairpin formation and the effects of crowding in shifting

described. The work on crowding illustrates a direct link to the activity of

pathways for {\it Azoarcus} ribozyme. The success of the CG applications to

relativistic effects as pericentre shift and gravitational wave recoil. The
orbits of MBHs are pursed down to ten Schwarzschild radii (~ 1 AU). As a
result, it is shown that about a half of MBHs merge during 1 Gyr in a galaxy
with mass $10^{11}M_{\odot}$ and stellar velocity dispersion 240 km/s, even if
the recoil velocity is two times as high as the stellar velocity dispersion.
The dynamical friction allows a binary MBH to interact frequently with other
MBHs, and then the decay of the binary orbits leads to the merger through
gravitational wave radiation, as shown by Tanikawa & Umemura (2011). We derive
the MBH merger criteria for the masses, sizes, and luminosities of host
galaxies. It is found that the successive MBH mergers are expected in bright
galaxies, depending on redshifts. Furthermore, we find that the central stellar
density is reduced by the sling-shot mechanism and that high-velocity stars

QCD at high density difficult, such models help to explore various effects
peculiar to the full theory. Studying them gives insights into the large
density behavior of the Polyakov loop by taking both bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom into account, although in one dimension only the
implementation of a global gauge symmetry is possible. For these models we
evaluate the respective partition functions and discuss several observables as

fast sunspot rotation. The event includes a sigmoidal filament eruption, a
coronal mass ejection, and a GOES X2.1 flare from NOAA active region 11283. The
filament and some overlying arcades were partially rooted in a sunspot. The
sunspot rotated at $\sim$10$^\circ$ per hour rate during a period of 6 hours
prior to the eruption. In this period, the filament was found to rise gradually
along with the sunspot rotation. Based on the HMI observation, for an area
along the polarity inversion line underneath the filament, we found gradual
pre-eruption decreases of both the mean strength of the photospheric horizontal
field ($B_h$) and the mean inclination angle between the vector magnetic field
and the local radial (or vertical) direction. These observations are consistent
with the pre-eruption gradual rising of the filament-associated magnetic
structure. In addition, according to the Non-Linear Force-Free-Field
reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field, a pre-eruption magnetic flux rope
structure is found to be in alignment with the filament, and a considerable
amount of magnetic energy was transported to the corona during the period of
sunspot rotation. Our study provides evidences that in this event sunspot
rotation plays an important role in twisting, energizing, and destabilizing the
coronal filament-flux rope system, and led to the eruption. We also propose
that the pre-event evolution of $B_h$ may be used to discern the driving
mechanism of eruptions.

pre-built applications are delivered to customers as a service. SaaS providers
aim to attract a large number of tenants (users) with minimal system
modifications to meet economics of scale. To achieve this aim, SaaS
applications have to be customizable to meet requirements of each tenant.
However, due to the rapid growing of the SaaS, SaaS applications could have
thousands of tenants with a huge number of ways to customize applications.
Modularizing such customizations still is a highly complex task. Additionally,
due to the big variation of requirements for tenants, no single customization
model is appropriate for all tenants. In this paper, we propose a
multi-dimensional customization model based on metagraph. The proposed mode
addresses the modelling variability among tenants, describes customizations and

given a primary change that is made to a model in order to meet a new or
changed requirement, what additional secondary changes are needed to maintain
consistency within the model, and between the model and other models in the
system? In practice, there are many ways of propagating changes to fix a given
inconsistency, and how to justify and automate the selection between such
change options remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a number
of postulates, inspired by the mature belief revision theory, that a change
propagation process should satisfy to be considered rational and minimal. Such
postulates enable us to reason about selecting alternative change options, and
consequently to develop a machinery that automatically performs this task. We
further argue that a possible implementation of such a change propagation
process can be considered as a classical state space search in which each state
represents a snapshot of the model in the process. This view naturally reflects
the cascading nature of change propagation, where each change can require
further changes to be made.

of area fraction of the colloidal packing, the coordination number, the

fraction for low area fractions, and diverges at random close packing.
Increasing the normal stiffness coefficient or the friction coefficient

requiring a different type of UHECR source at the ankle. For the benchmark case
the GRBs in the bright end of the luminosity function, which contribute most of
the neutrinos, have their photon spectrum substantially distorted by secondary
photons. Such bright GRBs are few in number, and reducing their $f_p$
eliminates the distortion, while reducing the neutrino production. Even if we
neglect the contribution of the brightest GRBs, the UHECR production rate at
GZK energies is almost unchanged. These nominal GRB models, especially with

Birds are highly visual animals with five different cone photoreceptor
subtypes, yet their photoreceptor patterns are not perfectly regular. By
analyzing the chicken cone photoreceptor system consisting of five different
cell types using a variety of sensitive microstructural descriptors, we find
that the disordered photoreceptor patterns are ``hyperuniform'' (exhibiting
vanishing infinite-wavelength density fluctuations), a property that had
heretofore been identified in a unique subset of physical systems, but had
never been observed in any living organism. Remarkably, the photoreceptor
patterns of both the total population and the individual cell types are
simultaneously hyperuniform. We term such patterns ``multi-hyperuniform''
because multiple distinct subsets of the overall point pattern are themselves
hyperuniform. We have devised a unique multiscale cell packing model in two
dimensions that suggests that photoreceptor types interact with both short- and
long-ranged repulsive forces and that the resultant competition between the

compared with classic methods based on consensus subgradient, but can be
computationally expensive, especially for problems with complicated structures

can reduce the overall computational cost of consensus ADMM by an order of

is the use of an inexact step for each ADMM update, which enables the agents to
perform cheap computation at each iteration. Our convergence analyses show that
the proposed methods converge well under some convexity assumptions. Numerical
results show that the proposed algorithms offer considerably lower
computational complexity than the standard ADMM based distributed optimization

Theorem which provides a continuous limit for sequences of equicontinuous

where the domains and the ranges respectively converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff

when the domains and ranges only converge in the intrinsic flat sense due to
the possible disappearance of points in the limit.
  In this paper two Arzela-Ascoli Theorems are proven for intrinsic flat

fixed range whose domains are converging in the intrinsic flat sense, and one
for sequences of uniformly local isometries between spaces which are converging
in the intrinsic flat sense. A basic Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is proven for
sequences of points in such sequences of spaces. In addition it is proven that
when a sequence of manifolds has a precompact intrinsic flat limit then the

graph databases to specify constraints on labeled paths. Recently, RPQs have
been extended by Libkin and Vrgo$\rm \check{c}$ to incorporate data value
comparisons among different nodes on paths, called regular path queries with
data (RDPQ). It has been shown that the evaluation problem of RDPQs is
PSPACE-complete and NLOGSPACE-complete in data complexity. On the other hand,
the containment problem of RDPQs is in general undecidable. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to extend regular path queries with data value
comparisons, called rigid regular path queries with data (RRDPQ). The main
ingredient of this approach is an automata model called nondeterministic rigid
register automata (NRRA), in which the data value comparisons are \emph{rigid},
in the sense that if the data value in the current position $x$ is compared to
a data value in some other position $y$, then by only using the labels (but not
data values), the position $y$ can be uniquely determined from $x$. We show
that NRRAs are robust in the sense that nondeterministic, deterministic and
two-way variant of NRRAs, as well as an extension of regular expressions, are
all of the same expressivity. We then argue that the expressive power of RDPQs
are reasonable by demonstrating that for every graph database, there is a
localized transformation of the graph database so that every RDPQ in the
original graph database can be turned into an equivalent RRDPQ over the
transformed one. Finally, we investigate the computational properties of RRDPQs
and conjunctive RRDPQs (CRRDPQ). In particular, we show that the containment of
CRRDPQs (and RRDPQs) can be decided in 2EXPSPACE.

conjunction with an analytic method to calculate the magnetic field generated

in the nonlinear optical probing of the energy-level landscape upon
hybridization. Thus, controlling the nature of coupling between metallic
nanostructures is of a great importance as it enables tuning their spectral
responses leading to novel devices which may surpass the diffraction limit.

  1674-1687, September 2014",,"10.1109/JSAC.2014.2330093",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article addresses the modeling and cancellation of self-interference in
full-duplex direct-conversion radio transceivers, operating under practical
imperfect radio frequency (RF) components. Firstly, detailed self-interference
signal modeling is carried out, taking into account the most important RF
imperfections, namely transmitter power amplifier nonlinear distortion as well
as transmitter and receiver IQ mixer amplitude and phase imbalances. The
analysis shows that after realistic antenna isolation and RF cancellation, the
dominant self-interference waveform at receiver digital baseband can be modeled
through a widely-linear transformation of the original transmit data, opposed
to classical purely linear models. Such widely-linear self-interference
waveform is physically stemming from the transmitter and receiver IQ imaging,
and cannot be efficiently suppressed by classical linear digital cancellation.
Motivated by this, novel widely-linear digital self-interference cancellation
processing is then proposed and formulated, combined with efficient parameter
estimation methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
widely-linear cancellation processing clearly outperforms the existing linear
solutions, hence enabling the use of practical low-cost RF front-ends utilizing
IQ mixing in full-duplex transceivers.

3115 presents a critical example of a GC system with multiple, distinct,

consistency of the GC bimodality in NGC 3115 suggests that in cases where GC

pressure must be sufficiently lower than the gas pressure. We calculate the
spatial distribution of the ionization degree and search for the MRI-active
region where the two criteria are met. We find that there can be thin active
layers at the disk surface depending on the model parameters, however, we find
hardly any region which can sustain well-developed MRI turbulence; when the
magnetic field is enhanced by MRI turbulence at the disk surface layer, a
magnetically dominated atmosphere encroaches on a lower altitude and a region
of well-developed MRI turbulence becomes smaller. We conclude that if there are
no angular momentum transfer mechanisms other than MRI in gravitationally
stable circumplanetary disks, gas is likely to pile up until disks become
gravitationally unstable, and massive disks may survive for a long time.

$\alpha$, which is similar in flavor to a bounded-degree MST. We name this
structure $\alpha$-MST. Let $P$ be a set of points in the plane and let $0 <
\alpha \le 2\pi$ be an angle. An $\alpha$-ST of $P$ is a spanning tree of the
complete Euclidean graph induced by $P$, with the additional property that for
each point $p \in P$, the smallest angle around $p$ containing all the edges
adjacent to $p$ is at most $\alpha$. An $\alpha$-MST of $P$ is then an
$\alpha$-ST of $P$ of minimum weight. For $\alpha < \pi/3$, an $\alpha$-ST does
not always exist, and, for $\alpha \ge \pi/3$, it always exists. In this paper,
we study the problem of computing an $\alpha$-MST for several common values of
$\alpha$.
  Motivated by wireless networks, we formulate the problem in terms of
directional antennas. With each point $p \in P$, we associate a wedge $W_p$ of
angle $\alpha$ and apex $p$. The goal is to assign an orientation and a radius
$r_p$ to each wedge $W_p$, such that the resulting graph is connected and its
MST is an $\alpha$-MST. (We draw an edge between $p$ and $q$ if $p \in W_q$, $q
\in W_p$, and $|pq| \le r_p, r_q$.) Unsurprisingly, the problem of computing an
$\alpha$-MST is NP-hard, at least for $\alpha=\pi$ and $\alpha=2\pi/3$. We
present constant-factor approximation algorithms for $\alpha = \pi/2, 2\pi/3,
\pi$.
  One of our major results is a surprising theorem for $\alpha = 2\pi/3$,
which, besides being interesting from a geometric point of view, has important
applications. For example, the theorem guarantees that given any set $P$ of
$3n$ points in the plane and any partitioning of the points into $n$ triplets,
one can orient the wedges of each triplet {\em independently}, such that the
graph induced by $P$ is connected. We apply the theorem to the {\em antenna

weak-lensing measured density profiles for clusters of galaxies, paying
attention to the determination of the concentration-mass ($c$-$M$) relation
which can be biased by the center offset, selection effect, and shape noise
from intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies. Several different methods
of locating the center of a cluster from weak-lensing effects alone are
explored. We find that, for intermediate redshift clusters, the highest peak
from our newly proposed two-scale smoothing method applied to the reconstructed
convergence field, first with a smoothing scale of $2^\prime$ and then
$0\overset{\prime}{.}5$, corresponds best to the true center. Assuming the
parameterized Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we fit the reduced tangential shear
signals around different centers identified by different methods. It is shown
that, for the ensemble median values, a center offset larger than one scale
radius $r_s$ can bias the derived mass and concentration significantly lower
than the true values, especially for low-mass halos. However, the existence of
noise can compensate for the offset effect and reduce the systematic bias,
although the scatter of mass and concentration becomes considerably larger.
Statistically, the bias effect of center offset on the $c$-$M$ relation is
insignificant if an appropriate center finding method is adopted. On the other
hand, noise from intrinsic ellipticities can bias the $c$-$M$ relation derived
from a sample of weak-lensing analyzed clusters if a simple $\chi^2$ fitting
method is used. To properly account for the scatter and covariance between $c$
and $M$, we apply a Bayesian method to improve the statistical analysis of the
$c$-$M$ relation. It is shown that this new method allows us to derive the
$c$-$M$ relation with significantly reduced biases.

mapping the deformation constrained self-consistent axially symmetric

study is based on the global relativistic energy density functional DD-PC1. The
resulting IBM Hamiltonian is used to calculate excitation spectra and
transition rates for the positive- and negative-parity collective states in
four isotopic chains characteristic for two regions of octupole deformation and

microscopic calculation based on the systematics of $\beta_{2}$-$\beta_{3}$
energy maps, the resulting low-lying negative-parity bands and transition rates

deterministic Markov process (PDMPs) in general Borel spaces. The control
variable acts on the jump rate and transition measure, and the goal is to
minimize the total expected discounted cost, composed of positive running and
boundary costs, while satisfying some constraints also in this form. The basic
idea is, by using the special features of the PDMPs, to re-write the problem
via an embedded discrete-time Markov chain associated to the PDMP and
re-formulate the problem as an infinite dimensional linear programming (LP)
problem, via the occupation measures associated to the discrete-time process.
It is important to stress however that our new discrete-time problem is not in
the same framework of a general constrained discrete-time Markov Decision
Process and, due to that, some conditions are required to get the equivalence
between the continuous-time problem and the LP formulation. We provide in the
sequel sufficient conditions for the solvability of the associated LP problem,
based on a generalization of Theorem 4.1 in [8]. In the Appendix we present the
proof of this generalization which, we believe, is of interest on its own. The

processes on a general Borel state space with both impulsive and continuous

The so-called Bellman equation associated to this control problem is studied.
Sufficient conditions ensuring the existence and the uniqueness of a bounded

shown that the value function of the optimization problem under consideration
satisfies this optimality equation. Sufficient conditions are also presented to
ensure on one hand the existence of an optimal control strategy and on the
other hand the existence of an $\varepsilon$-optimal control strategy. The
decomposition of the state space in two disjoint subsets is exhibited where
roughly speaking, one should apply a gradual action or an impulsive action
correspondingly to get an optimal or $\varepsilon$-optimal strategy. An
interesting consequence of our previous results is as follows: the set of
strategies that allow interventions at time $t=0$ and only immediately after
natural jumps is a sufficient set for the control problem under consideration.

26Al, 44Ti and 56Ni synthesised in massive stars and supernovae are sufficient
to explain the 511 keV annihilation emission observed in our Galaxy. Such a
possibility has often been put forward in the past. We developed a Monte Carlo
Galactic propagation code for ~MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar
medium, the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and the propagation are finely
described. This code allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the 511
keV annihilation emission. We test several GMFs models and several positron
escape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons. We consider the
collisional ballistic transport mode and then compare the simulated 511 keV
intensity spatial distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Whatever the GMF
configuration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni positrons, the 511 keV
intensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that ~MeV
positrons do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model.
The direct comparison to the data does not allow us to constrain the GMF
configuration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons. In any case,
nucleosynthesis positrons produced in steady state cannot explain the full
annihilation emission. The comparison to the data shows that: (a) the
annihilation emission from the Galactic disk can be accounted for; (b) the
strongly peaked annihilation emission from the inner Galactic bulge can be
explained by positrons annihilating in the central molecular zone but this
seems to require more positron sources than the population of massive stars and
type Ia supernovae usually assumed for this region; (c) the more extended
emission from the Galactic bulge cannot be explained. We show that a transient
source at the GC, such as a starburst episode, could explain this extended

silicene has strong spin-orbit interaction leading to opening of the gap in the
energy spectrum and spin-splitting of the bands in each valley. If an electric

transverse edges of silicene sheet. The applied electric field also allows
control of valley and spin polarization in silicene. The predicted valley and

when optimal actions appear sensitive to model fidelity. This article presents
an overview of recent developments across different disciplines to address

stability of optimal actions to perturbations to the model within a

two ways. Firstly, in a strong sense via an information (Kullback-Leibler)

extension, again centred at the approximating model, in order to `average out'

time scale of 20 years. Its two last eruptions (1985 and 2006) were subject of
intensive multiwavelengths observational campaign from the X-rays to the radio.
This contribution aims to determine physical parameters and the ionization
structure of the nova from its explosion to the first emergence of the
supersoft X-rays (day 26) by using the method of multiwavelength modelling the
SED. From the very beginning of the eruption, the model SED revealed the
presence of both a strong stellar and nebular component of radiation in the
spectrum. During the first 4 days, the nova evinced a biconical ionization
structure. The $\sim 8200$ K warm and 160 - 200 R$_{\odot}$ extended
pseudo-photosphere encompassed the white dwarf (WD) around its equator to the
latitude $>40^{\circ}$. The remaining space around the WD's poles was ionized,
producing a strong nebular continuum with the emission measure $EM \sim 2.3
\times 10^{62}$ cm$^{-3}$ via the fast wind from the WD. The luminosity of the
burning WD was highly super-Eddington for the whole investigated period. The
wind mass loss at rates of $10^{-4} - 10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and the
presence of jets suggest an accretion throughout a disk at a high rate, which
can help to sustain the super-Eddington luminosity of the accretor for a long
time.

a `world' means an entire universe with well-defined properties, determined by
the classical configuration of its particles and fields. In our approach each
world evolves deterministically; probabilities arise due to ignorance as to
which world a given observer occupies; and we argue that in the limit of
infinitely many worlds the wave function can be recovered (as a secondary

to both point location in geometric data structures and routing in networks.
However, whilst a number of algorithms and existence proofs have been proposed,

the computational resources required to generate them under a random

cone walk. We prove that given $n$ uniform points in a smooth convex domain of

model the trap in a quantum adiabatic approximation and apply Fermi's rule to

obtain similar lifetimes $\tau$ as in the semiclassical estimate, in the range

Lagrangians, etc. Instead, we define a ""unique"" worldline implicitly, by a
system of nonlinear polynomial equations containing a time-like parameter. Then
at each instant there is a whole set of solutions defining the coordinates of
particles-copies localized on the unique worldline and moving along it. There
naturally arise two different kinds of such particles which correspond to real

respectively. At some particular time instants, one encounters the transitions
between these two kinds of particles-roots that model the processes of
annihilation or creation of a pair ""particle-antiparticle"". We restrict by
consideration of nonrelativistic collective dynamics of the ensemble of such
particles on a plane. Making use of the techniques of resultants of
polynomials, the generating system reduces to a pair of polynomial equations
for one unknown, with coefficients depending on time. Then the well-known Vieta
formulas predetermine the existence of time-independent constraints on the
positions of particles-roots and their time derivatives. We demonstrate that
for a very wide class of the initial polynomials (with polynomial dependence of
the coefficients on time) these constraints always take place and have the form
of the conservation laws for total momentum, angular momentum and (the analogue
of) total mechanical energy of the ""closed"" system of particles.

excitation of LP electrons is proposed to be described by two coexisting
processes, namely, single and double electron excitations. Both processes have
been found to form defect states in the band gap and to cause the
experimentally observed photo-darkening and photo-volume expansion, however,
only double electron excitation is capable to trigger bond rearrangement and
structural transformation. Lattice relaxation, which follows bond rearrangement
occurs with characteristic energy of -0.9$\pm$0.3 eV and promotes formation of

organs depend strongly on how blood, especially red blood cells, flow through
the microvascular network. Macromolecular plasma proteins such as fibrinogen
cause red blood cells to form large aggregates, called rouleaux, which are
usually assumed to be disaggregated in the circulation due to the shear forces
present in bulk flow. This leads to the assumption that rouleaux formation is
only relevant in the venule network and in arterioles at low shear rates or
stasis. Thanks to an excellent agreement between combined experimental and
numerical approaches, we show that despite the large shear rates present in
microcapillaries, the presence of either fibrinogen or the synthetic polymer
dextran leads to an enhanced formation of robust clusters of red blood cells,
even at haematocrits as low as 1%. Robust aggregates are shown to exist in
microcapillaries even for fibrinogen concentrations within the healthy
physiological range. These persistent aggregates should strongly affect cell
distribution and blood perfusion in the microvasculature, with putative
implications for blood disorders even within apparently asymptomatic subjects.

Classical rowmotion has been studied by various authors (Fon-der-Flaass,
Cameron, Brouwer, Schrijver, Striker, Williams and many more) under different
guises (Striker-Williams promotion and Panyushev complementation are two
examples of maps equivalent to it). In contrast, birational rowmotion is new
and has yet to reveal several of its mysteries. In this paper, we prove that
birational rowmotion has order p+q on the (p, q)-rectangle poset (i.e., on the
product of a p-element chain with a q-element chain); we furthermore compute
its orders on some triangle-shaped posets and on a class of posets which we
call ""skeletal"" (this class includes all graded forests). In all cases
mentioned, birational rowmotion turns out to have a finite (and explicitly
computable) order, a property it does not exhibit for general finite posets
(unlike classical rowmotion, which is a permutation of a finite set). Our proof
in the case of the rectangle poset uses an idea introduced by Volkov
(arXiv:hep-th/0606094) to prove the AA case of the Zamolodchikov periodicity
conjecture; in fact, the finite order of birational rowmotion on many posets
can be considered an analogue to Zamolodchikov periodicity. We comment on
suspected, but so far enigmatic, connections to the theory of root posets. We
also make a digression to study classical rowmotion on skeletal posets, since
this case has seemingly been overlooked so far.

spectroscopical observations taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph at the
8.2m Subaru Telescope. The spectra cover the optical range from 3700 to 7400 A.
The effect of the CNO cycle is well identified in the abundances of He, N, and
O, while elements not involved in the synthesis such as Ar, S, and Fe present
values consistent with the solar vicinity and the ambient gas. The major
achievement of this work is the first detection of the faint CII 4267
recombination line in a Wolf-Rayet nebula. This allows to estimate the C
abundance in NGC6888 and therefore investigate for the first time the trace of
the CNO cycle in a ring nebula around a Wolf-Rayet star. Although the detection
of the CII line has a low signal-to-noise ratio, the C abundance seems to be
higher than the predictions of recent stellar evolution models of massive
stars. The Ne abundance also show a puzzling pattern with an abundance of about
0.5 dex lower than the solar vicinity, which may be related to the action of
the NeNa cycle. Attending to the constraints imposed by the dynamical timescale
and the He/H and N/O ratios of the nebula, the comparison with stellar
evolution models indicates that the initial mass of the stellar progenitor of
NGC6888 is between 25 Msun and 40 Msun.

respectively. For the general fermion-photon $S_f(\kappa_f)$ and photon
self-interaction $S_g(\kappa_g)$ the closed form results reveal two-point
functions with all kind of pathological terms: the UV divergence, the quadratic
UV/IR mixing terms as well as a logarithmic IR divergent term of the type
$\ln(\mu^2(\theta p)^2)$. In addition, the photon-loop produces new tensor
structures satisfying transversality condition by themselves. We show that the
photon two-point function in the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime can be
reduced to two finite terms by imposing a specific full rank of
$\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and setting deformation parameters
$(\kappa_f,\kappa_g)=(0,3)$. In this case the neutrino two-point function
vanishes. Thus for a specific point $(0,3)$ in the parameter-space
$(\kappa_f,\kappa_g)$, a covariant $\theta$-exact approach is able to produce a

compute lower bounds for real polynomials. We provide new sufficient conditions
for polynomials to be nonnegative as well as to have a sum of binomial squares
representation. These criteria rely on the coefficients and the support of a
polynomial and generalize all previous ones by Lasserre, Ghasemi, Marshall,
Fidalgo and Kovacec to polynomials with arbitrary simplex Newton polytopes.
  This generalization yields a geometric programming approach for computing
lower bounds for polynomials that significantly extends the geometric
programming method proposed by Ghasemi and Marshall. Furthermore, it shows that
geometric programming is strongly related to nonnegativity certificates based
on sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials, which were recently introduced by
the authors.

randomization in late boundary layer transition over a flat plate without
pressure gradient. The flow randomization is a crucial phase before flow
transition to the turbulent state. According to existing literatures, the
randomization was caused by the big background noises and non-periodic spanwise
boundary conditions. It was assumed that the large ring structure is affected
by background noises first, and then the change of large ring structure affects
the small length scales quickly, which directly leads to randomization and
formation of turbulence. However, by careful analysis of our high order DNS
results, we believe that the internal instability of multiple ring cycles
structure is the main reason. What we observed is that randomization begins
when the third cycle overlaps the first and second cycles. A significant
asymmetric phenomenon is originated from the second cycle in the middle of both
streamwise and spanwise directions. More technically, a visible asymmetric
phenomenon in the middle vortex ring cycle starts at time step t=16.25T and
x=838.9{\delta}in where the top and bottom level rings are still completely
symmetric. The non-symmetric structure of middle level ring affects the small
length scale in boundary layer bottom quickly. The randomization phenomenon
spreads to top level through ejections. Finally, the whole flow domain becomes
randomized. A hypothesis of C- and K-types shift is given as a possible
mechanism of flow randomization.

polarization variations in the optical and near-infrared bands. In December
2010, the object emitted a very bright outburst. We monitored it for
approximately four years (including the 2010 outburst) by optical and
near-infrared photopolarimetry. During the 2010 outburst, the object emitted
two rapid, redder brightenings, at which the polarization degrees (PDs) in both
bands increased significantly and the bands exhibited a frequency-dependent
polarization. The observed frequency-dependent polarization leads us to propose
that the polarization vector is composed of two vectors. Therefore, we separate
the observed polarization vectors into short and long-term components that we
attribute to the emissions of the rapid brightenings and the outburst that
varied the timescale of days and months, respectively. The estimated PD of the
short-term component is greater than the maximum observed PD and is close to
the theoretical maximum PD. We constrain the bulk Lorentz factors and
inclination angles between the jet axis and the line of sight from the
estimated PDs. In this case, the inclination angle of the emitting region of
short-term component from the first rapid brightening should be equal to
90$^{\circ}$, because the estimated PD of the short-term component was
approximately equal to the theoretical maximum PD. Thus, the Doppler factor at
the emitting region of the first rapid brightening should be equal to the bulk
Lorentz factor.

widely spread concept vortex breakdown to turbulence,which was considered as
the last stage of flow transition, is not observed and is found theoretically

we proposed a new theory with five steps, i.e. receptivity, linear instability,
large vortex formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and
randomization to turbulence. We have also proposed a new theory about
turbulence generation. The new theory shows that all small length scales
(turbulence) are generated by shear layer instability which is produced by
large vortex structure with multiple level vortex rings, multiple level sweeps
and ejections, and multiple level negative and positive spikes near the laminar
sub-layers.Therefore, turbulence is not generated by vortex breakdown but
rather positive and negative spikes and consequent high shear layers. Shear
layer instability is considered as the mother of turbulence. This new theory
may give a universal mechanism for turbulence generation and sustenance which
shows that the energy is brought by large vortex structure through multiple
level sweeps.

is based on the interplay between configuration and phase spaces via Wigner

an asymptotic expansion of the solution of the Wigner equation. This expansion
is a perturbation of the Wigner function of a harmonic oscillator but it is not
a genuine semiclassical expansion because the correctors depend on the

for the solution of the Wigner equation, which leads to an efficient regular
perturbation scheme in phase space. The validity of the approximation is proved
for particular classes of initial data. The proposed ansatz is applied for
computing the energy density of a a quartic oscillator on caustics (focal
points). The results are compared with those derived from the so-called
classical approximation whose principal term is the solution of Liouville

derive two kinds of quantum metrological bounds for vector parameter
estimation, both of which should be satisfied. By these bounds, we show that a

that the model generates, upon varying equilibrium distance of the DNA-TF

trajectories during sliding. We find that sliding occurs via helical paths

packings provide the foundation for the theory of jamming. This theory rests on
the observation that, despite the multitude of disordered configurations, the
mechanical response to linear order depends only on the distance to the
transition. We investigate the validity and utility of such measurements that
invoke the harmonic approximation and show that, despite particles coming in

almost every branch of modern science, technology and engineering. A practical
issue in the problem is that when the parameter space is large and the
available data is noisy, the geometry of the likelihood surface in the
parameter space will be complicated. This makes searching and optimization
algorithms computationally expensive, sometimes even beyond reach. In this
paper, we define a likelihood transform which can make the structure of the
likelihood surface much simpler, hence reducing the intrinsic complexity and
easing optimization significantly. We demonstrate the properties of likelihood
transform by apply it to a simplified gravitational wave chirp signal search.
For the signal with an signal-to-noise ratio 20, likelihood transform has made
a deterministic template-based search possible for the first time, which turns
out to be 1000 times more efficient than an exhaustive grid- based search. The
method in principle can be applied to other problems in other fields as the

localized interfacial polarization is proposed and is based on the surface
charge as the source of microscopic electric fields in dielectrics. The surface
charge density incorporates the local structure of the interface into
electrostatic calculations. The corresponding surface susceptibility and
interface dielectric constant provide local closures to the electrostatic
boundary value problem. A robust approach to calculate the surface

manipulating dc currents by directly solving electric conduction equations,
which only needs to utilize two layers of bulk natural materials. We
experimentally demonstrate dc bilayer cloak and fan-shaped concentrator,
derived from the generalized account for cloaking sensor. The proposed schemes
have been validated as exact devices and this opens a facile way towards
complete spatial control of dc currents. The proposed schemes may have vast
potentials in various applications not only in dc, but also in other fields of
manipulating magnetic field, thermal heat, elastic mechanics, and matter waves.

  Low Melting Point Alloy Ink",,,,,"physics.gen-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional 3D printings are generally time-consuming and printable metal
inks are rather limited. From an alternative way, we proposed a liquid phase 3D
printing for quickly making metal objects. Through introducing metal alloys
whose melting point is slightly above room temperature as printing inks,
several representative structures spanning from one, two and three dimension to
more complex patterns were demonstrated to be quickly fabricated. Compared with
the air cooling in a conventional 3D printing, the liquid-phase-manufacturing
offers a much higher cooling rate and thus significantly improves the speed in
fabricating metal objects. This unique strategy also efficiently prevents the
liquid metal inks from air oxidation which is hard to avoid otherwise in an
ordinary 3D printing. Several key physical factors (like properties of the
cooling fluid, injection speed and needle diameter, types and properties of the
printing ink, etc.) were disclosed which would evidently affect the printing
quality. In addition, a basic route to make future liquid phase 3D printer
incorporated with both syringe pump and needle arrays was also suggested. The
liquid phase 3D printing method, which owns potential values not available in a
conventional modality, opens an efficient way for quickly making metal objects
in the coming time.

camera viewpoints are typically lossily compressed via the classical transform
coding / coefficient quantization paradigm. In this paper we propose to reduce
distortion of the decoded depth maps due to quantization. The key observation
is that depth maps from different viewpoints constitute multiple descriptions
(MD) of the same 3D scene. Considering the MD jointly, we perform a POCS-like
iterative procedure to project a reconstructed signal from one depth map to the
other and back, so that the converged depth maps have higher precision than the
original quantized versions.

multichromophoric systems. The multichromophoric FRET rate is determined by the
overlap integral of the donor's emission and acceptor's absorption spectra,
which are obtained via 2nd-order cumulant expansion techniques developed in
this work. We calculate the spectra and multichromophoric FRET rate for both
localized and delocalized systems. (i) The role of the initial entanglement
between the donor and its bath is found to be crucial in both the emission
spectrum and the multichromophoric FRET rate. (ii) The absorption spectra
obtained by the cumulant expansion method are quite close to the exact one for
both localized and delocalized systems, even when the system-bath coupling is
far from the perturbative regime. (iii) For the emission spectra, the cumulant
expansion can give very good results for the localized system, but fail to
obtain reliable spectra of the high excitations of a delocalized system, when
the system-bath coupling is large and the thermal energy is small. (iv) Even
though, the multichromophoric FRET rate is good enough since it is determined
by the overlap integral of the spectra.
